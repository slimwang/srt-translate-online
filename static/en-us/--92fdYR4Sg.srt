Depending on how clever you are and how
much you already know about this topic,

2
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:05,680
a variety of answers are possible.

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:07,770
Here's the one that I
was really looking for.

4
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:11,540
It's really just the trivial
lower bound of reading the array.

5
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:15,900
So that would be an asymptotic cost of
ceiling of n over L, or just n over L.

6
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:19,220
There's an n because you need to
touch every word at least once.

7
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:21,470
And you need to divide by L because,
in the best case,

8
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:24,020
you'll read these elements
one block at a time.

9
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:27,960
The ceiling would just account for the
possibility that L does not divide n,

10
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,820
but if you left that out, that's fine.

11
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:32,400
Now, if you happen to come up
with the following answer,

12
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,180
I would've been really,
really impressed.

13
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:36,520
We'll do that result soon enough.
