1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,670
Here is our number in a place value chart. I know that the 1 is really

2
00:00:03,682 --> 00:00:07,871
important, it's in the 10,000,000 spot. So this tells us how big the number is.

3
00:00:07,967 --> 00:00:12,317
The next important number is the 6. 16,000,000 is halfway between 10 million and

4
00:00:12,329 --> 00:00:16,534
20 million. So I'd want to use the 1 and 6 to gauge how big my answer is. Notice

5
00:00:16,546 --> 00:00:20,524
too that if I add the powers of 10 to my chart, I can see that the 10 millions

6
00:00:20,536 --> 00:00:24,439
is 10 to the 7th. So this number is on the order of 10 to the 7th. Or at 10

7
00:00:24,451 --> 00:00:28,758
millionths. The 1 is definitely the most important number, and then 6 would be a

8
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:29,457
close second.
