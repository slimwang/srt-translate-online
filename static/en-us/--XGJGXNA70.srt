1
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:04,140
So what do we exactly mean by state and
measurement?

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:06,530
Let's try to understand with an example.

3
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:10,910
Say you're looking at a pendulum
swinging back and forth and assume that

4
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:15,675
it has a marker on it that you can
detect reliably, using one of the corner

5
00:00:15,675 --> 00:00:19,835
finding or template based matching
techniques you've learned so far.

6
00:00:19,835 --> 00:00:23,805
Now we can identify different
quantities to describe the system.

7
00:00:23,805 --> 00:00:24,395
For instance,

8
00:00:24,395 --> 00:00:29,275
the center of the target can be
located using an x and y coordinate.

9
00:00:30,315 --> 00:00:33,820
Similarly, the pendulum
rod has a certain length.

10
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:34,730
Let's call this l.

11
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:39,260
The circular weight at
the end has a radius r.

12
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:43,650
We could even say that the pendulum
makes an angle with the vertical line.

13
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:45,230
Let's call this theta.

14
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:46,570
When defining a model for

15
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:51,230
this system, which of these quantities
would you include in its state, and

16
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:54,890
which quantities are directly
observable from images?

17
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:57,470
That is part of the measurement model.

18
00:00:57,470 --> 00:01:02,550
Again, the quantities we are looking at
are, the x, y location of the target,

19
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:07,050
the length of the pendulum l,
the radius of the circular weight,

20
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:11,160
r, and
the angle made with the vertical theta.

21
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:13,040
Mark the appropriate check boxes.
