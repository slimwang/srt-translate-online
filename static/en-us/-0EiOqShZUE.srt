1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,380
So here's the correct output of
generating an anaglyph image.

2
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:09,310
We basically use the numpy function
dstack, which takes you know, different

3
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:13,800
images, in this case, and stacks them
together to create one combined image.

4
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:18,270
The secret here is also knowing a little
bit about how RGB is represented

5
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:19,870
in OpenCV.

6
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:24,630
So if you remember,
in OpenCV images are B, G and R.

7
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:25,690
The first channel is blue.

8
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:28,480
The second channel is green and
the third channel is red.

9
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,980
So blue, green, red.

10
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:34,680
Why do we have image right, and
image right, and image left?

11
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:38,018
Well, remember, image left is
the one I want to show as left,

12
00:00:38,018 --> 00:00:42,220
because that's where I want the right
information to be for the left image.

13
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:44,723
And then this is blue and green,

14
00:00:44,723 --> 00:00:49,929
which basically means now as our
mixture of blue and green is cyan.

15
00:00:49,929 --> 00:00:53,633
So if I now basically put
the right image in blue and green,

16
00:00:53,633 --> 00:00:57,010
that will become cyan,
this will remain red.

17
00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:58,435
And just stacking this up together,

18
00:00:58,435 --> 00:01:01,790
you should be able to see result
that will be a stereopair.

19
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:03,190
We run this, this is the left image.

20
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:07,300
That's the right image.

21
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,268
And that's the anaglyph image.

22
00:01:09,268 --> 00:01:13,330
Now, I will admit, I actually don't
see 3D vision very well because that

23
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:17,670
requires both of your eyes to be
equally strong, and many people do have

24
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:21,090
issues with both their eyes being
perfectly the same strength.
