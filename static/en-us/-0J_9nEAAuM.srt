00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,556
>> Well this equation certainly makes things a little bit easier. Because we did

2
00:00:03,556 --> 00:00:06,971
the same thing to both sides, I mean, didn't do anything crazy, like try to

3
00:00:06,971 --> 00:00:10,500
divide by 0, whatever answers we come up with from here on out will still work

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,265
for our original equation, either of these two right here. The difference is

5
00:00:14,265 --> 00:00:17,793
that now when we solve, we only have to deal with two factors that are

6
00:00:17,793 --> 00:00:22,014
multiplied together instead of three, like we had when we had that constant term

7
00:00:22,014 --> 00:00:26,289
out here as well. Let's think about what we can deduce at this point. We have

8
00:00:26,289 --> 00:00:30,554
two factors that when multiplied together give us 0. Let's call one of them a

9
00:00:30,554 --> 00:00:34,903
and the other one b. Then we can write this equation as ab equals 0. Thinking

10
00:00:34,903 --> 00:00:39,959
about this equation, can we conclude anything about what either a or b should

11
00:00:39,959 --> 00:00:42,191
equal? Please answer yes or no.
