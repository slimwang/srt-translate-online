00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:06,330
Classes have features. By that we mean its attributes, and its, its operations.

2
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:12,960
While classes, really describe the real world, that is,

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,800
the problem that you're solving, features are something that are going to end up

4
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:22,208
inside the computer. Obviously, your attributes are going to translate,

5
00:00:22,208 --> 00:00:26,820
into instance variables in your object oriented programing language. And

6
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:30,390
your operations are going to be translated into methods.

7
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:33,350
We're going to look a little bit at the attributes and the operations.

8
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:37,530
But, in general. In addition to the names of the attributes and operations,

9
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:42,090
we are going to have some type of information. And possibly also some, some

10
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:48,170
names for the attributes so that they can be referred to in, in, in your models.
