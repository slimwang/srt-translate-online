1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,138
Now there are other situations we can run into, too. For example, let's say we

2
00:00:04,138 --> 00:00:08,685
have 2 robots that are shooting at each other through a wall. Maybe they're not

3
00:00:08,685 --> 00:00:12,654
the brightest robots in the world. Or, maybe they are. Let's take a closer look

4
00:00:12,654 --> 00:00:16,754
at this situation. We have a few different bounding boxes to consider. We have

5
00:00:16,754 --> 00:00:20,471
this wall made up of a few bounding boxes, and we also have the bounding box of

6
00:00:20,471 --> 00:00:24,818
the rocket. So let's say we have this rocket here, and in one time step of the

7
00:00:24,818 --> 00:00:29,382
physics engine, it is on this side of the wall. But on the next time step of

8
00:00:29,382 --> 00:00:34,099
the physics engine, it is on this side of the wall. Now, everything in our

9
00:00:34,099 --> 00:00:37,942
physics engine happens at discrete steps, so there's no point at which this

10
00:00:37,942 --> 00:00:43,734
bounding box and this bounding box intersect. So then, which bounding box

11
00:00:43,734 --> 00:00:48,458
should we use? Do we want to end up using this bounding box, right here? Or

12
00:00:48,458 --> 00:00:52,550
maybe we should calculate some halfway point between the 2, right here, and use

13
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:58,737
that bounding box. Or maybe we want to use the entire swept area, swept out

14
00:00:58,737 --> 00:01:04,986
between the 2 time steps and use that instead. Now the box I've drawn is a

15
00:01:04,986 --> 00:01:07,838
little bit bigger than the path that would be swept out between these 2 time

16
00:01:07,838 --> 00:01:12,148
steps. Which of these do you think that we should use to properly calculate

17
00:01:12,148 --> 00:01:16,000
collisions? Check which ever single one you think is appropriate.
