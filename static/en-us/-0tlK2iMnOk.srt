1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:02,810
Here's how I completed
my implementation.

2
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:05,160
My next error was undefined
is not a function, and

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:09,080
that's not a terribly useful error,
but if I look at the line number,

4
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:12,900
it tells me, it was line six,
in AddressBookSpec.

5
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:17,040
If I look at that line, I can see it's
referring to this addContact method

6
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:19,000
of my addressBook class.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,940
So I just need to write this addContact.

8
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:25,460
I did this by adding a new property
to the class called contacts which

9
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:26,600
is an array.

10
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:30,260
I then wrote a new function
called addContact that accepts

11
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:34,455
a contact as a parameter and just
pushes that contact on to this array.

12
00:00:34,455 --> 00:00:38,440
My next error is on line
eight of AddressBookSpec.

13
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:41,890
And it's related to my use of
this getContact method here.

14
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:43,480
That method doesn't exist.

15
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:45,220
So, I need to go write that.

16
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:49,080
So, I wrote a getContact function,
which just accepts an index, and

17
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:52,440
returns the element of
the array with that index.

18
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:56,110
If I reload my spec runner,
I now see that all my specs are passing.

19
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:58,740
My address book should be
able to add a contact.
