00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:06,530
So we have this piece of code and I'd
like you to explain a bit how it works.

2
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:12,370
For example here, I create a constant
called URL with this type,

3
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:19,660
and then I create a variable by
calling some methods of this constant.

4
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:24,010
And Iâ€™m using this syntax over here.

5
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:27,790
So what would happen if
when I called this line?

6
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:30,660
The URL is empty.

7
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:31,930
It has a nil.

8
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:37,600
It's bound to nil and
what would happen if it had a real URL?

9
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,020
>> Okay.

10
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:45,760
So in the first case here we
have the optional unwrapping so

11
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,400
the case where the URL
is nill the unwrapping

12
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:55,360
process is going to stop here and
nill will be assigned to string.

13
00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:00,340
However for string two we're
trying to force unwrap URL so

14
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:02,320
it's the case that it is nil.

15
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,470
Then we're going to crash.

16
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:06,620
It's kind of like an all or
nothing type of use.

17
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:08,390
But that can sometimes be good.

18
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:09,620
Probably not in this case but

19
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:13,470
in cases like with a view controller
that's getting initialized from

20
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:17,030
a storyboard you expect there
to be maybe a UI component.

21
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:19,050
So, you see that happen
quite commonly for

22
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:22,810
like the IB outlets
to be forced on rend.

23
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:28,940
>> Okay, so, when would you use this
when you expect something to have

24
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:33,690
a value which is different from nil and,
if not, it should crash immediately?

25
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:37,940
>> Right, right, so
like in the case of initializing a view.

26
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:41,140
If it doesn't initialize
correctly from Storyboard,

27
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:44,300
then you don't want to crash and you
could go in and check the Storyboard and

28
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:46,520
figure out what the problem was and
fix it.

29
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,880
>> Okay, perfect, makes sense.
