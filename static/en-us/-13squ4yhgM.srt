00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:04,544
In the last lesson, we left off with dealing with this function, f of x equals

2
00:00:04,544 --> 00:00:10,416
x cubed minus 4 x squared plus x plus 6. We had found that 2 is a zero of this

3
00:00:10,416 --> 00:00:15,980
function, since when we substitute it in, the entire function comes to equal 0.

4
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:19,571
From this we learned, from the factor theorem, that x minus 2 must be a factor

5
00:00:19,571 --> 00:00:24,492
of the polynomial. So we're one step on our way to writing f of x in fully

6
00:00:24,492 --> 00:00:28,955
factored form. We know that eventually we'll be able to write it as x minus 2

7
00:00:28,955 --> 00:00:34,960
times a bunch of other stuff. But what is that other stuff? Well, to find it,

8
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,347
we're going to need to divide this expression by x minus 2. In particular we

9
00:00:38,347 --> 00:00:41,613
are going to use long division. That's what we'll look at next.
