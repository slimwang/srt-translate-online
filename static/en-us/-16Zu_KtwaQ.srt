00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,310
So today we discussed a learning method called learning by recording

2
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:06,400
cases. In learning by recording cases, we file away individual cases we

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,740
have encountered in the past in order to use them for future problem solving.

4
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:13,080
We talked about the nearest neighbor method as a way of finding the most similar

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:16,700
case to the current problem that we faced in the past. But in the real world,

6
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:20,680
this can often be very difficult. So we talked about using nearest neighbor to

7
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:23,360
find very complex similar cases to our current problem, such as our navigation

8
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:27,300
example. However, there are still a lot of limitations to this method.

9
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:30,420
Oftentimes, just executing a solution we've used in the past doesn't work.

10
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:33,860
And oftentimes, we have to store cases based on qualitative labels instead of

11
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:36,520
numeric labels. These weaknesses will be addressed

12
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:39,800
in our next lesson when we talk about case-based reasoning.

13
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,040
There we'll add adaptation and evaluation into our process, and

14
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:46,189
start to be able to use cases in a much more thorough and robust way.
