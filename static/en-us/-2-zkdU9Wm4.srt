00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,040
Constraint propagation also connects to human cognition.

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:07,350
First, constraint propagation is a very general purpose method like,

3
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:12,930
means analysis. In both knowledge based AI and in human cognition,

4
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:16,710
constraint propagation allows us to use our knowledge of the world,

5
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:21,470
in order to make sense of it. Constraints can be of any kind. Symbolic,

6
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:25,220
as well as numeric. We discussed symbolic constraints in today's lesson.

7
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:29,200
A good example of numeric constraints comes from XL spreadsheets,

8
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:33,820
with which most of you are familiar. If the columns in a particular

9
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:38,290
spreadsheet are connected to some formula, and you make a change in one column,

10
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:41,540
then the change is propagated into all the columns of the spreadsheet.

11
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:44,890
That's an example of Numerical Constraint Propagation.

12
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:48,320
We have seen constraint propagation under other topics as well.

13
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,650
For example, planning, and understanding, and scripts. The next topic,

14
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:55,800
configuration, will build on this notion of constraint propagation.
