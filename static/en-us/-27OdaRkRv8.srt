00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,180
In this lesson we are going to do an example of a refinement.

2
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:08,590
We will start with a very simple bank account application that allows deposits,

3
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:11,590
withdrawals, and queries about the current balance.

4
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:13,780
Here are some possible requirements.

5
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:17,070
The user can make a deposit of any positive number of dollars.

6
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:20,830
The user may make a withdrawal of any positive number of dollars so

7
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:24,340
long as at least that number of dollars is currently held in the account.

8
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:28,760
Their user may request the current value of the bank balance, which is defined

9
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,940
as the net value of all the deposits made minus the sum of all the withdrawals.

10
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:34,660
And initially the bank account is empty.
