00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,490
Let's continue looking at this relationship between the spatial domain and

2
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:05,140
the frequency domain.

3
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:08,660
Here's some simple properties of the Fourier transform.

4
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:10,300
We started with one that we already talked about.

5
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:14,660
Everything is linear because we're just doing sums and multiplies, all right?

6
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:18,550
The one we just described was this convolution one.

7
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:22,330
That convolution in the spacial domain is multiplication in

8
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:25,400
the frequency domain and vice versa.

9
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,270
One that's kind of interesting is scaling.

10
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:32,580
So, if I scale a function by a constant a.

11
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:33,590
So let's think about it this way.

12
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:35,190
Suppose a was greater than 1.

13
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:38,020
Let's suppose a was 2, all right?

14
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:41,170
Well, that would mean that when x had been 1,

15
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:45,130
now x is 2, so it, it would sh, shrink, right?

16
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:48,100
When you multiply by a number bigger than 1, right?

17
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:50,370
So if I had some function, right?

18
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:53,540
Now what happens is this value gets moved over there, so

19
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:56,390
I essentially shrink that function, okay?

20
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:02,030
So when I shrink a function things are going to now wiggle faster, right?

21
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:03,530
because they were wiggling slower before.

22
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:05,790
If I pull it in it now wiggles faster.

23
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:09,930
And so what happens is I end up stretching the Fourier transform.

24
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:13,570
And this is the formula for it, 1 over a times F of u over a.

25
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:15,190
So it's got that inverse property.

26
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:18,080
Which is just like that Gaussian idea also, right?

27
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,630
If I make it fatter, my Fourier transform gets skinnier.

28
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,620
One last one to look at, and we're not going to use this much, but

29
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:27,220
I want you to just see this is.

30
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:32,690
When you take the derivative of a function, so this is some nth derivative.

31
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:37,880
You multiply its Fourier transform by a function that's

32
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:40,050
proportional to the frequency.

33
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:43,630
So suppose n was just 1 and you're taking the first derivatives, right?

34
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:49,530
What that says is that you would be multiplying F of u, times u.

35
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:54,340
Which means the higher frequencies get accentuated.

36
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:56,602
Which was exactly what we saw when we took derivatives.

37
00:01:56,602 --> 00:01:59,460
Remember when we added noise, high frequency noise, and

38
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:02,000
then we took the derivative, the whole thing blew up?

39
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,610
That's because you're multiplying it by, when you take this derivative,

40
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:09,008
you multiply the high frequency components.
