1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,290
Now let's have a little more fun by
combining operators and assignment.

2
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:07,990
Let's create a variable called
totalPayroll and set it equal to zero.

3
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:11,080
Let's also create some other
variables to hold the salaries of

4
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:16,120
three hypothetical players
on say an athletics team.

5
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:20,090
One way we could calculate the total
payroll with salaries is to do this,

6
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:20,920
which isn't too bad.

7
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:23,160
It all fits on one line, but

8
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,050
in certain cases we may only want
to add one salary at a time.

9
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:30,280
And if we were to do this then
our calculations would change to

10
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,310
say something like this.

11
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:35,600
And in this case we add one salary
at time to the existing value of

12
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,260
the total payroll.

13
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,060
So this isn't too bad.

14
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:42,800
If we want out of one at a time, but
we can do better than this by combining

15
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,450
assignment and
the plus operator all at the same time.

16
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:50,380
And we can do this by using
the operator we want, in this case,

17
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:53,570
the addition operator
followed by an equal sign.

18
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:55,540
And while this may be
confusing at first,

19
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:58,550
let's look at how the operator
reads from left to right.

20
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:05,468
First we want to add to our existing
value and then we want to assign.

21
00:01:05,468 --> 00:01:09,092
And we can also do this with
other operators like subtraction

22
00:01:09,092 --> 00:01:12,301
multiplication division and
the modulus operator.

23
00:01:12,301 --> 00:01:16,459
So I go ahead and fix this up, and
now we get the same value by combining

24
00:01:16,459 --> 00:01:20,720
the addition and assignment for
this addition assignment operator.

25
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:25,039
If you want to see this with a different
operator, we can change all the signs to

26
00:01:25,039 --> 00:01:29,176
subtraction signs, and
now our total payroll is -2,500,000.

27
00:01:29,176 --> 00:01:32,489
And this would be more appropriate
if we wanted to show the deficit

28
00:01:32,489 --> 00:01:36,540
after paying our players, as opposed to
the total payroll that we saw earlier.
