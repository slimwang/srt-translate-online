1
00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:01,170
in the last node,

2
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:03,300
we mentioned that meaningful
apps come from great intention.

3
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:05,990
Now the best way to
surface this intention

4
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:09,940
is to build a user interface that's
easy to use and has clear value.

5
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:11,200
For the quake report app,

6
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,360
we want to allow users to get a sense of
earthquake activity around the world.

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,150
In order to do that, we've identified
certain pieces of metadata that

8
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:20,830
will be most helpful in
understanding that activity.

9
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:24,580
We even came up with a few Macleod
ideas for how to display that data.

10
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:26,170
And to kick them up to another level,

11
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:30,080
we roped in one of our UX designers
to develop a more refined design.

12
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,950
Let's take a look at the final mock up.

13
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:35,730
Okay, so here's the design
mock of the main list view.

14
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:37,150
Simple and clean, right?

15
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:38,020
Pretty cool.

16
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:42,300
Now, if we zero in here on the list item
design, you'll notice on the left that

17
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:46,325
we have a colored circle that
contains the magnitude of quake.

18
00:00:46,325 --> 00:00:50,160
Now also notice the fluctuation in color
that we have here in these different

19
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,210
circles to reflect the change
in magnitude strength.

20
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:57,500
Now, this is the most important
piece of information about a quake.

21
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:00,870
So the circle and the color provide
a good way to draw prominence to this

22
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:02,770
piece of important data.

23
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:06,910
Now in the center, we have the general
location name with the details

24
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:12,670
highlighted above it using a slightly
bolder font, all caps and lighter text.

25
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:18,210
Now all these subtle choices combine to
help focus the user on what's important.

26
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:21,080
And then lastly,
on the right side we have the date and

27
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,260
the time formatted nicely.

28
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:27,620
Also using a similar stacked layout
as location name in the details.

29
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:32,570
Some of you may be thinking what do I do
if I don't have access to a designer?

30
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:36,310
Now while it's certainly advantageous
to have a formal design perspective,

31
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:40,070
it's also very possible to channel
some solid design on your own.

32
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:42,890
It may just mean you'll have to
spend some more time iterating on

33
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:44,110
a design idea.

34
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:47,420
And ground your ideas around some
guidelines such as the material design

35
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:48,830
guidelines here.

36
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:52,060

additional tips on building a great UI.
