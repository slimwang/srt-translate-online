The problem is that you could make an argument for just about any of these. You

2
00:00:04,811 --> 00:00:08,345
could make an argument for any of the corners or intersection points of the

3
00:00:08,345 --> 00:00:13,322
bounding boxes or even the centroid of them. Or, maybe you don't want to use a

4
00:00:13,322 --> 00:00:17,165
point of intersection, maybe instead you want to select the entire area as a

5
00:00:17,165 --> 00:00:22,806
subsection of these bounding boxes. Which one you do is really up to you and it

6
00:00:22,806 --> 00:00:26,588
can have a lot of effect on how the rest of your physics or collision engine

7
00:00:26,588 --> 00:00:28,707
works.
