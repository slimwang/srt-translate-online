1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Let's just take a look again if there's activities.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,000
If you remember what we're trying to do is get, keep and grow customers,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and so these things on the left with all these arrows going into the funnel,

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
those represent all the demand creation activities you were doing either paid or free.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
And in the physical channel that we're getting you into the funnel on the top.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
And for web, mobile or cloud, we were getting you into the funnel on the bottom.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Now remember, these are just visual representations of the process.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The world doesn't actually look like this but when you get good enough ad,

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
thus you tend to actually look at your process.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
What we are really looking is a funnel laying on its side and you tend to think about

11
00:00:43,000 --> 99:59:59,999
how do we efficiently get payers or users into the funnel and all the way through it.
