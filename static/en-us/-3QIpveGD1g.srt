1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,075
The answer is the fourth choice. That this works

2
00:00:04,075 --> 00:00:06,894
at least against the attack that was described

3
00:00:06,894 --> 00:00:09,503
as long as the random value is kept secret.

4
00:00:09,503 --> 00:00:12,458
If C decrypts the message while C has the private

5
00:00:12,458 --> 00:00:15,299
key here also, well learn the random value and

6
00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:18,586
can use that in collaboration with eavesdropper

7
00:00:18,586 --> 00:00:20,704
who heard these messages now to figure out

8
00:00:20,704 --> 00:00:24,712
which voter voted for which candidate. So this is a

9
00:00:24,712 --> 00:00:27,774
weak system. So this solution doesnt work at

10
00:00:27,774 --> 00:00:31,145
least not it for a threat model includes an

11
00:00:31,145 --> 00:00:33,579
eavesdropper colluding with party C or C

12
00:00:33,579 --> 00:00:37,000
having the ability to eavesdrop on this link.
