00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,882
Going through the steps that we know and love now for finding inverse

2
00:00:02,882 --> 00:00:08,320
functions, here's what we end up with. Starting with f of x equals x over 4, f

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:15,114
inverse of x equals 4x. This makes perfect sense. F is dividing x by 4, and f

4
00:00:15,114 --> 00:00:21,668
inverse is multiplying it by 4. Checking our work, f of f inverse of x equals

5
00:00:21,668 --> 00:00:27,829
4x over 4, which is just x. Going the other direction, f inverse of f of x

6
00:00:27,829 --> 00:00:33,918
gives us 4 times x over 4, which is just x. Awesome! This must really be our

7
00:00:33,918 --> 00:00:40,079
inverse. Looking at g of x, we started off with g of x equals 4 over x. And

8
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:45,560
interestingly enough, g inverse of x also equals 4 over x. Let's double-check

9
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:49,897
to make sure this works. G of g inverse of x is 4 over 4 over x, which

10
00:00:49,897 --> 00:00:56,200
simplifies to x. Hm, we get exactly the same thing for g inverse of g of x,

11
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:02,670
since g inverse and g are the same thing. So we also end up with x for this. G

12
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:07,820
here is a special kind of function. It's the inverse of itself.
