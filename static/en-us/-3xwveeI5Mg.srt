00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,788
>> Fantastic. Now the preDrawCache function has some tricky math that we'll go

2
00:00:03,788 --> 00:00:07,559
ahead and walk through here. The first thing we'll need to do is determine the

3
00:00:07,559 --> 00:00:11,284
number of canvases that we're going to use along the x and y-axis. To do this,

4
00:00:11,284 --> 00:00:15,119
we actually divide the entire pixel size by the canvas tile size and then floor

5
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:18,774
the value. Note that we add the 1 here to round up, ensuring that any pixels

6
00:00:18,774 --> 00:00:22,668
that fall outside of this division operation are actually covered and added to

7
00:00:22,668 --> 00:00:28,151
our canvas. From there, we do a simple 2-dimensional for loop that walks through

8
00:00:28,151 --> 00:00:32,925
and creates a new canvas tile and set the x and y values equal to the position

9
00:00:32,925 --> 00:00:37,627
of x offset times tile size. Once that's done, we simply concatenate this new

10
00:00:37,627 --> 00:00:42,354
canvas tile to the already created array. And then, we set fully loaded equal to

11
00:00:42,354 --> 00:00:42,725
true.
