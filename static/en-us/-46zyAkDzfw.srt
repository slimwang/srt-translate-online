1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,240
Here's the plan for this lesson.

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:06,680
We'll start by outlining this general
design technique of dynamic programming.

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:10,480
Then we'll see three examples
in the sequence alignment or

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,170
edit distance problem.

5
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:14,930
This is also a very minor
generalization of the longest

6
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:16,860
common subsequence problem.

7
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:19,930
Also in the chain matrix
multiplication problem.

8
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:23,180
Where we're given a sequence
of matrices to multiply and

9
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:26,358
we want to place the parentheses in
the right order to do it efficiently.

10
00:00:26,358 --> 00:00:30,640
And the all-pairs shortest
paths problems for the graph.

11
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,870
Good references for these topics
are Dasgupta, Papadimitriou, and

12
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:37,270
Vazirani, their book on Algorithms.

13
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:39,210
And the classic Cormen,
Leiserson, Rivest,

14
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:40,990
Stein, Introduction to Algorithms.
