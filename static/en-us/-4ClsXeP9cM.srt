In addition to statistics, many data scientists are well

2
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:06,070
versed in machine learning. You might be wondering what exactly

3
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:08,940
is machine learning. Well, machine learning is a branch of

4
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:13,200
artificial intelligence that's focused on constructing systems that learn from

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,660
large amounts of data to make predictions. Machine learning could

6
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:19,180
also be useful to predict which movies you might like

7
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:22,500
on Netflix. Or how many home runs a batter may

8
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,440
hit over the course of his career. These are all

9
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,530
potential applications of machine learning.
