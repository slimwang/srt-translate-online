00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:05,290
So I'm setting here with the founding CTO of Udacity, Mike.

2
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:11,600
Mike, how did you come to the decision Udacity? Because Udacity is running their

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:14,450
courses own App Engine, in fact that's what this course is all

4
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:18,440
about. How did you come to the decision of, of using App Engine?

5
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:22,530
>> The very first website we built was built

6
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:26,010
for AI classes, a single course. And it was

7
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:30,330
built on a bunch of VPS servers, and we

8
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:33,330
had underestimated the interest that we were going to get.

9
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:35,700
Which was awesome, but we ended up with two

10
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,960
orders of magnitude more users than we expected. And

11
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,125
I was a relatively novice web developer. And so

12
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:44,969
we hit every single problem you can hit, in

13
00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:48,287
terms of scaling up the infrastructure to meet the

14
00:00:48,287 --> 00:00:51,359
demand. And so the entire 14 weeks of the course

15
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:54,089
we were just playing catch up the whole time.

16
00:00:54,089 --> 00:00:57,787
Fixing problems, and adding more bandwidth, and adding more machines

17
00:00:57,787 --> 00:01:01,520
and memory. And coming out of that, we were looking

18
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,820
at launching a bunch more courses and we were really

19
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:06,910
uncertain about how much traffic we'd be getting. We've seen

20
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:10,156
a lot of peaks. And so one of the engineers,

21
00:01:10,156 --> 00:01:12,808
we're a very small team, but one of the engineers

22
00:01:12,808 --> 00:01:16,580
had some experience using App Engine. And, it sounded like

23
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:21,122
a really great solution to the problem of uncertain amount

24
00:01:21,122 --> 00:01:24,881
of load, and took all of that headache. Because we

25
00:01:24,881 --> 00:01:28,198
were spending about half of our engineering hours doing sys

26
00:01:28,198 --> 00:01:30,916
admin and dev ops work, just trying to keep stuff

27
00:01:30,916 --> 00:01:33,114
running. And when you have a small team and you

28
00:01:33,114 --> 00:01:35,465
want to focus on getting new features out. And you

29
00:01:35,465 --> 00:01:38,405
want to focus on usually working on what your good

30
00:01:38,405 --> 00:01:41,846
at, then it is wonderful to have a platform that cushions

31
00:01:41,846 --> 00:01:46,030
you, for the spike and the loads. And pushes you in the right direction.

32
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:48,540
>> That's fascinating, that's exactly hat we're

33
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,960
trying to teach in this course. What would

34
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,860
be your key messages to the students of

35
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:55,860
this course, what would you tell them now?

36
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,010
>> So I think the advice I'd give to the

37
00:01:57,010 --> 00:02:01,330
students is, it's important to remember there are trade-offs with any

38
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:04,410
framework or platform you use. And one of th things,

39
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:08,008
after using App Engine for a couple years, we found is.

40
00:02:08,008 --> 00:02:11,450
It seemed like there was a lot more work, at times,

41
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:14,420
just to get started, to get something simple up and running.

42
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:17,480
But, what we found with time is that it pushes you

43
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,530
in the right direction. It pushes you to the best design

44
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:24,410
practices, for building a scalable applications. Maybe, if you're trying to

45
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:27,860
build something which will serve 200 people, you could do it.

46
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:29,420
Quite a bit faster if you are just running it on

47
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:33,451
a single machine. But the second you get up to 2,000, or

48
00:02:33,451 --> 00:02:36,532
20,000, or 200,000 users, it's made you make

49
00:02:36,532 --> 00:02:38,566
decisions, which will really put you in a

50
00:02:38,566 --> 00:02:41,530
better place. And that is, that's it, I

51
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:45,870
think the most absolutely valuable thing that it provides.

52
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:47,780
>> That's great. Thank you so much, Mike for taking

53
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:51,340
this time. I'm sure that the student will find this valuable.

54
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:55,380
>> Thanks, and glad I could help. And I really hope that after taking this

55
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:56,850
course, students have a little bit of an

56
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:58,440
easier time than we did at the beginning.
