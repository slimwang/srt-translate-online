1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:01,970
Well the internet
lights are blinking and

2
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:04,870
that can only mean one thing,
we've got a Mike incoming.

3
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:06,860
>> Hey, it's time for
a coding challenge.

4
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:07,880
>> Couldn't agree more.

5
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:09,080
Take it away, Mike.

6
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:12,710
>> Your task is to update the CSS in
a way that doesn't disrupt the currently

7
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:14,460
running version of the site.

8
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:15,600
First, to get you started,

9
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,280
you need to get your project
into the same state as Jake's.

10
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:21,360
Go to the project directory
in the command line and

11
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:24,780
run git reset --hard to remove
any local changes you have.

12
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:27,800
Then git checkout task-handling-updates.

13
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:31,800
This time make sure force
update on reload is disabled.

14
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,560
We want to retain the full
service life cycle here.

15
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:40,220
Over in the service worker
script in public/js/sw/index.js

16
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:42,900
your task is to change
the theme of the site.

17
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:45,883
Thankfully this is pretty easy as all
the colors are stored in variables.

18
00:00:45,883 --> 00:00:52,303
You can see those in
public/scss/_theme.scss.

19
00:00:52,303 --> 00:00:56,840
You can either uncomment the green and
pink theme or make one of your own up.

20
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,880
The only requirement is that
the primary color changes so

21
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,180
that the site's header changes color.

22
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:05,340
Then in the service worker you
need to update the cache name and

23
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:08,480
use the activate event
to remove the old cache.

24
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:11,770
Once you've coded it up,
reload the page to see it working.

25
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:13,230
In the service worker's dev tools,

26
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:16,070
you should see a worker
in the waiting position.

27
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:17,620
Don't let it activate yet.

28
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:19,987
Instead, head over to
the settings page and

29
00:01:19,987 --> 00:01:24,360
type new-cache-ready into
the test field and press Enter.

30
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,632
This will confirm it's all working.
