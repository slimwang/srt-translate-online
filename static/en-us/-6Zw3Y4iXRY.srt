1
00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:02,960
All right, why don't we walk through the solution.

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:06,700
First we define these Python lists called countries, gold, silver, and

3
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:11,850
bronze, which give us ordered lists of the country names, gold medal counts,

4
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:13,040
silver medal counts, and

5
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:18,420
bronze medal counts as they appear in the Sochi medal count table.

6
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:21,550
Then we create this Python dictionary, Olympic medal counts.

7
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:23,630
Where the keys are our column names and

8
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:27,770
the values are panda series containing these lists.

9
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:31,271
Finally, we create our data frame Olympic_medal_counts_df by

10
00:00:31,271 --> 00:00:34,240
passing olympic_medal_counts into the DataFrame function.
