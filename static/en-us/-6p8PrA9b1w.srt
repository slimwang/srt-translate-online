00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,040
All right, so
I took your comment to mean, and

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:06,870
don't correct me yet,
that when you have multiple bandit arms,

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:10,000
you want to choose the one that
has the highest confidence.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,260
>> That's not what I said, but okay.

5
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:13,420
>> I said, don't correct me yet.

6
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:17,300
So here we have two bandit arms,
a and b.

7
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:24,310
And we've pulled b twice and we've seen
one pay out, and we pulled a once.

8
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:25,730
And we didn't see it pay out.

9
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:27,950
So, in terms of expected value,
b is winning.

10
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:29,810
>> Yes, B is winning.
>> And in terms of confidence,

11
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:30,380
b is winning.

12
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:31,850
>> Right.
>> So, what do you think the best thing

13
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:32,610
to do is?

14
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:35,590
Do you think at this point we
should just always pick a?

15
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:36,200
Always pick b?

16
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:38,800
Or maybe something else.

17
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:39,845
>> I'm going to go with something else.

18
00:00:39,845 --> 00:00:42,510
>> [LAUGH] All right, so

19
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:45,800
if we didn't have that third option
though, which would you choose?

20
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,550
>> That depends,
how many more times do I get to do this?

21
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:51,615
Well wait, I'm forced to always
choose a or always choose b?

22
00:00:51,615 --> 00:00:53,205
>> Yes.
>> I guess I'd always choose B.

23
00:00:53,205 --> 00:00:53,955
>> Yeah.

24
00:00:53,955 --> 00:00:57,925
That actually is not a bad idea but the
fact of the matter is that it's always

25
00:00:57,925 --> 00:01:01,385
this problematic and the reason you want
to do something else is because well,

26
00:01:01,385 --> 00:01:04,375
let me first tell you this because
I bothered to compute it so

27
00:01:04,375 --> 00:01:05,595
I might as well share it with you.

28
00:01:05,595 --> 00:01:06,945
I did the following calculation.

29
00:01:06,945 --> 00:01:11,900
I said, if we were to randomly choose
the payoff rates for both a and b, and

30
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:14,390
then we pull a once and we pull b twice.

31
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:17,840
If we happen to see no payoffs for
a, one payoff for

32
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:23,250
b, how often is it the case that
b is the better arm than a?

33
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:24,640
>> Okay.

34
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,880
>> And you were right, that from
the data that we have at the moment

35
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:31,910
b is a pretty good guess and in fact 70%
of the time b is the better of the two

36
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:35,640
arms, but a full 30% of the time
>> A is the right arm.

37
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,470
So you don't just want to go with b.

38
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:40,350
because you're going to be wrong
almost a third of the time.

39
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,730
A better thing to do is something else.

40
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:43,770
So what is, what's an idea for
something else?

41
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:47,970
What's a reasonable thing to do if we
got an arbitrary number of polls left.

42
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:50,720
>> So if we have an arbitrary number
than we might as well talk about what

43
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,660
happens after an infinite
amount of time.

44
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:58,280
If I had an infinite amount of time
then I know my true expected values for

45
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,970
a and b and so I know which one to pull.

46
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:02,010
Right?
So another way of saying that is

47
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:06,450
I want to do the thing that gets me
more confidence in my expectations.
