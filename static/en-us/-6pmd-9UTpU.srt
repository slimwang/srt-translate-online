Since we have been talking about process creation,

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:06,850
let's take a quiz about some special parent processes.

3
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:10,580
The first question is, on UNIX-based operating systems,

4
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:14,875
which process is often regarded as the parent of all processes?

5
00:00:14,875 --> 00:00:19,290
And the second question, which is not required but it's extra credit,

6
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:25,270
on the Android OS, which process is regarded as the parent of all App processes?

7
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:28,790
Feel free to use the Internet to find the answer for these questions
