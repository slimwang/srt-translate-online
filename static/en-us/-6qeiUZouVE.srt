1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,683
Now I want to talk about one more
representation for planning,

2
00:00:03,682 --> 00:00:05,354
called Situation Calculus.

3
00:00:05,355 --> 00:00:10,129
[INAUDIBLE], suppose we wanted to have
the goal of moving all the cargo from

4
00:00:10,128 --> 00:00:14,914
airport A to airport B, regardless of
how many pieces of cargo there are.

5
00:00:14,914 --> 00:00:19,705
You can't express the notion of all in
propositional languages like classical

6
00:00:19,705 --> 00:00:22,429
planning, but
you can in first order logic.

7
00:00:22,429 --> 00:00:25,850
And there are several ways to use
first order logic for planning.

8
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:28,223
The best known is situation calculus.

9
00:00:28,222 --> 00:00:32,612
It's not a new kind of logic, rather,
it's regular first order logic with

10
00:00:32,612 --> 00:00:36,440
a set of conventions for
how to represent states and actions.

11
00:00:36,439 --> 00:00:38,890
I'll show you what the conventions are.

12
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:43,445
First, actions
are represented as objects in

13
00:00:43,445 --> 00:00:47,895
first order logic,
normally by functions.

14
00:00:47,895 --> 00:00:52,870
And so we would have a function,
like the function

15
00:00:52,869 --> 00:00:57,487
fly of a plane in a from airport and
to airport,

16
00:00:57,487 --> 00:01:02,356
which represents an object
which is the action.

17
00:01:02,356 --> 00:01:04,140
Then we have situations.

18
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:08,945
In situations,
are also objects in a logic and

19
00:01:08,945 --> 00:01:14,122
they correspond not to states but
rather to past,

20
00:01:14,123 --> 00:01:19,810
the past of actions that we
have in states base search.

21
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:24,280
So, if you arrive at what
will be the same world state

22
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,230
by two different sets of actions,

23
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:30,460
those would be considered two different
situations in situation calculus.

24
00:01:30,459 --> 00:01:33,609
We describe situations by objects.

25
00:01:33,609 --> 00:01:38,079
So we usually have an initial situation,
often called S0.

26
00:01:39,819 --> 00:01:44,439
And then we have a function
on situations called result.

27
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:47,704
So the result of
the situation object and

28
00:01:47,704 --> 00:01:51,652
an action object is equal
to another situation.

29
00:01:51,652 --> 00:01:56,512
And now, instead of describing
the actions that are applicable

30
00:01:56,512 --> 00:01:59,932
in a situation with
a predicate actions of s,

31
00:01:59,932 --> 00:02:05,290
situation calculus for
some reason decided not to do that.

32
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:10,064
And instead, we're going to talk about
the actions that are possible in

33
00:02:10,064 --> 00:02:13,099
a state and
we're going to do that with a predicate.

34
00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:19,555
We have a predicate possible of a and
a, is an action a possible in a state.

35
00:02:19,555 --> 00:02:25,010
Now there's a specific form for
describing these predicates.

36
00:02:25,009 --> 00:02:30,914
And in general it has
the form of some precondition

37
00:02:30,914 --> 00:02:38,376
of state s implies that it's
possible to do action a in state s.

38
00:02:38,377 --> 00:02:43,680
I'll show the possibility axiom for
the fly action.

39
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,120
We would say, if there is some
p which is a plane in state s,

40
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:52,617
and there is some x which
an airport in state x, and

41
00:02:52,616 --> 00:02:58,129
there is some y which is also
an airport in state s, and

42
00:02:58,129 --> 00:03:03,479
p is at location x in state s,

43
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:07,709
then that implies that it's possible

44
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:13,200
to fly p from x to y in state s.

45
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:17,269
And that's known as a possibility
axiom for the action fly.
