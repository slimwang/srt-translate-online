1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,640
So how many people would like to find
their blind spot, raise your hand.

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:04,682
You can't, it's blind, no.

3
00:00:04,682 --> 00:00:05,700
We're going to do that.

4
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:08,119
So it's actually really, really easy.

5
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:09,370
Couple of ways we can do this.

6
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:16,070
So, on my screen right now, I have
a picture of a, a plus and a, and a dot.

7
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:19,640
Your blind spot is always on
the outside of your visual field.

8
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:23,860
So what I'm going to do is, I'm going to
look for the blind spot in my left eye.

9
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:25,340
So it's going to be outside.

10
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:27,600
So what I'm going to do is,
I'm going to, whoa!

11
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,680
It happened right now.

12
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,930
So right now I'm looking at
that dot on the right, and

13
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:33,640
to the left of it is a cross.

14
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,490
And if I move here, there's the cross.

15
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:39,570
There's the cross, but
right here, the cross is gone.

16
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:41,380
I think that's at 12 deg,
I can't remember,

17
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:43,530
I think it's 12 degrees out, right?

18
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:44,150
It's just not there.

19
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:45,875
It's just plain black.

20
00:00:45,875 --> 00:00:47,912
Okay if I want to do
it with my right eye,

21
00:00:47,912 --> 00:00:51,750
well what I'll do is I'll look at
the cross, and I'll move until I oh!

22
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:52,750
There it goes.

23
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:54,660
The circle is gone.

24
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:57,710
If you are doing this,
if you rotate your head like that,

25
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:02,720
the cross comes back because the blind
spot is located off to one side and as

26
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:07,690
I rotate, the blind spot is now up here
and the, and the, the cross pops back.

27
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:10,880
In class, normally what I do is I
make a bunch of pieces of paper and

28
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,480
I hand this out right here.

29
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:16,130
Okay, and I ask people to
take their left eye, so, so,

30
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:19,880
for those of you not paying attention,
so we have a dot, and

31
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:24,300
over here we have a bar with a cross
hash pattern in the middle of it.

32
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:25,420
And what I do is,

33
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:31,410
I tell people to move that dot til
something seems to happen to that bar.

34
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:35,730
All right, so back here I see the bar
with the cross hash, I move in, and

35
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:39,630
then something happens, the cross
hash disappears into just a line.
