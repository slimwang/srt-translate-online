1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,390
Now what makes stochastic games more interesting, perhaps, than repeated

2
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:07,480
games, is the idea that the actions that the players take

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:11,320
impact not just the rewards, but also future states. Right? And,

4
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:12,760
so this is the same issue that comes up when we're

5
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:15,200
talking about mark off decision processes and the way we

6
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,720
dealt with it in that setting was by defining a value

7
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:20,970
function. So, it seems pretty reasonable to try to go after

8
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:25,270
that same idea again. So what I've got here is actually

9
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:27,770
the Belmont Equation And let's look at this together and let's

10
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:30,030
see if we can fix it because it's not quite right.

11
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:30,430
>> Okay.

12
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:32,759
>> For dealing with the idea of zero sum in a stochastic

13
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:37,170
game. Okay so you remember the Belmen equation? We've got Q I star.

14
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:37,923
>> Mm-hmm.

15
00:00:37,923 --> 00:00:41,900
>> So there was no I before, but Q star is the state. Is

16
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:43,550
to find over state actions, so here

17
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:45,600
we're going to define it over action, joint actions

18
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:45,925
>> Mm-hm.

19
00:00:45,925 --> 00:00:50,560
>> For the two players, action pairs. The immediate reward to player

20
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:53,160
i for take, for that joint action in that

21
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:56,350
state plus the discounted expected value of the next state.

22
00:00:56,350 --> 00:01:01,260
So we need to factor in the transition probabilities So

23
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:03,180
the transition of actually going to some next state s

24
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:06,310
prime is s, sorry t of s, AB as

25
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:09,370
prime. Right? So now, we're imagining what happens when we

26
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:11,680
land in S prime. So what I've written here says,

27
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,850
well, we're going to basically look a the Q values

28
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:17,880
in the state that we landed in, and kind

29
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,100
of summarize them, summarize that value back up so

30
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:23,170
that we can use it to define the, the

31
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:25,570
value of the state that we left. You with me?

32
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:26,980
>> I am with you.

33
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:29,620
>> Alright so if we put this in if, if we say the

34
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:32,870
way we're going to summarize the value for the new state that we land

35
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:36,520
in. Is we think of it as actually a matrix game. That there's

36
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:40,920
payoffs for each action choices of A prime and B prime. And over all

37
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:46,180
of those, we need to kind of summarize well which of those actions in this table

38
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:48,350
of values that we get for s prime.

39
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:50,200
Which of those values are we going to propagate forward

40
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:53,880
and call the value of that state? So what we did in regular MDPs is that we

41
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,680
said we'll take a max over all the

42
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,580
actions or in this case all the joint actions.

43
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:03,930
>> Uhun. So what do you think that translates to?

44
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:06,490
>> Well you wrote down max but that doesn't make sense,

45
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:07,460
that doesn't, that can't be right.

46
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,190
>> Well it translates, it means something. It

47
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:10,710
just doesn't mean what we mean it to mean.

48
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:11,620
>> That's true, that's fair.

49
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:13,670
>> So what does it mean and then, and then, how can

50
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:15,310
we fix it? So let's start off with what does it mean.

51
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:18,780
>> It means that you kind of always assume

52
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:21,770
that the joint actions that are going to be taken

53
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:26,150
Will benefit you the most. So, everyone, everyone is

54
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:29,080
trying to make you happy so, this makes you optimistic?

55
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:31,500
>> yeah, sort of optimistic

56
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,320
to the point of, of

57
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:33,850
>> Delusion?

58
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:37,450
>> Yes, very good. Right, it just basically says that whenever we're in a

59
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:39,640
state, the whole world is going to choose

60
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,420
their actions to benefit me, and this is

61
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:44,460
not what we get a say a zero sum stacastic game, but a zero

62
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:48,420
sum stacastic game, we should be you know. Like fighting it out at this point.

63
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:52,080
>> So that would work out if everybody's rewards were the same,

64
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,320
or everybody's rewards were the sum

65
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,100
of everyone's rewards, or something like that.

66
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:57,080
>> That's right.

67
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,890
If it was some kind of team based game.

68
00:02:58,890 --> 00:02:58,960
>> Mm.

69
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,570
>> Or if everybody was, you know, going to sacrifice their

70
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:04,780
own happiness for the benefit of Qi, or i I mean.

71
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:08,050
>> Hm. So it's not reasonable to assume that. In

72
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:11,190
fact, what was it that we were assuming when we

73
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:13,700
had a zero sum game that was just a single

74
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:16,130
stage? Right? Just a single game and then we were done.

75
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:18,010
>> Oh, that people were doing minimax.

76
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:19,010
>> Right.

77
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:19,660
>> And maximin.

78
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:22,980
>> So what if we changed the equation to look like that?

79
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:26,235
So, what I mean by this, is when, when we

80
00:03:26,235 --> 00:03:30,330
we evaluate the value of a state. We actually solve the

81
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:34,020
zero sum game in the Q values and take that value

82
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:36,010
and use it in the, in the context of this equation.

83
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:37,680
>> That seems closer to right.

84
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,520
>> Yeah. I mean, it's not an unreasonable

85
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,710
thing to do. It's just to say, I'm going to

86
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:42,810
summarize the future by imagining that we're going to play

87
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:45,310
that game that represents, you know, all the future.

88
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:45,750
>> Sure.

89
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,830
>> And I'm going to act in such a way to,

90
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:50,480
to try to Maximize that assuming you're trying to minimize

91
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,104
it, which makes perfect sense if it's a zero-sum game.

92
00:03:53,104 --> 00:03:54,720
>> Right. I was, yeah, and we're still, we're

93
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,280
still acting as if there are only two people here.

94
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,350
>> Yeah, yeah, that's right. It turns out

95
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:00,510
that when you're talking about zero-sum it really

96
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:02,400
implies that there's only two players. Because if

97
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,860
you have a zero-sum three player game, it

98
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:08,940
really is just a general sum game. You can imagine that the third player is just

99
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:10,640
an extra factor that's just messing with the

100
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,390
numbers to make things sum up to zero.

101
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:18,410
So, yeah, so zero sum really does kind of focus on this two player setting.

102
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:19,579
>> That makes sense.

103
00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:21,390
>> So we got this modified kelvin equation

104
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:24,480
and we can even translate it into a form

105
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:27,050
that's like Q learning. So the analog of

106
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:29,480
the kelvin equation and the Q learning update in

107
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:32,210
this setting would be that we. If we're

108
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:34,350
in some state, there's some joint action that's taken,

109
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:35,850
there's some pair of rewards that comes and

110
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:38,590
some next state that's visited that the Q value

111
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:42,030
for that state, joint action pair, is going to be updated to be closer

112
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:46,880
to, the reward for player i plus the discounted expected value, or sorry, the

113
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:52,110
discounted Summarized value or v value of the new states as prime, and we'll

114
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:55,450
again, we'll use mini-max to summarize what the values are in that new state.

115
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:56,120
>> I like it.

116
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,820
>> And that equation is sometimes referred

117
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:59,840
to as mini-max Q, because it's like

118
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,920
the Q learning update but just with the mini-max operator instead of a max.

119
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,940
>> That makes sense.
