1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:02,490
Next, we'll fix the behavior
of the Order button.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,390
Once I change the quantity to something
like six, if I hit the Order button,

3
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:09,510
the price should update to $30.

4
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:11,500
However, when I click the Order button,

5
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:14,770
it always changes the quantity
back to five and the price to $25.

6
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:16,400
So this behavior is incorrect.

7
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:19,540
To test your understanding of
everything we've learned so

8
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:22,690
far, I want you to go ahead and
fix this bug on your own.

9
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:24,750
I'm confident that you can do it.

10
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:27,270
This is a very common occurrence
during app development.

11
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:30,733
You build out more functionality of
your app, like this quantity picker, but

12
00:00:30,733 --> 00:00:33,160
then it can have ripple effects
on the rest of your app.

13
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:35,576
And it may break something,
like this Order button.

14
00:00:35,576 --> 00:00:37,500
So you have to just go back and
fix that later.

15
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:41,690
Once you've completed this task,
this is what the app should look like.

16
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:44,230
If I increase the quantity
to something like six, and

17
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:48,690
I hit the Order button, then the price
changes to $30, which is correct.

18
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:50,250
To help you tackle this problem,

19
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:53,620
first identify all the things that are
wrong with the current state of the app.

20
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:54,940
You can look at it on your device,
and so

21
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:57,070
it will be easier than
looking at this screenshot.

22
00:00:57,070 --> 00:01:00,120
This screenshot shows setting
the quantity to six and

23
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:03,620
then hitting the Order button and
seeing the result on the screen.

24
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:08,010
I want you to describe in words
the gap between what we have now and

25
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:08,560
what we want.

26
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:12,800
Be as detailed as possible by
writing your answer in this box.

27
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,110
The more specific you can get about all
the things that are wrong with the app,

28
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:21,300
the easier it will be to fix the problem
because you'll have almost a task list

29
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:23,728
on how to get to the ideal solution.

30
00:01:23,728 --> 00:01:26,740
Then after you've planned how you
will attack the problem, go ahead and

31
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:28,910
implement those changes in your app.

32
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:33,520
Once the Order button works as expected,
pat yourself on the back, and

33
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,930
then check this box to continue.
