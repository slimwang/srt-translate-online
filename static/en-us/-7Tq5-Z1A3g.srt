1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
This unit is about probability,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
which is a tool for dealing with uncertainty.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Once you understand probability,

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
you'll be able to tackle a much broader range of problems than you could

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
with programs that don't understand probability.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Often when we have problems with uncertainty, we're dealing with search problems.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Recall, in a search problem, we are in a current state.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
There are other states that we can transition into,

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
and we're trying to achieve some goal,

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
but we can't do it all in one step.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
We have to paste together a sequence of steps.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
In doing that, we're building up a search frontier that we're continuing to explore from.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Now, uncertainty can come into play in two ways.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
One, we can be uncertain about the current state.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Rather than knowing exactly where we are,

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
it may be that we start off in one of four possible states and

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
all we know is that we're somewhere in there, but we're not sure exactly where we are.

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The other place uncertainty can come in is when we apply an action,

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
say this action here--action A--it may be that we don't get to

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
one specific state but, rather, we're uncertain as to what the action will do,

21
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
and we might end up in this state or this state or this state

22
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
instead of the one that we were aiming at.

23
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
And so we'll see techniques for dealing with both of these types of uncertainty.

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Now, one place where people are used to dealing with uncertainty

25
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
is in playing games that employ dice.

26
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
And that's what we're going to deal with.

27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
In particular, we're going to play a dice game which is called Pig.

28
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I don't know why the game is called Pig.

29
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I can guarantee no porcine creatures were harmed in the creation of this unit.

30
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Here's how the game works.

31
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
There are two players, although you could play with more.

32
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
The players take turns, and on his turn a player has the option

33
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,000
to roll the dice--a single die--as often as he wants or to hold--to stop rolling.

34
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
And the object of the game is to score a certain number of points.

35
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
We're going to say 50 points; 100 is more common, but 50 will be easier

36
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
on the Udacity servers in terms of the amount of computation required.

37
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
And so it's my turn, and we have a score.

38
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
So here's a scoreboard; we'll have players with the imaginative names

39
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
of player 0 and player 1.

40
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
And the score starts off 0 to 0.

41
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Now there's another part of the scoreboard that is not part of the player's score.

42
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
We'll call that the pending score.

43
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Let's say it's my turn.

44
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I pick up the die, I roll it, and let's say I get a 5.

45
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Then 5 goes into the pending score,

46
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
but I don't score any points yet.

47
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Now it's my turn again.

48
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Do I roll or do I hold--stop rolling?

49
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Let's say I want to roll again.

50
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:55,000
This time I get a 2, so I add 2 to the pending score; I get 7.

51
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Let's say I roll again.

52
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I'm lucky. I get a 6. I add 6 to the pending; I get 13.

53
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
And I'm going great, so I roll again, and this time I get a 1.

54
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
And a 1 is special.

55
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
A 1 is called a pig out, and when you roll a pig out it means

56
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
you lose all the pending points, and for your hand you score

57
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
not this total, but just the 1.

58
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
So my score would be just the 1.

59
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Now the other player, player number 1, goes.

60
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Let's say player number 1 says, "I'm going to roll," gets a 3.

61
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
"I'm going to roll again," gets a 4.

62
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
"I'm going to roll again," gets a 5.

63
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:47,000
So now we have 12 in the pending, and now player number 1 says,

64
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
"I think I've had enough; I'm going to hold,"

65
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
and that means we take these points from the pending, the 12 points,

66
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
put them up on the board for player 1's score.

67
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
And now player 1's turn ends, and it's player 0's turn.

68
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
So your turn continues until you either hold or pig out,

69
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
and your score for the turn is the sum of your rolls, if you didn't pig out,

70
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,000
if you decided to hold, and the score is just 1 if you pigged out.

71
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
And you keep on taking turns until somebody reaches the target--here, 50.

72
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
So that's how the game of Pig works.

73
00:04:24,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Now let's go to try to describe the game in a form that we can program.
