00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,550
To submit your understanding of loaders,
try this exercise.

2
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:06,689
Temporarily add log messages
in the places in your app

3
00:00:06,689 --> 00:00:08,720
that have code related to loaders.

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,450
I've listed the key spots here.

5
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:14,770
For example, add a log message
in the activity on create method

6
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:16,880
at a log message when
the loader is initialized,

7
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,030
when onCreateLoader is triggered and
so on.

8
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:23,050
Feel free to add log messages
in any other places,

9
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:27,420
then run the app on your device and
check the log messages and log cat.

10
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:30,450
Experiment with what will actually
cause the loader to request data from

11
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:32,509
USGS more than once.

12
00:00:32,509 --> 00:00:34,010
In the notes below the quiz,

13
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:36,410
I've included some ideas
of scenarios to test.

14
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:38,160
What if you rotate the device?

15
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,190
What log messages get printed out then?

16
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:43,560
Does going to the home screen and
back make the loader to load again?

17
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,430
How about pressing the back button?

18
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:49,340
When you're done experimenting, you can
remove the log messages you've added.

19
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:50,900
Then click the check box here and

20
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:52,750
continue to the last coding
task of this lesson.
