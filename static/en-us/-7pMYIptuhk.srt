00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,987
Mipmapping looks much better, but goes to grey up the horizon. Modern GPUs can

2
00:00:03,987 --> 00:00:08,713
do even better than this by using anisotropic sampling. Anisotropic means

3
00:00:08,713 --> 00:00:11,353
having a property that has a different value when measured in different

4
00:00:11,353 --> 00:00:15,514
directions. Sampling means retrieving some piece of information meant to

5
00:00:15,514 --> 00:00:19,536
represent the whole. For example, a fragment shader will take a sample from a

6
00:00:19,536 --> 00:00:23,975
textures mipmap pyramid to represent the texture's color at that pixel. Where

7
00:00:23,975 --> 00:00:26,435
the word anisotropic comes into play is when we get to these pixels on the

8
00:00:26,435 --> 00:00:30,873
horizon. Think about looking along one column of the checkerboard. At the

9
00:00:30,873 --> 00:00:34,179
horizon a pixel may cover a large number of texels vertically, but few

10
00:00:34,179 --> 00:00:39,260
horizontally. That is, the number of texels differs in different directions.

11
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:43,416
What anisotropic sampling does is take extra samples along the axis where

12
00:00:43,416 --> 00:00:47,163
texels are more frequent and blends these together. These extra samples

13
00:00:47,163 --> 00:00:52,049
generally give a better result, not blurring out as quickly as the mipmap does.
