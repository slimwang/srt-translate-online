00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,048
I'd like to take a minute to give you a
visual of why the distributive property

2
00:00:04,059 --> 00:00:08,317
works the way that it works. So, let's go
back to drawing our beautiful circles. So

3
00:00:08,329 --> 00:00:13,129
let's say we have a group of 2 circles
and also a group of 10 circles. And,

4
00:00:13,129 --> 00:00:16,744
according to this equation, what we're
going to want to do is both add them

5
00:00:16,744 --> 00:00:20,844
together and then triple them. So if we
were to solve this problem the first way

6
00:00:20,844 --> 00:00:24,627
that we talked about, we would do this
addition inside the parentheses first, and

7
00:00:24,639 --> 00:00:28,449
then our multiplication. So you would take
these two groups, the 2 and the 10

8
00:00:28,449 --> 00:00:33,655
circles, and merge them into one group.
Great. So now we have 12 circles in one

9
00:00:33,667 --> 00:00:38,212
big group. And then, the next thing I want
to do is multiply this group by 3, so

10
00:00:38,224 --> 00:00:42,541
that means we want 3 sets of this
group of circles. So right now, we have

11
00:00:42,553 --> 00:00:46,945
one set and I can add 1 more, which make
it 2 sets and then I can add a third

12
00:00:46,957 --> 00:00:51,253
one. Remember, multiplication is just
repeated addition. So now, I have 3

13
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,415
groups of these 12 circles together and
that's it. I can count these up and if I

14
00:00:55,427 --> 00:00:59,552
decide, I'd do that right now, which I
won't, because I'm lazy, we would see that

15
00:00:59,564 --> 00:01:03,714
we have 36 circles. Okay, great. So,
that's the first method for solving this

16
00:01:03,726 --> 00:01:07,737
problem. However, we also have that 2nd 
method of solving problems like this and

17
00:01:07,749 --> 00:01:11,272
that's using the distributive property. So
if we want to use the distributive

18
00:01:11,284 --> 00:01:15,717
property, then the first step is going to
be to multiply each of the terms that's

19
00:01:15,729 --> 00:01:19,400
inside the parentheses by the 3. So
let's write down method 2. First, we're

20
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:23,651
going to say 3 times 2, then we're going to add
that to 3 times 10, just like we saw in the last

21
00:01:23,663 --> 00:01:27,374
quiz. Starting with the group of two
circles, I wanted to triple this like we

22
00:01:27,386 --> 00:01:31,266
see in this 1st term. And then, as we
see in the 2nd term, I want to triple

23
00:01:31,278 --> 00:01:35,395
this group as well. Great. So now I have
two groups, one group of 6 circles which

24
00:01:35,407 --> 00:01:38,029
is 3 times 2, and one group of 30 circles which
is 3 times 10.

25
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:41,938
And then, I want to add those two groups
together. So we need to merge this set of

26
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:46,159
circles with this set of circles, and we
end up with the exact same picture that we

27
00:01:46,171 --> 00:01:50,492
got using the first method. Once again, we
have 36 circles all in one group. I hope

28
00:01:50,504 --> 00:01:54,793
this has given you some insight into why
we're allowed to distribute multiplication

29
00:01:54,805 --> 00:01:57,636
to terms that are added together inside a
parentheses.
