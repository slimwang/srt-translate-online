00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,351
The exponent should be a positive 8. Great thinking if you got it right. If you

2
00:00:04,351 --> 00:00:08,729
multiply 9 10ths times 10 to the 9th, we would get 900,000,000. And 9 followed

3
00:00:08,729 --> 00:00:12,755
by eight 0s. In order to get this number back in scientific notation, our

4
00:00:12,755 --> 00:00:17,126
decimal point would have to be right after the 9. This means the power on the 10

5
00:00:17,126 --> 00:00:21,554
must be an 8. Our decimal point is here, and if we move it 8 places to the

6
00:00:21,554 --> 00:00:24,100
right, sure enough, we get 900 million.
