1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So the next units will be concerned with probabilities

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
and particularly with structured probabilities using Bayes networks.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
This is some of the most involved material in this class.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
And since this is a Stanford level class,

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
you will find out that some of the quizzes are actually really hard.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
So as you go through the material, I hope the hardness of the quizzes won't discourage you;

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:30,000
it'll really entice you to take a piece of paper and a pen and work them out.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Let me give you a flavor of a Bayes network using an example.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Suppose you find in the morning that your car won't start.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Well, there's many causes why your car might not start.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
One is that your battery is flat.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Even for a flat battery there is multiple causes.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
One, it's just plain dead,

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
and one is that the battery is okay but it's not charging.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
The reason why a battery might not charge is that the alternator might be broken

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
or the fan belt might be broken.

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
If you look at this influence diagram, also called a Bayes network,

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
you'll find there's many different ways to explain that the car won't start.

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
And a natural question you might have is, "Can we diagnose the problem?"

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
One diagnostic tool is a battery meter,

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
which may increase or decrease your belief that the battery may cause your car failure.

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
You might also know your battery age.

23
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Older batteries tend to go dead more often.

24
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,000
And there's many other ways to look at reasons why the car might not start.

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,000
You might inspect the lights, the oil light, the gas gauge.

26
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
You might even dip into the engine to see what the oil level is with a dipstick.

27
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
All of those relate to alternative reasons why the car might not be starting,

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:59,000
like no oil, no gas, the fuel line might be blocked, or the starter may be broken.

29
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
And all of these can influence your measurements,

30
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
like the oil light or the gas gauge, in different ways.

31
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
For example, the battery flat would have an effect on the lights.

32
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
It might have an effect on the oil light and on the gas gauge,

33
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
but it won't really affect the oil you measure with the dipstick.

34
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,000
That is affected by the actual oil level, which also affects the oil light.

35
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Gas will affect the gas gauge, and of course without gas the car doesn't start.

36
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:39,000
So this is a complicated structure that really describes one way to understand

37
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
how a car doesn't start.

38
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
A car is a complex system.

39
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
It has lots of variables you can't really measure immediately,

40
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,000
and it has sensors which allow you to understand a little bit about the state of the car.

41
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
What the Bayes network does,

42
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:01,000
it really assists you in reasoning from observable variables, like the car won't start

43
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
and the value of the dipstick, to hidden causes, like is the fan belt broken

44
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
or is the battery dead.

45
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
What you have here is a Bayes network.

46
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
A Bayes network is composed of nodes.

47
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,000
These nodes correspond to events that you might or might not know

48
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
that are typically called random variables.

49
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:31,000
These nodes are linked by arcs, and the arcs suggest that a child of an arc

50
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
is influenced by its parent but not in a deterministic way.

51
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:41,000
It might be influenced in a probabilistic way, which means an older battery, for example,

52
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
has a higher chance of causing the battery to be dead,

53
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
but it's not clear that every old battery is dead.

54
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,000
There is a total of 16 variables in this Bayes network.

55
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:59,000
What the graph structure and associated probabilities specify

56
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:06,000
is a huge probability distribution in the space of all of these 16 variables.

57
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
If they are all binary, which we'll assume throughout this unit,

58
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
they can take 2 to the 16th different values, which is a lot.

59
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
The Bayes network, as we find out, is a complex representation

60
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:26,000
of a distribution over this very, very large joint probability distribution of all of these variables.

61
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Further, once we specify the Bayes network,

62
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
we can observe, for example, the car won't start.

63
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
We can observe things like the oil light and the lights and the battery meter

64
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
and then compute probabilities of the hypothesis, like the alternator is broken

65
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
or the fan belt is broken or the battery is dead.

66
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
So in this class we're going to talk about how to construct this Bayes network,

67
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,000
what the semantics are, and how to reason in this Bayes network

68
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:02,000
to find out about variables we can't observe, like whether the fan belt is broken or not.

69
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
That's an overview.

70
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Throughout this unit I am going to assume that every event is discrete--

71
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
in fact, it's binary.

72
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
We'll start with some consideration of basic probability,

73
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,000
we'll work our way into some simple Bayes networks,

74
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
we'll talk about concepts like conditional independence

75
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
and then define Bayes networks more generally,

76
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:32,000
move into concepts like D-separation and start doing parameter counts.

77
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Later on, Peter will tell you about inference in Bayes networks.

78
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
So we won't do this in this class.

79
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I can't overemphasize how important this class is.

80
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Bayes networks are used extensively in almost all fields of smart computer system,

81
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:57,000
in diagnostics, for prediction, for machine learning, and fields like finance,

82
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
inside Google, in robotics.

83
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Bayes networks are also the building blocks of more advanced AI techniques

84
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:12,000
such as particle filters, hidden Markov models, MDPs and POMDPs,

85
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Kalman filters, and many others.

86
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
These are words that don't sound familiar quite yet,

87
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
but as you go through the class, I can promise you you will get to know what they mean.

88
00:06:22,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So let's start now at the very, very basics.
