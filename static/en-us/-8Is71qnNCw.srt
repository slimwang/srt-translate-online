1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
[Thrun] And again the solution follows directly from the state diagram over here.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
In the beginning we do know we're in state A

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
and the chance of remaining in A is 0.5.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
This is the 0.5 over here. We can just read this off.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
For the next state we find ourselves to be with 0.5 chance to be in A

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
and 0.5 chance to be in B.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
If we're in B, we transition with certainty to A.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
That's because of the 0.5.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
But if we're in A, we stay in A with a 0.5 chance. So you put this together.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
0.5 probability being in A times 0.5 probability of remaining in A

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
plus 0.5 probability to be in B times 1 probability to transition to A.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
That gives us 0.75.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Following the same logic but now we're in A with 0.75 times a 0.5 probability

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
of staying in A plus 0.25 in B, which is 1 minus 0.75,

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:06,000
and the transition's uncertainty back to A as 1, we get 0.625.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
So now you should be able to take a Markov chain and compute by hand

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
or write a piece of software the probabilities of future states.

18
00:01:16,000 --> 99:59:59,999
You will be able to predict something. That's really exciting.
