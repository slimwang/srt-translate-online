00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,230
So how might you use the idea of configuration to design an agent that can

2
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:06,280
answer Raven's progressive matrices? We've talked in the past about how

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:09,880
constraint propagation can help us solving these problems. If configuration is

4
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:13,360
a type of constraint propagation, how can you leverage the idea of variables and

5
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,000
values in designing your agent? What are the variables and

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,670
what values can they take? We've also discussed how planning can be applied to

7
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:23,610
Raven's progressive matrices. If configuration leverages old plans,

8
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:26,310
how you build your agent to remember those old plans and reconfigure them for

9
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:29,940
new problems? Will it develop the old plans based on existing problems, or

10
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:31,220
will you hand it the problems in advance?
