1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:07,500
>> So the tools that I was talking about
you can find those owasp.org website.

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:10,640
So remember we're talking about
source code analysis tools here.

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:14,790
So we are making assumption that the
code that you write, you have the source

4
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:18,440
code and you want to make sure that it
doesn't have those vulnerabilities.

5
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:21,010
So you going to run it, so
you obviously have the source code.

6
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:22,160
You run it through these tools.

7
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,580
A lot of times if the code
is not written by you,

8
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:26,900
it's coming from somebody else.

9
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:28,660
You may only have the binary.

10
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:32,800
And then some of those tools
that requires source code,

11
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,810
reduce source code analysis
obviously won't be helpful.

12
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:39,940
So discovering those vulnerability and
binary is said reverse engineering and

13
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:43,210
all the other skills come in,
but attackers for

14
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:47,850
example will take binary code and
try to discover vulnerabilities in it.

15
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:51,990
And we do that,
one of the lab courses we teach here.

16
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:56,323
People with attackers mindset,
given a piece of binary how do you find

17
00:00:56,323 --> 00:01:01,181
out if has let's say, some potential
overflow kind of vulnerability or not.

18
00:01:01,181 --> 00:01:04,571
But if your source code,
you writing the code and

19
00:01:04,571 --> 00:01:07,641
you want to deliver secure coding and
so on.

20
00:01:07,641 --> 00:01:11,578
If you work for a company part of
their software development process may

21
00:01:11,578 --> 00:01:15,921
include reviews and passing those codes
through these kind of tools and so on.

22
00:01:15,921 --> 00:01:18,256
It's a problem that we all recognize,

23
00:01:18,256 --> 00:01:21,670
we all recognize the importance
of writing secure code.

24
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:27,640
And these analysis tools can help you
identify potential vulnerabilities and

25
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,410
mistakes that you may have made.

26
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:32,730
That could result into these kind of
things that we've been talking about.

27
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:36,580
So, spending a little bit of time
with these is a good idea and

28
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:39,380
that's going to help you
write more secure code.
