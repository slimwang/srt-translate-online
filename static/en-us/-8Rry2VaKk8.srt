1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:02,790
Now how is this a function?

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:07,190
Well, you can think of an image as a collection of light intensities at

3
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:08,560
different locations.

4
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:13,180
For instance, this area on the shirt is pretty bright,

5
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:19,370
here this shadow is dark, and this grass somewhere in between.

6
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:22,790
Now how would you identify these different locations?

7
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:27,390
Note that these locations are laid out in a two-dimensional space.

8
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:33,920
We can characterize it using, say an x-axis, which is the horizontal dimension,

9
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,720
and a y-axis, which is the vertical dimension.

10
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:44,250
Any location on the image can thus be specified using an x-axis value and

11
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:46,010
a y-axis value.

12
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:50,670
Notice that this x axis value can be any real number.

13
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:52,130
Similarly for y.

14
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:59,500
Now the image intensity at the position x, y can be written as f of x, y.

15
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:02,890
And that's how you can think of the image as a function.

16
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:05,670
Now what about the intensity values in the image?

17
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:10,010
If we assume that they are real numbers than we can say that

18
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:15,080
f is a mapping from R cross R, or R square, to R.

19
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:19,640
Now this definition seems to indicate that images are infinitely large, but

20
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:25,100
practically speaking, images have a finite size, they have a certain width and

21
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:26,450
a certain height.

22
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:29,390
Assuming that our coordinate origin is here,

23
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:33,110
we can define numerical bounds for the image.

24
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:41,310
For instance, 10 to 210 n the x-axis, and say, 15 to 165 along the y-axis.

25
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:46,890
We also know that image intensity values have a finite range.

26
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:50,730
Say in this image, they range from zero through ten.

27
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:52,930
Given these finite ranges.

28
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:56,190
How would you define this image as a function?

29
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:59,870
Complete the function definition above by filling in the boxes.

30
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:04,880
Note that the first pair of boxes is the range of column values.

31
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:09,690
The second set of boxes represents the range of rows, or y values.

32
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:14,020
And finally, the third set of boxes represent the image in density range.
