1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,750
All right, so where should we add diff?

2
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:06,600
Diff is clearly related to both Git and commit, and, and

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:09,650
also to version control more indirectly.

4
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:13,230
But like we said, we don't want to add all these second-order connections, so

5
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:15,220
let's just connect it with commit.

6
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:19,017
The relationship between diff and commit isn't really type-of or

7
00:00:19,017 --> 00:00:21,450
part-of, so we'll need a new color for it.

8
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:23,050
Since diff takes two commits and

9
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:26,900
compares them, we're going to call this the operates-on relationship.
