The answer is that the blue box should appear inside the red box,

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:07,410
because the context for a function will always be created as

3
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:10,430
a child of the context that it was defined within.

4
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:13,680
A simple way to think about this is that the word foil should be

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,990
allowed to appear inside the body of this function because it's

6
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:19,150
a variable from the surrounding context.

7
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:22,870
It wouldn't make sense if this blue box appeared in the green box,

8
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:25,990
because that would mean it had no access to the foil variable.
