00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Let's now talk about the second part of this lesson called PID control.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
PID control is a vast field in control, and many, many classes can be taught about this one subject matter.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
What I'll do is I'll give you the very basics, and I'll let you implement the very basics.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I promise it'll be fun.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
You'll be able to drive a car around, and the Google car to the present day uses a version

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
of this exact same controller that is, of course, much more tuned the specifics of our car.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
But you get to see some of the essence of what it means to control a car.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Here is the problem. Consider the following car with a steerable front axle and 2 non-steerable wheels in the back.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Say we wished this car to drive along this line, which is the output of our smoother we just discussed.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Let's assume the car has a fixed forward velocity,

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
but you have the ability to set the steering angle of the car. How would you do this?

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
You would keep the steering constant?

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
You would use random steering commands?

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Or you could set the steering angle in proportion to what's known as the "crosstrack error,"

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
which is the lateral distance between the vehicle and the so-called reference trajectory.

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:11,000
The third possibility is steer in proportion to the this crosstrack error or CTE.

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Choose one of those that you think is best suited to control the car.
