00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,285
Okay.

2
00:00:00,289 --> 00:00:04,406
What I want you to do is come up with the area of each of these squares. So,

3
00:00:04,418 --> 00:00:08,435
find the area of this square, this square and then, this square has four

4
00:00:08,447 --> 00:00:12,791
different regions. I want you to find the area of each one. So, for example, to

5
00:00:12,803 --> 00:00:17,109
find the area of this part, I know that this side is 5 and I know that this side

6
00:00:17,121 --> 00:00:21,808
is the same as this side, which is same as this side. So, 5 times 5, or 25. You

7
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:27,275
multiply the sides of a rectangle or a square to get the area. Go ahead, fill in

8
00:00:27,287 --> 00:00:28,520
these other areas.
