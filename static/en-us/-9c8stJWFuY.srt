00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,290
Okay, let's take a look at the code.

2
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:05,750
So now I'm looking at
the my application class.

3
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:09,790
I have a couple of extra imports for
tag manager and container holder.

4
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:13,270
The variables to hold the container
holder and the tag manager.

5
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:16,100
Method to get the tag manager,
fairly simple.

6
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:17,430
Check if it already exists.

7
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:20,590
If not, get instance to create it and
then return it.

8
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:23,930
And then we have simple setter and
getter methods to set and

9
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:25,950
get the container holder.

10
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:29,880
Now, over in main activity,
again we have some imports.

11
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,729
We need to import PendingResult,
ResultCallback, ContainerHolder,

12
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:33,872
TagManager.

13
00:00:33,872 --> 00:00:37,220
and Oncreate I call
load GTM container and

14
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:42,050
here in GTM container I get
the TagManager instance.

15
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:46,180
I load the container, I set
the callback on the pending result.

16
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:49,585
I deal with the failure or
in this case I punt that to later.

17
00:00:49,585 --> 00:00:52,195
I refresh the container holder.

18
00:00:52,195 --> 00:00:55,575
I store the container holder,
calling setContainerHolder.

19
00:00:55,575 --> 00:00:59,125
I set a timeout of two seconds for
the container to load.
