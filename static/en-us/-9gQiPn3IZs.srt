00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,480
Now that we know what
bipartite graphs and

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:06,580
matching are, let's consider where that
problem of finding a maximum matching

3
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:10,100
in a bipartite graph comes up
in real world applications.

4
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:13,660
Actually, we'll make this a quiz, where
I give you some problem descriptions,

5
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:17,170
and you tell me which can be cast
as a maximum matching problems,

6
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:19,480
in bipartite graphs naturally.

7
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:23,350
Don't worry about whether or
not there's some complicated reduction.

8
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:26,610
First, consider the compatible
roommate problem.

9
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:30,360
Here some set of individuals give
a list of habits and preferences, and

10
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:33,060
for each pair we decide
if they're compatible.

11
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:34,900
Then we want to match roommates so

12
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:38,150
as to get a maximum number
of compatible roommates.

13
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:41,450
Next, consider the problem of
assigning taxis to customers, so

14
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:44,240
as to minimize the total pick up time.

15
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:47,280
Imagine that you're a taxi
dispatcher service.

16
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,010
Another application is
assigning professors to

17
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:52,740
classes that they
are qualified to teach.

18
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:55,940
Obviously, we hope to offer
all the classes that we want.

19
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:58,810
And lastly, consider matching
organ donors to patients,

20
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:01,580
who are likely to be able
to accept the transplant.

21
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:04,379
Of course we want to be able to do
as many transplants as possible.
