1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,360
For the first requirement, concerning illegal moves,

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,280
that's part of the functionality of the system.

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:06,910
So your answer should be F.

4
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:08,570
However, the second requirement,

5
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:12,350
that the system should respond within five seconds, is non-functional.

6
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:14,130
It's not what the system is computing, but

7
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:18,400
it's how or with what quality the system is doing the computing.

8
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,980
Third, the system should be written in Java.

9
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:24,870
Once again, this is a non-functional requirement and the fourth one,

10
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:28,930
the system should allow the user to use either an X or an O, that's functional.

11
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:31,200
That's part of what the system actually computes.
