1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,200
To help us understand filtering a little bit let's actually not just look at

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:03,890
box filters.

3
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:06,840
And here, I'm going to actually use a Gaussian filter.

4
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:07,689
A Gaussian filter,

5
00:00:07,689 --> 00:00:12,220
based on the equation of a Gaussian, it can be used to generate a kernel.

6
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:16,030
Now in this case, the kernel in this is, is still 21 by 21.

7
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:19,460
But, the values are normal distribution.

8
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:23,030
So you notice, more bright values or higher values here.

9
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:25,640
And as I go away from the center, they get darker.

10
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:28,280
In the height map we have looking at this,

11
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,220
you will see this to be a little different.

12
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:33,250
So now if we're for example notice, that there is a peak.

13
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:36,020
And then there are values, in this one.

14
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:38,040
Most intensity is here.

15
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,760
Lower ones almost zero here.

16
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,900
And now we want to actually look at this.

17
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:47,700
And apply this, as a kernel to do, smoothing or filtering operations.

18
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,220
So let's take our example again and

19
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:51,460
now this time around I'll apply the Gaussian Filter.

20
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,380
Which basically is again, shown by this 21 by 21.

21
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:58,600
Look at the values that we just saw in the previous slide.

22
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:02,590
And applied here, you see a result which is also smooth.

23
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:05,360
But here you might be able to notice that some of the edges have

24
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,590
a little bit more detail.

25
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:11,210
Again primarily because it's in the linear combination.

26
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:14,710
It's attribute weight is it's giving more weight to the pixel,

27
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:18,610
at the center and actually is giving more value to that, and less value in

28
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:21,940
the linear combination to the values that are away from the center.

29
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:24,420
So as we rub it, it tries to give more values or

30
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:30,180
more, more detail at the level, where the center is.

31
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:31,440
Just for comparison's sake,

32
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:34,670
I'd like to show you both these results next to each other.

33
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:36,480
Hopefully your video resolution is good enough for

34
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:40,690
you to see that this looks a little bit more blurrier than this one.

35
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:43,860
Just for sake of completeness we're going to zoom into to see some more detail.

36
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:46,320
Here is the zoom region that I've chosen.

37
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,988
Where the stem of this pepper is the one we want to focus on.

38
00:01:49,988 --> 00:01:54,070
Zooming in, you will see that this one is much more blurred, and

39
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:55,830
actually just flattened out.

40
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:59,810
While in this case, you'll see a little bit more of detail.

41
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:04,190
Now of course, it's not very like the median filter we had looked at before.

42
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:06,500
But Gaussian filter basically is just a different kernel.

43
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:09,620
And you can see other details also which are completely lost
