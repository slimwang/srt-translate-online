1
00:00:00,002 --> 00:00:04,110
We just saw that in computer science, you might write a function like this.

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:08,380
First we name the function, in this case we named our function decrease by 3.

3
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:12,538
Then we create a spot for the input, which we call x and put it in parentheses,

4
00:00:12,538 --> 00:00:17,194
and then we define what the output is going to be with this return statement.

5
00:00:17,195 --> 00:00:22,353
And then we write the output right here, x minus 3. But as you've probably come

6
00:00:22,353 --> 00:00:26,684
to realize over the course of this class, some people who do math a lot are a

7
00:00:26,684 --> 00:00:31,579
little bit lazier, like me. For one thing, in math, the name of the function is

8
00:00:31,579 --> 00:00:36,435
not usually nearly as inventive as it is in computer science. We can see that a

9
00:00:36,435 --> 00:00:40,659
programmer would call a function something like this, decrease by three, that

10
00:00:40,659 --> 00:00:44,634
really describes what the function's doing. In math though, our names for

11
00:00:44,634 --> 00:00:49,250
functions are really simple. In fact, the most common one is probably just the

12
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:54,269
letter f. What programmers and mathematicians do in common however, is that they

13
00:00:54,269 --> 00:00:59,100
still use the parentheses around what's going to be the input for the function.

14
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:03,340
And of course, x does seem like a pretty great input. Now the programmer has a

15
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:08,092
return statement, that represents what the output of this function's going to

16
00:01:08,092 --> 00:01:12,634
be, only around the program. But in math, we just create an equation. So if we

17
00:01:12,634 --> 00:01:18,202
want to create the decrease by three equation in math instead, we just write f

18
00:01:18,202 --> 00:01:22,852
of x equals x minus 3. The output is just that expression that we've often seen

19
00:01:22,852 --> 00:01:26,944
written to describe the deep ended variable, showing how it depends on the

20
00:01:26,944 --> 00:01:31,568
independent variable. Now the way that we read the left hand side of this

21
00:01:31,568 --> 00:01:36,713
equation right here is we say f of x. Now again, just like in programming, the

22
00:01:36,713 --> 00:01:41,987
parentheses here around the input do not mean multiplication. So the output of

23
00:01:41,987 --> 00:01:46,648
the function, the thing that's just equal to x minus 3, is this f of x over

24
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:50,989
here. And remember we used to say that the output was y, if the input was x. So,

25
00:01:50,989 --> 00:01:56,684
what we're really doing in functions is replacing the independent variable, y,

26
00:01:56,684 --> 00:02:01,480
with this new way of writing it, f of x. I think you'll see over time why this

27
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:05,676
is a useful way of writing it. But it doesn't make the original way we learned

28
00:02:05,676 --> 00:02:08,948
any less valid. They're just different ways of expressing pretty similar things,

29
00:02:08,948 --> 00:02:12,646
assuming that this is a function. Now that you've seen how both computer science

30
00:02:12,646 --> 00:02:16,738
and mathematics would represent the same function in different ways, I'd like

31
00:02:16,738 --> 00:02:20,706
you to translate the first function that we talked about from Python into its

32
00:02:20,706 --> 00:02:24,670
mathematical form. So this is the function that we initially called Increase By

33
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:29,876
Two. I'd like the input to be x, and the output to be x plus two. I'd also like

34
00:02:29,876 --> 00:02:34,910
you to name the function f. So just like we did up here, write the mathematical

35
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:37,703
form of the function down in this red box.
