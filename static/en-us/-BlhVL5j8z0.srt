1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,310
So the first one seems tempting.

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:03,500
You have these values.

3
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:05,450
Why not use them directly?

4
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:08,560
But note that these are just
likelihoods of observing x.

5
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:12,310
They are missing prior probabilities.

6
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:14,430
The probability that our random pixel,

7
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:19,410
regardless of its value,
is a skin pixel or not, is important.

8
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:20,730
Take this image for example.

9
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:27,190
All these pixels on the face and
on the neck are skin pixels.

10
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:28,270
But as you can see,

11
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:32,659
this is a really small area
compared to the total image area.

12
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:34,570
If this is all the data that we had,

13
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:39,206
then the prior probability of a pixel
being skin pixel would be pretty low.

14
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:41,733
Say around 0.2.

15
00:00:41,733 --> 00:00:46,660
The sum of this and the prior
probability of not skin must sum to one.

16
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:50,520
So therefore that value would be 0.8.

17
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,480
These two values must be multiplied
on their respective sides

18
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,500
to weight the likelihoods.

19
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:59,250
All of a sudden,
the distinction is not as clear.

20
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:02,480
Okay, so the first one is not enough.

21
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,420
The second choice is
exactly what we're after.

22
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:09,230
If we find that the probability of skin
given x is greater than the probability

23
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:10,930
of not skin given x,

24
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:15,010
then we have no reason not to
believe that it is a skin pixel.

25
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:17,165
Well, that was clear.

26
00:01:17,165 --> 00:01:21,110
Okay, the third choice is exactly
the same as the first one, except,

27
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:22,765
we have the prior's multiplied.

28
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:26,650
So yes, this is a valid condition.

29
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:28,520
You'll see why shortly.

30
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:31,020
The last one is a little less useful.

31
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:34,260
In fact,
it's the same as the second form but

32
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:37,740
with P of x multiplied on both sides.

33
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:42,090
Okay, if it's the same as the second
then I guess it's also valid, but

34
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:42,780
not too useful.
