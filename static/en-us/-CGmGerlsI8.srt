00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,564
You may have noticed that the symmetric, so what happens on the left is

2
00:00:03,564 --> 00:00:08,432
reversed on the right. In the first region, we see the graph starts off at the

3
00:00:08,432 --> 00:00:12,275
horizontal asymptote y equals 0, and rises to the vertical asymptote of x

4
00:00:12,275 --> 00:00:18,238
equals 3. We can also say it is increasing at the y-value of each point, as we

5
00:00:18,238 --> 00:00:23,567
move right, is greater than the y-value of the point before. In the last

6
00:00:23,567 --> 00:00:28,128
region, it's the opposite. It starts at the vertical asymptote and falls to the

7
00:00:28,128 --> 00:00:32,822
horizontal one, this means it's decreasing. At x equals 3, we have an

8
00:00:32,822 --> 00:00:37,681
asymptote. And the curve to the right of that rises from negative infinity up

9
00:00:37,681 --> 00:00:41,965
to the maximum that you found in the question before at 3.5 comma negative 4,

10
00:00:41,965 --> 00:00:46,589
before falling again towards negative infinity as it approaches the asymptote x

11
00:00:46,589 --> 00:00:50,123
equals 4.
