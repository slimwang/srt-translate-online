1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,009
I will solve objective
three in this next video,

2
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:07,273
by creating a webpage when the user
visits localhost:/8080/restaurants/new.

3
00:00:07,273 --> 00:00:09,900
This page will contain a form
that a user can fill out

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,370
to create a new restaurant.

5
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:13,790
The form will then send a post
request to the server, and

6
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:16,020
create a new restaurant
entry in the database.

7
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:18,590
Once you've attempted this challenge,
proceed to the solution video.
