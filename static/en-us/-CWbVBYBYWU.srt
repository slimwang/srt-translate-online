00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,012
Hi, I'm here again with Scott Murray.

2
00:00:02,012 --> 00:00:04,910
And when you think about the future of data visualization what are you

3
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:05,760
most excited about?

4
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:09,290
>> Can I start with what I'm not excited about?

5
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:10,226
>> Yeah.

6
00:00:10,226 --> 00:00:13,611
>> Not excited about more tools, more data.

7
00:00:13,611 --> 00:00:16,242
That's like, usually I think what people are excited about, but

8
00:00:16,242 --> 00:00:19,090
it's like every week some new tool gets announced.

9
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:22,750
And every week, you know, some government releases and some new data set and

10
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:25,220
like, it's all very good, but it can just be so

11
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:27,485
overwhelming, I think especially for people who are new.

12
00:00:27,485 --> 00:00:31,560
>> Mm-hm. >> So I have to say, on one hand, I'm excited about that.

13
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:35,115
And on the other hand I'm like, not very excited about that.

14
00:00:35,115 --> 00:00:40,377
I guess what I am excited about is having better resources for

15
00:00:40,377 --> 00:00:45,370
new people, and, and having like all, so much excitement.

16
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:48,652
Like just, just getting these new people into the field.

17
00:00:48,652 --> 00:00:51,910
because kind of like I was saying earlier,

18
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:56,480
like everybody brings their own experience, and it's been, you know?

19
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,588
I think visualization actually has this really long history, but

20
00:01:00,588 --> 00:01:05,500
it's sort of because it's kind of blowing up in this whole new way just recently

21
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:10,701
like with this convergence of, of open data, and tools, and open source, and

22
00:01:10,701 --> 00:01:15,869
all the sort of things you need to practice at getting more and more accessible.

23
00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:18,558
Plus of course kind of the, the, the buzzwords of big data and

24
00:01:18,558 --> 00:01:20,390
like all the stuff we're excited about.

25
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:23,731
So, all these things have converged to make this like a really hot

26
00:01:23,731 --> 00:01:25,464
exciting field right now.

27
00:01:25,464 --> 00:01:30,677
Which is great, but I think we forget that there's this whole history.

28
00:01:30,677 --> 00:01:34,958
You know, of this field and that this, this history is related to kind of

29
00:01:34,958 --> 00:01:39,280
representations of information before we started calling it data vis.

30
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,999
And it goes back to, to design and like how we evolved written language, and

31
00:01:43,999 --> 00:01:47,554
you know, hieroglyphics and all this, all this stuff.

32
00:01:47,554 --> 00:01:51,709
So I think, kind of in the, the early days in this new resurgence of

33
00:01:51,709 --> 00:01:56,683
data visualization, practice was limited to kind of some academics, and

34
00:01:56,683 --> 00:02:01,359
then a handful of, of really specialized design firms but now it's,

35
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:03,686
it's much, much bigger than that.

36
00:02:03,686 --> 00:02:04,458
So we have lots of people.

37
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:07,943
We have people internal at companies who just do data vis for that company.

38
00:02:07,943 --> 00:02:10,560
We have more and more of these kind of

39
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,100
boutique design firms that do kind of data design, data visualization.

40
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:17,532
We have existing firms like design firms,

41
00:02:17,532 --> 00:02:20,768
graphic design who are getting into doing data.

42
00:02:20,768 --> 00:02:25,346
And so, and then of course we have like students, and academics, and just kind

43
00:02:25,346 --> 00:02:29,370
of people who don't fit into any of those categories who are practising.

44
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:33,260
So I think that's really really exciting, but it's also,

45
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:38,100
like I said, challenge for us because we have the existing books, and

46
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:43,710
resources, and things are great, but not totally adequate because they,

47
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:47,500
they address kind of different audiences in, in that vain.

48
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:51,020
Edward Tufte's books are fantastic, but, like he's a statistician, and

49
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:53,130
they're coming from this one point of view.

50
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:56,060
And I, I still recommend the books to everyone, but

51
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:01,930
they don't address all of the latest kind of developments in interactive design.

52
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:05,200
And, what does this mean translating these ideas to a mobile experience?

53
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:09,750
What does this mean translating this idea to a dashboard or a billboard, or

54
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,200
you know, something in advertisement?

55
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,853
So, there're all kinds of these new considerations, and

56
00:03:14,853 --> 00:03:19,529
I guess I'm, I'm excited about us sort of together gradually figuring out

57
00:03:19,529 --> 00:03:22,250
ways to address all those considerations.

58
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:26,350
>> What are you most excited about when you think about the future of

59
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:27,820
data visualization?

60
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:32,280
>> I think what we're most excited about at Plotley and

61
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:37,720
we think a lot about, is what it would be like to be able to have massive,

62
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:44,460
worldwide collaboration in doing data analysis and graphing?

63
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:46,985
And so, a big part of what we thought about for

64
00:03:46,985 --> 00:03:49,740
Plotley, is making everything web-ready.

65
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:52,260
So, if you already know, let's say,

66
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:58,040
MatLab, or you're really good at using Excel, we don't think that

67
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:02,890
it makes a lot of sense for you to also have to learn how to do web development.

68
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:05,900
So we've tried to make it so it's really easy to keep using the tools that

69
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:10,490
you're using, but then being able to get a web and

70
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:14,832
collaboration layer for sharing your work with people from any language

71
00:04:14,832 --> 00:04:20,160
who are using any different type of technology, any different data type.

72
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,850
And so it can really kind of be a translation layer, because if you have

73
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:30,230
really sophisticated, let's say, political scientists, and engineers, and

74
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:35,370
data scientists, who are all able to collaborate between their respective

75
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:39,870
preferred development languages, and tools, and able to discuss things, and

76
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:45,790
make reproducible graphs, and data, and work on massive research projects.

77
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:48,790
We really hope that it would be able to further, you know,

78
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:53,730
science and collaboration in really any field.

79
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:56,575
You know, so we've thought about what if folks from NASA

80
00:04:56,575 --> 00:05:00,320
were streaming flight data and showing live satellite data.

81
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,420
What if groups that were doing research on cancer were able to share their resu,

82
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:05,826
results with the world, so

83
00:05:05,826 --> 00:05:09,755
anyone can reproduce their work and get involved with what they're doing?

84
00:05:09,755 --> 00:05:14,075
So experts can collaborate naturally even if they didn't necessarily plan to do

85
00:05:14,075 --> 00:05:15,390
so from the beginning.

86
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:19,550
Because if you make data, and if you make graphs, and you make tools available,

87
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:22,860
and free, and easy to use, we think there's a lot of power behind that.
