1
00:00:00,006 --> 00:00:02,905
Couple things to show you ,first let
me just show you this kind of works.

2
00:00:02,905 --> 00:00:07,840
Allright, here's some optic flow results
taken from a computer vision class 2003

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:09,973
from a actually it's a tutorial.

4
00:00:09,973 --> 00:00:14,750
Here listed on the bottom and you can
see that when you run loops at the,

5
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:19,070
on that front tree without kermits,
you get sort of terrible results and

6
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:22,350
while when you run it with the pyramid
you get a much better result.

7
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:25,000
And our goal is to really
get that much better result.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,460
But before we can do this we have
to talk a little bit more about

9
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:28,580
multiple scale.

10
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:30,450
So we been having all this
multiple scale stuff.

11
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:33,010
Now this isn't going to surprise
you that it relates to some of

12
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:37,160
the aliasing stuff and frequency
stuff that we talked about, oh God,

13
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:39,700
sounds like, found,
feels like months ago.

14
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:42,010
It's probably months ago.

15
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:43,040
I have no idea when it was.

16
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,000
Anyway when we were talking about
Fourier analysis in different scale.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,210
And what we're going to do now is take
a little detour through multi scale and

18
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:51,345
then we'll come back to Lucas and
Canoti.

19
00:00:51,345 --> 00:00:54,280
Allright, so,
we talked about aliasing, and

20
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:58,130
now I want to show you aliasing in,
in terms of image sub-sampling, okay?

21
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:00,470
So image sub-sampling is what,
we talked about it,

22
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:02,630
you just throw away
some number of pixels.

23
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:04,730
So here we have a a nice,

24
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:07,580
I sure hope it's in public domain,
picture by Van Gogh.

25
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:09,190
This is one where you can see his ear.

26
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:11,560
So on the other side,
I guess, there's no ear.

27
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:12,320
You know about that, right?

28
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,820
I'm going to assume you have
some experience with Van Gogh.

29
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:15,470
Anyway, okay, fine.

30
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:18,400
So, the picture on the left is
original picture where I've

31
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,290
thrown away every sample.

32
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:20,220
Maybe you can't tell.

33
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:22,000
Picture in the middle I've thrown away.

34
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,480
Every other sample, again,
both horizontally and vertically.

35
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,760
The picture on the right,
I've done it again.

36
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,890
Eve, I can tell, you probably
can't tell, I can tell it's,

37
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:30,380
kind of, looking kind of crummy.

38
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:34,560
And, in fact, if I blow up that
picture on the right, I see this.

39
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,630
Okay?

40
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:41,160
And what you're seeing here, the, the
junk that's in here is caused by this,

41
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:45,710
this aliasing, like just what we talked
about last time and, when I zoom it

42
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:49,250
back up, you can see that you've brought
these high-frequencies in there and

43
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:53,160
there's all this stuff in here that
just doesn't seem like it's the blurry

44
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:56,340
version of what was in the original and
that's because it's not.

45
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:58,240
It's an aliased example.

46
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,190
So, how do we handle aliasing?

47
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:02,030
What we talked about this last time.

48
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:05,730
What we have to do is we have
to filter and then sub sample.

49
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:09,090
So what I've done now is I've taken a
small Gaussian smoothing in the original

50
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:10,110
sub sampled.

51
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:12,120
Then smooth it again and sub sample.

52
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,780
Then smooth it again and sub sample.

53
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:18,570
And now when I blow it back up you'll
notice that the Gaussian sample then

54
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:23,060
that actually looks like a blurred
version of the thing on the left.

55
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:25,560
Okay, and that's because I
haven't done any aliasing.

56
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,620
So to do this multi-scale
stuff the right way,

57
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:30,550
I have to sort of do this blurring and
subsampling.
