1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Look closely--both axis are logarithmic and you can see as the step size increases by a factor of 10,

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
the error increases by a factor of 10⁵.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Remember, forward Euler was of order 1, Heun was of order 2. This is the solver of order 5.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Read this the other way around as you shrink the step size by a factor of 10,

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
the error decreases by a factor of 10⁵--that's a huge gain and you can see that this solver,

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
when it takes steps of 3 minutes around earth gets back to where it started within just millimeters.

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
This is quite an efficient method. It's called the Runge-Kotta feedback method.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Now assume that with all these strange numbers we mistyped one--

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:54,000
mainly we didn't enter 56,430 but we entered 56,431.

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Let's look at the result. This doesn't look that great anymore.

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
We've got an error that's well above 1 km, so getting these numbers right,

12
00:01:01,000 --> 99:59:59,999
which among other things belong to verification.
