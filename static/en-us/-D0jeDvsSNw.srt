As an aspiring entrepreneur,

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:06,060
there are number of terms that you'll
need to be intimately familiar with.

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:10,533
Throughout the course, we'll help you
talk the talk of a business owner in

4
00:00:10,533 --> 00:00:12,743
these short Terms to Know segments.

5
00:00:12,743 --> 00:00:17,312
We'll start with the basics,
profit versus revenue.

6
00:00:17,312 --> 00:00:21,470
Now, we've already spoken a bit about
the differences between the two.

7
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:25,620
Revenue is the total amount of
money your company collects.

8
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:28,952

00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:39,330
If you're a business that maybe makes
a lot of money, but maybe your expenses

12
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:43,880
and operating costs are eclipsing that,
you can still go under.

13
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:49,313
Now, there are even further distinctions
between types of profit, gross and net.

14
00:00:49,313 --> 00:00:51,771
These terms are some of
the most easily confused for

15
00:00:51,771 --> 00:00:53,436
those new to the world of finance.
