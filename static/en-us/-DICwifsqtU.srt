1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:03,950
And to show you exactly what's going
on here, I have a little scene.

2
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:05,580
I've taken the images,
tried to animate them so

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:07,000
you can see what's happening, okay?

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,780
So here's a very sort of ugly scene.

5
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:12,890
It's sort of color coded
by certain regions.

6
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:14,390
That doesn't really matter.

7
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:17,680
What matters is the camera now
is going to move to the right.

8
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,250
All right, it's a posterized co,
color scene so you, so

9
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:22,330
you can see these things
stand up a little better.

10
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:26,680
Right, so that's image one,
that's image two, that's image three,

11
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:27,290
that's image four.

12
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:30,600
So going backwards, so
the camera's moving to the right and

13
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:34,560
of course, the, it's not a Rubik's cube,
whatever kind of horrible evil,

14
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:38,550
diabolical puzzle that is moving to
the left faster cause it's closer.

15
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:41,300
So if I were to take all those
images and build a cube of them,

16
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:42,850
this is that same cube, okay?

17
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:47,040
So here we have X and Y, and
we stack them in time this way.

18
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,410
And here's just the top of them.

19
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:52,380
And I'm just going to take a slice,
one of the slices through there, and

20
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:53,300
that looks like that.

21
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:57,100
So now it's at a fixed y value.

22
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:02,320
This is X, and this is time,
and here are my streaks again.

23
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,120
Okay.

24
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,940
And notice that some of these streaks,
okay,

25
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:10,791
move at different slopes.

26
00:01:10,791 --> 00:01:16,956
Those slopes correspond to
the depth of the scene.

27
00:01:16,956 --> 00:01:21,610
And what's kind of cool about this
is it's really easy to find these

28
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:23,281
kinds of lines, okay?

29
00:01:23,281 --> 00:01:27,751
And you can find lines that intersect
that, that aren't parallel to the other

30
00:01:27,751 --> 00:01:31,490
lines, and so you can use that to
pull out the object, all right.

31
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:34,670
This is called EPI, EPI, image analysis.

32
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:39,535
And you can use that in some other ways
also, so I think one of the coolest ones

33
00:01:39,535 --> 00:01:45,580
I ever saw was done by in the same
some we spoke about before.

34
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:48,190
Again, now almost 20 years ago,

35
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:51,540
they had a scene where you had
people just walking past you.

36
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:53,170
Okay.
And imagine you've now got

37
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:54,860
a volume of video.

38
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:55,870
Okay, and you stack that up.

39
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:59,610
And now I'm just going to show you
some chunks taken from, sort of,

40
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:04,040
the top, the, the head area,
and then by, down by the feet.

41
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:11,120
At the area that is really at the very
top here, nothing changes in the camera.

42
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:17,387
So, as time goes this way,
the pixels stay constant, okay?

43
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:21,653
But at the slice where their heads are,
okay.

44
00:02:21,653 --> 00:02:24,280
You see these lines there,
the, these regions here?

45
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:31,150
That's the movement of their
heads through spacetime.

46
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:34,020
That's what this volume is,
it's spacetime, right.

47
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:39,760
And so each one of these diagonal
lines is the movement of their heads.

48
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:44,560
And these straight lines here,
what are those?

49
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,422
Those are just the background
just like up here.

50
00:02:47,422 --> 00:02:50,406
Those, when things don't move, right?

51
00:02:50,406 --> 00:02:55,148
And the camera's moving, these, the, the
pixel value in time stays the same so

52
00:02:55,148 --> 00:02:57,770
it's just a straight, ray and spacetime.

53
00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:01,810
But if they're moving then you
see them moving across in time.

54
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:05,050
Now the really cool thing is what
happens if you look at their feet.

55
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:09,588
Right?
So if I look down at this level, okay?

56
00:03:09,588 --> 00:03:12,258
Here's what the spacetime
image looks like.

57
00:03:12,258 --> 00:03:13,980
And you see this braided pattern?

58
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:20,380
That braided pattern is
the movement of their feet in time.

59
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:22,270
In fact, they even published a paper,

60
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:25,130
here's just some images taken
of it showing the same thing,

61
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:28,000
the slice through the head and
the slice through the, the feet.

62
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,550
And what they were able to show, and
here it's just sort of lined up,

63
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:35,670
is that you could actually recognize who
the person was with a small sample set

64
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:38,070
by just tracking that braid, all right.

65
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:41,990
So look, if not how you would do
gate recognition in a really good

66
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:44,300
discriminative way and things like that.

67
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:47,280
But it's an example of showing
you the data structures

68
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,320
that you can get from processing video.
