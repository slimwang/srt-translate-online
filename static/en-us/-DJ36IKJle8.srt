We can factor an a from ax and ay so we have a times x plus y. We can also

2
00:00:04,943 --> 00:00:10,345
factor a 2 from 2x and 2y. So we'll have plus 2 times x plus y. And notice if we

3
00:00:10,345 --> 00:00:15,688
were to just distribute we'd get back with what we started with. But in this

4
00:00:15,688 --> 00:00:21,339
line there's something incredible happening. This would be one term made up of

5
00:00:21,339 --> 00:00:26,854
two factors a times x plus y. This would be another term made up of two factors,

6
00:00:26,854 --> 00:00:31,742
2 and x plus y. So do you see it? What's the common factor for each of these

00:00:31,742 --> 00:00:33,880
terms? Write your answer here.
