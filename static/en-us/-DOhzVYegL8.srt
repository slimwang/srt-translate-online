make forms faster and better.

00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:07,500
>> You applied the principles
of short forms.

00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,370
You didn't ask for
redundant information.

00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:10,230
You simplified.

00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:11,590
You gave feedback.

00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:13,879
And you tried out location
services to help with addresses.

Now it is on to the next lesson
where you'll focus on touch.

are incredibly important so

00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:25,750
we want to create touch
interaction that users will love.
