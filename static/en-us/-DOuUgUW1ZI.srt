00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hey, welcome back.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Now, as we've said, this class is all about managing complexity.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Now many types of software manage complexity

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
by trying to artificially rule out any type of uncertainty.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
That is, say you have a checkbook-balancing program,

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
and it says you've got to enter the exact amount.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
You've got to say $39.27.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
You can't say, oh I don't know about $40.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
It's easier to write programs that deal that way, but it constrains what you can do.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
So, in this unit we're going to learn about how the laws of probability

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
can allow you to deal with uncertainty in your programs.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Now, the truly amazing thing is that you can allow uncertainty

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
and what you know about the world, or what's true right now

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
and uncertainty in your actions,

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
if the program does something, what happens next?

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Even though both of those are uncertain you can still use the laws of probability

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
to calculate what it means to do the right thing.

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
That is, we can have clarity of action.

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
We can know exactly what the best thing to do is

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
even though we're uncertain about what's going to happen.

21
00:01:08,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So follow with this unit, and we'll learn how to do that.
