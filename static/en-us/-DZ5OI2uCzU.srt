1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,759
congratulations you've built neural

2
00:00:02,759 --> 00:00:04,080
networks from scratch

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,450
you've mastered tensorflow and now we're

4
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:07,889
going to show you how to build and train

5
00:00:07,889 --> 00:00:10,199
a multi-layer convolutional neural

6
00:00:10,199 --> 00:00:13,500
network in even fewer lines of code in

7
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,269
this lesson we'll be introducing an

8
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:17,368
interface that sits on top of tensorflow

9
00:00:17,368 --> 00:00:19,829
and allows you to draw on the power of

10
00:00:19,829 --> 00:00:22,170
tensorflow with far more concise code

11
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:24,480
that's right in this lesson you'll be

12
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,518
building a deep neural network using a

13
00:00:26,518 --> 00:00:28,170
new set of tools you'll still have

14
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:30,089
tensorflow under the hood but with an

15
00:00:30,089 --> 00:00:31,500
interface that makes testing and

16
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:37,730
prototyping much faster
