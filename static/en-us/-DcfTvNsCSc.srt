2
00:00:05,524 --> 00:00:08,640
So let me make sure I
have this straight, Doc.

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:12,810
Once we have correctly set up
the model notifications and

4
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:18,110
delegates, whenever we modify any
managed objects, the views just sync up?

5
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:19,460
>> That's it, Marty.

6
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:22,200
The delegate,
the NSFetchResultsController, and

7
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:25,020
the notifications do all the work for
us.

8
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:26,630
>> That's fantastic, Doc!

9
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:27,950
So now that we've
implemented all this for

10
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:32,270
the Messages app, we can go back to the
future and recover my last algorithm.

11
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:32,770
>> Hold it, Marty.

12
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:34,790
We're forgetting one thing.

13
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:37,500
>> What's that, Doc?

14
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,582
Aren't we creating new objects and
letting everything sync up?

15
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:44,840
>> Yes, Marty but
that's all in volatile memory!

16
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:48,890
All this setting and
managing our object models is nice, but

17
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:53,200
if we're not saving to disk,
we're not persisting, Marty.

18
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,755
Come on Marty, let's go to XCode.
