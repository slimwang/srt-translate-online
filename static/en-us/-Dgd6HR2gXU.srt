00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
For last year's weight, or the x axis, your mean estimate was 81.2.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm very flattered to report for this year on average after outlier removal

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
you believe my weight went down.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:19,000
The standard deviation for x was 10.6, and the same for y is 9.34.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Finally, I'll give you the mean of the following mixed product,

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
the difference from the original axis and the x bar, the mean,

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
times the same for y.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
This looks an awful lot like a variance, but it's between two different variables.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
We call this a covariance or "cov" between two variables x and y.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
In our example, the numerical value for the covariance is 75.36.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Using the covariance it is amazingly easy now to calculate the correlation r.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
We just divide it by the two standard deviations for x and y.

13
00:00:53,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Please give me that number.
