1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:02,510
So with hiring it can be a mixed bag.

2
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:05,470
You could randomly reach out to
a bunch of different companies that

3
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:09,780
will sell you databases of people who
are prospectively looking for jobs and

4
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:13,560
you can sit down and rifle through
a couple of thousand resumes.

5
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:15,800
Done that, not so fun.

6
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:18,970
Or you can take advantage of your
existing social networks and

7
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:22,060
I don't mean just jumping on Facebook
and saying hey, we're hiring..

8
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:23,620
I mean press the flesh,

9
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:27,496
who do you know that is talented within
a specific skill set you're looking for?

10
00:00:27,496 --> 00:00:30,770
You know people or
you know people who know people and

11
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:33,140
reaching out through that
network is actually really,

12
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:36,020
really powerful in being able
to hire the right talent and

13
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:40,770
temperament within your company because
doing otherwise is kind of toxic.
