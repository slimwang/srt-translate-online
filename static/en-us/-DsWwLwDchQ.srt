We started off this whole lecture by showing you two examples of my two friends,

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:06,670
let's look at what happens with those two images.

3
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:10,250
Here, with the two images, while they found a lot of features,

4
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:13,030
we detected a lot of features in these two images.

5
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:17,050
But, we really wanted to find matchable features between these two,

6
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:21,290
so, the red here points out the features that are common between both of them,

7
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:24,360
and once I have those, what I can do is, match them,

8
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:28,750
and that allows me to now, bring those two images together, and

9
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:32,640
here I'm showing you basically that both those images now match, and, of course,

10
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,430
I could use this, to now create a panorama between those two images,

11
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:40,150
because what I basically, do is, align those two pixels, and do a little bit of

12
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:44,080
warping that we've talked about before to allow us to do this kind of stuff.
