1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,990
Of course, this was a bit of a simple inter quiz here. Yeah, probably that's not a good idea.

2
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:09,770
Making anybody take this course is a very good idea, but of course, actually you're

3
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:13,640
the computer scientist so you're supposed to be the one knowing about NP completeness

4
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:15,390
especially after taken this course.

5
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:17,180
You'll probably shouldn't say it's impossible.

6
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:21,430
A better answer would be to say, "It's been proven to be impossible,"

7
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:27,070
but I think that after this unit, you will agree that the best possible answer is actually to say,

8
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:31,380
"Well, it's been proven difficult or extremely difficult," but we can actually try

9
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:36,100
to solve this problem even though it is NP complete and I will show you how to approach that.

10
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:40,750
The thing is this--there's so many NP complete problems that are practically relevant

11
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:45,390
that over the past years extremely clever algorithms have been developed for these problems.

12
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:50,810
They have been developed for vertex cover, for clique, for independent set,

13
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:54,380
for the shortest tour problem, for SAT, and so on.

14
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:58,670
Knowing about these problems can really make you standout as a problem solver

15
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:03,070
because many people, as I said, will give up once they know their problem to be NP complete.

16
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:08,870
You should respect NP completeness, so maybe not be all smiling when you encounter

17
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:13,650
NP complete problems, although it's nice to know that they are happy but I don't know.

18
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:16,770
When they're solving their problem, be respectful but there's no need

19
00:01:16,770 --> 99:59:59,999
to be unhappy or scared of NP completeness.
