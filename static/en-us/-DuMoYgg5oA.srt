00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:04,130
You now have an idea of what
the continuous reply plan is,

2
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:07,220
how to set one up for your project,
and what the benefits are.

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:11,260
>> But a lot of the boxes in
the software lifecycle diagram

4
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:13,190
relate to different types of testing.

5
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:17,290
Depending on which world you come from,
they might not all be familiar to you.

6
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:20,000
Getting a product to the user
isn't particularly good

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,990
if that product has undergone
little to no testing.

8
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:26,510
>> So we'll see you in the next lesson
to talk about continuous testing.

9
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:27,510
You ready?

10
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:28,090
>> Yeah, let's go.
