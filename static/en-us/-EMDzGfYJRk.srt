1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,990
According to the Center for
Strategic and International Studies and

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:07,980
reports from various antivirus and
security companies,

3
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:12,450
the correct answer is
$100 to $500 billion.

4
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:14,780
This is a huge amount of money.

5
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:20,520
For comparison, drug trafficking
results in about $600 billion a year.

6
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:24,680
So cybercrime is in par
with drug trafficking.

7
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:27,970
And you may wonder why
such a huge number.

8
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:32,140
Now of course, this number includes
the direct financial losses,

9
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:37,350
such as when a credit card number is
stolen, or bank account is compromised.

10
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:41,370
But it also includes the cost
due to productivity loss,

11
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:46,750
such as the need to compare the computer
and systems after a cyberattack.

12
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:51,250
And it also includes losses due
to intellectual property when

13
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:52,880
valuable information is stolen.
