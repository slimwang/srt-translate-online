00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,586
As we can see from the three points we looked at first, the x-coordinate of our

2
00:00:03,586 --> 00:00:09,290
point is not going to change. It's still going to just be x. The y-coordinate

3
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:14,042
however, needs to switch signs, since we have positive y here, we need negative

4
00:00:14,042 --> 00:00:15,709
y here.
