1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,250
So in this case you have to use
the cross group transaction

2
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:06,620
because the function is changing two
different kinds of entities, profile and

3
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:07,420
conference.

4
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:10,890
Although for the conference owner those
two entities who belong to the same

5
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:13,810
group because the profile is
ancestor for a conference.

6
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:16,670
That's only the case for
the user who created the conference.

7
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:20,110
For any other user, the profile entity
and the conference entity are not

8
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:23,680
related by ancestral relationship and
therefore they belong to two different

9
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,870
entity groups and that's why
you need to use xg equals true.
