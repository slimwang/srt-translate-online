1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,067
To give you a little bit of a notion of sort of frequency and

2
00:00:02,067 --> 00:00:04,392
time, et cetera, pretty soon we're going to throw time away,

3
00:00:04,392 --> 00:00:06,174
because we're only going to be interested in space.

4
00:00:06,174 --> 00:00:09,375
But, since we're talking about how, how quickly something wiggles, and

5
00:00:09,375 --> 00:00:12,700
it originally was derived from one dimension, we'll talk about it this way.

6
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:19,770
So, here I have a signal, okay, g of t, okay, that's made up of two parts.

7
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:23,495
Okay, it's got a sinusoid of some frequency f and

8
00:00:23,495 --> 00:00:30,690
then another sinusoid of 3f but it's been scaled to make a third.

9
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:33,180
So that's this signal here and

10
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:36,790
you can write that as just the sum of these two sinusoids.

11
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:39,330
After all, that's what this equation says.

12
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:43,340
And because of linearity the stuff just sums,

13
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:45,650
the combination of two on the right gives you on the left.

14
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:49,190
And if I were to draw out sort of the contributions of

15
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:53,270
the sinusoids to the signal, it would look like this, okay?

16
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:55,770
So this is written, in this particular way.

17
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:57,430
I'm only showing you positive frequency,

18
00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:59,110
we'll talk about negative in just a minute.

19
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:04,170
But whatever f is, the idea is that the signal here has a frequency spectrum

20
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:09,340
with a certain amount of power at f, and sort of one-third of that at 3f, okay?

21
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:11,530
And this is one form of drawing out spectra.

22
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:14,260
We'll talk more about spectra in just a minute.

23
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:16,860
You'll notice that this picture on the left is sort of

24
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:21,630
kind of approximating getting towards a square wave, and it turns out that,

25
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:23,880
actually, if you really wanted a square wave,

26
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:27,890
what you do is you keep adding these odd frequencies, all right?

27
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:30,790
And I want to show you this because, sometimes, people will ask, well,

28
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:35,018
how can I get sort of a sharp boundary using just smooth sinusoids?

29
00:01:35,018 --> 00:01:37,160
So here we have our original picture.

30
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:40,705
And now I take that original one and I add in something that wiggles at

31
00:01:40,705 --> 00:01:45,670
5 times f, and you see that I'm getting closer yet to a square wave.

32
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:50,000
And then I get to 7 times f, and what comes after the 9, and

33
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,560
what you can see is that we're getting closer and

34
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,870
closer to having this as a perfect square wave, okay?

35
00:01:56,870 --> 00:02:02,510
And in fact, you can show that a square wave can just be written as this

36
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:07,890
infinite sum, okay, of these frequencies, okay?

37
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:09,780
And it, the amount of power you need,

38
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:13,670
goes down as the frequency, increases, all right?

39
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:16,840
So, what we want to do is we want to get to a point where we

40
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:21,810
can look at a signal and say, process it in a certain way, or, or

41
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:23,040
compute it in a certain way.

42
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:28,870
To say, what are the sinusoidal components that go into making up this image?

43
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:33,040
And in fact, you can show that to do a square wave like this, you need a,

44
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,830
an infinite sum of decreasing amount of increasing frequency.

45
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:38,879
And that's what's shown here.

46
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:43,780
Now what I haven't done is I haven't talked to you at all about phase.

47
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:46,830
And in fact, I'm not talking at all about, you know, what the phase, right,

48
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:49,490
I could have this offset, or I could have had different elements offset.

49
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:52,540
And in fact, all I'm showing you here is the amount, or

50
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:55,200
you can think of it as the power, we'll talk more about that in a minute,

51
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,420
of the content of each sinusoid.

52
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:00,390
And the reason we're not talking about phase is,

53
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:02,360
our goal is not to reconstruct an image.

54
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:05,810
We just want to, typically what we're going to want to know is,

55
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:10,000
how much power there is in each of the different frequencies.

56
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,930
In Computer Vision, we're interested in sort of analyzing what's going on.

57
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:15,550
If we're actually going to reconstruct images,

58
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:19,730
then we would probably have to worry more about the phase to, get you,

59
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:22,250
better reconstruction, but we're not going to do that, today.
