1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,360
Hopefully, the act of typing out this
block of code made you feel more

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,330
comfortable with writing if else
statements and gave you a sense of how

3
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:11,710
you can use it to introduce some
interesting logic when you create apps.

4
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:14,650
As for this last question
in the image of variable

5
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:17,380
number of guests has a value of ten.

6
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:21,860
Then this first condition will be false
because ten is not less than six.

7
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:23,360
So we skip this case.

8
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:27,120
We go into the second condition We
check if the number of guests 10

9
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:27,800
is less than 20.

10
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:31,670
And this is true so
we set the tip to be 100.

11
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:36,620
Since we fell into this case we can
skip all other cases that follow it and

12
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:39,469
then the ending value
of tip is just 100.
