00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hi. Welcome back and congratulations! We've made it all the way to Week 7.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
We've done a lot along the way, and this week's going to be a little bit different.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
First and most important. We have the final exam.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
There's a bunch of programming problems for you, and you'll see those.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
There won't be any video associated with it--just the questions, so work on those.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I think you'll have fund doing them, and I think you'll be able to handle them all.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
In addition to that, I didn't want to have any extra-heavy materials,

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
because you're going to have plenty of work on the final exam.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Instead, we're going to take some field trips.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
We're going to go visit with some friends and colleagues of mine

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
who are experts in computer science who use programming everyday

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
and have their own views on what the process of computer program design is like.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I think you'll enjoy talking with them. Come on with us.
