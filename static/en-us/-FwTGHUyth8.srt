1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:01,800
So I've made a small change to my app.

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:04,270
And I'm just changing the location
that we're actually looking at.

3
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:06,200
And I've set it to be the latitude and

4
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:09,880
longitude of the street right outside
the studio where I'm filming this.

5
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:13,940
So I called panorama.setPosition on
this, and I do everything else the same.

6
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:16,550
And I'll show you what
the app looks like.

7
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:20,270
Here you can see the area outside
the studio, and I'm on Latham Street.

8
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:23,750
And you can see Latham Street
in the street view itself.

9
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:27,610
And if I go to other places,
we can see Showers Drive and

10
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:29,370
the other part of Showers Drive.

11
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:32,770
And as a result you can see all
the street names being updated.

12
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:35,360
Here we can see Showers Drive
again from this angle.

13
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:36,340
So street names are on.

14
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:38,330
And you may want to turn this off.

15
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:39,830
The default value is
that it would be on.

16
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:42,940
Now lets take a look at what
it takes to turn it off.

17
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:48,694
Now, if you remember, it was just
panorama.setStreetNamesEnabled and

18
00:00:48,694 --> 00:00:50,670
we'd pass at a boolean.

19
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:53,650
I want to turn if off, so
I'm going to set false.

20
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:55,720
So now I'm going to rerun
the application and

21
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:57,400
we'll see what it looks like.

22
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:00,820
And here's the same application running
now with the street names turned off.

23
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:03,380
And you see I can just
see the view outside.

24
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:04,738
The street names have
not been overlayed.

25
00:01:04,738 --> 00:01:08,520
The default behavior was for
street names to be there, but

26
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:11,460
I've overwritten that, and in some
cases it might make for a better app.

27
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:13,780
It's really up to you and
what the needs of your app are.

28
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:17,690
Play with the others, the user
navigation and the zoom gesture, for

29
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:20,410
yourself and
see if you can get some nice effects.
