00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Here is my code.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I compute the dx and dy the way I told you by using the spath of index i + 1

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
minus the same at index.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
My rx and ry, called drx and dry over here, are the robot estimates

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
as obtained by the filter minus the path.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Then I apply the exact same two equations that I gave you for the progress U

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
and the crosstrack error cte as shown over here.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Of course, if I advance too much I add 1 to the index.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
You could have done this before computing the crosstrack error,

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
but I chose to do it afterwards.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
So I add the missing bracket, and when I run it I get sometimes a collision.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
There are two collisions here but I still reach the goal in 140 steps.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Let me run it again, and now I reach the goal without collision.
