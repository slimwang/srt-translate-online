1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
And now we come to a model that has way more compartments than the one before.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
A model for heat conduction in a wire.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Let's draw imaginary lines after each millimeter of that wire

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
and treat each millimeter as one compartment.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Every single compartment is treated in the same way,

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
so we can just look at one single of them to get an idea of what happening, let's take no. 8.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Compartment no. 8 loses a specific percentage of its energy

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
per time to compartments no. 7 and no. 9.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:39,000
To be specific, let's say it's going to lose 1%/ms to the left and 1%/ms to the right,

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
but there will also an energy flow from compartment no. 7 to no. 8 with the same

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
percentage of the energy of no. 7 and there will be an energy flow

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
from compartment no. 9 to compartment no. 8.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Again, the same percentage but of the energy content of compartment no. 9.

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
So after a short amount (h) of time, the temperature of the compartment no. 8

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
will be its initial temperature plus that amount of time

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:14,000
times 1%/ms to be gaining 1%/ms from compartment no. 7

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:23,000
and we are gaining 1%/ms from compartment no. 9 but we are losing 1%/ms to the left and to the right

18
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
so we're losing thrice that percentage.

19
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
One final thing to be doing to clean things up a little, let's get rid of this 1%/ms here.

20
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:41,000
If we work with seconds instead, 1 second amounts to 1000 ms, so we need 1000%/s.

21
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
1000% is 10--so now, we have an equation for the temperature

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
of the compartment no. 8 after one time step.

23
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Of course, this works similarly for all other compartments.

24
00:01:53,000 --> 99:59:59,999
We've just change the numbers. Its about the left neighbor, the right neighbor, and ourselves.
