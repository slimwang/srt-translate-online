1
00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:04,410
I can actually talk more about jQuery.

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:08,380
It is a DOM manipulation library.

3
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:16,700
By DOM manipulation library I mean that
it traverses through your HTML elements.

4
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:20,579
So it's going to help
you handle the events

5
00:00:20,579 --> 00:00:24,364
taking place within your HTML elements.

6
00:00:24,364 --> 00:00:26,030
It's very fast.

7
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:28,298
It's a JavaScript.

8
00:00:28,298 --> 00:00:30,946
It's completely coded in JavaScript.

9
00:00:30,946 --> 00:00:35,812
And yeah, you can use it for
a lot of your projects

10
00:00:35,812 --> 00:00:40,682
where you want to change
content within your HTML

11
00:00:40,682 --> 00:00:45,673
elements directly through
a function rather than

12
00:00:45,673 --> 00:00:51,160
going to your HTML page and
hard coding values into it.

13
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:56,369
This dynamically changes how-
>> How would I go on jQuery?

14
00:00:56,369 --> 00:00:59,703
>> Okay, yeah,
we can actually look at that.

15
00:00:59,703 --> 00:01:04,007
So yeah, here are what I've done is,

16
00:01:04,007 --> 00:01:08,600
I've opened up jQuery.js in Sublime.

17
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,178
So, this is going to be
your JavaScript library.

18
00:01:11,178 --> 00:01:18,647
Instead, [CROSSTALK] yeah we've already
given this file to you in advance.

19
00:01:18,647 --> 00:01:23,900
And this is helper.js which
is also provided to you.

20
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:32,390
So helper.js has a bunch of
variables that map to HTML elements.

21
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:37,257
Like for example,
with helper.html header name.

22
00:01:37,257 --> 00:01:40,659
It contained the header tag
h1 with the ID name and

23
00:01:40,659 --> 00:01:42,930
you've put in some data inside.

24
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,774
This is all populated from JSON.

25
00:01:46,774 --> 00:01:52,669
So wherever you have the percentage
data is populated from a JSON object.

26
00:01:52,669 --> 00:01:53,591
>> Okay.

27
00:01:53,591 --> 00:01:55,730
>> So that's what we are doing here.

28
00:01:55,730 --> 00:02:01,581
So these variables help
you map to the HTML form,

29
00:02:01,581 --> 00:02:06,012
it's designing your HTML webpage.

30
00:02:06,012 --> 00:02:12,204
Okay, when you see this bit
of code right here down here,

31
00:02:12,204 --> 00:02:17,790
you can see
the $document.readyfunction().

32
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:22,150
So the dollar symbols of the notes with
jQuery produce jQuery class.

33
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:27,626
Yes, so when you see,
when you take this particular

34
00:02:27,626 --> 00:02:32,510
line $ in braces,
you have a button.click.

35
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:37,360
What you are defining is any
element with the name button.

36
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,416
So we have one button in our
resume in our HTML page.

37
00:02:41,416 --> 00:02:45,261
>> Okay.
>> And so it's going to pick that button

38
00:02:45,261 --> 00:02:51,110
element and it's going to define
a click event handler on it.

39
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:54,860
>> And then the dollar sign is
telling me that it's jQuery?

40
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:57,554
>> That's right,
it's pointing to jQuery.
