00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,080
Okay.
Now that you've got a list of all of

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:02,810
their tables and

3
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:06,590
all of their columns, I want to give
you a chance to mess around with them.

4
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:09,390
On the next page,
you can run whatever queries you like,

5
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:11,530
using the zoo database.

6
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:14,690
You'll see a bunch of queries
commented out in the editor.

7
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:17,180
Try uncommenting each of them and
running it.

8
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:19,620
Some of them use features
you haven't seen yet.

9
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:22,120
Try to figure out what each
of those features does.

10
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:25,570
There's no right or wrong here, whatever
you put in the query variable will

11
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:29,640
run against the database, when you press
test run, and you'll see the results.

12
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,659
Once you go on to the next page
feel free to bookmark it, so

13
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:36,180
you can come back later, any time you
want to test out some SQL syntax.

14
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,340
Once you're done use
the submit button to move on.
