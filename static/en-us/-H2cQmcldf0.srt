00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,290
If we were designing the coffee maker as a whole and not just the software

2
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:08,820
controllers for it, we would now spec out each of the devices we just listed.

3
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:11,790
Fortunately, the hardware team has taken care of that task and

4
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:16,720
we have been given a Java API for the hardware. The API is available to

5
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:21,790
you from the class resources page. It comprises methods and constant values.

6
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:25,730
The methods provide a way of determining the status of the hardware device and

7
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:30,850
to change them as requested. The constants give symbolic names to the inner,

8
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:36,370
to integer values that, are needed by the controllers. Note that

9
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:41,030
Robert Martin wrote this example before enums were added to the Java language.

10
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:44,910
So he had to define them using the integer constants himself.
