Here's our fourth problem on working together. It takes Jamal and Danielle 4

2
00:00:03,454 --> 00:00:07,742
hours to carpet a room together. If each of them worked alone, one could

3
00:00:07,742 --> 00:00:12,602
complete the work in 6 hours less time than the other. How long would it take

4
00:00:12,602 --> 00:00:17,145
the faster one to do the job? Before we get started to solve, let's see if you

5
00:00:17,145 --> 00:00:21,780
can set up the correct equation. Write your equation here and be sure to use x

6
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:24,260
for the variable. Good luck.
