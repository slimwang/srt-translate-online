1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:01,450
So let's think about it.

2
00:00:01,450 --> 00:00:03,880
Well actually in fact, the answer, and

3
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:07,480
we would normally write it this way, M squared N squared right?

4
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:11,730
Because every pixel I have to multiply all of

5
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:14,550
the coefficients times the pixels that are underneath.

6
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:16,910
So there are M times N coefficients.

7
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:20,980
And I have to do that over all of the N times N pixels.

8
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:24,680
So the number of operations is on the order of M squared N squared,

9
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:28,250
which can get pretty large if M and N are moderate size.

10
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:29,460
Later we'll talk just a little bit

11
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:32,049
about what are called linearly separable filters.

12
00:00:32,049 --> 00:00:35,250
We don't use them a lot anymore if you've got really fast computers, but it,

13
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:37,040
it can make things be much quicker.
