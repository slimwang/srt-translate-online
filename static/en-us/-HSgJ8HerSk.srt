00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:03,950
So let's get back to thinking about how modules help the search engine. And we

2
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:08,125
divided the search engine into these two modules crawler, and search. And there

3
00:00:08,125 --> 00:00:11,390
weren't any actual imports between them. That suggests that there aren't any

4
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:15,031
actual dependencies. But the lack of explicit dependencies doesn't actually mean

5
00:00:15,031 --> 00:00:18,532
that there aren't any dependencies between these modules. So for this quiz, I

6
00:00:18,532 --> 00:00:22,012
want you to think about the ways the search module depends on the crawler

7
00:00:22,012 --> 00:00:26,324
module. And you may need to look at the code, it's linked below. The choices are

8
00:00:26,324 --> 00:00:31,328
how the links are extracted. What add<u>to</u>index does. What names are defined in

9
00:00:31,328 --> 00:00:35,533
crawler. How the index and ranks are represented and how the ranks are computed.
