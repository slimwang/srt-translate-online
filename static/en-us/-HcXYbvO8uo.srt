00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,337
These would be my two factors, excellent work if you got this one correct. You

2
00:00:04,337 --> 00:00:08,703
might have done this in a couple of ways, let's check out one of the methods. If

3
00:00:08,703 --> 00:00:12,798
we switch the middle two terms we can see that we'll get a common factor of N in

4
00:00:12,798 --> 00:00:16,933
the first terms and a common factor by P in the second terms. If we factor a 7 N

5
00:00:16,933 --> 00:00:21,546
from the first two terms we'll be left with two M and positive one. And if we

6
00:00:21,546 --> 00:00:26,142
factor a 5p from the second term, we'll be left with 1 and positive 2m. These 2

7
00:00:26,142 --> 00:00:30,828
factors might appear different but we just wanted to switch the order of these 2

8
00:00:30,828 --> 00:00:35,561
terms. Remember addition is commutative. Now that we can see there's a common

9
00:00:35,561 --> 00:00:39,820
factor of 2m plus 1 in the first term and 2m plus 1 in the second term. We

10
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:44,697
factor again which leaves us with our factored form, 7n plus 5p times 2m plus 1.

11
00:00:44,697 --> 00:00:49,503
But we could have regrouped the terms in another way. I could have grouped this

12
00:00:49,503 --> 00:00:54,321
first term and this last term together and then kept the middle 2 terms together

13
00:00:54,321 --> 00:00:58,912
as well. If we factor a 2m from these first 2 terms we'll be left with 7n and

14
00:00:58,912 --> 00:01:04,001
5p. Now in this last group of terms there's only a greatest common factor of 1.

15
00:01:04,001 --> 00:01:09,429
They don't share any variable factors or number factors. Notice that I have 7n

16
00:01:09,429 --> 00:01:14,966
plus 5p and 7n plus 5p in these two parenthesis. This is the next common factor.

17
00:01:14,966 --> 00:01:20,042
So, our two factors are 2m plus 1 and 7n plus 5p. Notice that these answers are

18
00:01:20,042 --> 00:01:24,159
exactly the same. We've just switched the order of the multiplication. This

19
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:28,025
first parenthesis represents a number. And the second parenthesis also

20
00:01:28,025 --> 00:01:31,992
represents a number. So, it would be like 2 times 3, would be the same as 3

21
00:01:31,992 --> 00:01:34,453
times 2. Our multiplication is commutative.
