1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,460
Actually, this was
a very large percentage.

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:07,520
It was over 90%, the people who felt
that it is important that they be able

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:13,870
to control information
that is private and

4
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:17,640
about them, and they should have
the ability to control that.

5
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:21,460
So based on this survey, obviously,
what we're saying here is that

6
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:25,640
internet privacy is
an important thing for people.

7
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:29,354
How hard they work to protect it,
that's a different question.

8
00:00:29,354 --> 00:00:33,688
But if you were to go and sort of ask
someone, should you be able to control

9
00:00:33,688 --> 00:00:37,539
it, it is not a surprising result,
of course, of this survey.

10
00:00:37,539 --> 00:00:41,850
But yeah, people would like to be able
to control who can get information about

11
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:43,760
their online things that they do.
