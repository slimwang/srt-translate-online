1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I want to introduce one more problem that can be solved with search techniques.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
This is a sliding blocks puzzle, called a 15 puzzle.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
You may have seen something like this.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
So there are a bunch of little squares or blocks or tiles

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
and you can slide them around.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
and the goal is to get into a certain configuration.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
So we'll say that this is the goal state, where the numbers 1-15 are in order

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
left to right, top to bottom.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The starting state would be some state where all the positions are messed up.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Now the question is: Can we come up with a good heuristic for this?

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Let's examine that as a way of thinking about where heuristics come from.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
The first heuristic we're going to consider

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:54,000
we'll call h1, and that is equal to the number of misplaced blocks.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
So here 10 and 11 are misplaced because they should be there and there, respectively,

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
12 is in the right place, 13 is in the right place,

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
and 14 and 15 are misplaced.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
That's a total of 4 misplaced blocks.

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
The 2nd heuristic, h2, is equal to

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,000
the sum of the distances that each block would have to move to get to the right position.

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:26,000
For this position, 10 would have to move 1 space to get to the right position,

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
11 would have to move 1, so that's a total of 2 so far,

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
13 is in the right place,

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
14 is 1 displaced,

24
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
and 15 is 1 displaced,

25
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
so that would also be a total of 4.

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Now, the question is: Which, if any, of these heuristics are admissible?

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Check the boxes next to the heuristics that you think

28
00:01:47,000 --> 99:59:59,999
are admissible.
