00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:01,460
Every linear program,

2
00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:06,340
it turns out, has a dual program which
mirrors the behavior of the original.

3
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:08,770
In this lesson we'll
examine this phenomenon.

4
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:11,340
To give us a chance to apply some of
the knowledge we gained about linear

5
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:12,420
programs.

6
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:15,370
As well as to deepen our understanding
of some of the other problems that we've

7
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:15,970
already studied.

8
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:19,050
See if you can guess which
problems as the lesson goes along.
