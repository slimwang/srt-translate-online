1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,680
After you unzip the downloaded file, you can open it up and

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:05,630
see the file structure within it.

3
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:08,373
Notice how there are two versions of everything with the same name.

4
00:00:08,373 --> 00:00:11,416
We have bootstrap-theme.css and

5
00:00:11,416 --> 00:00:16,450
bootstrap-theme.min.css and the same goes for JavaScript.

6
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:20,710
When a user opens your Web page or rather, when their browsers open the Web

7
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:23,630
page, they'll have to download all of the style and

8
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:26,070
JavaScript files that you've included in it.

9
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:28,370
Sometimes these files can be quite large.

10
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:32,369
So to help avoid that problem, we use minified files.

11
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:33,580
Minified CSS and

12
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:37,660
JavaScript files take up less space and can be downloaded faster.

13
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:38,710
On the left side,

14
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:43,310
I've got the unminified, the normal version of bootstrap CSS file open.

15
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:46,100
Notice how it looks pretty normal, but on the right,

16
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:48,400
I've got the minified version of the same file.

17
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:52,010
These two files are the same, but all of the white space has been taken out of

18
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:56,030
the minified version, while on the unminified version, it is still readable.

19
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:59,450
You should always include the minified version of your files on your site so

20
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:01,070
they can be downloaded faster.

21
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:04,677
But when you're editing, you should definitely use the unminified version.

22
00:01:04,677 --> 00:01:07,580
Otherwise, you'll drive yourself crazy trying to figure out what's going on.
