Here's a different city map. And in this city, the naming starts here. We have

2
00:00:04,928 --> 00:00:09,999
1st Street, 2nd street, and then it continues. The avenues are the same, but the

3
00:00:09,999 --> 00:00:15,018
avenues run north south. 1st Avenue, 2nd Avenue, and so on. Maybe this is the

4
00:00:15,018 --> 00:00:19,967
intersection of the 0th Street, and 0th Avenue. Now, 0th Street and 0th Avenue

5
00:00:19,967 --> 00:00:24,239
are pretty silly names for streets, but that's okay. And maybe this intersection

6
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:28,288
is important. It's where the first building may have been built, so residents

7
00:00:28,288 --> 00:00:32,143
called it the origin. I'll just label it 0. Now, I want to think about this

8
00:00:32,143 --> 00:00:36,203
intersection at 5th Street and 3rd Avenue in relationship to the origin. How

9
00:00:36,203 --> 00:00:40,479
would you complete the following statement? How many blocks is this intersection

10
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:45,628
to the right of the origin? And above the origin. Fill in the numbers here.
