00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,828
Now let's say we take a sample of 30 students and we make the lesson with the

2
00:00:03,828 --> 00:00:09,860
song available to them. Afterwards, the mean engagement score they report is

3
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:14,466
8.3. Where does this value fall on the distribution of sample means for all

4
00:00:14,466 --> 00:00:19,310
samples of size 30? To answer this remember that this normal distribution

5
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:24,850
represent the distribution of sample mean. Remember that the mean of sample

6
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:29,512
means should be the same as the population mean. And the standard deviation

7
00:00:29,512 --> 00:00:34,504
should be the population standard deviation divided by the square root of n. We

8
00:00:34,504 --> 00:00:38,787
want to find where on this distribution the sample mean will fall. In other

9
00:00:38,787 --> 00:00:40,513
words, what's the z score?
