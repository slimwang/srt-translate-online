When you're reading instructions for
how to do things in the shell,

2
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:08,070
you'll very often see a transcript of a
shell session, a screenshot showing what

3
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:12,186
to type, and what to expect
the computer will say in response.

4
00:00:12,186 --> 00:00:15,740
But it can sometimes take a bit of
thinking to figure out which lines

5
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:20,140
are meant to show something that you
typed in, and which ones are output.

6
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:21,430
Here, give it a try.

7
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:24,070
Here's a transcript of a shell session.

8
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:27,930
For each line, mark it as either
containing user input, or

9
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:29,410
as being command output.
