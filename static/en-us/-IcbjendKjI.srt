00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Let's now talk about pie charts.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
You all know what a pie is.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Here's a birthday pie,

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
and if you look at this pie from above

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
it looks just like this.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
It's a circle.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Now here comes Sebastian and cuts out his first piece of the pie.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
What results is a pie with a missing piece,

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
and then my wife comes, and she gets just a small piece,

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
but my brother eats a very big piece,

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
so only the following pie is left.

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
We've just made a pie chart,

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
and in statistics you use pie charts to visualize data,

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
specifically relative data, and I'll tell you in a second

15
00:00:41,000 --> 99:59:59,999
what that means.
