00:00:00,002 --> 00:00:04,893
We can think of the independent variable as the input and the dependent variable

2
00:00:04,893 --> 00:00:09,698
as the output. So in an equation like y equals 3x plus 2, the input would be

3
00:00:09,698 --> 00:00:14,801
whatever number we plug in for x, and the output is the number that we get for y

4
00:00:14,801 --> 00:00:19,529
by using that value of x. The output depends on the input.
