1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:02,780
The answer to the first
question is /dev/null.

2
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:06,490
For instance, if you just want to
discard the output of a process you can

3
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:08,320
just send it to /dev/null.

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,070
The answer to the second question
is the device /dev/random.

5
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:15,900
It also has a more robust counterpart,
/dev/urandom, and

6
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:21,723
one use of this device is to create
files that contain pseudo-random bytes.
