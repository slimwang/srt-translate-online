00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,620
Another benefit of nomparies is that
they support something called vectorized

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:05,120
operations.

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,000
The name is taken from linear algebra.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,530
But if you aren't familiar with
linear algebra, that's fine.

5
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:11,500
For the purposes of this discussion,

6
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:14,145
you can think of a vector as
just being a list of numbers.

7
00:00:15,195 --> 00:00:20,005
So, for example, one, two three or
four, five, six would both be vectors.

8
00:00:20,005 --> 00:00:23,925
Now in linear algebra you can add
two vectors of the same length.

9
00:00:23,925 --> 00:00:25,725
This is called vector addition.

10
00:00:26,725 --> 00:00:30,295
Now if you were defining vector
addition how would you define it?

11
00:00:30,295 --> 00:00:33,155
Specifically, if you were
to add these two vectors

12
00:00:33,155 --> 00:00:35,520
what would you expect the result to be?

13
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,160
I've added some choices here.

14
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:37,850
There's no right or

15
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:41,000
wrong answer to this question,
just select the one you would choose.
