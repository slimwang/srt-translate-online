We're starting to see that some equations for parabolas can't be factored. When

2
00:00:04,444 --> 00:00:08,602
that's the case, we need another method of finding where they intersect the

3
00:00:08,602 --> 00:00:12,760
horizontal axis. Let's look at this equation, y equals 3 x squared plus 6 x

4
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:17,036
minus 10. Now if we want to find the x intercepts, what equation are we really

00:00:17,036 --> 00:00:21,269
trying to solve? Please put you answer with the full equation in this orange
