00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,650
For some of us, LinkedIn is a new and
unfamiliar platform.

2
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:06,760
For others,
you might know it and love it.

3
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:10,610
Our goal is to make you know and
appreciate the power of LinkedIn.

4
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:11,490
When I move to the U.S.

5
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:15,640
from Germany, I did not know what to
put in my English LinkedIn version.

6
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:19,000
As Germans are generally more private,
I saw filling up my LinkedIn

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,110
as a horrible pointless hurdle
that really stretched my limits.

8
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:26,090
However, after doing some research and

9
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:29,220
getting more familiar with
the customization options of LinkedIn,

10
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:32,648
I started to realize that
LinkedIn had a lot of potential.

11
00:00:32,648 --> 00:00:35,250
If used skilfully,
it could give me a lot of

12
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:38,970
agency in creating my personal brand,
an ideal professional identity.

13
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:43,850
A LinkedIn profile contains
multiple customizable sections.

14
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:46,590
You can change the order of those
sections depending on your background

15
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:49,100
and better convey your
goals to recruiters.

16
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:52,380
For example,
if you're switching careers completely,

17
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:55,740
you can make your project section
proceed your work experience.

18
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:58,720
You could also create your
own professional headline.

19
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:01,830
This means you can define what you are,
not your current job title.

20
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:06,530
You can select a professional image of
yourself, allowing you to make a great

21
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:09,510
professional first impression
before the interview.

22
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:10,190
You can also

23
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:13,200
present a compelling summary
statement that frames your story.

24
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,850
This is extremely helpful if you're
changing careers, are new to the field,

25
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:20,320
or simply have an eclectic background,
like me.

26
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,230
LinkedIn invites you to present a
comprehensive list of your professional

27
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:26,800
experience with detailed bullets
about what you did at each place.

28
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:30,750
Finally, with LinkedIn, you can present
information about your passions,

29
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:34,860
hobbies, causes, and interests
that may not fit on your resume.

30
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:38,320
If you have a LinkedIn profile,
what parts do you have currently?

31
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,630
Feel free to respond in our forum.
