00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The trick is to add these two lines to the diagram.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:10,000
We know the slope of this line, which is -1 over the time constant for the heat loss.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
We know the length of this line, which is the jump, and the rate of change of the temperature.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
The heating value times the burning rate.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
This term makes the difference between burning and not burning,

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and now we can use the slope to express the ratio of this leg to this leg.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:35,000
1 over the time constant for the heat loss equals the ratio of the vertical length to the horizontal length.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The vertical length, the green line, is h times the burn rate and the burn rate is the wood's density

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:51,000
over the time constant of burning, and the horizontal length is 1,200 K minus the ambient temperature.

10
00:00:51,000 --> 99:59:59,999
You solve this equation for h, plug in these numbers, and then you get 135 K/kg/mÂ².
