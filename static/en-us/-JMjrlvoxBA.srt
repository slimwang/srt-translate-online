1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:05,510
You've learned so much, drawing, view
port management, movement, user input.

2
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:08,770
And now it's time to build
a real game from scratch.

3
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:11,330
Icicles is a game where the player
first selects a difficulty.

4
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:15,420
And then can use the arrow keys or
phone accelerometer

5
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:18,190
to move their character left and
right to dodge the falling icicles.

6
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:22,020
This seems pretty easy.

7
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:24,300
So we can tap the screen again
to go back to the difficulty,

8
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,220
select screen and
select a harder difficulty.

9
00:00:28,112 --> 00:00:30,860
Wow, okay, that's a lot of icicles,
oh, oh, no.

10
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:31,850
Oh, this is a lot harder.

11
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:37,370
So you can start building your own games
once you're done with this course.

12
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:40,644
Well, start this level using
the LBGTX project setup

13
00:00:40,644 --> 00:00:43,344
utility to create
a totally fresh project.

14
00:00:43,344 --> 00:00:43,930
Let's go.
