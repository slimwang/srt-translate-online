1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,030
After we completely factored, here's what we end up with. Looking at the

2
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:08,757
denominator, x can equal 0, 2, or 1. So I'll write those values in this box to

3
00:00:08,757 --> 00:00:15,832
tell us about the domain. X can equal 0, 1, or 2. Great, that takes care of

4
00:00:15,832 --> 00:00:20,130
half the problem. Now onto the range. Let's look at our horizontal asymptote.

5
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:23,080
If there is one at all. First though, I need to multiply out what's in the

6
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:26,390
denominator and the numerator. So we have a form that we can use for long

7
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:32,049
division. In the numerator I'll have x cubed minus x. And in the denominator,

8
00:00:32,049 --> 00:00:37,485
we have 2x to the 4th minus 6 x cubed plus 4x squared. Great. Now we can

9
00:00:37,485 --> 00:00:41,733
divide. Setting up our long division problem. I need to see how many times 2x

10
00:00:41,733 --> 00:00:47,306
to the 4th goes into x cubed. Well, that's just 0 times. I could carry on with

11
00:00:47,306 --> 00:00:50,583
my long division. But I know already that we're going to have a horizontal

12
00:00:50,583 --> 00:00:55,065
asymptote at. That y equals 0. Now the question is is this an asymptote that

13
00:00:55,065 --> 00:01:01,380
the function crosses or not. To find out let's plug in 0 for y in our function.

14
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:04,908
I know that this equation will be satisfied if the numerator is just equal to

15
00:01:04,908 --> 00:01:09,693
0. As long as the denominator is not undefined. At whatever value of x we need

16
00:01:09,693 --> 00:01:14,235
to do this. So let's just set x times x squared minus 1 equal to 0. Two of

17
00:01:14,235 --> 00:01:18,972
these factors x and x minus 1. Are also in the denominator, so I'm going to

18
00:01:18,972 --> 00:01:23,770
cross them out. But we still one left over, x plus 1. This means that x equals

19
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:29,060
negative 1, the graph of our function crosses through the horizontal asymptote.

20
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:31,964
Since the horizontal asymptote, then, is not restricting our range, the range

21
00:01:31,964 --> 00:01:37,010
is just all the real numbers. So we can write a none in this box. Awesome, that

22
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:40,829
was a super complicated quiz, so if you got through it, great job.
