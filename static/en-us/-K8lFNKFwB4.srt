Hi, welcome to 2D game
development at Udacity.

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:06,090
I'm Peter,
Developer Evangelist of Amazon.

3
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:09,210
>> And I'm Jeremy,
a Course Developer at Udacity.

4
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:10,830
>> With the explosion of mobile gaming,

5
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:13,836
there's never been a better time to get
your games into the hands of players.

6
00:00:13,836 --> 00:00:17,230
>> And 2D cross-platform game
development libraries make it

7
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:19,990
easy to write games that run anywhere.

8
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:22,530
Hey Peter, what was the first
game you ever worked on?

9
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:26,310
>> Actually, my first project was
the Amiga port of Red Baron which

10
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:29,280
was one of the first World War I
flight simulators for PC.

11
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,170
How about you?

12
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:33,790
>> Well the first game I ever touched
the source code of was actually

13
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:35,370
Asteroids on my graphing calculator.

14
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:38,170
I hacked it so
I got an unbeatable top score.

15
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:41,252
But the first game I ever wrote from
scratch was a Choose Your Own Adventure

16
00:00:41,252 --> 00:00:42,056
for the TI83+.

17
00:00:42,056 --> 00:00:44,010
>> Hm, how about you you?

18
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:45,630
Have you made any games in the past?

19
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:48,110
>> Or if you're brand new to the gaming
industry what's the first project that

20
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:48,750
you're itching to write?
