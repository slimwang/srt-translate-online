1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,660
As I said, there are lots
of different color spaces.

2
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:05,750
Here's a nice picture of
all these different ways of

3
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:07,370
representing these things.

4
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:10,530
By the way, notice the one
here at the bottom left, red,

5
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:12,140
blue, green, red, green, blue.

6
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:13,890
We'll talk about that one in a minute.

7
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:15,625
All right, but
let me show you what my favorite.

8
00:00:15,625 --> 00:00:17,940
In fact I'll put up two of them.

9
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:18,970
So which one's my favorite?

10
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:20,820
Well, I think I already gave it away.

11
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,130
I told you that the problem
with this one here,

12
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:26,620
is that the entire top surface is white.

13
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:28,410
And so, here's the question.

14
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:32,650
How much can I change the color
of something that's white?

15
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:34,190
Answer, not at all.

16
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:35,780
White is white is white.

17
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:39,310
So that's why I like this idea of
having this peak on the top, so

18
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:41,530
that is you can't get far away from it.

19
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:45,720
Likewise, same as, as on the black.

20
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:49,251
And you spin around,
the double cone gives you the, the hue.

21
00:00:49,251 --> 00:00:51,708
And as you get further out,
they call it chroma.

22
00:00:51,708 --> 00:00:53,882
I actually like calling
it saturation better.

23
00:00:53,882 --> 00:00:56,030
It, it doesn't really matter too much.

24
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:58,260
But the idea is,
I tend to think of it as a cone.

25
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:01,820
And what's important is when
you realize that it's a cone,

26
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:05,410
you realize that if you're comparing,
and we'll get to this in a minute,

27
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:08,660
if you're comparing the hue
of two different patches,

28
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:14,170
if they're very dark,
the hue doesn't mean anything.

29
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:17,180
If they're very bright,
the hue doesn't mean anything.

30
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:19,930
And that's very hard to see on
this cylinder representation, but

31
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:23,480
it's very easy to see,
see on the, on the cone.

32
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:28,019
Now of course, what is the color
space that we all know and love,

33
00:01:28,019 --> 00:01:29,292
or at least know?

34
00:01:29,292 --> 00:01:31,060
All right?
Which is the one we know best?

35
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:36,070
Well, it's the RGB space, right,
where basically, you've got a cube,

36
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:40,460
where in sort of a back corner where
things are 0, 0, or everything's black.

37
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:42,530
If you move down the red axis,
it turns red.

38
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:44,880
If you move to the green axis,
it turns green.

39
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,490
Add them together,
what's red and green make?

40
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:47,600
Yellow.
Why?

41
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,120
Cones.

42
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:51,130
And if you bring the whole thing up,
it looks white.

43
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:54,510
And what's cool is if you take
that cube, and you sort of

44
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:59,450
pull the white corner to the top and
the black corner to the bottom, right?

45
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:00,660
So in fact I have a sort of picture,

46
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:04,700
just think about that,
it would be almost like a double cone.

47
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:08,508
Not quite, it would be kind of
a lumpy double cone with sharp points.

48
00:02:08,508 --> 00:02:09,395
But the idea is,

49
00:02:09,395 --> 00:02:13,381
white would be at a point on the top,
black would be at a point on the bottom,

50
00:02:13,381 --> 00:02:16,500
right, and then you would have
chroma as you went around.

51
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,760
And that's why my preference
is the double cone.
