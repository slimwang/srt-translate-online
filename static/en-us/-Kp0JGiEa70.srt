1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:01,410
Alright Michael, you got the answer?

2
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:04,180
>> Yea, I'm ready to try and figure it out.

3
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:06,730
>> Alright let's go. Let's try the first one.

4
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:08,876
>> I feel like the first one's going to go rather well. So we

5
00:00:08,876 --> 00:00:15,930
need a pair of strategies so that no player is. Motivated to switch.

6
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:16,555
>> Mm-hm.

7
00:00:16,555 --> 00:00:19,360
>> And you told us they were pure strategies, so we actually have a nice

8
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:20,890
algorithm for doing this, which is we could

9
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:22,770
just check one of them with the definition.

10
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:23,353
>> Mm-hm.

11
00:00:23,353 --> 00:00:25,380
>> But, but in the case of prisoner's dilemma, I think

12
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:27,810
a natural place to start would be that minus 6, minus 6.

13
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:28,290
>> Mm-hm.

14
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:31,390
>> So let's say that A chooses the second row and B

15
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:36,230
chooses the second column, let's see if that's a Nash Equilibrium. So

16
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:38,400
both players need to be happy. So if, would A be happier

17
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:42,280
switching? If A switched, it would be getting minus 9, which is worse.

18
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:42,360
>> Mm-hm.

19
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,950
>> So A is happy, where A is. And if B

20
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:49,010
switches, B would be getting minus 9, so boom, Nash Equilibrium.

21
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:49,360
>> Done.

22
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,500
>> Now I didn't verify that other

23
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,340
ones weren't a Nash Equilibrium, but you didn't

24
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:55,620
say. Find all of the Nash Equilibrium. You just

25
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,720
said find, well you did say find the.

26
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,630
So you kind of implied that there's just one.

27
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:02,840
>> Right. But actually that's true, but you don't have to check this because

28
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,855
we already went through an exercise where we, where we knew the answer was minus

29
00:01:05,855 --> 00:01:10,770
6, minus 6. And the way we did that was we noticed that for A defecting the

30
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:15,880
second row is always better than this. Right? And then in particular this

31
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:18,280
row strictly dominates this row.

32
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,520
>> Right.

33
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,420
>> Which implies that if I picked anything on this

34
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:25,610
row I would rather move to the other row. And

35
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:26,877
you can see it. Minus 1 0 is better. Minus

36
00:01:26,877 --> 00:01:29,190
9, minus 6 is better. That's what it means to

37
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:32,940
be strictly dominated. So, I'd never pick this row anyway.

38
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:35,900
And this same argument for B for this column. So,

39
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,840
you'll notice that by getting rid of the things that

40
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,110
are strictly dominated, the only thing we're left with is this.

41
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:46,940
And, it turns out, in fact, to be a Nash Equilibrium. So, this is correct.

42
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:52,370
>> So, you just told me how to do my job, which makes me little sad.

43
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:53,710
>> Well, in this instance.

44
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:56,210
>> Because I already had the answer to this. But maybe, maybe

45
00:01:56,210 --> 00:02:00,330
you were signalling to me how I might attack this next problem. Maybe.

46
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:02,370
>> Maybe.

47
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:07,160
>> So, A is choosing a row and gets the first number.

48
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:11,360
So, is there a row, that, were they dominates all the other rows?

49
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:14,970
It doesn't seem that way.

50
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:15,990
>> Mh-hm

51
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:18,920
>> But maybe, maybe, oh I could start with B, maybe B, there's a

52
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:21,720
column that dominates all the other columns.

53
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,130
But no, it looks like it's totally symmetrical.

54
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:26,770
>> Yep, so strictly dominated doesn't necessarily

55
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:28,950
help here, and by necessarily I mean doesn't.

56
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:30,560
>> So that was kind of mean. Thank you.

57
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:35,120
>> All right, so oh, but we have something else we could do.

58
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:35,550
>> Yes.

59
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:38,762
>> So, there is a, the largest number that anybody can

60
00:02:38,762 --> 00:02:39,462
get is 6.

61
00:02:39,462 --> 00:02:40,635
>> Mm-hm.

62
00:02:40,635 --> 00:02:43,103
>> And there's a play where both of them can get the 6.

63
00:02:43,103 --> 00:02:43,434
>> Yeah.

64
00:02:43,434 --> 00:02:44,618
>> So there's no way they're going to want

65
00:02:44,618 --> 00:02:46,542
to switch away from that, because everyone's getting there

66
00:02:46,542 --> 00:02:47,947
kind of maximum out of reward. So A

67
00:02:47,947 --> 00:02:53,940
bottom row, B right column, gets us Nash Equilibrium.

68
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,986
>> And that is in fact correct, and you can

69
00:02:55,986 --> 00:02:58,528
see it because from here I would always, it would

70
00:02:58,528 --> 00:03:01,070
always be worse for me, and it would always worse

71
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:03,834
for me. So, these are in fact the Nash Equilibrium,

72
00:03:03,834 --> 00:03:05,137
for these two problems.

73
00:03:05,137 --> 00:03:08,516
>> Cool. They've seemed easier than I was expecting.

74
00:03:08,516 --> 00:03:08,530
>> Mm-hm.
