00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,318
Remember that x squared. It's just x times x or 2 x's multiplied together. X to

2
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:10,267
the 4th is just 4 x's multiplied together and we're also multiplying that by

3
00:00:10,279 --> 00:00:15,462
another 3 x's that are multiplied together. So here we have a big string of x's

4
00:00:15,722 --> 00:00:20,127
all multiplied together, just like we would expect, considering how many

5
00:00:20,139 --> 00:00:24,851
exponents we see here, but the same base of over and over again. So, in total

6
00:00:24,863 --> 00:00:29,500
here we have 9 x's all multiplied together. And we know that this just equals x

7
00:00:29,512 --> 00:00:33,803
to the 9th power. However, we can or rule to do this in a much shorter and

8
00:00:33,815 --> 00:00:38,006
easier way. We can get the same answer by just adding these 3 exponents

9
00:00:38,018 --> 00:00:43,190
together. We know that our base is still x, but our power is just 2 plus 4 plus

10
00:00:43,202 --> 00:00:47,006
3. 2 plus 4 is 6, plus 3 is 9. So we get the same answer.
