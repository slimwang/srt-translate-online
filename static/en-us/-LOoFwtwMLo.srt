1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:05,090
So Martin suggests using an alternative approach to OOA is to

2
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:07,150
write out use cases.

3
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:11,580
Recall that a use case is a simple story illustrating a single execution or

4
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:16,610
pointing out an important obstacle that the user might confront.

5
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:19,465
For the case of the coffeemaker can you come up with a few use cases?

6
00:00:19,465 --> 00:00:22,757
What's brewin'?

7
00:00:22,757 --> 00:00:26,060
>> So if they did press the brew button, but that was,

8
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:29,330
I guess, the first use case there's a couple of things that could happen.

9
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:32,250
Everything could be right, because all of our pre-conditions are there,

10
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:37,400
or there could be no water for the brewing process to start, or

11
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,410
just the filter's not in place, or no coffee grounds.

12
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:42,030
Those are some problems that could happen.

13
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:46,840
>> So on, on that one notice that so far we haven't, we don't have an sensor for

14
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:48,020
the grounds.

15
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:50,710
OK. So if there's no grounds in there you're going to get very,

16
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:52,380
very weak coffee.

17
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:52,980
>> Okay.

18
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:56,970
>> And if there's no filter, you're going to get your coffee pretty quickly.

19
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:57,740
>> Right.

20
00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:59,960
I guess I have a question that regards to that use case.

21
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:03,230
Is the problem of them not having coffee grounds something that

22
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:04,730
the system should even worry about?

23
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:07,890
Because it seems like that would be hard to tell, like the filter being in

24
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:10,500
place I can imagine being something a sensor could tell.

25
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:15,100
But how much coffee is in your, your filter could be,

26
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:17,420
maybe something that's not supported, I don't know.

27
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:23,930
>> So this is an issue with designing software and hardware at the same time.

28
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:28,400
So you could imagine, for example in the Mark 5 having a sensor for

29
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,680
the recep, receptacle actually clicking in.

30
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:31,210
Okay.

31
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:33,350
When you, when you push it in there.

32
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:38,250
Trying to figure out how many grounds are in there or how, you know, how deep

33
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:43,160
the grounds are or something our hardware people haven't gotten that one yet.

34
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:46,400
Okay, so we're, we're not going to be able to sense that very well.

35
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,740
>> It sounds a little bit like trying to

36
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:49,950
count jelly beans in a jar or something.

37
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:55,030
But anyways the other use cases I have involve remember moving or

38
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:56,970
placing the pot because we have an indicator for that.

39
00:01:56,970 --> 00:01:58,330
>> Right, right. >> So it's something that stood out.

40
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:01,730
And then also when you fill the water receptacle.

41
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:04,370
We have an indicator whether the water is there or not.

42
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:08,210
So that seemed to be a, an interaction that had something the user could see.

43
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:09,588
>> So let's consider four of those.

44
00:02:09,588 --> 00:02:14,460
The user press, press pushes the brew button, and that's our primary one.

45
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:18,430
And then some contingent ones containment vessel is not ready.

46
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:19,950
The coffee is all gone or

47
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:22,430
we could have that the, the brewing is actually complete.
