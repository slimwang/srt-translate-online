1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:04,880
We'll begin with patient
access to their own data, and

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:10,680
we'll see how the bar gets raised as
the stages of meaningful use progress.

3
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:14,240
We've discussed the requirements
in the first two stages.

4
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:19,409
In Stage 3, as proposed,
80% of patients must be able

5
00:00:19,409 --> 00:00:24,578
to access their records either
through the VDT function,

6
00:00:24,578 --> 00:00:31,238
or through an ONC certified API, or
application programming interface.

7
00:00:31,238 --> 00:00:38,040
And 35% must have access to
patient-specific educational materials.

8
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:41,933
We mentioned the term API in our
team project discussion near

9
00:00:41,933 --> 00:00:45,190
the end of lesson one,
when we discussed FHIR.

10
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:49,140
For all practical purposes,
these two terms are probably going to be

11
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:55,380
synonymous in healthcare, that is FHIR
will be the API used in healthcare.

12
00:00:55,380 --> 00:01:01,170
Unsurprisingly, Stage 3 also raises
the bar on actual patient engagement.

13
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:06,690
25% of patients must
access their records,

14
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:11,314
either through VDT or
through an ONC-certified API.

15
00:01:11,314 --> 00:01:17,780
35% of patients must receive
a clinically relevant secure message.

16
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:21,880
And of great interest with respect
to patient phasing technologies

17
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:25,320
such as those we'll
discuss in lesson seven,

18
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:30,580
providers must incorporate
patient-generated data from non-clinical

19
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:35,550
settings such as home health for
15% of their patients.

20
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:41,460
This requirement clearly anticipates the
increased use of mobile technologies and

21
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,410
sensors in the home.

22
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:48,134
Stage 3's proposed provider
requirements also increase

23
00:01:48,134 --> 00:01:52,103
the percentage of
e-prescriptions to 85% for

24
00:01:52,103 --> 00:01:57,430
eligible providers and
25% for eligible hospitals.

25
00:01:57,430 --> 00:02:00,240
They also require the use of 5 clinical

26
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,690
decision support tools tied
to 4 quality measures.

27
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:07,283
And providers must use drug to drug and

28
00:02:07,283 --> 00:02:13,230
drug to allergy interaction alerts
during the entire reporting period.

29
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:18,212
Hospitals must receive at least
80% of medication orders,

30
00:02:18,212 --> 00:02:23,100
60% of laboratory orders and
60% of diagnostic imaging

31
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:27,860
orders via computer-based
physician order entry.

32
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:32,093
Although order entry by scribes,
assistants to physicians who enter

33
00:02:32,093 --> 00:02:36,550
the information for them,
does count toward these goals.

34
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:42,660
Finally, Stage 3 has specific
interoperability requirements.

35
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:45,235
Providers must send
an electronic summary for

36
00:02:45,235 --> 00:02:49,440
50% of transitions of care and
referrals.

37
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,940
You recall that these are major
sources of error in patient care.

38
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:59,940
They must receive an electronic summary
for 40% of transitions and referral.

39
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:06,170
And providers must perform medication
allergy problem list reconciliation for

40
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:10,700
80% of transitions of care and
referrals.

41
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:15,150
Finally, eligible providers
must electronically submit

42
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:20,030
three out of five of the following
reporting requirements.

43
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:27,030
Immunizations, syndromic surveillance,
this would be for infectious diseases.

44
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:29,740
Reportable conditions case reporting,

45
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:33,950
certain conditions that need to
be reported to public health.

46
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:38,570
Public health registries to keep
track of certain diseases and

47
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:43,800
conditions and non public health
registries, such as those for cancer.

48
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:48,230
Eligible hospitals must submit
four from the same list

49
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:50,770
to which electronic lab
reporting is added.
