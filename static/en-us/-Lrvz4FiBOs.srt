00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Once you've got the order on y and x right, the rest should be pretty straightforward.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
We're going one step left, we're going one step right, we're going one step down,

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
we're going one step up, and subject four times the original value.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
And the result is that our initial square has turned into a soft blob.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
In case you're wondering, we're using 50 steps from the left to the right

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and from the bottom to the top.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
How could we get such a smooth picture with just 50 * 50 values. The trick is interpolation.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
So let's switch off interpolation to see how our raw data really look like.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Now, you can see those 50 steps in x direction and y direction.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Interpolation turns this pixelated image into one that looks really smooth.
