1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,990
Now what if A is actually fake and
B is real?

2
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:04,240
>> But that's not the truth.

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:06,260
>> It could be the truth,
we didn't know that.

4
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:07,720
>> We went to mechanism
to work either way.

5
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:08,340
>> That's right.

6
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:10,860
>> Okay, so all right, so
let's go to the bottom again.

7
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:15,725
So if B is the real mom, B has
a value of V real which is bigger than

8
00:00:15,725 --> 00:00:19,478
V fake which is A's value.

9
00:00:19,478 --> 00:00:26,338
So when B, announces the value,
B probably should announce the V real.

10
00:00:26,338 --> 00:00:31,470
Because again B is going
to want to spend that or

11
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:33,750
wouldn't want to not get the baby.

12
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:37,010
Having not spend that amount we
would have regret for that, and so

13
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:41,430
B is going to basically be truthful
right and say what B's true value is.

14
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:43,040
Which in this case is V real.

15
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,120
At that point A has a choice.

16
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:45,895
A can say yes and

17
00:00:45,895 --> 00:00:49,128
is going to have to pay more for
the baby then the baby's worth to A.

18
00:00:49,128 --> 00:00:50,906
>> Because V real's bigger than V fake.

19
00:00:50,906 --> 00:00:54,647
>> Or say no and
walk away having paid the fine but

20
00:00:54,647 --> 00:00:57,906
B gets the baby but
at a very high price.

21
00:00:57,906 --> 00:01:01,170
>> But it doesn't matter because
F is still bigger than zero.

22
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:04,160
>> I see, so now what you're saying is,
so that is a little bit weird and

23
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:04,989
asymmetrical, right?

24
00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:08,420
So B gets the baby for V real.

25
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:11,960
But if it was A who had the baby,
then A's going to get the baby for

26
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:14,290
V fake which is less.

27
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:17,400
>> Right, but it doesn't matter,
>> Your point is that because of this

28
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,260
fact, because of the fact that
if A lets it get this far,

29
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:24,160
knowing that A's not the mom,
it's going to cost A the fine.

30
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:27,140
>> Right, and A will not get the baby.

31
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:30,870
So that means A doesn't want
to get this far, which means

32
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:34,540
when asked the question, having thought
it all through, A will just say no.

33
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:39,630
So in fact, by saying this is
the process we're going to go through

34
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:42,740
when asked the question
both will be truthful.

35
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:44,310
>> In fact,
all the questions will be truthful,

36
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:46,210
all the way up to question one.

37
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:47,350
>> What?
>> All the questions.

38
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:51,025
So any question that's asked is going to
be answered truthfully by this design.

39
00:01:51,025 --> 00:01:52,100
>> That's right, I'm sorry,

40
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:55,077
you were saying all the way up to you're
going counting backwards that's right.

41
00:01:55,077 --> 00:01:56,400
>> Now well up to one.

42
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,970
Yes up the screen to one.

43
00:01:57,970 --> 00:01:59,940
>> Right so that's exactly right.

44
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:03,820
Without knowing what V real and V fake
are but with everyone understanding that

45
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:08,925
the baby is valued more by the real
mother than the fake mother.

46
00:02:08,925 --> 00:02:13,490
This mechanism set them in such a way
that it makes no sense for the fake

47
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:18,690
mother whoever it is to ever let it get
this far ever let it get to step three.

48
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:23,620
So as a result when forced to ask the
question the fake mother has to bale.

49
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:24,580
>> Got it.

50
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:29,310
>> Before it gets to three because
otherwise Fake mom will lose.

51
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:31,950
>> Clever.
>> Therefore this mechanism

52
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:34,850
will in fact elicit the true
values of the baby and

53
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:37,020
will allow King Solomon
to know the right thing.

54
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:40,990
Because of this King Solomon knows
that they will answer truthfully and

55
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:43,640
will find out who the real mother is.

56
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:49,230
And the only person who loses in this
Is the poor person of the sword.

57
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:50,500
>> Again.
So sorry.

58
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,390
>> And there you go.

59
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:55,300
So I think that that's a pretty
interesting example of

60
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,540
how you might kind of
do mechanism design.

61
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,610
>> That is really interesting.

62
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:04,860
Yeah and so I slipped and called it
a bit at one point because it sort

63
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:11,210
of reminds me of what people
do in auction design.

64
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:12,860
>> Right.
>> When auctions are designed it's

65
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:16,270
often the case that you want
to set up an auction so

66
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:21,758
that people reveal their true values for
the for the goods that are available and

67
00:03:21,758 --> 00:03:26,430
that they'll bid their true values and
that the winner the one who valued

68
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:28,780
the most will actually end up
winning at the end of the day.

69
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:30,500
>> Right.
You try to set up a structure so

70
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:34,080
that people will basically pay
what it is they really want or

71
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,030
at least will announce what
it is that they really want.

72
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:39,980
There are lots of variations on this and
in fact some version

73
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:43,730
very similar to this is sort of
what e-bay does but without babies

74
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:45,795
the baby in this case is the prize
>> E-baby.

75
00:03:45,795 --> 00:03:47,150
>> E-baby.

76
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:48,200
>> Wait a second.

77
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,400
>> We have a website.

78
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,553
Let's go get rich.

79
00:03:50,553 --> 00:03:56,993
>> [LAUGH] I think that's illegal.

80
00:03:56,993 --> 00:03:58,753
>> I think it depends.

81
00:03:58,753 --> 00:04:02,979
>> But I was just going to say that
if you switch the As to Bs and

82
00:04:02,979 --> 00:04:05,193
the Bs to As then eBay is baby.

83
00:04:05,193 --> 00:04:07,261
>> I do not understand how
you do stuff like that.

84
00:04:07,261 --> 00:04:08,153
But I'm impressed.

85
00:04:08,153 --> 00:04:09,160
>> All right.
>> Okay so

86
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:12,230
here we are so yeah auction and by the
way you might think that this would be

87
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:14,760
a natural segue to
talking about auctions.

88
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,378
But that'll be our third class
that will never actually do.

89
00:04:17,378 --> 00:04:19,204
[LAUGH] Seem fair?

90
00:04:19,204 --> 00:04:21,257
>> At least for being honest
we're getting our true value.

91
00:04:21,257 --> 00:04:22,560
[LAUGH]
>> That's true.
