1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:04,080
I asked you to determine the bug
in each of these lines of code.

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,310
Hopefully, you were able to do
it by just looking at that line.

3
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:10,190
For this solution video, I'm going to
enter these lines of code into

4
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:14,690
Android Studio so that you can see what
error Android Studio would give us, and

5
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:16,879
we're going to fix it as well so
that there are no errors.

6
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:23,030
I temporarily commented out this line of
code using the double forward slash so

7
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:25,370
that it doesn't show that
there's a red error every time.

8
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,710
We'll switch back to
the code we had before, but

9
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:32,700
I just wanted a place where I
could add these test strings.

10
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:36,540
If I type in string title =
"Today's Specials", I get an error.

11
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:39,600
It says that it can't
resolve the symbol string.

12
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,450
That's because Java doesn't recognize
the type string with lowercase s.

13
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:45,010
It needs to have a capital S.

14
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:50,390
Now it recognizes this data type,
and there's no errors.

15
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:51,550
There's an error on the second line, but

16
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:54,450
I'm going to comment it out
with a double forward slash.

17
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:57,980
That way the computer won't
try to compile that line.

18
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:00,110
Technically this string isn't
going to go into our app, so

19
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:01,850
we don't need it to work
with the rest of our code.

20
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:07,240
If I type in specialOfTheDay =
"Cafe Latte", I also get an error.

21
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:10,000
It says cannot resolve
symbol specialOfTheDay.

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,620
That's because this variable
was not created earlier.

23
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:14,800
This is the first time we're using it,
and so

24
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,920
we need to specify the data
type in front of it.

25
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:21,000
So we'll say String
specialOfTheDay = "Caffe Latte",

26
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,450
and that fixes the problem.

27
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:28,780
Now I've typed in String nutritionInfo
= "500 calories or less.

28
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:29,720
Under the string here,

29
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,930
I get a red underline that says
illegal line and in string literal.

30
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:37,640
I was trying to create a string literal
here, but I forgot the end quote.

31
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:40,440
So we need to add that, and
that fixes the problem.

32
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:44,690
The last one is String
drink name = "iced coffee".

33
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:48,150
The word name is highlighted in red, and

34
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:51,080
I get an error saying it cannot
resolve the symbol name.

35
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:55,690
The reason is because a variable name
should be in camelCase with no spaces.

36
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:58,640
So I need to get rid of the space here,
and if there's two words,

37
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,090
you can just capitalize
the beginning of the second word.

38
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:04,454
And that fixes the error.

39
00:02:04,454 --> 00:02:07,640
For the name of the drink,
you might want to capitalize the I or

40
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,710
the C here, but it's really up to you.

41
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:13,280
Anything you put in the double
quotes is your choice, and

42
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,400
the Java compiler won't complain
about those types of errors.

43
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:20,640
Great, you've really mastered how
to create strings in Java now.
