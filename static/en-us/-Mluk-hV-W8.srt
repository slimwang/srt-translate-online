00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:01,800
Quick quiz.

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:07,410
It is better to compute gradients using, convolution since that's

3
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:10,585
the right way to model filtering so you don't get flipped results.

4
00:00:10,585 --> 00:00:14,210
B) correlation because it's easier to

5
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:18,205
know which way is which which way the derivatives are being computed.

6
00:00:18,205 --> 00:00:20,020
C) it doesn't really matter.

7
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:24,300
Or, d) neither since I can just write a for-loop and

8
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:25,279
it'll compute the derivatives.
