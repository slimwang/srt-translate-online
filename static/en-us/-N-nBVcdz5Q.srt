00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Now you will learn about the three Ms in statistics:

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
the mean, the median, and the mode.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
And these are terms that are really important to know.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
They are useful in looking at data, and they are often confused.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
So let me bring clarity to the story of the three Ms.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Let's talk about the first.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
We talked quite a bit about house prices,

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
and here is a list of possible house prices.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
The mean is using the exact same formula as in the previous unit.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
It's the average of all those prices over here.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Do me a favor and quickly compute it for those numbers over here.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
When you put in the number, don't worry about the thousands.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 99:59:59,999
It's something between 165 and 190.
