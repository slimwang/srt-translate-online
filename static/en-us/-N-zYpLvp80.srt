00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,420
Although we each have our own set of traits, sometimes

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:05,880
it's useful to think about traits among a population of

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:10,450
individuals. For example, a population is a particular group or

4
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:13,410
type of people in an area. So although there are

5
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:16,540
many ways to identify a population, a common metric is

6
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:19,330
geography, as you can see here, with a map of

7
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:22,790
the world. Just as people and families share common traits

8
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:26,600
because they're genetically related and they share a common environment.

9
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:29,910
Some geographic populations share common traits because, like

10
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:33,560
families, they're also genetically related and share a common

11
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:36,860
environment. For example. Here's a map of the

12
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:41,210
world, divided by countries, showing you the breakdown for

13
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:44,110
the trait of sex. For our purposes, sex

14
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:46,030
simply means whether or not you have male or

15
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:49,100
female reproductive organs. Now, it is true that

16
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:52,030
it's possible to have both male and female reproductive

17
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:55,500
parts, and those are called intersex individuals. But for

18
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:58,300
our purposes we're only going to consider two categories in

19
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:02,030
the meantime. In our world map here, the redder

20
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:05,630
a country seems, the more males to females it has

21
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:08,510
in its population. And the more blue a country

22
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:11,550
appears, the more females to males you have in that

23
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:14,890
country. The closer it is to a more neutral

24
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:17,550
color, white. So a, a lighter blue, a lighter red.

25
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:22,060
Or a white color, in fact. This means that the male and female ratio is

26
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:26,130
roughly equal. So what I want you to do is look at the map here and

27
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:31,310
tell me. Which two geographic regions in the map here have the highest imbalance

28
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:37,020
of either males or females? Is it Canada, Russia.

29
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:42,620
China, Saudi Arabia, Australia, or Brazil. Remember, I want

30
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:45,800
you to pick two geographic regions that have the highest

31
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:49,240
imbalance of either males or females. Remember to use the

32
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,360
legend over here and look at the map to see

33
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,460
if you can figure out which countries have the highest imbalance.
