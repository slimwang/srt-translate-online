1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,130
Here's another interesting
example I'm going to show you.

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:06,460
This reminds me, and
I hope it reminds you folks,

3
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:09,120
of the kinds of stuff we
see in Harry Potter movies.

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,990
By the way,
this work was done in 2000, so

5
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:13,490
before any of the Harry Potter movies or
books.

6
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:17,220
And the idea was we basically had was
let's actually put a camera on a person

7
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:20,590
and create a video portrait, where they
sit and make a few expressions and

8
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:25,610
then we actually now create a portrait
that actually has them alive,

9
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:29,150
that is moving around in infinitely
long doing this kind of stuff.

10
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:32,900
That's what we did in this case is we
basically video recorded a person for

11
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:38,210
a few seconds and used that to generate
an infinitely long live video portrait.

12
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:41,640
Here is, of course,
you can see the red bar will jump and

13
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,140
it's kind of showing it's going
from one frame to the other

14
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:46,550
in showcasing a little bit
more of the alive scene.

15
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:51,740
Again, to me this reminds me of the
kinds of stuff of video portraits we see

16
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:53,390
in Harry Potter movies.

17
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:57,080
In this instance we actually go one step
further and actually we use two cameras.

18
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:59,156
Remember all of the stereo
stuff we looked at, and

19
00:00:59,156 --> 00:01:03,340
allow it also to kind of give
a little bit of depth to the scene.

20
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:06,210
So now the video texture is
actually going on when we do have

21
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:09,150
two different cameras and
we're moving them around and

22
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:11,130
kind of going from one
frame to the other.

23
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:13,400
This is referred to as view morphing and

24
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:17,640
allows us to kind of give it
a much more alive video portrait.

25
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:21,660
By the way, we will be doing an
assignment on using video textures and

26
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:23,700
you can actually try to do this for
yourselves also.
