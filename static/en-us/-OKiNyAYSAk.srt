1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,846
So cyber insurance was one way to,
remember managing risk accepted,

2
00:00:04,846 --> 00:00:05,827
transfer it.

3
00:00:05,827 --> 00:00:08,032
So cyber insurance is
how you transfer it.

4
00:00:08,032 --> 00:00:09,860
Is not very popular.

5
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:14,591
Based on a 2014 survey, what percentage
of customer's major insurance

6
00:00:14,591 --> 00:00:17,878
brokers were interested in
buying cyber insurance?

7
00:00:17,878 --> 00:00:21,520
There is more to read about it,
but car insurance is mandated,

8
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,090
you have to have it.

9
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:26,260
So when it comes to cyber,
the question is how many people

10
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:29,060
actually are interested in
buying cyber insurance.

11
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:32,955
Small, which is really,
the exact number is not important.

12
00:00:32,955 --> 00:00:34,952
Is small or significant?

13
00:00:34,952 --> 00:00:38,074
These are the two buckets
you're asked to choose from.

14
00:00:38,074 --> 00:00:41,230
So, what do you think?
Which answer is the right one?

15
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:44,200
Think and mark, and
then we'll talk about the solution.
