00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:03,742
From the function p over q, we can see from the denominator that the vertical

2
00:00:03,742 --> 00:00:08,966
asymptote is x equals negative 5 half's. The horizontal asymptote from our

00:00:08,966 --> 00:00:13,530
leading coefficients, is y equals negative 1 half. The graph that has these

4
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:17,710
asymptotes is graph C right here. Moving on to our second function, q over p of

5
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:23,238
x, the vertical asymptote is x equals negative 4. The horizontal asymptote is y

6
00:00:23,238 --> 00:00:27,659
equals negative 2, and that means that this goes with graph B.
