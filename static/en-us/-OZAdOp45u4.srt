Our sleep patterns are a result of Circadian rhythms which are biological

00:00:04,146 --> 00:00:09,630
processes that occur over approximately a 24-hour cycle. For example throughout

00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:14,078
a 24-hour period, our bodies will change in temperature. It'll peak a few hours

00:00:14,078 --> 00:00:18,355
before we go to bed. And soon after we wake up, but it will decrease when we're

00:00:18,355 --> 00:00:22,922
asleep. Production of certain chemicals, such as Melatonin. They will change

00:00:22,922 --> 00:00:26,712
our alertness throughout the day. I mentioned Melatonin, this is produced in

7
00:00:26,712 --> 00:00:30,829
the Pineal Gland, and it's important for sleep. It causes drowsiness and

00:00:30,829 --> 00:00:33,020
lowering of the body temperature.
