1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:04,170
Now this is how the finished Miwok app
will look by the end of this lesson.

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:08,020
So if we tap into a category and
tap on a list item.

3
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:11,200
>> [FOREIGN]
>> Each list item will play

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,710
the pronunciation for each word.

5
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:14,840
Let's try it out with some other ones.

6
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:19,284
Try family members, let's try daughter.

7
00:00:19,284 --> 00:00:21,280
>> [FOREIGN]
>> Nice.

8
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:22,750
How about phrases?

9
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:23,968
>> [FOREIGN]
>> Now,

10
00:00:23,968 --> 00:00:28,920
how can we go about adding
audio support to the app?

11
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:33,070
Well first, let's create a plan to help
us scope out the work for this feature.

12
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:37,080
And while it may be tempting to skip
this question and move on to the answer,

13
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:40,140
I strongly recommend that you take some
time to think over this question and

14
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:41,740
write something down.

15
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:45,000
Now as I mentioned to you in the
beginning of Lesson 3, it's common for

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,430
your team to ask you to
build out a certain feature.

17
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:50,090
And you may have absolutely
no idea where to start.

18
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:53,080
And that's exactly why we're guiding
you through this thought process

19
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,310
of adding this audio feature.

20
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:57,870
Remember that you can review
the steps from when we added

21
00:00:57,870 --> 00:00:59,190
the images to the app.

22
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:01,900
So those steps will be similar
to what we're doing when we

23
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:03,820
adding the audio to the app.

24
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:05,360
Now if you need additional help,

25
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,950
remember to check out
the hint below the quiz.

26
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:10,988
Now after you have your plan, the
biggest question you probably have is,

27
00:01:10,988 --> 00:01:13,400
how do you even play
an audio file on Android?

28
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:16,660
Now I want you to go online and
research what classes in Android

29
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:19,840
can help us play an audio file, and
go ahead and write your answers here.

30
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:23,990
I want to emphasize that the goal
of this lesson is not for

31
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:27,120
you to become an expert in
audio playback on Android.

32
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,890
The goal of this lesson is to give
you skills to learn a new part of

33
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:32,630
the Android platform that
you've never used before.

34
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:36,250
You'll get practice reading tutorials,
scanning documentation and

35
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:38,490
even building out a small sample app,

36
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:42,380
all to help you figure out how to add
this new feature into the Miwok app.

37
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:45,650
And in the future, we hope that you can
apply these skills to learning a new

38
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:48,070
part of Android that you wouldn't
have ever encountered before.
