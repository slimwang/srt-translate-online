1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,690
Couple of things to point out here now,
and

2
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:04,770
this is something that you may
have started thinking about.

3
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:07,470
So, imagine there is a pendulum,
which is swinging.

4
00:00:08,652 --> 00:00:10,430
Of course, in the case of a pendulum,

5
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:13,110
there are two place it might
be the most similar, right?

6
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:14,380
When it's coming down this way,

7
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:19,270
if I'm just doing an image, it's similar
here, and of course, it's coming down,

8
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:21,570
but it might be also similar
when it's on this side.

9
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:24,390
So, what will happen in this
instance is something like this.

10
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:29,040
So, if you notice it started finding
similarities before it's come all

11
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:32,110
the way down, and of course,
it's kind of jittering because of it.

12
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:35,050
Again, simply put what
happens in a pendulum is,

13
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:38,350
that it's similar at this point,
both when it's coming down and up, so

14
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:41,580
basically it might just do this,
rather than go all the way down.

15
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:43,820
Well, that allows,
kind of creates a problem, and

16
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:47,280
the way we fix it is by modeling
a little bit more of the dynamics.

17
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,800
So, the pendulum here is
basically coming this way,

18
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,090
there are two different options.

19
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:54,310
I want to be able to kind of
make sure that I kind of keep

20
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:56,300
the motion trajectories in check.

21
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:58,100
And that allows us to then create,

22
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:01,110
even an infinitely long
pendulum motion like this.

23
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:03,880
So, just keeping in mind, and
doing a little bit of look ahead,

24
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,920
modeling the dynamics
allows us to do this, and

25
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,320
the Markov chains
representation supports this.
