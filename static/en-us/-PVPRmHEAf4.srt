1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:03,600
>> First provide
confidentiality of a message.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,180
This is typically not a strength
of asymmetric encryption,

3
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:12,326
because asymmetric encryption is much
slower than symmetric encryption.

4
00:00:12,326 --> 00:00:17,060
And therefore let me try to protect
the confidentiality of a message,

5
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:22,520
we typically use symmetric encryption
instead of using asymmetric encryption.

6
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:26,820
Therefore, this is not a task that
asymmetric encryption is good at.

7
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,740
Second, securely
distribute a session key.

8
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:34,750
A session key is used to encrypt
all messages during a session.

9
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:37,180
For example, a web browsing session.

10
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:39,390
We can use a session key to encrypt and

11
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:43,880
provide confidentiality of all
the communications within that session.

12
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:47,940
This is a task that asymmetric
encryption is better at.

13
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:53,330
For example, if Alice and Bob wants to
establish a session key between them.

14
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:58,300
It is easy for Bob for example,
to create a session key and then

15
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:02,950
encrypt the session key using Alice's
public key and send over to Alice.

16
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:06,530
It is guaranteed that only
Alice can decrypt a message and

17
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:12,150
extract the session key, because only
Alice has the corresponding private key.

18
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:16,740
Therefore, this is a task that
asymmetric encryption is good at.

19
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:18,570
Third, scalability.

20
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:23,310
Imagine we have N users and they need to
communicate with each other securely.

21
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:27,120
For example to have confidentiality
in their communication.

22
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:30,330
In this case,
we need N square number of keys.

23
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:30,980
Whereas for

24
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:35,315
asymmetric encryption, regardless
of how many users are involved.

25
00:01:35,315 --> 00:01:40,295
We only require that each user has
one public key and one private key.

26
00:01:40,295 --> 00:01:43,845
Therefore, asymmetric encryption
is much more scalable.
