1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
And the correct answer is 23.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
We need 1 parameter for the prior p (spam),

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and then we have 2 dictionary distributions of any word,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
i given spam, and the same for ham.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Now, there's 12 words in a dictionary,

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
but this distribution only needs 11 parameters,

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
so 12 can be figured out because they have to add up to 1.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
And the same is true over here, so if you add all these together,

9
00:00:27,000 --> 99:59:59,999
we get 23.
