1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Now comes the tricky part, and I want you to answer it for me.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,000
What is the joint probability that the true location is 2 and Monty chooses to show me 1?

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
What is the joint probability for the location be 2 and Monty shows me 2?

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Two and three, clearly, the true location in this case is 2

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
and I've picked 2, so in this specific situation Monty has a chance to choose from

6
00:00:22,000 --> 99:59:59,999
the two other doors and say he picks them at 50% chance randomly.
