00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,172
I could figure these first three out on my own without a calculator, just by

2
00:00:03,172 --> 00:00:07,601
using the method we've been using. I rewrote each of the numbers we wanted to

3
00:00:07,601 --> 00:00:13,006
take the log base 10 of as 10 to some power. 1 is 10 to the 0, so that gave us

4
00:00:13,006 --> 00:00:20,360
0. 10 is 10 to the 1, so taking its log in base 10 gives us 1. And log base 10

5
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:25,732
of 100 equals 2. However, I don't know how to write the number 2 or the number

6
00:00:25,732 --> 00:00:31,079
20 or the number 200 as 10 to some power. So for these, I need to use my

7
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:36,901
calculator, let's try one of them out. How about the first one? So, log base 10

8
00:00:36,901 --> 00:00:42,540
of 2 equals this long decimal. I'm going to round to the fifth decimal place.

9
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:45,501
Entering the last two problems on the calculator, gives me long decimals as

10
00:00:45,501 --> 00:00:53,469
well. Log base 10 of 20 is 1.30103, about. And log base 10 of 200 is about

11
00:00:53,469 --> 00:00:59,364
2.30103. Please remember, these are rounded answers.
