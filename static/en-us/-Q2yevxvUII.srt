You'll need to use an Object3D to let you rotate after translation. Here's my

2
00:00:04,955 --> 00:00:09,137
solution for the minuteHand. The cube is translated to the correct pivot point

3
00:00:09,137 --> 00:00:13,186
by the position. That does't change. A minuteHand is then added and then rotated

4
00:00:13,186 --> 00:00:17,292
into place. This new object is then added to the scene. It's this minuteHand

5
00:00:17,292 --> 00:00:22,198
object that undergoes that rotation gives us what we want. Similar code is added

6
00:00:22,198 --> 00:00:23,423
for the hour hand.
