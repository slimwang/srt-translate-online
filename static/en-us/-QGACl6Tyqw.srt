00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,270
The answer is, all of these are computer programs except

2
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:04,150
for the slice of toast. In general, if you can

3
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:06,990
eat something it's not a computer program. The programs that

4
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:09,220
you write in this class will be Python code. Those

5
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:11,250
will be input to another program, which is a Python

6
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:14,710
interpreter that follows instructions in your code, and it does

7
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:17,460
that by following the instructions in its code. And you'll

8
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:19,140
be able to run all that using your web browser.
