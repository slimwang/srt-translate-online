1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,330
We're not quite done yet
with implementing

2
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:04,046
the tablet UIwire frames.

3
00:00:04,046 --> 00:00:06,072
The detail fragment 
should look like this,

4
00:00:06,072 --> 00:00:07,868
but instead it 
looks more like this.

5
00:00:07,868 --> 00:00:09,954
For the tablet UI, 
we try to optimize it

6
00:00:09,954 --> 00:00:12,560
more for wider screens 
like tablet landscape mode.

7
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:14,400
Another good place 
for this layout,

8
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,079
is in the phone landscape view,

9
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:18,710
where there's more horizontal space
than vertical space.

10
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:21,196
For this quiz, figure out 
which layout folders,

11
00:00:21,196 --> 00:00:23,762
we would need to define
the fragment-detail layout in.

12
00:00:23,762 --> 00:00:26,160
in order to achieve this layout 
on phone portrait

13
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,790
and this layout
for phone landscape and tablet.
