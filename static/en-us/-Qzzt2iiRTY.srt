Jake, did you sort this one out?

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:04,900
>> Yep, and here is what I did.

3
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:07,833
Over in showCachedMessages I start
by creating a transaction for

4
00:00:07,833 --> 00:00:08,693
the Wittrs store.

5
00:00:11,852 --> 00:00:14,336
Then I get the objectStore.

6
00:00:14,336 --> 00:00:16,360
Then I get the by-date index.

7
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:21,309
I use getAll, which returns a promise
for everything in the index.

8
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:24,520
And I pass the results to addPosts.

9
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:29,460
However, the messages here will be
in date-ascending order by default.

10
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:33,210
So, I reverse them so
the latest post appears at the top.

11
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:35,580
I want to see how this update
works the natural way.

12
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:38,930
So I'm going to bump the service
worker cache version.

13
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:41,850
Then over in the browser,
I'm going to disable Force update.

14
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:42,910
Then I'll refresh the page.

15
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:45,410
There's our update.

16
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:45,920
We'll take it.

17
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,920
And now,
if I take the server offline and

18
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,530
refresh the page,
we get the last post we saw.
