00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,070
>> This one was c. If you got it right, excellent work. Just like in the first

2
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:07,964
practice problem, we want to get the boundary line, so let's solve this

3
00:00:07,964 --> 00:00:12,104
inequality for y. First we subtract 3x from both sides, then we divide both

4
00:00:12,104 --> 00:00:16,288
sides of the inequality by negative 5. Remember, both these terms need to be

5
00:00:16,288 --> 00:00:20,941
divided by negative 5. And here we need to be very careful. We divided by a

6
00:00:20,941 --> 00:00:25,971
negative so we need to reverse the inequality sign. Now we're ready to graph.

7
00:00:25,971 --> 00:00:31,050
The y intercept is negative 3, which is here. 3 units down from the origin. Our

8
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:35,705
slope is positive 3 5ths, so we rise 3 units up and run 5 units to the right.

9
00:00:35,705 --> 00:00:40,405
Now, I have two points and I can draw my boundary line. I have a less than

10
00:00:40,405 --> 00:00:45,265
symbol so I need to draw a dash line, because I can't include points on the

11
00:00:45,265 --> 00:00:50,403
line. And finally, we use a test point to determine which region should be

12
00:00:50,403 --> 00:00:55,440
shaded, the top region or the lower region. If I plug in 0 for x and 0 for y I

13
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:00,572
get 0 is less than negative 3. I know this statement isn't true, so I don't want

14
00:01:00,572 --> 00:01:05,266
points in this region. I want this region. This should be my solution region and

15
00:01:05,266 --> 00:01:09,537
I can test another point in this region to be sure I'm going to use the point

16
00:01:09,537 --> 00:01:14,041
zero negative four and remember you could choose any point in this region. It

17
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:19,676
wouldn't matter. If I plug in 0 for x and negative 4 for y, I get negative 4 is

18
00:01:19,676 --> 00:01:25,692
less than negative 3. This is a true statement, so yeah, I did this problem

19
00:01:25,692 --> 00:01:26,707
correctly.
