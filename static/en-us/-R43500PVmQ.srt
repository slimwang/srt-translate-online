1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:04,140
We saw that how structure of the data
that is stored in an interrelational

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:07,600
database changes the way
we do access control.

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,280
We also saw that certain
kind of queries,

4
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:14,470
in particular queries that
return arrogate results,

5
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:19,250
can leak potentially sensitive
data via inference attacks.

6
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:22,030
So we studied this new kind of attacks.

7
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:24,270
Inference and injection attacks.

8
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:28,380
And ways in which we can address
those attacks for database systems.
