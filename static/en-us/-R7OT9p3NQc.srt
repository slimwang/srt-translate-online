1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:05,344
In our first example, you could work 40 hours and earn $400. Let's say you start

2
00:00:05,344 --> 00:00:10,610
a new job that pays a different hourly wage. Now you're going to work 35 hours

3
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:15,890
and earn $630. At this new job, let's say you worked 35 hours and you earned

4
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:21,342
$630. How much could you earn working 50 hours? Whenever we saw problems

5
00:00:21,342 --> 00:00:25,500
involving variation we want to set up a proportion. So let's make this really

6
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:30,880
simple. If I worked one hour, I would earn $10 based on my original example. So

7
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,754
if I work double that amount of time, I would get double the amount of money. I

8
00:00:34,754 --> 00:00:41,063
would earn $20. Notice that if my hours worked increased then my amount of money

9
00:00:41,063 --> 00:00:45,068
also increased. This is so that way these two fractions will be equal. And one

10
00:00:45,068 --> 00:00:49,163
of the biggest things we want to make sure of when solving variation problems is

11
00:00:49,163 --> 00:00:53,938
that we have one fraction involving hours another involving income. We always

12
00:00:53,938 --> 00:00:58,456
want to keep our units the same. Whenever we have direct variation, the first

13
00:00:58,456 --> 00:01:03,384
amount of one unit will be directly across from the first amount of the second

14
00:01:03,384 --> 00:01:08,238
unit. So when I'm filling in this proportion, 35 hours should go here for the

15
00:01:08,238 --> 00:01:13,178
amount of hours worked for one And $630 should go here for the income worked for

16
00:01:13,178 --> 00:01:20,353
1, because if we work 35 hours, we earned $630. So you try solving this one. How

17
00:01:20,353 --> 00:01:24,452
much money could we earn if we worked 50 hours? Be sure you don't include the

18
00:01:24,452 --> 00:01:27,823
dollar sign in your answer. I already have that written for you.
