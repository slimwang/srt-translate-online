00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:05,436
Here the solutions are 4 plus or minus the square root of 13. Great work if you

2
00:00:05,436 --> 00:00:09,146
found those answers. Again, we start by moving this constant term to the right

3
00:00:09,146 --> 00:00:15,235
side of our equation. So, we have x square, minus 8x equals negative 3. Next,

4
00:00:15,235 --> 00:00:17,935
we want to add the same amount to both sides of our equation, so that we can

5
00:00:17,935 --> 00:00:24,140
complete the square. Our b is negative 8. So, b over 2 squared equals positive

6
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:28,930
16. We add that amount to both sides, and then we rewrite the left hand side of

7
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:33,850
our equation using x minus 4 squared. Now that we have a perfect square, we

8
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:38,014
take the square root of both sides. To get x minus 4 is equal to plus or minus

9
00:00:38,014 --> 00:00:43,503
root 13. We add four to both sides to get x by itself, so 1x is equal to 4 plus

10
00:00:43,503 --> 00:00:47,513
or minus the square root of 13.
