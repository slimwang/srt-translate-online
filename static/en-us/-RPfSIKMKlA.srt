Hi, and
welcome to the lesson on VR interaction.

2
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:04,600
So, Chris,

3
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:08,010
what do you think are the most
important elements of VR interaction?

4
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:10,070
&gt;&gt; Well,
I think that in virtual reality,

5
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:13,290
what's important is that instead
of the traditional two-dimensional

6
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:17,060
user interfaces we're used to,
the whole world becomes interactive.

7
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:21,280
So we'll be using scripts to make
3-D objects react to your gaze and

8
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:24,110
then you can use these
objects as well as

9
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:27,390
traditional user interface to move from
scene to scene and put it all together.

10
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:31,630
&gt;&gt; Very cool, yeah,
that sounds like a lot of fun.

11
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:34,510
&gt;&gt; We'll also be looking at how you
can change scenes so that you can

12
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:38,920
put together an entire interactive
experience that the user can go through.

13
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:40,590
And I think it'll be a lot of fun.

14
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:41,550
Let's get started.
