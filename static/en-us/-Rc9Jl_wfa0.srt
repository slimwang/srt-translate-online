1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
The answer is that E has to be 1 because E is the carry digit.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
After adding up these two 3-digit numbers we get a little bit more,

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
and the most that the carry digit could be is a 1.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,000
If O stood for 9, even 9 plus 9 is 18, and we might carry over a little bit.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
But still that's 19. It's not 28.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
So the E must be a 1.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 99:59:59,999
We could go on from there and figure other things.
