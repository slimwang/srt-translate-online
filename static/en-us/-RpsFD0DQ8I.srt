1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,964
The first watch has an OLED display
with low-bit ambient mode and

2
00:00:03,964 --> 00:00:05,802
is currently in ambient mode.

3
00:00:05,802 --> 00:00:08,182
The correct answer for
this is number four.

4
00:00:08,182 --> 00:00:12,016
It does not use an NTA listing,
the colors are solid and it uses less

5
00:00:12,016 --> 00:00:15,867
than 5% of the screen to save
battery and not burn in the display.

6
00:00:15,867 --> 00:00:18,705
We have an OLED display with
a low-bit ambient mode and

7
00:00:18,705 --> 00:00:21,310
it's currently in interactive mode.

8
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:24,916
The correct answer for this is number
one, the watch is in interactive mode.

9
00:00:24,916 --> 00:00:29,676
So full color animation and anything
else, so totally fine and recommended.

10
00:00:29,676 --> 00:00:34,909
The next watch has an LCD display, which
does not show color in ambient mode and

11
00:00:34,909 --> 00:00:37,140
it is currently in ambient mode.

12
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:39,531
The correct answer for
this one is number two.

13
00:00:39,531 --> 00:00:42,742
Since it can show grey scale images,
although three and

14
00:00:42,742 --> 00:00:44,872
four would also be acceptable here.

15
00:00:44,872 --> 00:00:47,896
And for the final question,
we have an LCD display,

16
00:00:47,896 --> 00:00:51,838
no color in ambient mode and
we're currently in interactive mode.

17
00:00:51,838 --> 00:00:54,833
The correct answer for
this one is also number one, as well.

18
00:00:54,833 --> 00:00:56,458
The watch is in interactive mode.

19
00:00:56,458 --> 00:00:59,578
So full color animation and
anything else are totally fine and

20
00:00:59,578 --> 00:01:01,080
recommended here, as well.
