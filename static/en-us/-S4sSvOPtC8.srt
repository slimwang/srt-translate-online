00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,776
Now that you have an idea of what a logarithm is, let's explore their

2
00:00:02,776 --> 00:00:08,433
properties. Since the logarithm of a number is an exponent. Let's actually

3
00:00:08,433 --> 00:00:11,544
review the properties of exponents first, so that way, we can see how they

4
00:00:11,544 --> 00:00:16,500
apply to logarithms. What's the result of each of these operations? You should

5
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:20,980
write your answer using x as the base, and then using some combination of a and

6
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:23,630
b for the exponent.
