1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:02,399
We design our projects
to be challenging,

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:05,179
and you'll almost certainly
feel frustrated at times.

3
00:00:05,179 --> 00:00:08,759
But what's unique about learning with
Udacity is that we provide you with

4
00:00:08,759 --> 00:00:13,529
several kinds of human, personal support
options to make sure you succeed and

5
00:00:13,529 --> 00:00:14,809
graduate.

6
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:17,839
To find out more about this,
I'm going to bring Lisbeth.

7
00:00:17,839 --> 00:00:20,379
>> I'm Lisbeth Ortega,
Udacity's community manager.

8
00:00:20,379 --> 00:00:21,070
To begin with,

9
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:24,480
every project you create is code
reviewed with detailed personal feedback

10
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,140
by a friendly expert and returned to
you, on average, within 24 hours.

11
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:31,250
You simply can't get personalized
feedback like this anywhere else.

12
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:35,480
And, additionally, you can submit these
projects as many times as you need.

13
00:00:35,479 --> 00:00:37,269
Our reviewers are trained, vetted,

14
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:40,470
global experts who love to provide
critical feedback and help you grow.

15
00:00:41,479 --> 00:00:44,699
Additionally, you have access to
a dedicated helpful mentor who

16
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,960
acts as a personal adviser
throughout the program.

17
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:52,179
Your mentor is always accessible, and
you can reach out to them when you need.

18
00:00:52,179 --> 00:00:56,340
They'll help you stay on track and make
the most of your Udacity experience.

19
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:00,180
This is another service you'll
only find with us at Udacity.

20
00:01:00,179 --> 00:01:03,350
If you have particular technical
questions, you can ask them on our

21
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:07,500
forums and receive answers from Udacity
staff so that you'll never stay stuck.

22
00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:11,609
Finally, our student body is the most
important part of the Udacity

23
00:01:11,609 --> 00:01:12,349
experience.

24
00:01:12,349 --> 00:01:17,229
Our students form a worldwide community
of which you are now an integral member.

25
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:18,549
In this nanodegree program,

26
00:01:18,549 --> 00:01:22,259
as in all Udacity programs, your peers
will be an invaluable resource to you.

27
00:01:23,319 --> 00:01:24,289
And just as in a brick and

28
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:27,090
mortar institution,
it's important to get to know them.

29
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:30,015
To facilitate this, we work hard
to introduce you to your peers.

30
00:01:30,015 --> 00:01:32,540
In particular,
we'll arrange both online and

31
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:36,010
offline study groups where
you'll meet face to face.

32
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:38,594
We'll support students meetups and
industry events,

33
00:01:38,594 --> 00:01:42,060
and engender a community atmosphere
to ensure your learning experience is

34
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,680
as rich as possible.

35
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,910
We'll also help you interact online
through our forums, Slack and

36
00:01:46,909 --> 00:01:48,299
other online tools.

37
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:48,939
>> Thank you, Lisbeth.

38
00:01:50,129 --> 00:01:53,409
Here at Udacity we've built a fantastic
support network to help students

39
00:01:53,409 --> 00:01:55,759
like you surpass your expectations.

40
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:59,670
We hope you take full advantage of these
resources to reach your goals and more.
