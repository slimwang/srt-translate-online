1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:06,010
What do we really want to do is, have the first picture appear at zero, zero

2
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:11,710
and have the next picture appear a little bit after the last X coordinate

3
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:17,720
of the first one. We could call getMaxX to get that last X coordinate, and

4
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:21,530
then add a small value to it. This way they would be 10 pixels apart.
