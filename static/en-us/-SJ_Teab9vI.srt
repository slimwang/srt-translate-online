1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,320
Now remember, one of the things that
we've talked about in this class,

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:05,360
is how the camera has evolved.

3
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:09,880
Our relationship with the camera has
gone from this kind of a tripod setup,

4
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:13,680
to much more distant, to even
this kind of casual relationship.

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,570
And that's what's important and
especially true now that we have

6
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:22,250
cameras like this or even Go-Pros, which
is like the, one I showed you earlier.

7
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:24,570
And you know variable cameras and
stuff showing up.

8
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:26,520
So more and
more of these devices are coming up.

9
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:30,590
So now we need to start looking at
other ways of doing stabilization

10
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:33,980
without actually having to carry a
profession rig like the one we just saw.
