00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,394
I get rid of those little boxes just to make our whole graph area look a little

2
00:00:04,406 --> 00:00:08,914
bit cleaner. Since our x values need to range from negative five to five on this

3
00:00:08,926 --> 00:00:13,409
portion of the axis that we've drawn, each of these grid lengths needs to count

4
00:00:13,421 --> 00:00:17,689
for one. So, when we step from zero, one step over, we need to label that one,

5
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:22,378
two, three, and so on. And you see we get to five on the positive edge of the

6
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:26,545
axis. Counting in the negative direction, we had the same scale. So, we have

7
00:00:26,557 --> 00:00:30,442
negative 1, negative 2. And you can see, I even made a mistake when I was

8
00:00:30,454 --> 00:00:34,491
drawing these axes. I made our x-axis one longer than it needed to be, which

9
00:00:34,682 --> 00:00:38,988
doesn't really hurt us, so I'm going to leave it as is. I apologize for my lack

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,890
of perfection here. Now, in the y-direction, we need to be able to go from

11
00:00:42,902 --> 00:00:47,122
positive 10 all the way down to negative 20. We have 5 boxes up here and 10

12
00:00:47,134 --> 00:00:51,171
boxes down here. So, that means we need to count by 2s with each step of teh

13
00:00:51,183 --> 00:00:55,455
graph. So, moving from 0 up one box, is going to actually be stepping 2 in the

14
00:00:55,455 --> 00:00:59,973
y-direction and then down into the same scale again. Now, again, the point of

15
00:00:59,985 --> 00:01:04,126
creating these scales and these limited links for either access is really just

16
00:01:04,138 --> 00:01:08,147
to make our lives easier a little bit when we're graphing. The x and y values

17
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,060
for this graph do extend, actually, all the way from negative infinity to

18
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:16,238
positive infinity. We're only going to graph part of that infinitely long line,

19
00:01:16,333 --> 00:01:19,579
in particular, the part that shows these values on this graph.
