1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:04,730
So, for this quiz, I want you to try and
create your own customized watchface.

2
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:07,357
You'll notice in
the SweepWatchFaceService and

3
00:00:07,357 --> 00:00:11,490
the AnalogWatchFaceService that
it draws an mBackgroundBitmap.

4
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:15,160
The existing bitmap is a very dark
gradient, so you'll barely see it.

5
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:18,390
What I want you to do is to
replace the image this references

6
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:19,800
to your own custom image.

7
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,646
So, you could put up a picture of a
friend or a pet, like my dog Mila here.

8
00:00:23,646 --> 00:00:28,301
You can use any 320x320 image
in either PNG or JPG format.

9
00:00:28,301 --> 00:00:30,020
Don't use anything too large, or

10
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:33,111
it could cause the watchface to
run out of memory resizing it.

11
00:00:33,111 --> 00:00:37,380
Also, make sure you test your watchface
in interactive and ambient mode.

12
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:40,270
You'll need to hide the background
image in ambient mode, and

13
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:42,270
clear the canvas to black instead.

14
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:45,225
So, go and implement your change in
either the SweepWatchFaceService or

15
00:00:45,225 --> 00:00:46,850
the AnalogWatchFaceService.

16
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:48,630
And then test it on your device or
emulator.
