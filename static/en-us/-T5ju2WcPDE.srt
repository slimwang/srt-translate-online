Hi! In this unit, it's time to get Apollo 13 to the moon and back.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Doing so requires quite some accuracy in our computations.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
This is why we look into some better tricks to solve differential equations on the computer

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
but eventually we can fire the rocket boosters to save the crew.
