1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:01,870
So do you get it now?

2
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:04,820
Do you now understand how you
can earn money from an app?

3
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:07,170
Yeah!

4
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:11,720
And the great thing is that we haven't
even started coding our app yet.

5
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:16,440
This way we can plan right from
the start how to get ads in our app.

6
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,840
Creating a great experience for
our users.

7
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,250
That's right.

8
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:26,860
Designing your app from the start with
ads in mind is the way to look at it.

9
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:29,870
I got these ad things cold down now.

10
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:31,150
I can't wait to get started!

11
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:32,130
Hold on.

12
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:34,030
Hold your horses.

13
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:36,440
We've barely scratched the surface.

14
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:40,430
There are so many more things
to learn and use for ads.

15
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:42,580
For example, analytics.

16
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:45,480
So you can see how the user
interacts with your ad.

17
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:49,720
There is mediation, to interact
with additional ad networks, and

18
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:54,510
house ads, to cross promote
your ads in our purchases.

19
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:56,125
And then you can also.

20
00:00:56,125 --> 00:00:57,483
Okay, Okay.

21
00:00:57,483 --> 00:01:00,380
I understand, but
don't confuse the student.

22
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:07,020
Dear student, look at the instructor
notes here for lots more information.

23
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:08,120
And since there is so

24
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:13,360
much more in ads we might just create
the sequel lesson to cover those.

25
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:15,380
Now, you're talking.

26
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:19,888
And, you there student,
have enough to get started.

27
00:01:19,888 --> 00:01:21,043
That's right.

28
00:01:21,043 --> 00:01:22,221
Happy coding.
