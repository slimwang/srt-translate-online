1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:03,690
All right,
let's see what we're dealing with.

2
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:05,830
Now, I love the blue and
the minimalist approach.

3
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:09,390
Points for guessing my favorite color,
but I feel like it could do a bit more.

4
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:12,860
There aren't really any animations or
magic moments or anything.

5
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:15,010
Oh, but there's this notification.

6
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:18,420
That'll be handy and
really helps add to the experience.

7
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:21,510
Although, I'd love to see a widget or
something else to allow me to set up

8
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:23,740
a permanent weather display
that fits with my device.

9
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:27,040
But this doesn't look like what
the weather outside looks like.

10
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:29,120
I wonder how to change that.

11
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:31,610
Of course, it would be nice if I
didn't need to do this manually.

12
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:36,210
Remember that the initial experience is
often the turning point between someone

13
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:38,260
uninstalling an app and
using it every day.

14
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:41,980
Now let's see what the tablet
version looks like.

15
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:45,390
Mm-mm.
There's nothing here.

16
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:46,730
What's going on?

17
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:48,290
Oh, I'm not on Wi-Fi.

18
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:50,720
Sure would have been nice to know I
needed an internet connection and

19
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:51,890
not that the app was broken.

20
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:55,120
Okay.
Much better.

21
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,210
And I like the landscape layout,

22
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:58,130
with the weather details
right next to the list.

23
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:00,720
Really great use of
the extra space here.

24
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:01,240
Oh lord.

25
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,510
Looks like there's a few
edge cases they overlooked.

26
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:06,760
It means, Wednesday comes
around every week, after all.

27
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:10,320
It really is important to keep in mind
the huge variety of Android devices when

28
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,760
designing your app.

29
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,150
Well, I'll need to come
up with a plan of attack.

30
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:15,870
I'll check with Ian, and
between the two of us,

31
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:18,550
I'll bet we can settle on the core
of what needs to improve.

32
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:20,340
But I challenge you to take
a look at Sunshine, and

33
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:23,300
make a short list of what you think
should be done before launching the app.

34
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:26,030
Discuss your ideas in the student
forum and take note of where your list

35
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:27,990
intersects with ours as you
move through the course.
