1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:03,468
Recall that we have at least two ways in which we can deal with your stressful

2
00:00:03,468 --> 00:00:09,840
situations. One, is problem focus coping and the other is emotion focus coping.

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,272
Recall that with problem focused coping, we looked for strategies to solve the

4
00:00:13,272 --> 00:00:18,500
problem and therefore, reduce our stress. With emotion focus coping, we look at

5
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:21,800
ways in which we can reduce the negative emotional response that we experience

6
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:28,100
to stress. Now, we discussed a variety of emotion-focused coping responses.

7
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:31,345
Social support is one way in which we can reduce the negative emotional

8
00:00:31,345 --> 00:00:36,930
responses that we feel in regards to stress. Therefore, talking with friends or

9
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:40,414
family about stressful situations or predicaments in which we find ourselves,

10
00:00:40,414 --> 00:00:45,908
can go a long way in reducing our overall stress levels. This in turn we know

11
00:00:45,908 --> 00:00:50,920
is important for our overall brain health and immune system functioning.

12
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:54,160
Therefore, we want to avoid long term exposure to stress because we know

13
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,400
cortisol has a negative effect on the hippocampus and our immune system

14
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:02,852
functioning. Now, we're going to move on and see how stress affects our health,

15
00:01:02,852 --> 00:01:05,830
and Greg's going to introduce that topic for us.
