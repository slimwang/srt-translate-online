00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,480
So here is what all of our numbers are equal to. I hope your guesses were

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:08,720
close. I think looking at this last log down here, log base 10 of 3 million,

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:15,108
gives us a clue as to what's happening. Notice that this is equal to 6.47712,

4
00:00:15,108 --> 00:00:20,934
and we're taking the log of 3 times 10 to the 6th. So we have a 6 here and we

5
00:00:20,934 --> 00:00:26,558
have a 6 right here. Noticing that this decimal here is the same as for log

6
00:00:26,558 --> 00:00:31,396
base 10 of 3, it looks like what we have is log base 10 of 3, accounting for

7
00:00:31,396 --> 00:00:39,760
the .47712, plus log base 10 of 1 million. Since this is just 10 to the 6th.

8
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,871
That means that this is where we get that other 6 from, to make up this whole

9
00:00:42,871 --> 00:00:44,109
answer.
