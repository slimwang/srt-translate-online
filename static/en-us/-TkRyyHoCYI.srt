1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,920
So to talk about other tools
that you might use for

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:04,944
prototyping, we've brought
in Cody from Pixate.

3
00:00:04,944 --> 00:00:06,573
>> Hi, there.

4
00:00:06,573 --> 00:00:09,590
>> So Cody, what is Pixate?

5
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:14,770
>> Pixate is a prototyping
platform definitely used for

6
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:20,740
more intense animations or
detailed animations, interactions also.

7
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:24,410
But it's all done natively, so on
the device that you're prototyping for,

8
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:27,890
you get the same effects on
scroll views, on the animations,

9
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:31,510
anything that you would normally see in
an app, we can reproduce through Pixate.

10
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:32,830
>> Perfect, that's wonderful.

11
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:35,910
So it sounds like it's good at these
sort of higher fidelity prototypes.

12
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:37,810
It's good at these
micro-interactions and

13
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:41,240
getting things right when you're
doing some small part of the app.

14
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:45,960
>> Right, it definitely focuses on
reproducing a real experience within

15
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,410
the app, as opposed to, maybe ones that
are more, you know, like paper for

16
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:52,210
instance, or
anything like that where it,

17
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:54,150
you don't get the full feeling of it.

18
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:59,600
What you can do is, when you prototype
through Pixate, you can basically

19
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,560
hand this over to someone, a developer,
someone maybe you're selling the app to,

20
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:07,920
and show them exactly how you
expect it to work as the designer.

21
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,010
>> So a tool like Pixate would make
it much easier to have a design

22
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:13,400
consultation, we'll be doing
later on in the lesson.

23
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:16,754
So Cody, why are micro-interactions
important for a prototype?

24
00:01:16,754 --> 00:01:20,410
>> Micro-interactions are really
important from the design aspect because

25
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:24,350
you want to show exactly the animations,
the movement of the different elements

26
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:29,160
within the app to give everyone a better
idea of what you're trying to build and

27
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:31,190
what you kind of envision
as the designer.

28
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:34,170
>> So what kind of questions do you get
from entrepreneurs about your product?

29
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:37,500
>> A lot of questions
we get are related to

30
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,570
what to do with it once
you've created a prototype.

31
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:43,090
I feel like that may be kind of
a pain point for some people,

32
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:47,130
because they hear they have this design
and they can show it to whomever.

33
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:49,245
However, they get to hand
this over to a developer now,

34
00:01:49,245 --> 00:01:51,547
and show them exactly
the animations they're looking for.

35
00:01:51,547 --> 00:01:55,325
And the developer, for the most part,
can translate that over to code, and

36
00:01:55,325 --> 00:01:57,050
then generate the app from there.

37
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:59,256
>> Okay, so
once you've built the prototype,

38
00:01:59,256 --> 00:02:01,693
you get a lot of questions
about what to do with it,

39
00:02:01,693 --> 00:02:04,405
and your suggestions are pretty much,
have it built.

40
00:02:04,405 --> 00:02:06,880
>> Mm-hm, that's correct,
yeah, just build it.

41
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,750
Just hand it over to the developer and
build from there.

42
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:12,020
We want to work on obviously a lot
of ways to improve that process,

43
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:16,570
like giving in code export or,
you know, other features like that,

44
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:20,110
which we're kind of working
on alongside other features.

45
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:23,550
Ultimately, right now the best way
to do it is to just show them.

46
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:24,950
>> Okay, perfect.

47
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:28,390
So we've covered what you do once
you've gotten the Pixate prototype.

48
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:31,440
What is the process for
getting in to the Pixate prototype?

49
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,320
Let's say we've got people who have
an InVision prototype or have a set of

50
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:38,070
screens that have already been made,
what do they do to get that into Pixate?

51
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:39,958
>> Ideally, the best way to do it is,

52
00:02:39,958 --> 00:02:43,050
so the way the Pixate works is
it works solely with assets,

53
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:47,190
assets being images or soon actually
video, and things like that.

54
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:51,820
What they'll want to do is take that
information or those images they have

55
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:56,020
through InVision, those screens, and
transfer them into Sketch, Photoshop,

56
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:59,325
anything like that, and then from that
point they can put it into Pixate,

57
00:02:59,325 --> 00:03:00,920
create them as individual layers and

58
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:03,210
start playing around with
creating those interactions.

59
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:04,480
>> Perfect, thank you.

60
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,725
Thank you for coming in Cody.

61
00:03:05,725 --> 00:03:06,650
>> Not a problem at all, thank you.
