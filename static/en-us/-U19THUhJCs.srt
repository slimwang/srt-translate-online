1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:03,440
So, now that you have
the pets app codebase for

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:08,280
this exercise, I'd like you to take
some time to analyze the starter code.

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:11,560
So in order to help you focus your
attention on important components,

4
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:14,160
go ahead and
answer these five questions.

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,220
So, first name the 2
activities in the code.

6
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:21,060
Second, what type of button are we
using to connect the 2 activities?

7
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:25,360
Are we using a toggle button,
a floating action button, or a spinner?

8
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:29,300
And third, which of these many
options exists in either activity?

9
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:30,250
And check all that apply.

10
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:35,351
So, is there a Delete All Pets
menu option, an Insert Dummy Data

11
00:00:35,351 --> 00:00:40,630
menu option, a Settings menu option,
or perhaps a Quit menu option?

12
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:44,810
And fourth, what type of view allows
us to show a dropdown menu for gender?

13
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:48,210
Did we use a checkbox,
a picker or a spinner?

14
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:50,740
And fifth, what activity method do

15
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:54,000
you need to override in order
to handle menu option clicks?

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,740
Did we override the onCreateOptionsMenu,

17
00:00:56,740 --> 00:01:00,770
the onOptionsItemSelected() method or
perhaps the onClick() method?

18
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:04,441
So go through these questions and
then have fun looking through that and

19
00:01:04,441 --> 00:01:05,030
starter code.
