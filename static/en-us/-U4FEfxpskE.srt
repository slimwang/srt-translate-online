00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,102
If you take a closer look at
the Animations folder where we've

2
00:00:03,102 --> 00:00:04,602
been saving our animations.

3
00:00:04,602 --> 00:00:08,617
You'll notice there's another file here
that we haven't explicitly created.

4
00:00:08,617 --> 00:00:13,290
And it's called
clockhandleseconds.controller.

5
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:15,520
What do you think this file is used for?

6
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:17,530
Take a guess, and
we'll review afterwards.
