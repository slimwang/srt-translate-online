1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,096
Most of this feedback was really useful.

2
00:00:02,096 --> 00:00:08,280
Feedbacks one, four, and
five, all expressed confusion

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:12,120
at the design, and a sense that the user
cannot do what they need to do.

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,360
Feedback number two,

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,470
is a useful thought on a question we
weren't hoping to answer just yet.

6
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:21,450
Which is also awesome.

7
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:24,260
Users will often bring to your attention
things that you should endeavor to

8
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:25,590
keep in your app.

9
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:27,890
And its important to listen to them.

10
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:31,952
However, feedback number three,
is less useful.

11
00:00:34,192 --> 00:00:36,500
For two important reasons.

12
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:40,150
First, as a low fidelity prototype,
we haven't settled on a font yet, and so

13
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:42,719
we can't make use of feedback
about the font we've chosen.

14
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:46,430
Secondly, this feedback is a suggestion.

15
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:49,950
Suggestions are great at identifying
places that need to change, but

16
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:51,230
should never be followed blindly.
