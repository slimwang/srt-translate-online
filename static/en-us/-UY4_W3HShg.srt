00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,505
In the last section we worked with multiplying and dividing fractions. We did a

2
00:00:04,517 --> 00:00:08,824
lot with fractions. Let's continue and see what else we can do. Here's our third

3
00:00:08,836 --> 00:00:12,991
chocolate math problem. You want to frost a cake for a party. You frost 2 5ths

4
00:00:12,742 --> 00:00:16,409
of the cake in vanilla icing and 1 4th of the cake in strawberry icing. What

5
00:00:16,421 --> 00:00:20,608
fraction of the cake is frosted? You might not know what to do with these two

6
00:00:20,163 --> 00:00:23,723
fractions and that's okay. I want you to go ahead and take a guess. You can put

7
00:00:23,735 --> 00:00:27,195
your answer in these 2 boxes here, the numerator up top and the denominator in

8
00:00:27,207 --> 00:00:30,644
the bottom. You also want to write down your answer, we're going to come back to

9
00:00:30,656 --> 00:00:33,417
it later, and you can see how your thinking might have changed.
