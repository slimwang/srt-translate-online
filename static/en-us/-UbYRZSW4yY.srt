As I mentioned earlier, I can't really teach you software design. You have to

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:13,280
actively learn it. To encourage this, part of your grade for the course will be

4
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:18,850
a measure of your participation in it. This is necessarily a subjective element,

5
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:23,110
but I can let you know of some of the considerations that go into it.

6
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:27,200
First is your teammates' evaluations of you on the projects and assignments.

7
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:32,715
Also your engagement in the quizzes that are part of the lessons. Third is your

8
00:00:32,715 --> 00:00:38,130
non-gratuitous participation on the class form. I consider this course, itself,

9
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:41,920
as a design project. Although it has been offered many times before, it has

10
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,710
necessarily been adapted to deal with the constraints of web-based delivery and

11
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:49,880
a large number of students. Therefore, I expect some elements will work

12
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:55,980
better than others. I specifically would like to solicit your contributions,

13
00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:00,452
such as the following. First, any bugs in the material. These can be as

14
00:01:00,452 --> 00:01:04,144
trivial as typos, or as vague as questions about unclear lesson content.

15
00:01:04,144 --> 00:01:05,973

16
00:01:05,973 --> 00:01:09,729
If you have any suggestions for additional content, as long as the suggestions

17
00:01:09,729 --> 00:01:14,940
fit within the general intent of the course. Also, specific examples, either

18
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:19,140
generated by you or ones that you have seen that were particularly edifying.

19
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:23,160
Alternative assignments or assignment questions. Even suggestions for

20
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:27,140
style elements that might be added to the course. In general, the first

21
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:31,290
contributor on a particular item will get primary credit for that contribution.
