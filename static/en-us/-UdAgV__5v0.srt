1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The answer is according to the policy the agent would prefer to follow this straight line,

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
because it is the most direct, and it is the longer goal.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Now, at any point he might slip off to one of these squares.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Those would all potentially be explored,

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
but if he did he would go back down onto the road.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Likewise, he might fall off onto any of of these squares,

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
but if he did, he would also go back towards the road.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
That's certainly true under this situation, when he's off road,

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
but it also turns out to be true here and here,

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
because the closest way to get to the goal would be to go in the north direction.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Therefore, these three rows could all potentially be explored,

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
but the bottom two rows would never be explored under any conditions

13
00:00:53,000 --> 99:59:59,999
no matter what happens stochastically as long as the agent is following this fixed policy.
