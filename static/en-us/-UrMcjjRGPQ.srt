00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:03,600
Now that you have you have your SHA1
fingerprint, let's take a moment to go

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,380
over the four steps that you'll
need to take to set up maps.

3
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:10,840
In order, the first thing that you'll do
is to set up billing for your account.

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,610
Then you're going to create a project,
then you're going to enable maps on that

5
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:18,890
project, and finally,
you're going to set up the credentials.

6
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:20,560
Once you've gone through
this process once,

7
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,250
you wont have to set up billing again.

8
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:26,040
You only do it once for all
the applications under a single project.

9
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:29,190
But for future apps you may have to
do some of the last three steps.
