00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:03,900
The designer has a clear conceptual model,

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:07,190
of how a product works. But when users

3
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:11,345
interact with a product, designers aren't present. Users

4
00:00:11,345 --> 00:00:13,901
have to get their conceptual model from the

5
00:00:13,901 --> 00:00:17,560
product system image. When interacting with a

6
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:20,460
product, we can't talk to designers to understand

7
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:23,700
their conceptual model. So we rely on whatever

8
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:26,680
information we can find out about the product.

9
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:32,009
From it's shape, form, signifiers, affordances. And even instruction manuals.

10
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:37,510
This information combined, is what we call the system image.
