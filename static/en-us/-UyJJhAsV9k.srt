1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:04,750
So in this lesson, I brought together concepts of focal length, field of view,

2
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:06,400
and sensor size.

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:11,240
I discussed the impact focal length has on how an image is formed.

4
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:14,220
Both on the creative sides a little bit, but also on the technical side.

5
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:17,220
As to what you can get in terms of field of view and focal length.

6
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:21,865
Also discussed perspective projection, which allows you to

7
00:00:21,865 --> 00:00:25,790
kind of start looking at objects that are further away or closer.

8
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:28,950
And how that is impacted with focal lengths.

9
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:30,340
Lot of basic material, but

10
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:34,760
we will continue to advance further and see more details in the next lesson.

11
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:36,770
For example, we look at exposure triangle.

12
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:38,400
We, we'll actually look at aperture,

13
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:43,220
shutter speed and also more information about the sensor size or sensor values.

14
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:48,670
That has, perhaps gives us more control on what the photography process is

15
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:49,520
all about.

16
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,210
Of course, we're looking at this because we want to try to understand how

17
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:54,700
we're going to bring them towards computation.

18
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:58,190
Again, I've listed a couple of books for you to look at if you're interested.

19
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:01,190
I do use a lot of resources on the web, please look at, look them up.

20
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:03,720
More will be available on the website.

21
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:06,700
And again, thanks to Professor Christensen who provided us with some

22
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:12,150
amazing images of the Tech Tower and Georgia Tech campus.
