1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,448
What excites me the most about my career is that I think that, that training

2
00:00:04,448 --> 00:00:08,608
animals in captivity is the absolutely best thing you could do for any animal,

3
00:00:08,608 --> 00:00:15,356
because it teaches them to cooperate with their own care. It gives them freedom

4
00:00:15,356 --> 00:00:21,293
from stress because they learn to understand more about their environment. And

5
00:00:21,293 --> 00:00:25,197
it develops a very positive feeling about their caregivers and their entire

6
00:00:25,197 --> 00:00:31,808
experience. So we can train animals to do amazing things. Including eye drops

7
00:00:31,808 --> 00:00:37,514
and stomach tubes, inoculations. We have injected the animals with anesthesia

8
00:00:37,514 --> 00:00:41,621
and removed teeth voluntarily. Instead of having to do something of use of like

9
00:00:41,621 --> 00:00:46,584
hold them down and force them through a procedure. We can release our animals

10
00:00:46,584 --> 00:00:50,614
into the open ocean and train them to perform behaviors working with us to work

11
00:00:50,614 --> 00:00:55,138
as watchdogs. Which is what the military does or as researchers which is what I

12
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:58,036
have done working with them in their natural environment and they choose to

13
00:00:58,036 --> 00:01:02,377
come back. On the strength of the basis of the relationship that we have with

14
00:01:02,377 --> 00:01:07,632
them. So we can take better care of them, as well as, learn from them, as well

15
00:01:07,632 --> 00:01:11,645
as, enrich them through this method.

16
00:01:11,645 --> 00:01:14,585
>> So say I or, you know, one of our students wants do do what you do, how can we

17
00:01:14,585 --> 00:01:16,085
do that?

18
00:01:16,085 --> 00:01:21,516
>> So, we actually offer internships for people. People come all over the world,

19
00:01:21,516 --> 00:01:26,340
and come and work with our sea lions. They can learn how to train the sea lions

20
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:31,376
up close and personal. And learn all of these basic psychology techniques. So

21
00:01:31,376 --> 00:01:35,030
even if you're not a psychologist, you can learn how to apply psychology and

22
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:39,870
practice it right here in the facility with really amazing animals.
