1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,138
To begin talking about this course, let's look at the learning goals.

2
00:00:03,138 --> 00:00:08,420
In this course, you will learn what operating systems are,

3
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:13,380
why are they needed, and how are they designed and implemented.

4
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:17,410
This will include discussion of key mechanisms and abstractions that

5
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:22,890
operating systems must support to provide the required functionality.

6
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:26,160
In this course, we will cover a number of topics in depth.

7
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,530
In particular, we will describe the design and implementation of

8
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:35,520
operating systems' abstractions, mechanisms, and policies related

9
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,650
to several of the key types of functionality provided by operating systems.

10
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:45,199
This includes processes and process management, threads and concurrency, and

11
00:00:45,199 --> 00:00:48,340
in general, challenges related to multithreading.

12
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:52,960
OS functionality for managing hardware resources like CPU and memory.

13
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,780
OS services for communication and I/O, which includes file I/O.

14
00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:00,630
OS support for distributed services, including remote procedure calls.

15
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:02,279
We call those RPCMs.

16
00:01:02,279 --> 00:01:05,360
Distributed file systems, distributed shared memory.

17
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,150
And we will briefly review systems software that's common in data center and

18
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:09,990
cloud environments.
