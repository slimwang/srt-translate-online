1
00:00:00,775 --> 00:00:03,810
I always going to forget this, but let me figure it out. To

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:07,100
add a field, I was there was, where's that little click access guy?

3
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:08,900
>> So you can only see that when

4
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:11,560
you're actually in the app. from the end user

5
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:13,910
view. But right now we're in the setup. So,

6
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:15,240
we don't need a quick link to the setup.

7
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:20,010
>> Hm. Oh, custom fields, new field. I found it. Okay so I

8
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:23,430
want to add, I don't know, what should we track about our attendees?

9
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:25,870
>> Maybe their emails, so we can

10
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:26,460
send them the ticket?

11
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:30,590
>> Makes sense, Okay. so I bet there's an email field.

12
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:35,350
There is, nice work. That was nice work to Sales Force, just

13
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:35,350
>>

14
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:35,555
[LAUGH]

15
00:00:35,555 --> 00:00:37,980
>> In general, thank you for giving me

16
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:40,630
the email field. Field Label, Email, I guess.

17
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:44,990
Okay, and again, not going to worry about this stuff.

18
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:47,830
Save. All

19
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:53,340
right, cool. We've got our field here just like we wanted.

20
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:54,150
>> Great.
