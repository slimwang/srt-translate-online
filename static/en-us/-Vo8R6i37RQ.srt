00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,476
Well the price of the truck will always include the $20 initial fee so let's

2
00:00:04,476 --> 00:00:09,241
write that first. Then whatever the number of miles we drive we have to multiply

3
00:00:09,241 --> 00:00:13,633
it by 2 since the cost is $2 per mile so we should add 2x to our expression and

4
00:00:13,633 --> 00:00:18,328
what's great we can check this. If we drive 20 miles we know the cost should be

5
00:00:18,328 --> 00:00:23,239
$60. Let's plug in $20 and for x to make sure that that's true. Sure enough,

6
00:00:23,239 --> 00:00:27,805
what do we find? The price is $60. This expression works.
