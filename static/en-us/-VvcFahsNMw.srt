1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,670
Here are the solutions for the systems.

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:05,555
The first system turns
out to be inconsistent.

3
00:00:05,555 --> 00:00:11,695
The second system has unique solution,
X = 4, Y = 3, Z = 1.

4
00:00:11,695 --> 00:00:15,270
And the last system has
infinitely many solutions.

5
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:20,210
The parameterization of
the solution set is X = 3- 2Y.

6
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:23,970
Y equals Y and Z = -4.

7
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:26,470
Let's look at how to
solve the first system.

8
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:30,850
Start by clearing the first
column underneath the top X term.

9
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:36,920
We'll subtract the first equation
from the second to get 2y- 3z =3 and

10
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:43,220
then add the first equation to
the third equation to get 2y- 3z=-1.

11
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:45,920
These bottom two equations don't look so
good.

12
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,920
We have the same quantity on the left
hand side equaling both 3 and

13
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,070
negative 1.

14
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:55,140
In fact, after subtracting
the second equation from the third,

15
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:57,850
we have the contradictions 0 =- 4.

16
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:00,140
So we can stop here.

17
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:03,720
The system is inconsistent and
has no solution.

18
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,700
Now let's look at the second system.

19
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,450
We need to have an x
term in the top equation

20
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:11,570
in order to proceed with
eliminating the first column.

21
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:15,220
So let's start by swapping the first and
second equations.

22
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:19,520
And then we can subtract three times
the first equation from the third.

23
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,320
The X column is cleared, so

24
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:25,100
now we can start clearing the Y
term in the third equation.

25
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:28,390
We can do this by adding
the second equation to the third.

26
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:30,580
We're now in triangular form and

27
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:34,350
we have three distinct leading
variables in the three rows.

28
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:37,210
So things are looking good for
us to have a unique solution.

29
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:38,070
Now let's solve for

30
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:42,850
z by multiplying the bottom equation
through by negative one-third.

31
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:44,980
And now we have that z = 1.

32
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:48,330
Now let's add the third equation
to the second equation,

33
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:51,030
which incidentally gives us that y = 3.

34
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:54,020
Finally, let's subtract the third
equation from the first

35
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:56,250
to finish clearing the last column.

36
00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:00,990
This gives us x- y = 1 in
the last thing we need to do

37
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:05,600
is add the second equation to the first
to finish clearing the why terms.

38
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,288
This gives us the unique solution

39
00:02:08,288 --> 00:02:13,520
x = 4 y = 3 z =1 to the original
system of equations.

40
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,810
Now let's look at the last system.

41
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:19,630
Our first step will be to subtract
3 times the first equation

42
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:21,340
from the second equation.

43
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:25,390
This makes the second
equation into your- z =4.

44
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:28,510
Then, we'll add the first
equation to the third,

45
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:31,595
which gives us
an equation reading 0 = 0.

46
00:02:31,595 --> 00:02:34,560
Our equation is in triangular form now.

47
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,530
So we can identify the pivot
variables which will be x and z.

48
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:41,990
Since y is not a pivot variable,
we have a free variable,

49
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:46,020
meaning we're going to have an infinite
number of solutions to our system.

50
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:47,020
Now, we can go ahead and

51
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:51,540
ignore the 0 = 0 row, because
that's just redundant information.

52
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:53,960
Concentrating on
the first two equations,

53
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:58,720
to isolate z, we need to multiply
the second equation through, by -1.

54
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,650
This gives us z=-4, then we can subtract

55
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:06,880
the second equation from the first to
eliminate z term in the first equation.

56
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:13,180
This means the first equation reads x +
2y= 3, since the pivot variables x and

57
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:17,970
x are now in only one equation each,
we can parametrize the solution set for

58
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:21,320
the system in terms of
the remaining variable y.

59
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:26,370
If the point x, y,
z is in the solution set then

60
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:31,600
by rearranging the first equation
x will equal three minus 2 y.

61
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:35,460
Y, since it is a free variable
will be equal to itself and

62
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:39,030
z because of the second equation
will equal negative four.

63
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:42,460
This gives us a parameterization
of our solution set.

64
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:48,800
With the base point of 3, 0, -4,
in a direction vector -2, 1, 0.

65
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:56,413
So in our answer boxes we write
x = 3- 2y, y = y, and z = -4.
