1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,040
So talk about confusion matrices in different context, you might

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:08,109
remember the work that Katie showed you on principle component analysis, on PCA.

3
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:12,800
Were we looked at seven different, I guess white male politicians from

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:17,100
George Bush to Gerhard Schroeder, and we ran an eigenface analysis.

5
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:21,585
Extracting the principle components of this data set, and then re-use

6
00:00:21,585 --> 00:00:28,040
the eigenfaces to re-map new faces to names in order to identify people.

7
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:30,910
So what I'm going to do now, I won't drag you

8
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:34,490
through the same PCA example again, so let's do away with those faces.

9
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:38,410
But instead what I'll do is, I give you a typical output and

10
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:42,110
we're going to study the output using confusion matrices.

11
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:48,750
So Katie was so nice to run a PCA on the faces of those politicians and

12
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:52,530
take the resulting features, put it into a support vector machine and

13
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:54,440
then go through the data and

14
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:59,980
count how often any of those people were predicted correctly or misclassified.

15
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:02,530
And just to confuse everybody, in this example,

16
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:06,120
we follow the convention of putting the true names, the true class labels,

17
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:08,180
on the left, and the predicted ones on top.

18
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:12,990
So, for example, this number one over here was truly Donald Rumsfeld, but

19
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:15,320
was mistaken to be Colin Powell.

20
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:19,130
And the way I know it's Colin Powell was the same names over here,

21
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:22,980
from Ariel Sharon to Tony Blair, apply to the columns over here.

22
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:26,030
Ariel Sharon's on the left and Tony Blair's on the right.

23
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:27,760
So we ask you a few questions now.

24
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,250
First, a simple one.

25
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:33,390
Which of those seven politicians was most frequent in our dataset?
