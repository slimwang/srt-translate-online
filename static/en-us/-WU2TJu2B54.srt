00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:03,820
Understanding that there could be
a number of different objectives behind

2
00:00:03,819 --> 00:00:08,279
creating segments, let's explore a few
examples of how the objective of

3
00:00:08,279 --> 00:00:11,939
your analysis helps determine
the data to use for your model.

4
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:15,640
For example,
to create a benchmarking system,

5
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:20,010
we would definitely need data
around the store attributes itself.

6
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:24,520
Data like square footage of the store,
the hours the store is open, and

7
00:00:24,519 --> 00:00:28,109
how long management has been
assigned to the specific store,

8
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:31,660
are just a few variables to
think about having available.

9
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:35,500
Plus, you might want data on street
traffic accessibility, and how many

10
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:40,030
employees are assigned to the store,
along with how many hours they work.

11
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:43,090
Population around the store
can also be important,

12
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:45,480
as well as how many
competitors each store has.

13
00:00:46,859 --> 00:00:48,339
However, if our objective for

14
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:52,500
the segments is to create manageable
pricing rules for our products and have

15
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:56,439
them clustered into store segments, some
of the store attributes we mentioned for

16
00:00:56,439 --> 00:01:01,449
the first clustering objective might not
be nearly as important as say, income or

17
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:05,430
life stage demographics for
people living around the store.

18
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:09,940
Distance to the competition and the type
of competition could be important,

19
00:01:09,939 --> 00:01:13,849
as well as whether stores are in
a certain regulatory zone.

20
00:01:13,849 --> 00:01:17,649
And finally, if the objective is
to optimize product allocation and

21
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:22,660
space planning, that along with area
demographics, important data to include

22
00:01:22,659 --> 00:01:27,569
would be product category sales history,
sell-through, which can measure

23
00:01:27,569 --> 00:01:31,979
allocation and pricing effectiveness,
and product discount trends.
