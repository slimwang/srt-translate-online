Now, for the asymptotes. Let's check for vertical, horizontal and oblique,

2
00:00:04,753 --> 00:00:10,158

00:00:10,158 --> 00:00:15,936
none in the box. Separate multiple answers with semi-colons. Remember that

4
00:00:15,936 --> 00:00:20,474
slant and oblique are referring to the same type of asymptote. They may be used

5
00:00:20,474 --> 00:00:21,645
interchangeably.
