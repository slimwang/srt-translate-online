00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:05,560
Let's talk about a question
that actually comes from an ad

2
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:11,830
that was run on TV by a well known
computer vendor, I will not name it.

3
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:16,920
But that ad basically claimed
that its systems didn't suffer

4
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:22,540
from any of the ailments that the
competition system had to worry about.

5
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:27,450
So this claim that was made by
this vendor who said it's system

6
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:32,430
was superior, and when it came to
security could have been well founded,

7
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:36,660
or it may have been a marketing thing.

8
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:41,550
Here we want to sort of dig deeper and
to sort of think about vendor A and

9
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:46,600
vendor B, and
they both supply operating systems.

10
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,840
And vendor A's making this claim about

11
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,520
better security that its
system offers in some sense.

12
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,710
So what could be
the basis of that claim?

13
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:01,750
So we haven't talked that
a lot about how one would

14
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:06,840
validate this sort of a claim, but
we know what a trusted system is and

15
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,790
what requirements it must meet.

16
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:12,295
And we also talked
about the threat model,

17
00:01:12,295 --> 00:01:17,800
that is who targets these kind of
systems, and one of our design

18
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:23,260
principles said it is easier to get
things right when they're simpler, okay.

19
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:25,620
Complexity is the enemy,

20
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:28,810
leads to vulnerabilities that
can be exploited and so on.

21
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:32,970
So I want you to use your
knowledge about threat modeling,

22
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:38,440
about design of secure systems,
and the trusted computing system

23
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:44,660
requirements to think about the options
that we have here and check

24
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:48,960
the ones that you think there is some
reason to believe that it may be true.

25
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,580
Once you do that, we'll come back and
talk about the answers.
