00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:02,435
There's a couple of extra things
that you're going to need to do in

2
00:00:02,435 --> 00:00:03,890
AndroidManifest.xml.

3
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:08,296
First of all is to define a service for
your Geofence TransitionIntent Service.

4
00:00:08,296 --> 00:00:10,653
This should be inside
the application tag.

5
00:00:10,653 --> 00:00:11,725
And then secondly,

6
00:00:11,725 --> 00:00:16,290
you want to ensure that the application
uses ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION permissions.

7
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:18,760
Add these to your manifest, and
check this when you're done.
