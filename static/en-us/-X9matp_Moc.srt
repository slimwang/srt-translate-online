00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:05,400
A KWIC index system accepts as input a sequence of text lines.

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:09,530
Each line is a sequences of words and each word is a sequence of characters.

3
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:12,790
You can think of the lines as containing titles, something like titles.

4
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:17,670
A line may be circularly shifted by removing its first word and

5
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:19,220
appending it to the end of the line.

6
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:23,010
Thus, a line consisting of four words will have four circular shifts,

7
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:24,700
including the original.

8
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:28,340
The idea being, that we can index into the list of

9
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:32,900
lines using each of the words that comprise the line.

10
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:37,370
The quick index system outputs a listing of all the circular shifts of all

11
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:42,370
the lines in alphabetical order of the key word used to shift the line.

12
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:47,450
The idea is that if you want to look up any of those titles,

13
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:51,380
you can use any of the words that comprise the title to find it
