00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,852
>> We can put them either in order from least to greatest, or greatest to least.

2
00:00:05,852 --> 00:00:10,723
It doesn't matter, we'll get the same results. So, let's just do least to

3
00:00:10,723 --> 00:00:15,993
greatest because that's more typical. So, for Nursing, the lowest salary is

4
00:00:15,993 --> 00:00:22,675
44,640. Next is 56,380. Then, 58,350. Then, 63,120. Then finally, 72,250. So,

5
00:00:22,675 --> 00:00:29,991
let's cross off the first and last. And again, the second to first and second to

6
00:00:29,991 --> 00:00:36,906
last, and we're left with this one in the middle. So, this is the median,

7
00:00:36,906 --> 00:00:47,185
58,350. Let's do the same for the Geography majors. First, we have 38,150. Then,

8
00:00:47,185 --> 00:00:57,055
we have 41,290. Then, 48,670. Then, 53,160. And finally, 57,320. So, again we'll

9
00:00:57,055 --> 00:01:03,497
cross off first and last. Second to first, second to last, and we're left with

10
00:01:03,497 --> 00:01:04,629
one in the middle.
