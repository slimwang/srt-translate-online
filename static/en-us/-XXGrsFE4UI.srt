1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,000
So let's look at these equations
a little more carefully.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,470
So the brightness constancy equation.

3
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:12,150
What we're going to do is assume we know
that some pixel is moving in amount u v.

4
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:18,190
U is the amount in x, v is the amount
of y when we get to t plus 1.

5
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:19,420
Okay?

6
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:22,500
The brightness constant, constraint
equation can be written like this,

7
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:27,520
I of x,y,t that is,
the image at time t, at location x,y,

8
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:32,387
brightness if it's gray-scale, color if
it's color, is going to be the same at t

9
00:00:32,387 --> 00:00:38,020
plus 1 at location x plus u, y plus v,
where u and v are the amount

10
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:41,520
the point has moved in the x direction
and the y direction respectively.

11
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,530
So that's called the brightness
constancy constraint and in fact I can

12
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:51,940
rewrite it like this, 0 is equal to
the x plus u, y plus v, t plus 1 image.

13
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:54,524
Minus the original i of x,y,t.

14
00:00:54,524 --> 00:00:57,620
All right, that's the brightness
constancy constraint.

15
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:03,320
The second assumption was that we get
a very small amount of motion, okay?

16
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,129
So that basically, u and v,

17
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:09,940
let's assume they're, like,
one pixel, or part of a pixel.

18
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:12,310
Or just, things are changing smoothly.

19
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,070
Yes you know it's coming.

20
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:21,230
What that means is I can estimate
using the Taylor expansion here

21
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:25,850
that the value of an image displaced
from x by u and displaced from,

22
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:31,160
from y by v, is approximately,
well it's exactly here if I order terms.

23
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:35,590
It's the original value plus
the gradient x times delta x,

24
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:37,930
plus the gradient y times delta y.

25
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:39,180
U and v are delta x and

26
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:42,175
delta y, respectively,
plus some high order terms.

27
00:01:42,175 --> 00:01:42,915
Right?

28
00:01:42,915 --> 00:01:44,195
Remember Taylor expansion?

29
00:01:44,195 --> 00:01:46,875
If you go infinite series,
you get the exact solution,

30
00:01:46,875 --> 00:01:49,705
but we're just going to say
plus some high order terms.

31
00:01:49,705 --> 00:01:53,565
And then when we make those high
order terms go away, poof, wow.

32
00:01:53,565 --> 00:01:54,375
Isn't that great?

33
00:01:54,375 --> 00:01:56,135
I've got the power right here.

34
00:01:56,135 --> 00:01:56,855
All right?

35
00:01:56,855 --> 00:01:59,770
Then we say that it's an approximation.

36
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:05,700
Okay, so we say that x plus u, y plus
v is approximately the original image

37
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:10,500
plus the gradient in x times delta x
plus the gradient y times delta y, or v.
