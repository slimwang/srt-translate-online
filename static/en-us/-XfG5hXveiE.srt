1
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:04,980
So at this point the training of my support vector classifier is done,

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:07,670
including the principle components transformation.

3
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:09,270
Now I want to move on to testing.

4
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:14,260
In order to do that, I need to repeat what I did with my training features,

5
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:16,510
this time with my testing features.

6
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:18,700
And that means starting with a PCA transform.

7
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:22,450
Something very important that I'm not doing here,

8
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:26,270
is refitting my PCA on my test features.

9
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:29,500
I want to be very consistent between what I've done with the training features,

10
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:32,020
and what I'll be doing with the testing features here.

11
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:35,350
So that means using the same principle components that I found in the training

12
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:41,050
features and representing my testing features using those principle components.

13
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:44,380
So that having been said, when I call PCA to a transform,

14
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:47,500
do I want to be doing it on the training features or on the testing features?
