The second main category of UML, Diagram Systems Behavioral Diagrams.

00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:09,910
In contrast with the structural diagrams, which describe the system as a whole,

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,680
the behavioral diagrams are concerned with a particular instance of behavior of

4
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:20,490
that system. That is, you may have to have multiple sequence diagrams,

5
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:23,000
multiple collaboration diagrams, to convey,

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,230
to give an idea of overall system behavior. We're going to now survey these so

7
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:31,840
you get a feel for what's available to you. Once again, it's unlikely that for

8
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,350
a given system you'll use all of these diagram types.
