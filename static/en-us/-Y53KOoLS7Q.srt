1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,971
It turns out we can. The numerator would be eleven and the denominator would be

2
00:00:04,971 --> 00:00:08,925
X minus six times X plus six. Great job, if you've figured that one out. When I

3
00:00:08,925 --> 00:00:13,800
look at this numerator and these two terms, I can see they share a common factor

4
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:17,966
of eleven. If we factor eleven out of our numerator, we'll get eleven times X

5
00:00:17,966 --> 00:00:22,195
plus two. Now we can see this X plus two is a factor and the numerator. Add in

6
00:00:22,195 --> 00:00:27,815
the denominator, which means we can simplify. These factors cancel to 1, and

7
00:00:27,815 --> 00:00:31,876
we're left with 11 divided by x minus 6 times x plus 6.
