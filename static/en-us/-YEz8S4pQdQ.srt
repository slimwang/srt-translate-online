00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,600
In this lesson, we define
the dual of a linear program and

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,460
showed how this dual program
can be seen as the problem

3
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:10,090
of making a certain kind of bound on
the primal program as tight as possible.

4
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:13,240
Then we saw how maximum flow and

5
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:17,270
maximum bipartite matching can be
expressed as linear programs, and

6
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:20,779
how the minimum ST cut and
vertex cover problems were their duals.

7
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:24,230
If this idea of duality appeals to you,

8
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:27,960
I suggest looking at the primal dual
algorithm for solving the near programs.

9
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:31,070
Although this is not
a practical strategy for

10
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:34,540
solving general linear programs,
it has served as the inspiration for

11
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:37,860
many algorithms for
specific types of problems.

12
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,740
In fact, the Ford-Fulkerson
algorithm which we studied and

13
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:42,350
the famous Hungarian algorithm for

14
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:46,650
finding minimum cost matchings,
can be seen as primal dual algorithms.

15
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:47,730
Those are good places to start.

16
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:53,080
More broadly, the type of duality that
we've studied has profound implications

17
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:57,360
for game theory, convex geometry,
and convex optimization.

18
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,560
Keep this lesson in mind when
you encounter those topics.
