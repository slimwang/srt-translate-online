1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:04,320
We just enabled email and password
authentication in Friendly Chat.

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:07,830
Now, we'll make some minor adjustments
to add Google Authentication.

3
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:09,370
First, we need to provide a way for

4
00:00:09,369 --> 00:00:12,099
Friendly Chat to communicate
with Google Authentication.

5
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:17,189
To do so, we must add support for
a URL scheme to our app.

6
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:21,400
A URL scheme is a means and protocol for
communication with other apps.

7
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,350
For more information on URL schemes and

8
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:28,000
how apps communicate,
check out the link in the resources.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,160
The URL scheme that we want to
add is the reverse client ID,

10
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:35,490
which can be found in the Google
service dash info file.

11
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:39,600
So let's navigate to that file and
find the reverse client ID.

12
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,399
Copy it, and then select the friendly
chat Swift app to see the app settings.

13
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:49,719
Click the info tab, go to URL types,
and you'll see a box for

14
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:52,299
a URL scheme labeled reversed client ID.

15
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:56,170
Paste your ID into this field and
you can leave the other fields as blank.

16
00:00:57,429 --> 00:00:59,560
Now, Friendly Chat has
a means of communicating

17
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,179
with Google Authentication, but
there's still a little bit left to do.

18
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,439
Let's go back to the app
delegate in Friendly Chat.

19
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:09,770
In order to use Google Authentication,
we must provide functionality for

20
00:01:09,769 --> 00:01:12,939
handling when the app
transitions to a web URL.

21
00:01:12,939 --> 00:01:16,909
Like the Google sign-in page,
that's what this function is for.

22
00:01:16,909 --> 00:01:20,179
We've already included the code
to handle passing data from a URL

23
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:22,840
back to Friendly Chat,
we just wanted to point that out.

24
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:27,519
Now we need to tell our authorization
view controller to include Google

25
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:30,089
as an authorization provider.

26
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:34,500
Open FCViewController and add a new
import for FirebaseGoogleAuthUI.

27
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:38,130
Now go back to
the ConfigureAuth function.

28
00:01:38,129 --> 00:01:41,409
This is where we want to specify
authorization providers like Google.

29
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:46,339
The default authorization UI has an
array called providers where we can set

30
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:46,670
this up.

31
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:52,660
To add Google, we just need to add
the FIRGoogleAuthUI object in the array.

32
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:54,500
And that's it.

33
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,939
Now Fiendly Chat is enabled
with Google Authentication.

34
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:01,180
Go ahead and run the app and
you'll see the Google sign in button.

35
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:05,000
When we click on it we're redirected
to the Google sign in page.

36
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,519
And I'll log in with one
of my Google accounts.

37
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:11,379
Once I complete the login flow, it may
or may not ask me to allow Friendly Chat

38
00:02:11,379 --> 00:02:14,699
to access my email address and
basic profile information for Google.

39
00:02:14,699 --> 00:02:17,319
I'll go ahead and click Allow.

40
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:19,189
Awesome, the login flow is complete.

41
00:02:19,189 --> 00:02:22,099
Now let's try sending a message
with this new authenticated user.

42
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:27,769
And as we can see the display name for
this message is updated since I'm using

43
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:30,520
my Google account instead of
the other account we saw previously.
