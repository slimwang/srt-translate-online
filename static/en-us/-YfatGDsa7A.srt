1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,420
All right. Our last bit is, is, is, I have,

2
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:05,720
I have to break it to you that reality can be a problem.

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:07,800
That's a nicer way of saying life sucks.

4
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:13,630
In reality lenses aren't really thin, lenses aren't perfect,

5
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:16,430
photographers aren't perfect, except some of us.

6
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:18,060
Sensing arrays aren't perfect so

7
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:21,580
sometimes we have to do stuff to try to fix these things.

8
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:25,540
So, here's an example of a problem that's fixable, easily,

9
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:28,130
in mathematics and geometry.

10
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:30,580
And this is referred to as geometric distortion.

11
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:34,480
So on the left here, we have a nice, regular grid.

12
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,550
But sometimes, our lenses are not perfect, and

13
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:42,230
they'll bow things out like this, and this is called pin cushion distortion.

14
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:44,430
And sometimes they'll bow things out like that, and

15
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:46,730
that's referred to as barrel distortion.

16
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:48,900
By the way, for those of you that use Photoshop or

17
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:52,060
other more sophisticated image manipulation tools.

18
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:54,020
You can correct for this in the image, and

19
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:58,230
in fact, in Photoshop and, and in Camera Raw, if it knows the camera and

20
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:03,050
lens that you're using, you tell it, correct for the geometric aberrations and

21
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:04,569
it will go ahead and just fix that for you.

22
00:01:04,569 --> 00:01:07,590
because it knows about the lens and it knows about the camera.

23
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:09,340
By the way, I used the word, aberration.

24
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:12,270
That's what we tend to use for any sorts of problems that are,

25
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:15,250
are in how the lenses, how the images are created.

26
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:18,580
Here's an example of the correcting of that radial distortions.

27
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:20,040
Radial coming out from the middle.

28
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,870
Picture on the left taken with a lens that's actually designed to

29
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:26,550
try to capture as much of the scene as possible, but it's very distorted.

30
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:29,240
On the right, you can see the recovery making it as if

31
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,990
everything were perfectly flat.

32
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:32,640
Another kind of aberration or

33
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,840
problem in computational photography is what's called chromatic aberration.

34
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,550
Oh sure, if any of you are Pink Floyd fans, you're familiar with

35
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:42,690
the picture that shows white light coming through a prism spreading out and

36
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:43,930
making a rainbow.

37
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:46,950
I would it to you, but I'm sure I'd have to pay Pink Floyd money.

38
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:47,890
All right.

39
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:52,630
And the problem is, is that different color lights are diffracted different

40
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:55,980
amounts by a particular lens, or a particular medium.

41
00:01:55,980 --> 00:02:00,470
So the problem is, how do I get all the light coming from a point to land on

42
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:02,440
the same place in my image?

43
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:05,560
And this is shown here where they're showing you the, the red and

44
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:09,008
blue lights as converging to different places.

45
00:02:09,008 --> 00:02:14,370
And, here's an example at a corner, and when you blow it up, you can see this

46
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:19,600
red line that's between the, the blue sky and the, the white building.

47
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,000
Where did that red line come from, there's no red there.

48
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,320
Well, that's chromatic aberration.

49
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:27,240
By the way, Photoshop knows how to take care of that too.

50
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,760
That one's a little bit more of an approximation, but

51
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,630
you can remove the chromatic aberration of your lenses that way.

52
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:36,580
Last one we'll talk about is what's called vignetting.

53
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:41,050
If you use certain cameras at certain aperture settings.

54
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:47,000
Not all of the rays that are hitting from, say, the middle of the image,

55
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,430
coming through the middle are being caught at the corners.

56
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:54,230
So here we have a, a lens imaging system and

57
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:56,800
we're going to talk about that in just a minute, and we've got some point.

58
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,856
And the ones that would be near the edges goes,

59
00:02:58,856 --> 00:03:00,709
goes through a couple different lenses.

60
00:03:00,709 --> 00:03:04,110
Only some of them hit the imaging medium, and so

61
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:09,310
what that causes is that you get these dark areas around the, the edges.

62
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:10,400
And that's called vignetting.
