1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,050
Let's apply what we just learned by opening up

2
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:06,390
the MainActivity.java file within our project. We're going to take

3
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:08,830
this networking code snippet and move it over to

4
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:11,200
it's own AsyncTask, so it runs in a background

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,160
thread. The task is going to be defined within

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,070
this fragment class. But speaking of which, it's actually

7
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:21,300
still called PlaceholderFragment. Let's do a little bit of

8
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:25,365
refactoring now by giving it a real name. Let's call

9
00:00:25,365 --> 00:00:28,463
it ForecastFragment. And then you can update it

10
00:00:28,463 --> 00:00:31,560
in other appropriate places as well. We can also

11
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,560
move ForecastFragment into its own file that way

12
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:38,412
the MainActivity won't get so long and cumbersome. Within

13
00:00:38,412 --> 00:00:41,284
ForecastFragment we should define a new inner class

14
00:00:41,284 --> 00:00:45,290
called FetchWeatherTask which extends from AsyncTask. And then you

15
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:48,770
can move the networking code snippet here. After you

16
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:50,840
make the changes and run your app, it should

17
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:53,770
look something like this. There really should be no difference except it

18
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:57,290
doesn't crash now. In the next step we will add code to execute

19
00:00:57,290 --> 00:01:01,300
the task. And later in the lesson, we'll do JSON parsing and updating

20
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:05,120
the UI. In the meantime though, make these initial changes to your code.
