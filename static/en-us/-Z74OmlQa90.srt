1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,670
Now we're going to actually
install our workshop,

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:04,180
which is the Android Studio program.

3
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:08,020
I suggest you watch me so that you
can have a sense of what the process

4
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:11,900
looks like, and then follow the text
version instructions at your own pace.

5
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:16,460
Also, keep in mind that
these are large files.

6
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:19,980
You're going to want to have a strong
and stable Internet connection.

7
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:22,970
For students with slower and
more unreliable Internet,

8
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:26,100
you might want to consider finding
a wired Internet connection.

9
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:28,790
Also, if things are taking
a while to load or download and

10
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:32,790
you're getting bored, feel free to go to
the next node, which has a quick review

11
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:35,750
quiz game that you can do while
Android Studio is downloading.

12
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:39,050
I've created the walkthrough for

13
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:42,510
how to download Android Studio on
two different operating systems.

14
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:46,230
I have instructions for Windows and
instructions for Mac computers.

15
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:47,100
I'll give you a moment.

16
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,560
Go ahead and
click on which one applies to you.

17
00:00:58,454 --> 00:01:02,680
Okay, I'm going to be installing
Android Studio on a Windows machine.

18
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:05,019
Please note that this screen cast
was done on April 7, 2015 and

19
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:10,640
I say that just because sometimes the
screens or the icons that you might see

20
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:15,730
while installing Android studio could
change depending on what version it is.

21
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:19,260
We're going to give you a text version
to go along with the screencast.

22
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:23,190
Since it's easier to change the text
version than to go through re-recording

23
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:24,630
an entire screencast,

24
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:27,820
that will be a little it more up
to date than the screencast will.

25
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:30,420
All right, so to start off,
go ahead and open a web browser, and

26
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:32,980
go to the Android studio website.

27
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:35,630
It's linked in the instruction notes,
you do not have to type this in.

28
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:40,000
All right, so once you've arrived on
the site, you should see a big green

29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,940
button that's pretty obvious that says
Download Android Studio for wWndows, so

30
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:44,650
go ahead and click that.

31
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:49,163
All right and that's going to take you
to the License for Android Studio.

32
00:01:49,163 --> 00:01:50,990
You're welcome to go ahead and
read that.

33
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:54,200
I'm going to scroll to the bottom,
sign my rights away,

34
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:57,510
and then click this Download
Android Studio for Windows button.

35
00:01:59,102 --> 00:02:02,060
All right, we did want to download this,
so we do want to keep it.

36
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:03,590
I'm going to press Keep.

37
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:07,870
Okay, and if you look right here, this
is a little bit less than a gig of data.

38
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:10,860
And that's about equivalent to
downloading a movie file of

39
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,080
reasonable quality.

40
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,740
So you can judge how long this will
take based on your Internet connection.

41
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:18,490
Okay, once it's finished downloading,
go ahead and double click the file.

42
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:20,760
We did in fact want to run this.

43
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:21,350
So click Run.

44
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:24,290
Yes, we did want to allow
it to make changes.

45
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:28,640
All right, and now we're at
the Android Studio Setup Wizard.

46
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,200
This is going to guide you through
a collection of screens to set up

47
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,942
Android Studio, and pretty much always
we're going to just select the default.

48
00:02:34,942 --> 00:02:39,700
All right, so I'm going to hit Next,
I want all these boxes checked.

49
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:44,520
Note that this requires 3.8 GB of space,
and we only download about a gigabyte,

50
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,770
so after this, there's going
to be even more downloading.

51
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:48,290
I'm going to hit Next.

52
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:53,470
This is a license agreement here, you
can go ahead and read it if you'd like.

53
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:55,000
I'm going to go ahead and hit I Agree.

54
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:57,716
Oh yes, I agree more.

55
00:02:57,716 --> 00:03:02,611
Okay, I'm all right with all of
these standard install locations.

56
00:03:02,611 --> 00:03:05,460
All right,
going to say next on the emulator setup.

57
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:06,410
We'll talk about this later.

58
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,670
Sure, let's make a Start Menu folder and
I'm going to hit Install,

59
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:12,920
which will bring me to this screen.

60
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:17,172
Of course, if you like staring
at loading bars feel free.

61
00:03:17,172 --> 00:03:18,850
All right, it looks like it completed.

62
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:20,999
I can go ahead and
look at the show details.

63
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:26,420
And I'm not seeing anything here
about huge errors, so that's good.

64
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:27,820
All right, I'm going to go ahead and
click Next.

65
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:32,800
Okay, so the install looks like
it finished, we click finish.

66
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,600
This is the little loading screen for
Android Studio when it starts up.

67
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:40,180
Okay, now this is asking me if I have
some settings from a previous version of

68
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:43,950
Android Studio, and
I'm pretty sure that you don't.

69
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:47,070
So you probably want to hit the I don't
have a previous version of android

70
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:50,252
studio, or I don't want to import my
settings, and go ahead and hit OK.

71
00:03:51,993 --> 00:03:54,570
Just going ahead and downloading
a few more components for me.

72
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:56,690
Now once you see this screen,

73
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:59,730
you know you've got
Android Studio up and running.

74
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:02,250
But the real test to see if
you did everything correctly

75
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:04,210
will be if you can make
your first app using it.

76
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:07,650
All right, so
this completes the installation video.

77
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:09,250
And now you're going to do
this process on your own.

78
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:12,570
All right, I'm going to download
Android Studio on a Mac.

79
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:17,385
Note that this screen cast
was done April 6th, 2015.

80
00:04:17,385 --> 00:04:19,836
And the reason I'm saying
that is because sometimes,

81
00:04:19,836 --> 00:04:21,880
this process will change.

82
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:24,160
We will always provide you
with text instructions for

83
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,580
the install process, and we will
keep those instructions up to date.

84
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:29,860
So things look a little
different here and there.

85
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:32,960
Don't worry, check out the text
install instructions and

86
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,850
with that little mini
note lets get started.

87
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:39,680
The first thing you're going to do is
click at the instructed note below

88
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,070
to get to the Android studio homepage.

89
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:45,450
Don't try typing this out, just click
the link in the instructor notes.

90
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:48,420
Once you're here there's going to be a
pretty obvious button that says download

91
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:51,410
Android studio and it should say for
Mac, go ahead and click it.

92
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:55,130
At this point you'll see a license
agreement, you can read it if you like.

93
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:58,310
And then go ahead and scroll down,
click that you've read it and

94
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:00,640
then click this download
Android Studio for Mac button.

95
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:03,380
Okay, so
it's started downloading here for me.

96
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:07,650
Now you should be able to see that this
download is a couple hundred megabytes.

97
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:09,430
Once it's downloaded,
go ahead and double-click it.

98
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:13,790
You should see this big beautiful
screen that says Android studio.

99
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:16,320
And as with most applications, you're
going to go ahead and click Android

100
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,850
studio and drag it into your
applications folder so it'll copy over.

101
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:22,980
After you've successfully done that,
you can go ahead and

102
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:27,080
double click Android Studio, which will
actually try to open Android Studio.

103
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,433
You might get a warning about it
being a download from the web.

104
00:05:29,433 --> 00:05:32,468
But we did mean to download this and
we did mean to run it so go ahead and

105
00:05:32,468 --> 00:05:33,970
click Open.

106
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:36,980
This little screen should appear to
load up the installation process.

107
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:41,540
All right, and
here we are at the Welcome Wizard.

108
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:44,120
What follows is going to be a series
of screens and licenses and

109
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,820
you pretty much just want
to keep the defaults.

110
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,240
And you click Next.

111
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,080
This is a screen asking me where
my Java development kit is.

112
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,860
Now, we just installed that and

113
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:56,750
it's actually making
a guess about where it is.

114
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,920
If it isn't guessing,
you can click the Detect button.

115
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:03,620
And if that isn't working, you can
try navigating your file system to go

116
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:05,690
exactly to where you downloaded it.

117
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:08,820
If you're having trouble with this step,
It probably means that there were

118
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:11,300
issues with downloading
the Java Development Kit.

119
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:13,160
You might have downloaded
the wrong file or

120
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,520
just something might not
be configured right.

121
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,580
Try going through
the instructions again or

122
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:19,280
checking out
the troubleshooting documents.

123
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:23,690
Everything seems to be working here so
I'm going to go ahead and click Next.

124
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:25,500
Now we're not doing
anything too crazy so

125
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,130
I'm going to choose
a standard installation.

126
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:31,510
Here are some of the licenses
that I was talking about.

127
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:33,980
Go ahead and click on this
first license and say, Accept.

128
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,810
That'll accept all these
licenses down here.

129
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:41,410
You'll have to click on the next
license set here, and also hit Accept.

130
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:45,890
And this will let you finish
the Android Studio Setup Wizard.

131
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:48,559
Okay, when I click Finish, it's actually
going to download a lot of stuff.

132
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:52,740
And what all of this entails is
downloading a couple gigs of data,

133
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:55,840
which is sort of a huge
amount of stuff to download.

134
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,330
So be patient,
this might take some time.

135
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:01,350
If you're getting bored of staring at
a loading bar, you can go ahead and

136
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:02,715
click to the next video, where we.

137
00:07:02,715 --> 00:07:05,733
We have a little review game to go over
some of the stuff we've already learned.

138
00:07:07,035 --> 00:07:10,365
As you see this window, go ahead and
type in your password, and

139
00:07:10,365 --> 00:07:12,855
the candy cane strips here
mean this is close to done.

140
00:07:14,355 --> 00:07:14,865
Awesome.
And

141
00:07:14,865 --> 00:07:17,620
once you're done, you see this screen.

142
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:20,736
Hopefully there's a lot of positive
language like successfully,

143
00:07:20,736 --> 00:07:25,330
installation pass, successfully created.

144
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:27,880
If you see any errors here it could
mean that there are errors with

145
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,250
the installation.

146
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:31,140
But things look good so
I'm going to go ahead and click Finish.

147
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:35,930
Now once you see this screen, you know
that you've got Android studio up and

148
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:36,990
running, so great job.

149
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:41,930
But the real test is going to be seeing
if we did everything correctly enough

150
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:44,350
that we can create out
own apps using it.

151
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:47,230
All right, so,
now you've watched me do the steps once.

152
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:49,970
I want you go ahead and
download Android Studio yourself.

153
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,570
If the downloading is taking awhile, but

154
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:55,660
you still want to be doing Android stuff
feel free to move onto the next node

155
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:58,360
where we have a review game to pass
the time while things install.
