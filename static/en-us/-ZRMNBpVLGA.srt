1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So we've talked about some probability problems

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
that we can handle with simulation--that is,

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
choosing using a random number generator,

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
some samples, and hoping that they're representative of the problem.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
And if you choose enough, you get a close enough representation.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
An alternative strategy is enumeration,

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
where we actually go over all the possibilities

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
and we can compute an exact probability.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Now, some problems are so complex that it would take forever to do that,

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
but computers are much better at it than people are,

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and so it's a powerful strategy.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
We'll show you some simple examples, and they can scale up to more complex ones.

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:41,000
So let's imagine all the possible families living in houses,

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
and these houses have differeing poperties.

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
This one is colored red and has an Englishman.

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
This one has a zebra, and so on.

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
But for now we're only interested in the children that live in those houses,

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
and, in fact, we're only interested in the houses that have exactly 2 children.

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
So we're going to not consider some of them,

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
and consider the other ones that have exactly 2 children,

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
and then we want to be able to ask questions of them.

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
And we can ask probability questions.

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
We're going to constrain ourselves to ask conditional probability questions.

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:20,000
So what is the probability of Event A given Event B?

25
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
And an event is just a state of affairs.

26
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,000
So Event B might be the event of the family having exactly 2 children.

27
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
And so we've crossed off these houses,

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
and we're only taking these other ones, and then Event A might be

29
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
the probability of having a boy or a girl.

30
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Now, in real life, we could do simulation by going out and polling and asking people.

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
In mathematics, we can do enumeration if we make certain assumptions,

32
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:56,000
and one assumption we can make is that it's exactly 50% probable that you get a boy

33
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
and 50% probable that you get a girl and that one birth

34
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
is independent from another.

35
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
So let's address the question.

36
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
What's the probability of having 2 boys given that there is at least 1 boy in the family?

37
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:15,000
And the universe of possibilities is only the families that have exactly 2 children.

38
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
So we could put that here in the condition as well--

39
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
at least 1 boy and 2 children total.

40
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
What do you think this probability is equal to?

41
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Let's put your answer here and enter it in the form of a fraction.

42
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
So if you think it's one-half, put 1 and then 2.

43
00:02:31,000 --> 99:59:59,999
If you think it's 11-17ths, put 11 and 17.
