So we can't write the equation of a vertical line in slope intercept form. But

2
00:00:04,181 --> 00:00:08,172
what about the other two forms for linear equations that we know of? Can we

00:00:08,172 --> 00:00:12,305
write it in point slope form? Or can we write it in general form? Please pick

00:00:12,305 --> 00:00:14,337
yes or no for each of these questions.
