1
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:04,320
So we verified a listing is within
a half an hour walk from work.

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:08,359
Doesn't make me take a ferry and we're
able to verify that our pancake house,

3
00:00:08,359 --> 00:00:10,727
gelateria, school, or
hospital is in the area.

4
00:00:10,727 --> 00:00:14,971
But after a search query turns up those
results we want to see more about those

5
00:00:14,971 --> 00:00:17,436
places in our potential
new neighborhood.

6
00:00:17,437 --> 00:00:20,267
Luckily the places library
is a ridiculously large

7
00:00:20,266 --> 00:00:23,570
database full of useful tidbits
about the world around us.

8
00:00:24,789 --> 00:00:26,980
Places returned in both
our auto complete and

9
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:29,519
search box have unique
identifiers called place IDs.

10
00:00:30,589 --> 00:00:33,140
You should be aware that you can
pass them just like latlongs and

11
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:36,020
many of the services such as
distance matrix and directions APIs.

12
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:41,119
Place IDs are the keys that you get back
tons of details about an establishment

13
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:41,619
or location.

14
00:00:42,759 --> 00:00:45,969
When we get the list of results from
our search box, we get place IDs for

15
00:00:45,969 --> 00:00:46,490
all of them.

16
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:50,810
Let's take a look at a few
examples of using the place IDs

17
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:54,330
in the place details web service to see
what kind of details are available.

18
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,370
We already have a place
ID here to test out.

19
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:01,810
We'll be getting the place IDs within
our site from our search box or

20
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:03,310
text search query.

21
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:07,010
But for the web service request,
we can get place IDs from the places,

22
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:10,570
text, nearby or radar searches.

23
00:01:10,569 --> 00:01:12,839
Check out the link in the instructor
notes for how to do that.

24
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,290
We need to use the place
IDs to search for

25
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:19,620
place details which is the demonstration
that we're about to do.

26
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:25,549
Again, I'm specifying that I'm doing
a place detail search here and

27
00:01:25,549 --> 00:01:27,619
that I want the response in JSON format.

28
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,680
I'm passing in a place ID and
my API key.

29
00:01:34,659 --> 00:01:37,548
Here's the response that we get back for
the Google Sydney office.

30
00:01:38,969 --> 00:01:42,129
I'm going to minimize the address
components and the geometry.

31
00:01:43,969 --> 00:01:47,590
We can see here that we get back an
international phone number, the name for

32
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:53,240
the place, some photos, a rating,

33
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:59,399
not sure where those .5 points went,
lots of reviews, and the type.

34
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:04,821
So we can tell this is an establishment,
which means it's a business.

35
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:07,456
All of these photos have photo
reference IDs, seen here.

36
00:02:07,456 --> 00:02:12,625
We can build another simple URL
to use the photo reference IDs

37
00:02:12,625 --> 00:02:17,830
using an API key and
a photo reference parameter, and a wif.

38
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:20,340
This time I'm making
a places photo request.

39
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:25,090
Again I specify a width,
the photo reference ID

40
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:28,469
that I got back from the place
details request, and my API key.

41
00:02:28,469 --> 00:02:33,300
That's the places photo that we were
given in our place details request.

42
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:37,239
Let's do another place ID as an example.

43
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,780
This is a great little coffee shop.

44
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:41,449
You may or may not have heard of it.

45
00:02:41,449 --> 00:02:44,810
We can see that this is the Starbucks
on Broadway in the city.

46
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:46,750
Now we can see some pretty useful stuff.

47
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,907
Operating hours are really useful for
one thing.

48
00:02:48,907 --> 00:02:53,309
We'll use these on our site later when
we will get place detail results.

49
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:54,750
Notice that we get back for

50
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:59,370
display purposes text, but also granular
data of the periods when it's open.

51
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:03,209
Again we get back the photos.

52
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:08,379
We also again get back the rating and
reviews.

53
00:03:08,379 --> 00:03:11,889
So for example if I wanted to limit
my results to things open for

54
00:03:11,889 --> 00:03:14,679
certain hours or
above a certain rating I could do that.

55
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:18,329
If you're making a restaurant reviewer
search app these things could be

56
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:18,949
really important to you.

57
00:03:20,569 --> 00:03:21,419
Let's get back to our site.

58
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:26,680
So we're already getting back all the
place IDs when we do the text search or

59
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,620
the search box query.

60
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:31,750
So let's add an OnClick event
on the markers that appear

61
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:34,259
that'll display some placed
details about each marker.

62
00:03:35,789 --> 00:03:38,819
Remember, we need the places
library loaded to do this.

63
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:42,870
We already included it in order to
use auto-complete, and search box.

64
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:47,859
We're going to add to our create
markers for places function.

65
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,860
For each place marker that we create,

66
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:54,060
we're going to add an event listener
to call a get details function.

67
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:56,969
We're going to create a single info
window here that we'll share between

68
00:03:56,969 --> 00:04:01,900
the different place markers that we only
have set of place details open at once.

69
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:05,860
And then we'll add our event listener
for a click event on the marker.

70
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:08,440
This will call a get
place details function,

71
00:04:08,439 --> 00:04:13,169
passing in the marker which is this and
the placeInfoWindow.

72
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:14,119
Let's define that now.

73
00:04:15,629 --> 00:04:20,730
Our getPlace details function is
going to use the placeID to execute

74
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:22,790
a placeDetailSearch.

75
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:26,340
And then it's going to display a bunch
of that information in an info window

76
00:04:26,339 --> 00:04:28,409
above the place marker.

77
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:33,150
We'll create a new places service and
use the getDetails method.

78
00:04:33,149 --> 00:04:37,379
Passing in the place ID which
we set as the marker ID before.

79
00:04:37,379 --> 00:04:39,100
We'll get back the results.

80
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:41,420
Check that the status is okay.

81
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:44,340
And then parse through all that
neat data that we saw before

82
00:04:44,339 --> 00:04:45,949
in the web service call.

83
00:04:45,949 --> 00:04:49,189
We'll put all of this data into
the info window that we create,

84
00:04:49,189 --> 00:04:51,300
including the first photo
reference that we get.

85
00:04:52,899 --> 00:04:55,759
Remember, not every place ID will return

86
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:58,909
all of the details that we
saw in the web service calls.

87
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:01,130
Some of them may not have opening hours,

88
00:05:01,129 --> 00:05:04,180
some of them may not have
a phone number, et cetera.

89
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:07,730
So we have to check for the existence of
each of these pieces of data before we

90
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:09,319
actually display it in the info window.

91
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:11,220
Let's test this out.

92
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:15,840
Let's click on some of these
markers to get more results.

93
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:18,799
We can see the place name,
the formatted address,

94
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:24,870
the phone number, the operating
hours and a nice little thumbnail.

95
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:26,810
A 24 hour IHOP!

96
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:28,899
Jackpot.
All right, so

97
00:05:28,899 --> 00:05:30,889
I think this is really
going to help our users.

98
00:05:30,889 --> 00:05:33,949
At this point they'd be able to find the
places of interest in the neighborhoods

99
00:05:33,949 --> 00:05:35,839
that they could potentially live in.

100
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:37,959
Let's review our places
API skills in a quiz.
