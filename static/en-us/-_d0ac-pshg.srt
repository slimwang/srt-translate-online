1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,590
What we're going to do next, is we're going to show our

2
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:06,430
designs to three other people, and find out how, we

3
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:08,690
as designers, can improve them. How do we make it

4
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:12,760
simpler? How can we increase the discoverability? And, what are the

5
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:14,695
cues for feedback, and how do we make those stronger?

6
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:18,840
For a few tips, see the project brief, on how to

7
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,810
do an effective feedback session with users. Now let's watch

8
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:26,110
Clifton, as he shows his designs to Kathleen, a potential user.

9
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:28,440
Notice how he interacts with Kathleen, and

10
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:31,680
in particular, notice how he asks her questions.

11
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:36,880
>> So Kathleen, imagine you have this new product, this digital wallet,

12
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:41,520
that you kind of you can trade times with other people. So you start off

13
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:47,030
here. And tell me what you see, and what you would like to do?

14
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:51,130
>> So, it looks

15
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:53,390
like I have,

16
00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:00,520
a bank and my balance right now is three hours, and 10 minutes.

17
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:03,920
>> Okay, so what, what would you do here?

18
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,350
>> I would probably type in, you know, whatever

19
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:08,940
I'm looking for, knowing what that I have my balance

20
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:12,920
and start, start looking for you know, a person to

21
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:17,370
help me. Trade, or do whatever I'm looking to do.

22
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:21,029
>> Mm, okay. So let's assume you

23
00:01:21,029 --> 00:01:24,830
tap on this you go to this screen.

24
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:26,490
>> I'm going to say that I'm looking for somebody to clean my

25
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:30,100
house so that I have a, an idea to, to keep going with.

26
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:31,370
>> Mm-hm.

27
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:35,720
>> And my, my, yeah. And so now I

28
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,670
think I would see that these are all the people

29
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:42,770
who are near me and and what costs they have.

30
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:46,810
Looks like the red and the green. Red would be,

31
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:51,770
maybe, by myself. I like that it is. Actually, something that I think it

32
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:54,860
would be nice is if we actually started with the green and it showed me

33
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:57,030
the things that I could afford first,

34
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:00,140
rather than the things I can't afford because

35
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:03,410
that, that seems a little snubbing. Like, hey, look at this, you can't have it.
