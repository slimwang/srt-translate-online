1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,510
And, I would say the answer is yes.

2
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:03,960
Here is the line.

3
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:05,270
And, what's really interesting,

4
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:11,170
this line over here, in the original data, corresponds to a circle.

5
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:16,149
The circle of equal distance to the origin in the coordinates system.

6
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:19,740
So, as we added this new feature,

7
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:23,250
and I picked one that I really wanted to pick here.

8
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:27,490
As we added this new feature, we're able to use support vector

9
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:31,480
machine to learn a nonlinear decision surface in the form of a circle.

10
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:34,400
That is quite amazing.
