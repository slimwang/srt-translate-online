00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:02,780
Here's your first project. Go out and find a

2
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:07,110
signifier that's confusing to you or others. Document that with

3
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:10,380
photographs, like you just learned. So here's your challenge.

4
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:12,630
How are you going to fix it? How would you make

5
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:15,310
it better? How could it be less confusing? Take

6
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:19,260
materials that you find anywhere, and improve upon it, so

7
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:23,870
it's not confusing. Then, submit all that, and later I'll

8
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:25,970
show you a solution for a signifier that I found

9
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:27,850
confusing, and how I decide to fix it.
