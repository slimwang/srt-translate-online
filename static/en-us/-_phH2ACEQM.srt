1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,450
>> Alright Sam, I'm ready let's build this app. What do we do?

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:04,580
>> So the first thing we need to do is

3
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:06,750
think about what do we care about most at a festival.

4
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:10,420
>> Okay I mean we're paying attention, mostly I guess, to the bands.

5
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:10,991
>> Mm-hm.

6
00:00:10,991 --> 00:00:13,640
>> the stages they're playing on and the people who are going.

7
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:14,370
>> Right.

8
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:15,850
>> That sound about right?

9
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:19,280
>> Yeah, those are the main things we want to track. Let's write it

10
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:21,850
down on this tablet and kind of map out what our schema is going to be.

11
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:23,120
>> Okay.

12
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:25,220
>> First, we start off with our festival.

13
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:26,870
One of the other things you said we wanted to track, were

14
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:31,650
bands. Also, we wanted to track stages, and we wanted to track attendees.

15
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:35,972
>> Okay, so, you've written these words.

16
00:00:35,972 --> 00:00:37,477
is there any particular reason why you did

17
00:00:37,477 --> 00:00:41,480
it the way you did? Like in these boxes, or any reason for the structure?

18
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:42,700
>> So I think the boxes will become

19
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:44,890
a little more apparent when we go into the

20
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:47,880
app to start building. But for now, I mean,

21
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:51,870
it's pretty simple. We'll build up more later but

22
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:53,570
really, it'll become a little more interesting

23
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:55,210
when we actually start connecting the boxes and

24
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:57,000
talking about how do festivals relate to

25
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,260
bands, or how do attendees relate to festivals.

26
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:03,840
>> Okay, cool. so I, I, should we start building it? What do we have to do?

27
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,943
>> Yeah, let's go in the browser.

28
00:01:04,943 --> 00:01:05,209
>> Okay.
