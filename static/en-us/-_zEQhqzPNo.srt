00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,404
At this point lets turn to an overview of our immune system to help us

2
00:00:03,404 --> 00:00:06,968
understand exactly what's happening in our bodies and our ability to fight off

3
00:00:06,968 --> 00:00:12,555
illnesses. There are two types of defense we have as humans, we have natural

4
00:00:12,555 --> 00:00:17,400
immunity and we have acquired immunity. Natural immunity refers to the

5
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:21,458
processes that we have to remove foreign substances from our bodies.

6
00:00:21,458 --> 00:00:27,749
Inflammation, and phagocytosis, are two forms of natural immunity. Inflammation

7
00:00:27,749 --> 00:00:31,905
occurs when tissues are restored following some type of injury. Where as

8
00:00:31,905 --> 00:00:36,195
phagocytosis occurs when white blood cells take in a substance, and digest it,

9
00:00:36,195 --> 00:00:41,610
or, move it to a place where it can be destroyed. So these are two types of

10
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:46,150
natural immunities. And we have acquired immunities when we get antibodies that

11
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:51,242
are produced in the body in response to specific antigens. We get these through

12
00:00:51,242 --> 00:00:55,288
experience. For example, when you become sick from a virus, you develop

13
00:00:55,288 --> 00:01:00,305
antibodies that defend against that virus. And that's why specific viruses

14
00:01:00,305 --> 00:01:05,062
cannot affect you again in the future. This is an example of an acquired

15
00:01:05,062 --> 00:01:06,316
immunity.
