1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:04,979
In the notification versus
delegate question, I'm not

2
00:00:04,979 --> 00:00:10,010
100% sure how the candidate
understands this,

3
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:14,070
because he mentioned that an object
can have more than one delegate.

4
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:17,750
This is definitely not very usual and

5
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:21,250
you won't see any class designed
that way in foundation.

6
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:24,940
So I'm not sure if he was saying
that you can change the delegate.

7
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:30,149
But I like to make absolutely sure
that whoever is going to join our team

8
00:00:30,149 --> 00:00:35,447
understands that delegate is for
when you have to send information from

9
00:00:35,447 --> 00:00:41,215
one object to a single other object and
one object can only have one delegate.

10
00:00:41,215 --> 00:00:48,120
And notifications are more as he said
broadcast that part was pretty good.

11
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,970
So when you need to send information
to many objects you should use

12
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:53,030
notifications.

13
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:55,870
So I have maybe a few
reservations there,

14
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:59,650
but it looks like he understand
what he's talking about.
