00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,900
Hopefully you have some
ideas that you love and

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:05,840
that you assume users will love too.

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:07,110
>> For the purpose of this class,

4
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:10,730
we'll walk you through how we would come
up with a new kind of shopping app idea.

5
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:13,920
We'll be using this shopping app
idea as the main example throughout

6
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,500
the rest of the course.

7
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:19,220
>> You can use this idea,
a different version of this idea, or

8
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:21,570
come up with your own idea to
complete the final project.
