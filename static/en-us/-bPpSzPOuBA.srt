00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:04,770
Okay, I have loaded a timeline trace I have saved from an earlier session.

2
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:08,029
>> Wait, wait. You can save timeline traces?

3
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:09,960
>> Oh yeah. It's a pretty awesome feature.

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,360
You can just right click on the timeline

5
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:15,820
and save any trace. Similarly, you can load

6
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:17,620
a trace from a previous session in the

7
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:20,120
same way. This is a really useful feature

8
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,900
whenever you're debugging a site, and want to

9
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:26,090
keep it for further analysis or if you need to share it with someone. Hm. Wow.

10
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:29,890
All right, I've been taking screen shots. Really wish I'd known about his early.

11
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:32,700
>> Yeah, traces are definitely better than screen shots. I've

12
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,590
put a link to the trace we're looking at here in

13
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:37,270
the instructor notes. Why don't you download it and open it

14
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:39,211
on your machine to follow along. I'll wait a few seconds.

15
00:00:39,211 --> 00:00:44,179
[BLANK_AUDIO]

16
00:00:44,179 --> 00:00:50,310
Okay. Let's look for some CSS events in this trace. First, you can see the CSS

17
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:54,450
requests going out. Note that it happens after

18
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:57,960
the first trunk of HTML, is received. This

19
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,620
is where the parser finds the link tag

20
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:02,660
and initiates the CSS request. Then we wait

21
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:05,390
to get the css bites and finally a

22
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:09,190
bit later we see the re-calculus style event which

23
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:12,000
is were we convert the css response into the css

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,270
object model. In this particular case the css is tiny so

25
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:19,650
it only takes a few milliseconds to do the conversion,

26
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:23,570
but for larger style sheets this could definitely take much longer.

27
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:27,220
>> Okay, so before I rewrite all of my css rules. I should

28
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:30,750
probably record the timeline and check out how long this stuff is taking, right?

29
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:33,330
>> That's right. Measure first then optimize as needed.
