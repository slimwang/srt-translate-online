Hi, I'm Chris Pryby.

2
00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:03,600
I'm a course developer with Udacity and

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,240
also former Georgia Tech
graduate student.

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,560
I'll be presenting this course on linear
algebra designed specifically for

5
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:11,730
students of the OMS CS program.

6
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:14,610
Since linear algebra is
the backbone of many techniques and

7
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:18,720
algorithms in computer science, we
wanted to provide a resource for OMS CS

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:23,160
students to learn or brush up on some
of the fundamentals of this subject.

9
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:27,100
But instead of giving just another set
of lectures on this topic, we wanted to

10
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:30,790
put linear algebra in the context of
how you will use it in this program.

11
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:33,040
In this course,
in addition to learning some theory,

12
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,520
you will be implementing
the algorithms we discuss yourself.

13
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:40,290
By the end you will have built your own
library of linear algebra functions.

14
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:41,760
The only necessary background for

15
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,560
this course is knowledge
of a programming language.

16
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:47,130
But some familiarity with
elementary algebra and

17
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:49,310
trigonometry will be helpful as well.

18
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:51,860
I'm looking forward to this course and
I hope you are too.

19
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:52,980
Let's go ahead and get started.
