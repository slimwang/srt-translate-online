00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:05,971
We know the z score, so we can find the probability of getting anything less

2
00:00:05,971 --> 00:00:12,658
than that z score using our z table. So here's 0.8 and here's the column where

3
00:00:12,658 --> 00:00:20,190
it intersects 0.04. So the probability of getting less than a mean of 40 is

4
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:27,609
0.7995. So the probability of getting greater than a mean of 40 is 1 minus

5
00:00:27,609 --> 00:00:34,148
0.7995, which is only about 0.2. So it's somewhat unlikely to have randomly

6
00:00:34,148 --> 00:00:39,710
drawn a sample from the whole Klout population with a mean of 40. If this mean

7
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:45,694
wasn't selected by chance, then it's possible that this app, the Bieber Tweeter,

8
00:00:45,694 --> 00:00:51,150
which automatically re-tweets Justin Bieber, could have played a role in

9
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:58,000
increasing these people's Klout scores. But how unlikely is a probability of

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,502
0.2? There's no set threshold. But in the next lesson, we're going to show you

11
00:01:03,502 --> 00:01:08,386
how statisticians have formally decided whether or not something is likely or

12
00:01:08,386 --> 00:01:09,084
unlikely.
