00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,300
In our earlier examples of comparing different versions against one another,

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:06,950
we just conveniently had those old working versions sitting around.

3
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:11,020
In that case we manually saved off old versions under different file names.

4
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:14,140
I personally used to do this all the time with school essays, math papers, and

5
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:16,030
law tech and so on.

6
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:18,770
This is one very primitive form of version control.

7
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:21,380
How else might you get old version of your files?

8
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:24,460
It's likely that you've actually interacted with some systems that do some form

9
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:26,100
of version control for you.

10
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:27,720
Have you ever used Dropbox?

11
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,960
Dropbox actually periodically saves versions of your files.

12
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,940
After you've edited a file, you can right-click and

13
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:35,140
choose View Previous Versions.

14
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:38,390
And then in the browser, you can check some of the old versions.

15
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:42,500
Note that by default Dropbox only saves these version for 30 days.

16
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,260
Do you use Google Docs?

17
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:48,220
There's a little link up at the top that says, All Changes Saved in Drive.

18
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:51,280
If you click on that you get a side panel of all the old revisions made by

19
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,490
anyone who's ever worked on the Doc.

20
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:55,250
And you can restore to any point in time.

21
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:56,030
What about Wikipedia?

22
00:00:56,030 --> 00:01:00,230
If you go to any Wikipedia article, say maybe the one on version control,

23
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:04,560
you'll see a View History tab that you can click on to see all the old versions.

24
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:07,780
You can click through to see an entire old version or

25
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:10,335
you can compare any two versions against one another.

26
00:01:10,335 --> 00:01:12,220
Let's take some time now for another reflection
