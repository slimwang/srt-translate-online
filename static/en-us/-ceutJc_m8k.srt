00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:05,360
But what if our sum, instead, was 11 x plus 22? What do you think our final

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:09,681
answer would be this time? Now, I know this wasn't the sum for our last problem,

3
00:00:09,681 --> 00:00:13,557
but I want you to see if there's an extra step you need to do at the end.

4
00:00:13,558 --> 00:00:18,576
Sometimes you need to simplify further. Can you in this case? Write your answer

5
00:00:18,576 --> 00:00:19,038
here.
