1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:04,460
To upload wireframes, JPEGs,
or PNGs simply drag and

2
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:08,130
drop your images directly
into your browser window, or

3
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:11,670
you can simply click Browse to select
screens you would like to import.

4
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:15,790
If you find yourself manually uploading
screens one by one, it may be a long and

5
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:20,350
cumbersome process, so you may consider
using EnVision sync as a method for

6
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:23,500
automatically uploading screens for you.

7
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:27,740
EnVision Sync can automatically detect
changes to the screens that you've saved

8
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:30,060
on a local folder on your computer, and

9
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:33,560
automatically import those
into EnVision for you.

10
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:36,390
The advantage of using
EnVision Sync is that you can

11
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:39,470
automatically have those screens
uploaded into EnVision so

12
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:42,849
you don't have to manually upload them
each time you want to create a project.

13
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:46,510
Once you've finished
uploading your screens,

14
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:50,910
you'll see a thumbnail preview of all of
your screens uploaded into your project.
