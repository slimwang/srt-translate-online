00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:00,690
All right, For our 7th and final problem I want you to try dividing these two

2
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:05,101
rational expressions. This is a challenge problem, so it's going to be a little

3
00:00:05,101 --> 00:00:11,260
bit tougher than one's you're used to. I'll admit, the hardest part is actually

4
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:15,444
factoring, but if you do get the correct answer then great job. You're on your

5
00:00:15,444 --> 00:00:19,155
way to becoming a pro at factorizing and rationalizing expressions.
