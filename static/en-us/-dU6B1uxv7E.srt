00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,199
Welcome to CS212. Now, in this class,
you're going to be learning by example. So

2
00:00:05,211 --> 00:00:09,963
I will pose some problems to you and
you'll get a chance to create your

3
00:00:09,975 --> 00:00:15,189
solution. And then I'll show you and
discuss my solution. It's important to

4
00:00:15,201 --> 00:00:20,465
note that there's more then one way to
approach a problem, and I don't mean that

5
00:00:20,477 --> 00:00:26,711
my solution is the only way or the best
way. My solutions are there to help you

6
00:00:26,723 --> 00:00:32,743
learn a style and some techniques for
programming. But if you saw problems a

7
00:00:32,755 --> 00:00:39,554
different way, that's fine. Good for you.
All learning that goes on happens inside

8
00:00:39,566 --> 00:00:45,699
of your head, not inside of my head. So
what's important is that you understand

9
00:00:45,902 --> 00:00:51,798
the relation between your code and my code
that you get the right answer by writing

10
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:57,544
out the solution yourself and then you can
examine my code and maybe pick up some

11
00:00:57,556 --> 00:01:03,558
pointers and some techniques that you can
use later. For example, suppose I ask you

12
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:09,815
to compute the sum of a list of numbers.
Here's the mathematical formula. And I ask

13
00:01:09,827 --> 00:01:16,990
you to write function, which we'll call
ss, for sum of squares, which takes a list

14
00:01:17,002 --> 00:01:23,590
of numbers as input. If you've taken
CS101, you might write a solution like

15
00:01:23,602 --> 00:01:28,522
this, initialize the total=0.
We'll go through the indices of the

16
00:01:28,534 --> 00:01:33,503
numbers and for each one we'll increment
the total by the square of the number, and

17
00:01:33,515 --> 00:01:37,806
then when we're done we'll return the
total. So that's a perfectly good

18
00:01:37,818 --> 00:01:42,586
solution. No problems with that
whatsoever. If you're able to come up with

19
00:01:42,598 --> 00:01:48,275
that you've done your job. But then after
you come up with your solution I'll show

20
00:01:48,287 --> 00:01:54,179
you mine and mine might look like this,
same function definition. But I might

21
00:01:54,191 --> 00:02:00,008
prefer a functional style rather a
sequencial style where I'm return the sum

22
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:06,306
of the squares of X for each X in number.
Now maybe you've never seen something like

23
00:02:06,318 --> 00:02:12,600
this before maybe you didn't know about
the sum function. Maybe you didn't know

24
00:02:12,612 --> 00:02:19,050
about this type of generator expression in
line so this might all be new to you.

25
00:02:19,172 --> 00:02:25,220
Important point is that this solution of
yours is just as valid as mine. So what I

26
00:02:25,232 --> 00:02:30,355
want you to do is just compare your
solution to my solution and see if

27
00:02:30,367 --> 00:02:36,635
there's anything interesting or new in
mine that you might pick up. I don't want

28
00:02:36,647 --> 00:02:41,078
you to say, hey, that's not fair, Peter,
you introduced some new idea that I

29
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:45,624
haven't seen before. Don't let that make
you upset. Instead, I want you to say,

30
00:02:45,725 --> 00:02:50,234
well, my solution works, but this is
interesting, too, and this is something

31
00:02:50,246 --> 00:02:54,716
new. I want you to be happy that you
learned something new, and proud that you

32
00:02:54,728 --> 00:02:59,166
came up with a solution that is just as
good. But happen to just use some

33
00:02:59,178 --> 00:03:04,163
different techniques. So remember,
learning is not me saying something and

34
00:03:04,444 --> 00:03:09,431
pouring that into your head. Rather,
learning is what goes on inside of your

35
00:03:09,443 --> 00:03:14,595
head. And it's up to you to make use of
what I show you. So that you can learn.

36
00:03:14,712 --> 00:03:20,435
This class is an apprenticeship. You
learned first by observing, then by trying

37
00:03:20,447 --> 00:03:26,115
it yourself when the next example comes up
and then finally now you really got it

38
00:03:26,127 --> 00:03:31,845
down when you can take what you've learned
and teach it to someone else, may be in

39
00:03:31,857 --> 00:03:37,621
the forums or may be outside of class. Now
one final point. The problems in this class

40
00:03:37,633 --> 00:03:42,459
are hard, the best learning takes place
when you're challenged and this class

41
00:03:42,471 --> 00:03:47,440
will challenge you. Don't worry if you
don't get everything on the first try, use

42
00:03:47,452 --> 00:03:52,056
the forms to ask questions, view the
videos more than once if you think that

43
00:03:52,068 --> 00:03:56,883
the helps, give yourself time to let new
ideas sink in, you may have to see them

44
00:03:56,895 --> 00:04:01,424
multiple times before it makes sense so
don't worry about having to review

45
00:04:01,436 --> 00:04:06,942
multiple times or ask for help. It's hard
but it's fun hard, so welcome to the

46
00:04:06,954 --> 00:04:10,613
class, good luck. I hope you enjoy as much
as I do.
