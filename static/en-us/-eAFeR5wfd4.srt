1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,420
Let's now elaborate on the goals of operating

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:06,850
systems structure. The first goal is protection. By

3
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:10,230
protection what we mean is protecting the user

4
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:13,070
from the system and the system from the user

5
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:15,600
and also users from one another. And also

6
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,162
protecting an individual user from his or her own

7
00:00:19,162 --> 00:00:22,500
mistakes. That's what we mean by protection. And

8
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:26,370
this is an important goal of operating system structuring.

9
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:29,770
An operating system, of course, provides services and

10
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:32,351
one of the key determinants of a good

11
00:00:32,351 --> 00:00:36,480
operating system structure is how good is the

12
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,960
performance of the operating system. That is, what is

13
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,270
the time taken to perform services on behalf

14
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:45,930
of the application. I have, you've heard me say

15
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:48,590
this even before in the previous lecture. A

16
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:51,830
good operating system is one that provides the service

17
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:56,980
that is needed by the application very quickly and gets out of the way. And

18
00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:00,100
that's the key determinant of operating system

19
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:03,310
structure as well. Another goal, of operating system

20
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:08,100
structure, and in fact, one of the goals that we will be focusing a lot

21
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:11,850
on in this course module, is flexibility.

22
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:17,180
Sometimes also called extensibility, meaning that a service

23
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:22,450
that is provided by the operating system is not one size fits all, but the

24
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:26,140
service is something that is adaptable to the

25
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:29,800
requirements of the application. Another important goal of

26
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:33,180
structuring an operating system is to ensure that

27
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:36,460
the performance of the operating system goes up

28
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:40,250
as you add more hardware resources to the

29
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:42,926
system. This is sort of an intuitive understanding,

30
00:01:42,926 --> 00:01:44,890
but you want to make sure that

31
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:48,530
the operating system developers on this intuitive understanding

32
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:51,920
that when you increase the hardware resources,

33
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,890
the performance also goes up, and that's what

34
00:01:54,890 --> 00:02:01,240
is meant by scalability. It turns out that both the needs of the application may

35
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:04,680
change over the lifetime of an application

36
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,110
and also the resources that are available for

37
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:14,070
the operating system to manage and give to the application may change over time.

38
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:17,200
Agility of the operating system refers to

39
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,700
how quickly the operating system adapts itself

40
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:22,740
to changes either in the application needs

41
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:25,360
or the resource availability from the underlying

42
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,740
hardware. Another worthwhile goal of operating system

43
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:34,120
structure would be responsiveness. That is, how quickly

44
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:37,405
the operating system reacts to external events, and

45
00:02:37,405 --> 00:02:42,110
this is particularly important for applications that are interactive

46
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:43,950
in nature. Imagine you are playing a video

47
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:47,040
game. In that case, what you want to see

48
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,320
is when you do something like clicking the

49
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:52,110
mouse to shoot at a target, you want to

50
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:55,220
see action immediately on the screen. So that

51
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:59,780
is responsiveness, how quickly the operating system is reacting

52
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:00,850
to external events.
