1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:04,390
So that gives us some idea how to solve it systematically. If we thought about a

2
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:09,590
harder problem, let's say we increased the year, well then we would need to add

3
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:14,828
the days in the years, and some of those years will have 365 days. Some of those

4
00:00:14,828 --> 00:00:19,243
years will be leap years, and we'll have 366. So you see this is a fairly

5
00:00:19,243 --> 00:00:23,399
complicated problem. Maybe based on this we have enough of an idea to write down

6
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:26,752
as an algorithm what we did as a human. So that's what I'm going to try to do

7
00:00:26,752 --> 00:00:26,993
next.
