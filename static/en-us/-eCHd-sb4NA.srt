1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,950
As we mentioned in a previous morsel,

2
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:05,780
system software can
access devices directly.

3
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:11,520
And in Linux, the command ioctl
is used to directly access and

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:12,950
manipulate devices.

5
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:17,154
It stands for io control,
and this is essentially

6
00:00:17,154 --> 00:00:22,040
a way that the operating system can
access the device's control registers.

7
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:25,520
For this quiz you need
to do the following.

8
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:29,980
Again, in Linux the ioctl command
can be used to manipulate devices.

9
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:34,500
What you need to do is complete
the code snippet using ioctl so

10
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,780
as the determine the size
of a block device.
