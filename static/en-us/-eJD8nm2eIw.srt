00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,838
Here's our third problem with motion. This time we have a speed boat that takes

2
00:00:03,838 --> 00:00:08,677
6 hours to travel downstream when the current is 12 miles per hour. The return

3
00:00:08,677 --> 00:00:12,583
trip for the boat would be upstream and the boat's going to travel at its same

4
00:00:12,583 --> 00:00:18,070
speed. But against the current and that's going to take it 8 hours. Your

5
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:22,458
challenge is to find the speed of the boat in still water. As always, we'll use

6
00:00:22,458 --> 00:00:27,394
a table to help us get started. So again here, we're looking for the speed of

7
00:00:27,394 --> 00:00:31,711
the boat. So we'll let that be x. See if you can fill in the missing

8
00:00:31,711 --> 00:00:35,446
information for our table. And this time there is something different with our

9
00:00:35,446 --> 00:00:40,756
time column. We're actually given the times to go upstream and downstream. This

10
00:00:40,756 --> 00:00:46,101
means that we'll have numbers here and expressions for distance here. See if

11
00:00:46,101 --> 00:00:48,051
you can figure this one out.
