1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,390
Color constancy is that the hue of something, the hue and

2
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:07,689
pretty much saturation, under different color, over different spectra or

3
00:00:07,689 --> 00:00:10,200
color of lighting, you're still good at seeing.

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:10,960
So, you know, you,

5
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:15,930
you go outside and or you go inside where lights are different colors,

6
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:20,090
and purple shirts look purple, green, green pants look green.

7
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:22,220
Purple shirts and green pants together look bizarre.

8
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:23,880
But you know, it's okay, you can still,

9
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:27,270
you can still see it, regardless of the color of the illumination.

10
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:29,240
The same thing, lightness constancy is like,

11
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:32,920
what I was talking about the, the, the black piece of coal always looks black,

12
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,790
even though more light is hitting your eye from the black piece of

13
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:39,470
coal outdoors, than from the white piece of paper indoors.

14
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:42,830
So humans are very good at perceiving ,.

15
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:45,870
What color a surface would have looked like if the light had

16
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:47,320
actually been white?

17
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:50,660
So you sort of remove the effect of the illumination.

18
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:54,200
We're pretty good at also being able to figure out what's

19
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,850
actually hitting our eyes, so you can say well it's a bluish thing, but

20
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:00,120
I actually see kind of a more purplish light coming in.

21
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,380
You can sort of make that distinction.

22
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:03,270
What humans are not so

23
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:06,560
good at is being able to tell you what the color of the light is,

24
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,210
because they're brain is spending all this time trying to eliminate,

25
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:14,990
the color of the light and they're not so good at being able to report that.

26
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:17,940
So there are lots of methods that are used to try to

27
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:19,670
accomplish this kind of computationally.

28
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:23,310
One method is.

29
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:25,100
Let's suppose I don't know the color of a light, but

30
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:28,400
I want to render something well on, say, a color CCD image.

31
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,320
Right?

32
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,930
Well, one thing you can do is you can say,

33
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:34,440
let me assume that the average color is gray.

34
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:37,150
That the average intensity is gray.

35
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:40,570
And so those of you who have auto white balance on your cameras.

36
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:42,420
And most of us with digital cameras do.

37
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:45,090
It's essentially averaging over all that and saying.

38
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:47,830
Let me take a look at all the different average color and

39
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:52,100
assume that it's really grey out there, so anything that's

40
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:56,770
makes the whole average not grey is due to the illuminant and I'll change that.

41
00:01:56,770 --> 00:02:00,570
And it works okay it can sort of fail in that.

42
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:02,800
So, you know that tungsten film, right, so

43
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:07,610
if you're, if you're, you know, if things aren't, aren't really great,

44
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:11,490
you're ability to automatically do white balance, is really difficult.

45
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:13,820
There's another really very simple method,

46
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:16,280
assume that the brightest thing I see is white.

47
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:21,740
So that way if the brightest thing I see is actually light blueish, I say okay,

48
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:23,450
that was really supposed to be white.

49
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:25,780
So I'm going to assume the light is kind of blue, and

50
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:28,160
I'll undo the blue light that's there.

51
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:32,990
Okay, those of you that ever done, manual white balancing in cameras,

52
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:36,320
you know that you put out a white card, or white piece of paper,

53
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:39,250
you take an image of it, you say this is a white balance image, and

54
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:41,860
you're telling it, this thing is really white, so

55
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:45,290
that any color that you see in there is because of the illuminant.

56
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:49,260
Pull that out when you're doing the, when,

57
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:50,610
when you're trying to do the color balancing.

58
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,850
There are other things that say,

59
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:58,330
I'm going to assume that the colors are supposed to span the entire color gamut.

60
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:02,580
And so if I see the color sort of shifted, let me try to bring it back and

61
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,090
fill the whole gamut.

62
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:09,180
So, these methods work sort of okay for photography because,

63
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:12,290
it turns out that even if you get it a little wrong, your brain,

64
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:16,480
when looking at the photograph, will often undo the right thing to begin with.

65
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,020
But none of these methods really work well enough for

66
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:22,500
computer vision in order to analyze what's going on out there.

67
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,800
It's still really an open problem.
