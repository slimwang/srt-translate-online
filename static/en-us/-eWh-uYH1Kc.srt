00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
In this homework you're going to be asked to write a grammar that will allow us

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
to write a parser for the JSON language.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
JSON is a data interchange language for JavaScript that allows JavaScript programs

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
to pass values back and forth and pass them on to other programs.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
What I'm asking you to do is to write this grammar.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
You can look at JSON.org to see the definition.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
There is a little grammar there on the right-hand side.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
It's not quite in the right format that we expect here,

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
so you're going to have to translate it into the right format.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Then you should be able to parse.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
A top level is called a value in JSON.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
You should be able to parse that with your grammar.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Here I've given you some examples that you can test out to see if they make sense.

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
See if you can translate the JSON grammar into our format,

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
and see how easy that is.
