1
00:00:00,182 --> 00:00:01,190
So we move on.

2
00:00:01,191 --> 00:00:03,910
We look for another shortest path.

3
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:09,291
There's one path left of length one,
so we look at that path, we expand it.

4
00:00:09,291 --> 00:00:14,900
Add in this path,
put that one on the explored list.

5
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:18,039
And now we've got three
paths of length two.

6
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:19,710
We choose one of them.

7
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:22,989
And let's say we choose this one.

8
00:00:22,989 --> 00:00:29,269
Now, my question is,
show me which states we add to the path.

9
00:00:29,269 --> 00:00:33,399
And tell me whether we're going to
terminate the algorithm at this point

10
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:36,399
because we've reached the goal, or
whether we're going to continue.
