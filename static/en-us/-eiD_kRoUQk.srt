00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:02,050
I mentioned, a minute ago,

2
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:06,930
the association class. You can think of an association class as ac-,

3
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:12,430
as an association that has some class properties. For example attributes, or

4
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:15,430
you can think of it as a class that has some association properties.

5
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:23,280
Here's an example. If we have a company class. And a person class,

6
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:29,870
and we have some kind of association between them that a person, has

7
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:35,550
a job with a company. We might want to indicate what that person's salary is,

8
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:42,080
from that company. So this is not really a property of the person.

9
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:47,610
Because the person might have more than one job is not really a property of

10
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:51,320
the company because the company certainly has more than one person.

11
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:54,070
It's really a property of the association itself.

12
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:00,860
Association classes are indicated by having a dashed line.

13
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:06,730
That abuts into the association line. At the end of the dash line is

14
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:12,910
another rectangle. In this case it is the association of class called job,

15
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:17,210
and in the class rectangle for job there is an attribute of salary.

16
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:24,470
Notice something else a little peculiar here. That job,

17
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:30,550
has an association with itself. This is called a recursive association.

18
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:37,200
For recursive associations in particular, you better use role names.

19
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:43,200
This case, we're talking about the manages association. So

20
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:50,020
one job might manage another job. The department head might manage the staff and

21
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:55,430
therefore we want to have roles for the boss or supervisor, and the worker.
