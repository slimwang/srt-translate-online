1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:04,970
Before we can identify the cars, and the connected car's data.

2
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:07,680
Let's start with a question.

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,270
What is the data collected by the connected car?

4
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:16,500
To answer this question, we will take a look at some aspects of the data.

5
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:21,420
As in the previous examples, we will be using the iPython Notebook.

6
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:26,672
From the instructor's notes, please find the download links to

7
00:00:26,672 --> 00:00:31,470
the iPython Notebook and the data set that we will use in this lesson and

8
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:37,620
make sure you have a file in it named connected cars.cvs.

9
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:43,640
Launch the iPython Notebook, and click on Lesson 4 Handout.

10
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:48,120
You should see something like this on your web browser screen.

11
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,610
Let's look at the first block of code.

12
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:55,470
Here, the first thing we do is import the pandas library.

13
00:00:55,470 --> 00:01:02,750
And then we use the Pandas library to read the CSV file, connected_cars.csv.

14
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:07,590
For the entirety of this lesson, to run the piece of code in that block,

15
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:09,680
we will use the Play button here.

16
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:15,680
You can also use the Enter and Shift button together to do the same.

17
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,910
Let's run this piece of code.

18
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:23,520
Now the data has already been loaded in a pandas data frame.

19
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,260
The data frame is called events.

20
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:31,910
We will use the describe method for the data frame to see what it loaded.

21
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:35,950
Here, you will see a summary of the data in a table.

22
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:41,490
This summary shows that we have 128,561 events or entries.

23
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:50,560
You can take a look at the actual data by using the head method on the events.

24
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:55,980
The head method shows you what is inside the data.

25
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:59,740
In this case we have 5 columns.

26
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:01,550
In the first column we have.

27
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:02,980
A driver ID.

28
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:06,020
The second column gives us some values of x.

29
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:08,190
The third some values of y.

30
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:12,100
The fourth are dates on which these values were taken.

31
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:16,720
And the fifth, the time at which these values were taken.

32
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:21,100
We only see here the top 5 events.

33
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:26,890
Similarly, we can try to use the tail method on events.

34
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:28,230
Let's see what happens.

35
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:29,870
We see the same.

36
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:34,400
Sort of data except now the driver IDs are G.

37
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:39,150
You can see these are the last 5 rows of the data set.

38
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:41,450
We will quickly summarize the data.

39
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:45,820
We saw that the data has IDs A to G.

40
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:49,650
It has some x and y location, or coordinates.

41
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:52,700
It also has a date and time.

42
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:57,200
Here, we have a scattered diagram to show you what the data actually contains.

43
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:02,080
These are coordinates of people driving around in a connected car.
