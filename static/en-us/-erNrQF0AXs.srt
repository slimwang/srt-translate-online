It's the activation of the sympathetic nervous system that allows us to flee or

2
00:00:04,424 --> 00:00:09,036
fight in dangerous situations. Here's a real example I like to share with my

3
00:00:09,036 --> 00:00:13,360
students. I had completed almost a 13 hour hike to the top of Half Dome at

4
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:19,546
Yosemite National Park. I was exhausted, my knees hurt, I was so tired. I

5
00:00:19,546 --> 00:00:24,750
didn't think I could make it down. When all of a sudden, somebody yelled, bear.

6
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:29,099
Sure enough my sympathetic nervous system became activated. I was able to run

7
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:34,060
almost the entire way down the remainder of the mountain, one mile. That is a

8
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:38,080
great example of fleeing or fighting and activation of the sympathetic nervous

9
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,469
system.
