1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,610
Well, you actually go into the operating
system, so it's still mediating.

2
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:08,135
You have actually turned off the check.

3
00:00:08,135 --> 00:00:12,500
I'm going to say that you
tampered with the TCB, so

4
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:16,940
it's the tamper proof
requirement has been violated.

5
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:20,770
As a result of that,
it's no longer functioning correctly.

6
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:23,680
So correctness is not going to be there,
but

7
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:28,360
I think the reason that the violation
that we first run into it is,

8
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:33,570
that it's been altered or tampered with,
because we have turned off this check.

9
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:37,139
So the answer to this
should be the Tamper-proof.
