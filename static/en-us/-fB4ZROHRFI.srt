1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,689
To subtract the second rational expression we really want to add the opposite.

2
00:00:04,689 --> 00:00:09,045
We want to distribute our subtraction sign to each term in the numerator which

3
00:00:09,045 --> 00:00:13,110
gives us a negative 1. Now we factor each denominator and try to find the lowest

4
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:18,466
common denominator between the two fractions. The lowest common denominator is x

5
00:00:18,466 --> 00:00:22,551
minus 1 times x minus 1 times x plus 1. We know this since these two

6
00:00:22,551 --> 00:00:26,519
denominators share a common factor of x minus 1. The other factor for this

7
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:31,164
denominator is x minus 1. And the other factor for this denominator is x plus 1.

8
00:00:31,164 --> 00:00:34,766
We multiply each fraction by the missing factors of the lowest common

9
00:00:34,766 --> 00:00:40,464
denominator. For the first fraction, we distribute 6x to the quantity x plus 1.

10
00:00:40,464 --> 00:00:46,770
We'll get 6x squared plus 6x. For this second fraction, we'll have negative 1

11
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:51,087
times the quantity x minus 1. We really just changed these two signs. So we'll

12
00:00:51,087 --> 00:00:55,930
have negative x plus 1. Now that we have two fractions with common denominators

13
00:00:55,930 --> 00:01:01,132
We can add the numerators together. We just add the like terms. When we add the

14
00:01:01,132 --> 00:01:06,840
like terms of 6x and negative x together we'll get 6x squared plus 5x plus 1.

15
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:12,430
Now remember, we have a new numerator here. And let's see if we can factor it.

16
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:17,805
We want factors of positive 6 that's sum to 5. Well yes that would be 3 and 2.

17
00:01:17,805 --> 00:01:21,973
This would be the factored form if we use factoring by grouping. But notice that

18
00:01:21,973 --> 00:01:26,448
this doesn't help us out. None of these factors appears in our denominator. We

19
00:01:26,448 --> 00:01:31,032
can't simply any more. I final answer would be 6 x squared plus 5 x plus 1.

20
00:01:31,032 --> 00:01:34,493
Divided by the factors of this denominator.
