00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
But nobody asked about the perceptron algorithm, suppose you have the following

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
2 dimensional linear set where plus indicates

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
a positive class label and minus a negative class label, and my first question is,

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
"Are these data linearly separable?"

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'd also like to know if we start perceptron

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
with an initial separating plane like this,

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
will it actually converge?

8
00:00:25,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Please check the appropriate boxes yes or no, and yes or no.
