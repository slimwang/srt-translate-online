00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,822
When we were working with equations for
Grant this last time, what we were really

2
00:00:04,834 --> 00:00:09,355
doing was taking one expression, 87w+72n,
and subtracting from it another

3
00:00:09,367 --> 00:00:13,922
expression, 3w+ And we worked with
parentheses in a kind of new way. So,

4
00:00:14,025 --> 00:00:18,794
let's take a second, and talk a bit more
explicitly about how to add and subtract

5
00:00:18,932 --> 00:00:23,698
polynomials. Let's start out by comparing
what the difference is between subtracting

6
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:28,171
polynomials and adding polynomials. So,
this first expression is what dealt with

7
00:00:28,183 --> 00:00:32,281
in the last quiz. And we saw that because
there's a minus sign in front of a

8
00:00:32,293 --> 00:00:36,682
quantity with parentheses around it, we
need to change the sign of the operator

9
00:00:36,694 --> 00:00:41,254
that's in front of the 12n here. That's
inside the parentheses. So, here's what we

10
00:00:41,266 --> 00:00:45,589
ended up with. We said that we needed to
subtract both the 3w and the 12n, so both

11
00:00:45,601 --> 00:00:50,017
of them have minus signs in front of them
now. What if instead, though, we decided

12
00:00:50,029 --> 00:00:53,696
to add them? So, we want to add this
entire quantity that's inside the

13
00:00:53,708 --> 00:00:58,099
parentheses. So, here's a little quiz.
What terms would you put in this green box

14
00:00:58,111 --> 00:01:02,699
right here to correctly complete this
expression over here? The key here is that

15
00:01:02,711 --> 00:01:07,043
I want you to get rid of these parentheses
that are around the 3w+12n, and show me

16
00:01:07,055 --> 00:01:11,253
how doing that changes the expression.
I've already put a plus sign right here

17
00:01:11,265 --> 00:01:15,445
for you. So, that means that if you want
the first term in the box to be negative,

18
00:01:15,541 --> 00:01:17,797
then I'd like you to put a negative sign
in front of it.
