00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,200
Let's continue our investigation by looking at some variables

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:06,030
that are highly correlated. This time we'll look at the

3
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:08,430
number of likes users received from friends on the

4
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:11,596
desktop version on the site. This is the www likes

5
00:00:11,596 --> 00:00:15,640
received. We'll compare this variable to the total number

6
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:19,670
of likes users received which is the likes received variable.

7
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:22,130
Now you could of course get likes received through the

8
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:24,580
mobile version but we're not going to look at that here.

9
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:28,220
So now I'm going to hand it off to you. I want you

10
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:33,650
to create a scatter plot of this variable versus this variable and it should

11
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:38,330
make sense that likes received should be higher than www likes received. Since

12
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:42,410
some of the likes may be coming from other sources, either mobile or unknown.
