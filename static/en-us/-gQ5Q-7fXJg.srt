00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:04,440
You may recall this explanation from our lesson on explanation-based learning.

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:08,230
There, the agent constructed an explanation like this to show that a specific

3
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:12,514
object was an example of a cup. For a good example of a pail, the agent may

4
00:00:12,514 --> 00:00:16,468
have constructed similar explanation with the object being replaced by pail

5
00:00:16,468 --> 00:00:22,210
everywhere. Now however, the agent knows that pail is not an example of a cup.

6
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:26,225
Something is not quite right with this explanation. We've also just seen how

7
00:00:26,225 --> 00:00:31,500
the agent can identify the false suspicious relationship in this explanation.

8
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:36,640
It is identified, but the handle must be fixed because that is the feature that

9
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,130
separates the positive experiences from the negative experiences.

10
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:43,140
The question then becomes, how can this explanation be

11
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:47,850
repaired by incorporating handle as fixed? Where should handle as fixed go?
