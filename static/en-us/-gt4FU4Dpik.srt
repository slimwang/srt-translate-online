1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
It's proof time again! 3 AM in the recording studio. And as always, this is entirely optional.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
This goes way beyond what will ever be taught in an introduction to statistics class.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
It's only for those who love hard-to-prove challenges.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
And as previously, we're going to prove the correctness of

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
the maximum likelihood estimator or MLE but this time for Gaussians.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Our Xi's can now be arbitrary values not just 0s or 1s.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
And the mean and the variance are computed using these two now familiar formula.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
How can we prove this to be correct? Again, last chance to skip.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
As before, there's the proof on the left side with a couple of blanks five in total.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
And there's seven expressions that you can put in

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
and the way you put them in is if for example the seventh expression

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
in your opinion fits over here you put the number 7 in here.

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
You only use each expression on the right side once,

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
and there's obviously more expressions on the right side than the holes on the left side.

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Let me quickly go over the proof.

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
In maximizing the probability of the data, we first state the probability of these data items

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
and then send over here using a normal distribution with prime of µ and σ².

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
But that left something unknown on the left that you have to pick from the right side.

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Then we take the logarithm of this and here's the logarithm with two gaps in sight.

20
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
We take the first derivative of the logarithm that you have to compute

21
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
by picking the appropriate term on the right

22
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
and set it to 0, which is where the maximum is obtained.

23
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,000
From there, we can transform the expression to this expression over here where I left out a term

24
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
and it finally gives you the desired proof for the maximum likelihood estimator for the mean.

25
00:01:50,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Good luck!
