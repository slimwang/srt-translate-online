1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,680
Let's do the vertices
first since they're easy.

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:06,070
These two become one, and
these three become one.

3
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:10,120
So we should have entered a 2
in this box and a 3 in this box.

4
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:12,470
For the edges here are the answers.

5
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:17,310
The interesting cases are this edge,
which comes from these two edges, and

6
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:20,940
this edge which comes
from these three edges.

7
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:24,370
This one on the left is probably easy to
see, because it's the simple case of,

8
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:28,070
well, there are two vertices
connected to the same vertex.

9
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:30,300
The other case might be a little
bit trickier to see, but

10
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,000
it's the same principle.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,780
You could, for example,
imagine taking these three vertices,

12
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:36,690
collapsing them into a single vertex.

13
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:37,850
In which case,

14
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:41,970
now I have a single super vertex over
here connected to these two guys.

15
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:44,590
If it helps, let's take a look
at an intermediate graph.

16
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:49,440
So what I'm showing here is the graph
you get if you first collapse these two

17
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,380
in a super vertex, but
before you collapse these three.

18
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:57,780
In this case notice that these two
edges would combine into this edge.

19
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:58,940
So there should be a two here.

20
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:04,150
I hope you can now easily see that when
you collapse these three vertices,

21
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:05,760
these two edges will have to combine.

22
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,710
So that's two plus one, or three.
