1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,560
All right, welcome back, and
good job with the first two tests.

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:08,350
So to answer the third question, the
ViewGroup we used was the LinearLayout.

3
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:11,390
And now let's take a look into
the code of how we accomplished

4
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:13,110
steps one and two.

5
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:15,580
So here we are in the list
item layout file.

6
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:20,240
So to match our code,
we'll need to add a view ID of TextView.

7
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:25,030
And have this text view,
have an id of default text view.

8
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:29,050
Now to test it out,

9
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:32,439
I'm going to show you a cool trick using
something called the tools namespace.

10
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,240
In XML, a namespace provides a way so
that elements don't have name conflicts.

11
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:40,850
This is similar to having
a very unique family name.

12
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:43,400
So that no one else will ever
share the same name as you,

13
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:49,660
even if they might have the same first
name so XMLNS stands for XML NameSpace.

14
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:53,760
And if you notice here we've been
using another namespace in our

15
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,380
code all along XMLNS:android.

16
00:00:56,380 --> 00:01:00,020
So the attributes that we've been
using in Android already such as

17
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:04,635
android:layout _width or android:layout_
height all start with Android; and

18
00:01:04,635 --> 00:01:07,890
these are already part of
the Android namespace.

19
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:11,340
So I want to add a namespace
here called the tools namespace.

20
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:15,255
So this line here maps the tools
prefixed to this namespace

21
00:01:15,255 --> 00:01:20,600
schemas.Android.com/tools and
this means that any element or attribute

22
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:24,770
whose name starts with the prefix
tools is part of the tools namespace.

23
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:27,670
So for each of these two
text views I'm going to add

24
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:30,320
two attributes using
the tools namespace.

25
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:35,730
So you may be wondering where I
found out about this text attribute

26
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:37,590
from the tools namespace.

27
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:41,350
So the tools namespace was created
by the Android's tools team and

28
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:45,000
has a bunch of attributes that can help
you out with writing your layouts.

29
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,463
So we can see the attributes were
created by checking out their

30
00:01:47,463 --> 00:01:53,350
documentation online and I just
searched up Android Tools namespace.

31
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:56,400
So on this page we see a whole
list of different attributes.

32
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,850
So when we scroll down to the bottom,

33
00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:01,180
we see a section about
designtime attributes.

34
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:04,450
So Designtime Attributes help us when
we're developing our code, but won't

35
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:08,660
actually show up at runtime, so let's
take a look and see more of them here.

36
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:12,670
For example, if we add the tools:text
attribute on a text view.

37
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:16,280
Then in the design preview in
Android Studio, it will show this text.

38
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,910
However, this text won't show up
when the app is actually running,

39
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:19,820
which is good.

40
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:22,420
because we don't want all
the text views to always have

41
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:24,400
this particular text that we've set in.

42
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,090
So you can think of this as
a placeholder text to help us as

43
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:30,120
developers make sure the code looks
all right when we're testing it

44
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,650
Android Studio.

45
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:35,800
So let's switch back to the code,
and notice here that I've added two

46
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:40,190
text attributes, one for
lutti and one for one.

47
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:43,910
And so making sure that these don't
show up at run time is really important.

48
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:46,800
Because the list of items will
be created dynamically on

49
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,170
the spot when needed.

50
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:52,070
So will set the text of the English and
words in the Java code instead of just

51
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:56,060
hard coding them and specifying
them directly in XML layout file.

52
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:58,690
And since the text in these text
views will change dynamically,

53
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:01,750
we won't need to add the Android
text attribute view,

54
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:05,600
just to help us see what it looks like,
but not actually see it at runtime.

55
00:03:07,668 --> 00:03:11,670
So I'm going to switch back into the
design pane and from the design preview

56
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:14,626
you'll notice that the text is right
up against the edges on the left and

57
00:03:14,626 --> 00:03:15,550
top sides.

58
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:17,020
So we'll need to add some padding.

59
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:19,810
So let's go back to the text pane and
add some padding here.

60
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:24,140
All right, so let's take a look at what
that looks like in the design pane now.

61
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:27,340
Nice, so this is what the list item
layout looks after those changes.

62
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,760
While this is not the final look and

63
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:31,930
feel of the list item in our app,
it's good enough to continue working on

64
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:33,470
displaying the list of
numbers in our app.
