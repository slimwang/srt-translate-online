1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,404
Let's imagine that these spectrums of
questions really do line up with not

2
00:00:04,404 --> 00:00:08,285
just easy and hardness, but
actually line up with understanding.

3
00:00:08,285 --> 00:00:10,585
Which is sort of the assumption
that we made, right?

4
00:00:10,585 --> 00:00:13,445
That anyone can answer the easy
questions, but as you know more,

5
00:00:13,445 --> 00:00:15,240
you can answer the hard questions.

6
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,930
That means the chance of
you being able to sort of,

7
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:21,470
these questions are aligned, not just in
terms of easy and hard, they're actually

8
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:24,650
aligned with some underlying
notion of what you actually know.

9
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:27,994
That your knowledge is, which I'm
just writing as understanding here.

10
00:00:27,994 --> 00:00:28,573
>> Okay
>> Okay,

11
00:00:28,573 --> 00:00:32,444
now furthermore let's imagine you're
understanding were here, okay?

12
00:00:32,444 --> 00:00:35,600
This is really where you are on
this understanding scale.

13
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,370
>> Where Curly is.

14
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:37,413
>> That's where Curly is.

15
00:00:37,413 --> 00:00:40,070
>> Okay,
in this linear scale of knowledge

16
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:41,400
>> Yeah so this linear scale of

17
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:45,380
knowledge about dinosaurs that
apparently requires some background in

18
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:47,730
calculus, you're basically
here on this linear scale.

19
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:50,450
Well what would that mean for
you to be right here.

20
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:54,440
Well it probably means that for
questions way over here,

21
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:57,910
those really are easy for you and
you'll always get them right.

22
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:02,430
And for questions way out here,
they're too hard for you and

23
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:04,519
you're probably going to get them,
almost certainly get them wrong.

24
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:07,730
But one of the interesting things about
being right at some particular level of

25
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:10,620
understanding is that
you will occasionally

26
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:14,110
get some of these things just on this
side of your understanding right.

27
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:16,930
And you will occasionally get
things just on this side of

28
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:18,580
your understanding wrong.

29
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:21,170
Really kind of understanding is
like a probability function.

30
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:23,228
And I'm going to pretend it's Gaussian,

31
00:01:23,228 --> 00:01:25,590
because that's what we
do in machine learning.

32
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:28,230
And just kind of say the probability

33
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:32,080
of you getting a question right depends
upon where your understanding is.

34
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:36,145
And as you move far in one direction
you will always, always get them right.

35
00:01:36,145 --> 00:01:38,918
Far in another direction you will
always, always get them wrong, but

36
00:01:38,918 --> 00:01:41,704
right around your level of
understanding there's some noise there.

37
00:01:41,704 --> 00:01:44,539
And you'll sometimes get the ones that
are just beyond your understanding

38
00:01:44,539 --> 00:01:47,800
right, and sometimes get the things that
are just below your understanding wrong.

39
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,090
We actually talked about this in
the machine learning class you might

40
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:53,840
remember when we talked about self
play and learning how to play games.

41
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,110
Do you remember this?

42
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:56,870
>> Was it a racquetball example?

43
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:58,400
>> Right we used
a Racquetball example and

44
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:02,610
we talked about how if you play someone
who is much much better than you

45
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:05,490
are then basically you never learn
anything because you always lose.

46
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:06,770
>> That's like the hard questions.

47
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:08,195
>> Those are like the hard questions.

48
00:02:08,195 --> 00:02:11,235
And if you play someone
you're much much better then

49
00:02:11,235 --> 00:02:13,035
you also never learn anything
because you always win.

50
00:02:13,035 --> 00:02:14,255
>> That's like the easy questions.

51
00:02:14,255 --> 00:02:17,285
>> Right, and in fact the right thing
to do is to play someone who's just

52
00:02:17,285 --> 00:02:18,143
a little bit better or

53
00:02:18,143 --> 00:02:21,320
just a little bit worse than you
that is right around where you are.

54
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:24,290
And then you'll actually learn something
because the exploration makes sense.

55
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:27,530
And sometimes you get positive feedback,
sometimes you get negative feedback, and

56
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:29,990
you learn how to modify your actions and
to learn.

57
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:31,100
>> Okay, that makes sense to me.

58
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:33,130
>> Right, and so
by analogy that's what's happening here.

59
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:37,080
If I can give you questions right around
where your level of understanding is,

60
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,730
then you might learn something.

61
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:41,880
>> Good.
>> So given that highfalutin boughten

62
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,850
taking it all the way
back to racquetball.

63
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:46,800
What do you think a good
set of incentives might be?

64
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,610
>> I don't know I mean it's like,
what I wanted to say was,

65
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:52,150
well you want to be getting
like half of them right.

66
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:54,230
And so we could pay off the teacher.

67
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:56,900
Well we I guess we pay the learner off
for getting things right because that's

68
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,990
really what the learner
should be striving for.

69
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:02,025
But we can pay off the teacher for
keeping things around a half.

70
00:03:02,025 --> 00:03:04,791
But that doesn't really make sense
because then the teacher could do like

71
00:03:04,791 --> 00:03:07,154
I'm just going to randomly choose
from a really easy problem or

72
00:03:07,154 --> 00:03:09,410
a really hard problem, and
on average that will be a half.

73
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:12,680
So it'll really not be asking any
questions that are in that happy zone.

74
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:16,360
>> That's good so actually what
you just said is pretty important.

75
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,060
>> And it seems like a really bad idea.

76
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,180
>> No,
no it's actually really important.

77
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,440
You said something really important.

78
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,750
Let me point what you said.

79
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:25,200
You said that if I tried to pick
a half or any distribution really.

80
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:25,832
>> Okay.

81
00:03:25,832 --> 00:03:29,060
>> Then he teacher can
always just choose questions

82
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:30,840
to kind of get that distribution.

83
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,750
And sometimes they'll be incentivized
to, I'll just pick easy ones or

84
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:36,580
hard ones where I know I'm going to
get the distribution that I want.

85
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:38,030
And that sort of misses the point.

86
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:41,880
But what if I don't allow you to
pick the question what if instead

87
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,650
I require you to tell
me where this line is?
