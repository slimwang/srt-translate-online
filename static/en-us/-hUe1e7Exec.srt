1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,300
Hopefully you got something like this.

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:05,142
The taskForPOSTMethod should
start very similarly to how

3
00:00:05,142 --> 00:00:07,280
the taskForGETMethod started.

4
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:10,020
We should add the ApiKey
to the parameters.

5
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:11,180
And then for the request,

6
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:16,910
it should be an NSMutableURLRequest
instead of just the NSURLRequest.

7
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:21,380
And we want to configure the method to
be of type POST, whoops, there we go.

8
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:24,968
And then we want to add the header
values or the Accept and

9
00:00:24,968 --> 00:00:26,610
Content-Type header.

10
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,980
And finally we want to
add the HTTP body.

11
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:34,610
From here the rest of the method
is almost a carbon copy.

12
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:38,299
The main difference being that we
use completionHandlerforPOST instead

13
00:00:38,299 --> 00:00:40,160
of completionHandlerforGET.

14
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,120
Now the fact that the rest of this
code is almost a carbon copy of

15
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,730
taskForGetMethod means that it could
probably have been placed in its own

16
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:47,420
method too.

17
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:50,380
But we're going to pause just short
of doing that like we said earlier.

18
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:54,340
We're just going to focus on
taskForGETMethod and taskForPOSTMethod.

19
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:55,855
Now, this is only half the battle.

20
00:00:55,855 --> 00:00:58,030
We have to use these methods.

21
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:01,280
So, to make this work, we're going to
pair task forget method, and task for

22
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,730
post method, with what we're
going to call convenience functions.

23
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:07,600
And, these convenience functions
will be the perfect solution for

24
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,810
removing all the web service
logic away from our controllers,

25
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:13,770
and we'll implement
those in just a moment.

26
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:14,790
But first,

27
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:17,680
let's outline our new authentication
flow that we're going to be using.
