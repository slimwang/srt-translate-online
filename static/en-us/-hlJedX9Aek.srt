1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,350
The first statement,
to decrypt using AES,

2
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:07,040
just run the same algorithm in
the same order of operations.

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,300
This is false.

4
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,770
Because in AES, to decrypt,

5
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:14,360
we run the algorithm in
the reverse order of operations.

6
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:18,890
Second, each operation or
stage in AES is reversible.

7
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:20,160
This is true.

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,520
As we have discussed, all
the operations in AES are reversible.

9
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:31,581
Third, AES can support key
length of 128, 192, and 256.

10
00:00:31,581 --> 00:00:32,741
This is true.

11
00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:36,940
Fourth, AES is much more
efficient than Triple DES.

12
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:38,400
This is also true.

13
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:42,330
In fact, these are the main
motivations and requirements for

14
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:44,300
developing AES in the first place.
