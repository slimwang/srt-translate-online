1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:04,380
For the sequential DAG, the critical
path goes through all of the additions.

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:08,800
And since there are n such additions,
the answer is all O(n).

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:09,470
Now what about the tree?

4
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:16,320
Now in the tree, all paths include
at least one vertex from each level.

5
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,885
Since there are log n levels,
the answer is log n.
