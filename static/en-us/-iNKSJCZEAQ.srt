1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,241
Negative 3 is correct, nice equation solving if you got that one correct. The

2
00:00:05,241 --> 00:00:10,847
lowest common denominator for our fractions is 9x. We know x is already a factor

3
00:00:10,847 --> 00:00:16,184
of 3x, so really we just need to find the LCD for 9 and 3x. When we use our

4
00:00:16,184 --> 00:00:20,770
factor tree method we can see that we get a final product of 9x. And our first

5
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:26,138
fraction, the x terms cancel to 1, leaving us with 9 times 1 or 9. For our 2nd

6
00:00:26,138 --> 00:00:31,449
fraction the factors of 9 canceled the 1 leaving us with -1 times x, or -x. And

7
00:00:31,449 --> 00:00:38,656
finally for our last fraction 9 x divided by 3 x equals 3. So we're left with 4

8
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:43,710
times 3 which equals 12. Solving this linear equation will get a access equal to

9
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:49,292
-3. Remember, we just reverse the signs here, since negative x equals 3, so

10
00:00:49,292 --> 00:00:54,773
positive x would equal negative 3. For this original equation, x cannot equal 0.

11
00:00:54,773 --> 00:00:59,416
It's an excluded value. And since our answer was x equals negative 3, we're

12
00:00:59,416 --> 00:01:02,093
okay. We can keep this as our solution set.
