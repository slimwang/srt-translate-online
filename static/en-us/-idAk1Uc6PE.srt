1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,130
The answer is 12 cars.

2
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:05,970
To find this answer we can multiply the possibilities together.

3
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:10,840
First, we know a car body is required, and it has no sub-features.

4
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:13,090
Then for the transmission we have two options.

5
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:15,380
Either the transmission is automatic or it is manual.

6
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:19,530
For an engine, there are three options.

7
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:25,380
Electric, gasoline, or a combination of electric and gasoline called hybrid.

8
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:26,000
Finally, for

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,580
the pulls trailer feature, we can either have the feature or exclude it.

10
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:35,970
Thus, we can multiply these numbers together: 1 times 2 times 3 times 2,

11
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:40,250
which equals 12, for the 12 possible car configurations.
