1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,960
Apps use a navigation
structure to present views

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:06,410
when each page is a part of
a hierarchy or a flat sequence.

3
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:08,150
Users make one choice per page, and

4
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:10,650
can retrace their steps to
make different choices.

5
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:13,660
Such a hierarchy often takes
the form of a list of items,

6
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:15,070
each with a detail page.

7
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:19,059
Apps use modal presentation for things
like temporary views and alert views.

8
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:23,020
As well as self contained activities
that only offer the choice

9
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:25,350
to be completed or dismissed.

10
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:27,930
In this lesson,
we'll focus on modal presentation.

11
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:29,520
Navigation will come in lesson four.
