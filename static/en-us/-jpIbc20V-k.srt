00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:03,969
Let's talk about how to
handle text in a deep model.

2
00:00:03,969 --> 00:00:06,190
Imagine that you want
to classify a document.

3
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:09,920
Is it talking about politics,
or business, or science maybe?

4
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:13,580
You're going to have to look
at the words in that document

5
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:14,240
to figure that out.

6
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:17,100
Words are really difficult.

7
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:20,550
There are lots of them and
most of them you never, ever see.

8
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:26,610
In fact the ones that you rarely see,
tend to be the most important ones.

9
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:31,430
If you know that your document contains
duh, you don't know much at all.

10
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:34,960
But if you know that it
contains retinopathy,

11
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,225
you know that it's probably
a medical document.

12
00:00:37,225 --> 00:00:45,121
Retinopathy appears with
a frequency of 0.0001% in English.

13
00:00:45,121 --> 00:00:49,360
It's even possible that you've never
seen that word yourself before.

14
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,290
For deep learning,
rare events like that are a problem.

15
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:55,760
We like to have lots of training
examples to learn from.
