Nice job getting through this lesson.

2
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:05,790
By now, you should have a guide which
shows you the skills that are necessary

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:08,655
for you to meet your goals and
where you could use some help.

4
00:00:08,655 --> 00:00:11,280
In this next lesson, you'll use
this guide as you learn more about

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,420
the different options you have to
fill any skill gaps you found.

6
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:18,250
We'll explore hiring, outsourcing,
freelancers, mentors and

7
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:22,000
business partners as common options
you have to help with your business.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,770
So, bring your guide and
we'll see you there.
