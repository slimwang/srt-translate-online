00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,840
This piece of code starts out by declaring a variable called audioPlayer.

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:08,290
And it seems to be using colons and bangs in the declaration.

3
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:08,910
That's interesting.

4
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:15,050
Then I notice this if keyword, so that's probably an if statement coming, and

5
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:19,030
sure enough, we see that there is an else statement a few lines down.

6
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:22,710
There are also frequent examples of the dot notation, and

7
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:24,990
I wonder if that is a function call.

8
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:28,580
There is also a reference to this variable called filePath.

9
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:31,610
And it seems to me that the name of that file is love_story, and

10
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:33,040
the type of that file is an MP3.

11
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:39,010
Oh, and there's the super clue, which is audioPlayer.play.

12
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:43,700
And it seems to me that this line of code is playing this MP3 file.

13
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:47,470
So my best guess at this point is that this code seems to

14
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:51,400
run when the user taps on a song in their iPhone playlist.

15
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:54,420
Now, we will learn how to write this code in our app soon.

16
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:55,500
Let's begin making that app.
