00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:04,500
I mentioned in the last video that
gross versus net are two of the most

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:07,540
easily confused terms for
those new to finance.

3
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:10,700
So, just to drill this difference
into your brain a bit more,

4
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:12,230
I've got another quick quiz for you.

5
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:17,890
Now, another way to think of profits is
in terms of margins or the percentage of

6
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:23,090
funds that your business retains, or
loses, depending on your situation.

7
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:26,079
So just like before,
take a look at these definitions and

8
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:29,897
using the letters, match with
the correct terms in the provided boxes.
