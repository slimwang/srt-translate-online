00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:04,140
Let's take these, these three constraints one at a time, and

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:10,350
decide where it would be appropriate to assign responsibility for managing that.

3
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:15,200
Before when we had associations we associated the, we, we had the constraints

4
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,330
connected with the associations, but we don't have associations anymore.

5
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:20,280
We have, just have components.

6
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:22,890
So lets take them one at a time.

7
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:28,750
The resize window indirect effect, that particular association,

8
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:32,350
which component do you think would might be the appropriate one

9
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:37,090
to be responsible for managing those indirect effects?
