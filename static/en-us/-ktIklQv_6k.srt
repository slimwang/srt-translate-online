1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:05,040
Now this process of referrals, as you can see, can be rather slow. A

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,880
particular DNS query might thus require round

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,120
trips to multiple servers that are authoritative for

4
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:14,700
different parts of the hierarchy. The blue

5
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:18,221
server is authoritative for the root. The purple

6
00:00:18,221 --> 00:00:21,336
server is authoritative for .edu and the

7
00:00:21,336 --> 00:00:25,620
red server is authoritative for gatech.edu. Now supposing

8
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:27,920
we wanted to save the extra time in trouble of

9
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,270
these round trip times. This local resolver would typically have

10
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:34,800
a cache that stores the NS records for each level

11
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,850
of the hierarchy as well as the A records and each

12
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:41,660
of these answers would be stored or cached for a

13
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:44,610
particular amount a time. Each of one these replies has

14
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:47,180
what's called a time to live or a TTL that

15
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:51,090
indicates how long each of these answers can be saved before

16
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:53,840
they need to be looked up again. Caching

17
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,020
allows for quick responses from the local DNS

18
00:00:57,020 --> 00:01:01,370
resolver, especially for repeated mappings. For example, since

19
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:03,840
everyone is probably looking up domain names such

20
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,100
as google.com It's much faster to keep the

21
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:10,150
answer in cache. So, given multiple clients trying

22
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:12,930
to resolve the same domain name, the answers

23
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:16,010
can all be resolved in a local cache.

24
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:18,430
Some queries can reuse parts of this look

25
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:21,610
up, for example, it's unlikely that the authoritative name

26
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:24,280
server for the root is going to change

27
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:27,360
very often. So that answer might be kept, or

28
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,050
cached, for a much longer period of time.

29
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:33,310
A typical time might be hours or days, or

30
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:36,630
even weeks. The mapping for a local name, such

31
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:41,080
as www.gatech.edu, on the other hand, might change more

32
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:44,470
frequently and thus these local TTL's might need to be

33
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:48,620
smaller. Now the most common type of DNS record, is what's

34
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:52,060
called an A record, which maps an IP address to a

35
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:55,190
domain name. But there are other important record types as well.
