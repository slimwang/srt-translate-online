1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,340
All right, let's do some work, not much work, but a little bit of work.

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:07,900
So last time we talked about, adding a noise function to an image function, so

3
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:12,200
here we have our noise, defined as just this random things scaled by the sigma,

4
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:15,340
our output was just the image plus the noise.

5
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:18,320
And we said, remember, you have to worry about the size of the sigma in

6
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,520
respect to the range of the image, so if your image is 0 to 255,

7
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,910
a sigma five might be plausible, if your image goes 0 to 1, size of

8
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:31,000
sigma five is not plausible, so you have worry about how those come together.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,750
Now, suppose there was noise in your image, and

10
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:38,390
you wanted to remove the noise, how might you think about doing that?

11
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:42,950
Now I'm sure, bunch of you have suggestions that are kind of similar.

12
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:45,490
Here, here's the typical one, right?

13
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:48,850
Let me replace the value of each pixel,

14
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:52,632
with sort of an average of the pixels around it.

15
00:00:52,632 --> 00:00:53,950
Okay?

16
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:55,960
So.

17
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:59,030
Let's think about what that would look like in 1D, and then we'll go to 2D,

18
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,930
and we'll talk about why is this the right thing to do or

19
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:04,680
when is this not the right thing to do, all right.

20
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:08,380
So, here's our first attempt, so, we're going to replace each pixel with

21
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:10,770
an average of the values of the pixels neighborhood, and

22
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:15,610
this is referred to as a moving average, so here I have some location here, and

23
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:19,470
I just take the average value and I put it down there, okay?

24
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:23,790
And then I would move my little, what's called window as I take my average, and

25
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:26,840
I get a new value, and I get another one, and then eventually,

26
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:30,980
I would get this new somewhat smoothed version of the original, and

27
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:35,030
it's smoothed meaning that we sort of averaged of the things locally.
