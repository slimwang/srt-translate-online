00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,119
What do you think, David?

2
00:00:01,119 --> 00:00:02,763
>> So in resolution theorem proving,

3
00:00:02,763 --> 00:00:05,624
we always assume the opposite
of what we're trying to prove.

4
00:00:05,624 --> 00:00:07,783
We're doing proof by refutation.

5
00:00:07,783 --> 00:00:09,436
So we're trying to prove
that it is a bird, so

6
00:00:09,436 --> 00:00:11,960
we're going to assume
that it's not a bird.

7
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:12,470
>> That's right.
