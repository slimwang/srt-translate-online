1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Here you get 0.72,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
which is the product of

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
not having cancer in the first place

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
0.9

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
and the probability of getting a

6
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
negative test result

7
00:00:09,000 --> 99:59:59,999
under the condition of not having cancer.
