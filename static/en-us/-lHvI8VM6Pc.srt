1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:01,880
So let me ask the simple question here.

2
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:03,250
Why stereo vision?

3
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:05,710
Here the question that
really comes to mind is,

4
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:09,790
why do we want to take a pair of
two images taken at the same time?

5
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:13,420
Pretty much model our human vision
system of two eyes looking at a scene

6
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:14,550
at the same time,

7
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:19,730
how can that be used to generate
a 3D geometric model of that scene?

8
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:23,300
Again, let's start off with our simple
camera model that we looked at.

9
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:26,640
Here I'm basically going to start
off again with a simple object.

10
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,950
And of course in the real world, here
I'm basically going to give it point P,

11
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:33,830
capital P, with coordinates X,Y and
Z in the real world.

12
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:38,470
Let's first take first viewpoint, which
is actually shown by this point here.

13
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:42,100
And this is, of course, the world
coordinates from this viewpoint here.

14
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:44,180
And of course this is my image.

15
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:46,810
So here, basically,
at focal length f is an image.

16
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:48,810
Of course,
it has its own coordinate axes.

17
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:51,430
Just for simplicity,
I'm putting the coordinate axes

18
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:55,050
at the center of the image
plane itself rather the corner.

19
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:57,130
But you know that's
a simple transformation.

20
00:00:57,130 --> 00:01:00,330
Of course, basically, what we're trying
to do is capture this whole object,

21
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:05,770
which basically means this ray of
light and really kind of coming

22
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:11,360
down to small x, small y to point out
this point in the image plane itself.

23
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,640
So that's my image.

24
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,040
And of course, this image parameterized
with both the location and

25
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:20,050
the image itself by x and y and,
of course, the focal length, f.

26
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:22,830
Now let's actually take the same
instance that we had looked at before

27
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:27,900
that was the ambiguity of all
points that lie on this line

28
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:31,960
actually being a problem because I think
all of those points on this line will

29
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:34,470
appear to be here on this image.

30
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:37,560
So, for example this point
will appear exactly here.

31
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:39,536
So will this.

32
00:01:39,536 --> 00:01:43,750
So will this, and so will this one.

33
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:45,720
So that's the problem we have.

34
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,670
How can we mitigate this
by another viewpoint?

35
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:52,480
Well, let's take this as a left view and
this is the right view.

36
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,910
I have another image coming in and,

37
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:59,260
of course, all of these points
are coming to the point here this is

38
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:03,930
the optical point of this image here,
and basically converging here.

39
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:08,400
But now I actually have one, two,
three, four, five rays of light.

40
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:12,640
This should start telling you that now
we can actually resolve the ambiguity.

41
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:17,089
Because all these five points actually
now come in in the image plane here.

42
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:22,890
But this is the only point
that appears here and there.

43
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:26,820
So, by just looking at these points,
and doing things like triangulation,

44
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:30,820
we now know exactly this is the same
point that's visible from both.

45
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:35,190
So no longer are we having
the ambiguity that we had before.

46
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:38,720
So hopefully this convinces you
that having multiple viewpoints

47
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,610
allows us to now get rid
of the ambiguity and

48
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:44,370
extract more information about
exactly which point I'm looking at.
