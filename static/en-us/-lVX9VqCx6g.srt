1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,511
So here's the worst case. We have a green triangle clipped by a blue rectangle.

2
00:00:05,511 --> 00:00:08,179
How many sides is the resulting polygon?

3
00:00:08,179 --> 00:00:20,276
So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

4
00:00:20,276 --> 00:00:23,234
And so how many triangles will this result in?

5
00:00:24,495 --> 00:00:38,041
1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. So our answer here is 5.
