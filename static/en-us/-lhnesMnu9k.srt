00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:05,365
So, we know you're at mile marker 210. But before you put your map away, your

2
00:00:05,365 --> 00:00:11,408
friend sees another town located seven miles south of mile marker 234. So

3
00:00:11,408 --> 00:00:15,544
what's the distance to this second town? Keep in mind that you want to find the

4
00:00:15,544 --> 00:00:19,651
shortest distance to the town. When you think you have that answer, enter it

5
00:00:19,651 --> 00:00:26,586
here. Then, let me know if this town is closer than this town. If this town is

6
00:00:26,586 --> 00:00:29,940
closer, chose yes, otherwise choose no.
