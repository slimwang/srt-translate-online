1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,480
So we showed in the last problem that it really depends on what time you want to minimize

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,130
whether you want to use n vans or 1 van, and so let's take a look at those two problems.

3
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:15,720
First, we could minimize the time until all mails are delivered

4
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:19,910
or we could minimize the sum of the individual times taken by the vans.

5
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:27,800
Now, what I'd like to know is whether minimizing either of these times is polynomial time solvable

6
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:36,520
or NP complete, and let's go ahead and say this is the case for n vans and an n vertex graph.

7
00:00:36,520 --> 99:59:59,999
And go ahead and check whichever is appropriate.
