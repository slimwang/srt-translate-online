1
00:00:00,097 --> 00:00:04,876
Okay, let's see how we do this. The operator that we're going to do during the reduce is max.

2
00:00:04,876 --> 00:00:09,781
So 2 max 1. Which one's bigger? Two. Four max 3. Which one's bigger? Four.

3
00:00:09,781 --> 00:00:13,604
Two max 4. Which one's bigger? Four. We're done with the reduce.

4
00:00:13,604 --> 00:00:16,757
So now we begin the downsweep. Remember, we start with the identity element here.

5
00:00:16,757 --> 00:00:19,397
And then we're going to apply the downsweep operator.

6
00:00:19,397 --> 00:00:22,558
In this case, we're doing a downsweep with a max.

7
00:00:22,558 --> 00:00:25,688
So, we will copy to the left, just as in the sum example.

8
00:00:25,688 --> 00:00:31,384
And we will apply max to each, each of the pairs of elements to create the output to its right.

9
00:00:31,384 --> 00:00:36,319
So right now we're running our downsweep operator on this 2 and this 0, okay?

10
00:00:36,319 --> 00:00:41,744
We copy the 0 over. And now we run max on 2 and 0 and get 2, okay?

11
00:00:41,744 --> 00:00:44,422
Now, we'll drag down these intermediate values here.

12
00:00:44,422 --> 00:00:49,244
So, we'll copy this to the left, and then 2 max 0, gives us 2.

13
00:00:49,244 --> 00:00:54,483
We'll copy to the left, and then 2 max 4 gives us 4, and then we'll complete.

14
00:00:54,483 --> 00:00:58,888
Note that the output on any particular element is equal to

15
00:00:58,888 --> 00:01:03,364
the maximum value we've seen up to, but not including this element.

16
00:01:03,364 --> 00:01:10,224
The max value we see here is 4, which is the max value of each element we've seen up to this point.
