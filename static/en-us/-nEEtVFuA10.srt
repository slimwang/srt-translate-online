1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:05,110
So we see that the more closely
a person is related to someone

2
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:06,990
who suffers from schizophrenia.

3
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:10,530
The more likely that person is also
to suffer from the disorder.

4
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:15,130
So we know from this that there is
a genetic component to schizophrenia,

5
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:17,250
but by itself that's not enough.

6
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:21,390
There also has to be some kind of
stressful environmental experience

7
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:23,190
that the person suffers from.

8
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:27,650
Those two things together are really
what's required and we refer to this

9
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:30,530
as the diathesis stress model.

10
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:33,750
So, diathesis means
the biological predisposition

11
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:36,850
and the stress means some kind
of environmental event.

12
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:39,260
It's those two things together
that are really required.

13
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:43,440
And this, by the way, applies to all kinds
of psychological disorders.

14
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:48,470
Anxiety, personality disorders,
obsessive compulsive disorders.

15
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:51,990
So, let's take a closer look at some
of the seenvironmental risk factors

16
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:54,480
for schizophrenia.

17
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,930
So one of the risk factors involved
in the development of schizophrenia

18
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:00,790
is maternal infection.

19
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:05,750
And so what we mean by this is that
if a pregnant woman is exposed to diseases

20
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:12,000
or infections, that the baby, later on
in life, actually has an increased risk

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,520
for the development of schizophrenia.

22
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:18,750
So some of these diseases and infections
include things like herpes,

23
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:23,280
influenza, rubella and toxoplasmosis.

24
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,520
And toxoplasmosis by the way is found
in feline feces which is one reason

25
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,280
why doctors always recommend

26
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,520
that pregnant women
stay away from cat litter.

27
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:36,530
Other environmental risk factors
include chronic stress

28
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:39,750
and taking certain drugs, now again,

29
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:44,500
by themselves, these things do not cause
or even really increase schizophrenia.

30
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:48,040
It's that coupled with
a genetic predisposition

31
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,748
that's really required.

32
00:01:49,748 --> 00:01:53,679
And again this is what we mean
by the diathesis stress model.
