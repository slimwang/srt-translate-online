00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,440
So far we've only talked about how to
use Gradle to build a project component

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:05,555
of a single deliverable output.

3
00:00:05,555 --> 00:00:07,768
But builds rarely stay so simple.

4
00:00:07,768 --> 00:00:10,660
A Gradle project can have
any number of sub projects,

5
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:13,260
each of which also has
their own sub projects.

6
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:16,190
Every multi project build
also has a root project.

7
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:19,440
Even if that root project is
the container for its subprojects.

8
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:22,390
You'll generally create a subproject
in order to move some reusable

9
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:24,020
functionality into a library.

10
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:27,180
That way the library can be used
by other projects, and also so

11
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:29,320
Gradle can determine
that the library and

12
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,378
the app that depends on it
should be built together.

13
00:00:31,378 --> 00:00:34,440
A Gradle multi-project build is
configured in a settings decorative file

14
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,100
in the root of your project.

15
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:37,340
If you're creating an Android app,

16
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:40,650
using Android Studio this file's
automatically generated for you.

17
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:43,710
In fact, every Android project
created by Android Studio

18
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,910
is a Gradle multi project by default.

19
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:49,840
Note, Android Studio refers to
sub projects as modules, but

20
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,010
we'll use the two terms interchangeably.

21
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:53,000
Lets check out an example.
