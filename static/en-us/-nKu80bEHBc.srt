00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Welcome back to Statistics 101.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Today, we do a case study.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
The case study is based on data that you, the students, submitted

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
where on Facebook you all discussed my weight,

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
and you've all see me in this class

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
and a whopping 163 of you followed this very hidden Facebook discussion

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
and submitted your guesses.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Thanks to all of you, I now have a data set.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
In my first study, I will treat your guesses as my data or sample

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
and somewhat abusing the nature of my own weight.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I treat my own weight as the hypothesis H0.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Technically speaking, this is a bit of an abuse.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
We're not really testing whether my own weight is incorrect,

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
but you can still use the same math and have a lot of fun.

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Towards the end of this exercise, you will actually find out my weight.

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Please don't tell anybody.

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Here is the actual data that was submitted by all of you.

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
One of the really interesting findings here--some of you had some fun.

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:02,000
In the data, you find a guess 1 * 10²², which is about the weight of the planet Pluto in kilograms.

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Then there are three counter guesses with -1,

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
which makes me suspect that these numbers were submitted by the same person.

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Some of you think I weigh 0 whereas others think I weigh 1000 kg--as much as a car.

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Thank you so much. Very kind of you.

24
00:01:18,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Let's take this data, and I'll ask you the first quiz.
