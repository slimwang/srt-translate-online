1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:05,240
In the previous lesson, we learned some tricks we can employ as operating

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:09,550
system designers for optimizing the RPC communication

3
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:13,840
software which powers client-server communication in the

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,870
local area network from the point of

5
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:20,290
view of reducing communication latency. Of course,

6
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:23,290
user interactions go beyond the local area

7
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:26,570
network to the wide area Internet. The

8
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:29,620
primary issue, once a packet leaves your

9
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:32,860
local node, is to route the packet reliably

10
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:36,700
and quickly to the destination. Routing is part

11
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:40,080
of the functionality of the network layer of

12
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,440
the protocol stack of an operating system.

13
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,425
What happens to a packet once it leaves

14
00:00:44,425 --> 00:00:48,340
your node? Well, the intermediate hardware routers between

15
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:52,090
your node and the destination have routing tables.

16
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:54,750
That help them to move the packet towards the

17
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:58,410
desired destination node by doing a table look-up. The

18
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:02,090
routing tables evolve over time, since the Internet itself

19
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:05,420
is evolving continually. That's the big picture. And there are

20
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:09,180
lots of fascinating details which you can learn in

21
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:12,120
a course that is dedicated to computer networking. For

22
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,660
the next part of the lesson on distributed systems,

23
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:18,040
we want to ask the question, what can be done

24
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,870
in the intermediate routers, to accommodate the quality

25
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:24,420
of service needs of individual packet flows through

26
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:27,380
the network? Or in other words, can we

27
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:31,840
make the routers en route to the destinations smart?

28
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,080
The specific thought experiment we are going to

29
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:38,320
discuss is called active networks. And then, we

30
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,090
will connect the dots from active networks to

31
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:43,150
the current state of the art, which is referred

32
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:47,040
to as software defined networking. Thus far

33
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,350
in the course, we've been focusing on

34
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:52,690
specializing operating system services for a single

35
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:56,670
processor, or a multi-core or a parallel system,

36
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:02,470
or a local area network. In this lesson, we will take this idea of specializing

37
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:08,800
to the the wide area network. Specifically, we will study the idea of providing

38
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,440
quality of service for network communication in

39
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,820
an operating system by making the network active.
