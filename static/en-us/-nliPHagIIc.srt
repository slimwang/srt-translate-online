1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:02,484
Now that you understand AVAudioRecorder,

2
00:00:02,484 --> 00:00:05,300
it's time to get that
code into PitchPerfect.

3
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:09,373
In Xcode, open up the
RecordSoundsViewController.swift file.

4
00:00:09,373 --> 00:00:13,349
Let's start by adding in the import
statement for AVFoundation right here,

5
00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:16,149
underneath where it says import UIKit.

6
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:18,917
Inside the RecordSoundsViewController
class,

7
00:00:18,917 --> 00:00:21,626
let's add our variable
to BD AVAudioRecorder.

8
00:00:21,626 --> 00:00:26,240
I'm going to add it hear underneath
IBOutlet and call it AudioRecorder.

9
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,663
Scroll down to the recordAudio function.

10
00:00:28,663 --> 00:00:31,835
In here we're going to add the lines for
creating the audio session, and

11
00:00:31,835 --> 00:00:35,030
telling AVAudioRecorder
to start recording audio.

12
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:39,294
You can find all the code I've typed
here directly under this video.

13
00:00:39,294 --> 00:00:42,488
At this point our code is
able to record the audio and

14
00:00:42,488 --> 00:00:45,104
save it to the recorded voice .wav file.

15
00:00:45,104 --> 00:00:47,620
What about when we
want to stop recording?

16
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:50,620
That is handled when the stop
recording button is pressed.

17
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:54,190
And you wired up that button to fire
up the function stopRecording in

18
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:55,470
the previous lesson.

19
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:55,970
Let's go there.

20
00:00:57,008 --> 00:01:01,310
In the stopRecording function, let's add
these three lines to stop the recording.

21
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:04,540
We'll tell the audio recorder to stop,
and then we'll close out the session.

22
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:06,615
That's all it takes.

23
00:01:06,615 --> 00:01:08,590
PitchPerfect is now able
to record your voice.

24
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:11,440
If you run it and press record,
you'll see the file name and

25
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:12,810
path in the debug console.
