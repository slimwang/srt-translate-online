1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:02,580
Let us look at abduction more closely.

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:04,110
To understand the similarities and

3
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:08,300
differences between deduction,
abduction and induction,

4
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:11,600
let us look at the relationship
between a rule, cause and effect.

5
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:16,550
Let's consider a simple rule like,
if it cloudy, it rains.

6
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:18,520
So it is cloudy, is the cause.

7
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:20,620
It rains, is the effect.

8
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:23,450
If it's cloudy and
it rains, it's a rule.

9
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:27,080
>> Another example of a rule,
would be the rule that Bob hates Joe.

10
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:29,960
So Bob hates Joe, so
whenever Joe walks in, Bob leaves.

11
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:32,070
The cause is Joe walking in.

12
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:33,360
The effect is Bob leaving.

13
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,560
And the rule is Bob hates Joe.

14
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:39,600
You already come across yet another
instance of this particular arrangement,

15
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,050
when we were talking about flu and
fever.

16
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:45,120
So the rule might be; if flu then fever.

17
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,350
Flue is the cause.

18
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:47,785
Fever is the effect.

19
00:00:47,785 --> 00:00:51,535
Non-deduction, in one
fundamental kind of inference.

20
00:00:51,535 --> 00:00:55,785
We know the rule and the cause,
and we need to deduce the effect.

21
00:00:55,785 --> 00:00:58,815
So, given the rule,
if it is cloudy, then it rains, and

22
00:00:58,815 --> 00:01:03,455
given the cause, it is cloudy,
we can deduce that it rains.

23
00:01:03,455 --> 00:01:05,375
>> Similarly,
in our rule that Bob hates Joe,

24
00:01:05,375 --> 00:01:09,465
we can say that if Joe just walked in,
we can deduce that Bob will leave.

25
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:13,360
Part of the rule is, if flu, then fever.

26
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,850
And we know that a shortcut's flu, then
we can deduce that, a shortcut's fever.

27
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:20,010
This is simply an instance
of more despondence, and

28
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:23,570
we discussed this in detail when
we were talking about logic.

29
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:25,010
Now let us look at induction.

30
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:28,660
Given a relationship between a cause and
an effect, we can try to induce a rule.

31
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:34,360
For example, if we observe
repeatedly that when it is cloudy,

32
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,740
it rains, and we may induce a rule.

33
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:38,910
If it is cloudy, then it rains.

34
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:40,060
>> Same thing with Bob and Joe.

35
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:43,780
If we observe repeatedly that every
time Joe arrives, Bob leaves.

36
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:45,840
we can induce a rule
that Bob must hate Joe.

37
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,840
If every time a patient
goes to a doctor with flu,

38
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:55,320
and the patient has fever, then we
can induce a rule if flu then fever.

39
00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:00,060
In can of abduction, given a rule and
an effect, we can abduce a cause.

40
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:06,410
As an example, given the rule if
it is cloudy then it rains, and

41
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:10,220
the effect that it is raining,
we can ask of ourselves is it cloudy.

42
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:15,220
And once again with Bob and Joe,
given our rule that Bob hates Joe, and

43
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:17,800
given that we just arrived at the party,
and we see that Joe is here but

44
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:22,260
not Bob, we might be able to adduce
that Bob left when Joe arrived.

45
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:25,550
>> Or given the rule,
if flu then fever and

46
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:29,480
that fact Ashok that has fever, we might
be able to adduce that Ashok has flu.

47
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:33,430
First of all notice that
we are back to diagnosis.

48
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:36,450
Diagnosis is an instance of abduction.

49
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:38,520
But notice several of the properties.

50
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,940
First, deduction is truth preserving.

51
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:44,790
If the rule is true,
and the cause is true,

52
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:48,820
we can always guarantee that
the effect is true as well.

53
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:51,690
Induction and
abduction are not truth-preserving.

54
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:54,110
If we know something of the relations
between cause and effect for

55
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:57,940
some sample, that does not mean that
the same relationship holds for

56
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:58,980
the entire population.

57
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:03,370
Induction does not always
guarantee correctness.

58
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:04,820
Same for abduction.

59
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:09,050
We may know the rule and the effect, and
we may suppose that the cause is true.

60
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:11,210
But that need not necessarily be true.

61
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:14,092
It may be the case the flu then fever.

62
00:03:14,092 --> 00:03:15,590
And Ashark may have fever, but

63
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:18,550
that does not necessarily
mean that a shark has flu.

64
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:20,020
Fever can be caused by many many things.

65
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:25,750
The reason that fever does not
necessarily mean that Ashkk has flu is

66
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:29,160
because there can be multiple causes for
the same effect.

67
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,170
Multiple hypothesis for the same data.

68
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,610
This is exactly the problem that
we had encountered earlier,

69
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:38,200
when we were talking about
what makes diagnosis hard.

70
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:41,810
We said that deduction, induction, and

71
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:45,250
abduction, are three of
the fundamental forms of inference.

72
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:49,920
We can of course also combine these
inferences, science is a good example,

73
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,560
you and I as scientists,
observe some data about the world.

74
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,600
Then we induced some explanation for it.

75
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:02,090
Having induced such an explanation for
it, we induce a rule.

76
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:08,935
Having induced a rule, now we can use
production to predict new data elements.

77
00:04:08,935 --> 00:04:12,020
We going to observe some more.

78
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:14,370
Again, we adduce, induce, deduce.

79
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:17,420
And we continue the cycle.

80
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:22,100
Might the cycle also explain
a significant part of cognition?

81
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:25,500
Is this what you and
I do on a daily basis?

82
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,530
Adduce, induce, deduce?
