1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Now comes the moment of truth.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I have been waiting for this moment for quite a while to let you experience first hand

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:19,000
how to visualize data, and in this unit, you will do everything entirely by yourself.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I will give you data and you will plot those data and answer simple questions.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
But there is one thing to know--this unit is strictly optional.

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:40,000
The reason is there is programming involved in this unit and programming was not a prerequisite.

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
However, I will make sure what you have to do is extremely simple, is very well explained,

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
and a whole lot of fun, so if you choose to take this unit, you will visualize some interesting data

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:00,000
using a very simple programming tool. This over here is the Udacity programming interface.

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Don't freak out--all I'll do is give instructions over here, and I'll hit the run button.

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,000
As I scroll down, you can see a histogram of the data.

12
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
So this has been computed automatically now.

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:23,000
There are five data categories from 2.0 to 6.0, and you can see the frequency of data ions

14
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,000
in the vertical dimension--1, 4, 3, 1, and 1 again.

15
00:01:29,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Now this is a familiar histogram. Just look out how easy it was to generate this.
