In these next videos we'll
use the Hooked Model

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:08,430
that near just explained as a means to
optimize your monetization strategy.

3
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:10,610
First let's look at Triggers.

4
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:14,350
The point where users open your app.

5
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:18,140
It's a good place to start because
you can't make any money if people

6
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:19,350
aren't using your product.

7
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:25,110
Now in order to improve your trigger,
think of the following questions.

8
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:26,820
Who is your user?

9
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:30,600
And if you have a few types of users,
try to identify each of them.

10
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:34,240
Then, what might these users
be doing before they decide to

11
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:35,260
interact with your product?

12
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:39,000
Take a moment and
jot these ideas down now.
