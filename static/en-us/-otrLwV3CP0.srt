00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,230
Now, we can try this out in BlueJ. Let's make a new car object. Here it is.

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:12,970
Let's drive the car for ten miles. Hm, that wasn't very exciting. It would be

3
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:18,570
nice if we could see the car. Let's do that. I'll put a picture in here, and

4
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:23,450
you'll see later how that picture is initialized. And in the drive method, I'll

5
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:27,880
move the picture by the distance trip. Now, let's make another car. You see the

6
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:32,930
picture. Let's drive it, and there it goes. And that was a little bit

7
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:37,310
disappointing, because it only moved by ten pixels. Let's fix that. Let's move

8
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:42,330
it by 10 times the distance, and actually let's do this right. Let's declare a

9
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:46,249
variable, and then use that variable. Now, when the car drives, then it shows

10
00:00:46,249 --> 00:00:49,870
it nicely. Okay, now you have seen how to implement some instance methods. And

11
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:53,530
Sarah will walk you through that process with another example, with a person

12
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:53,790
class.
