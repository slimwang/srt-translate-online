1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:02,810
So here we're going to work
through this simple example again,

2
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:04,980
using our 4s and 9s.

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:09,542
We're going to assume that we have
some feature that we're measuring, x.

4
00:00:09,542 --> 00:00:12,790
It's typically a vector, but
I'm going to show it here as a scalar.

5
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:18,260
So x goes from small x,
so little x, to big x.

6
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:18,780
All right?

7
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:20,720
It's changing, changing values.

8
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,600
Clearly, all the way to the left,
I've got more 4s, and

9
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:30,050
all the way to the right, I've got
more 9s at the best decision boundary.

10
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:32,890
Okay?
And that's what's indicated in red here.

11
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:36,970
At that boundary,
if I call it a four, or

12
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:41,990
I call it a nine,
it should cost me on average the same.

13
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:45,920
Because in fact, if,
if calling it a four would

14
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,320
be less risk than calling a nine, I'm
going to move that boundary this way.

15
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,860
And if cost, calling it a nine is
better than calling in a four,

16
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:55,530
I'm going to move the boundary that way.

17
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:58,120
So at the best possible boundary,

18
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:03,930
the expected loss is the same
regardless of which label I announce.

19
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:09,750
All right, so if we picked label four,
okay, at that boundary.

20
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:12,120
Okay, then the expected loss is what?

21
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:18,090
Well, it's just, what is the probability
that it's really a nine,

22
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:22,280
and that I call it a four,
the cost of calling it a four?

23
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:25,429
And what's the probability
that it's really a four, and

24
00:01:25,429 --> 00:01:27,042
the loss of calling it a four?

25
00:01:27,042 --> 00:01:31,749
Well if you remember, remember we
assumed that the loss of x to x is zero,

26
00:01:31,749 --> 00:01:35,690
that is, there's no cost
of calling a four a four.

27
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:38,320
Well that means that this
just reduces down to,

28
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:43,590
well, if I'm at this location, x, what's
the probability it's really a nine?

29
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:46,390
And the cost of calling the nine a four?

30
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:50,380
That's the expected loss of
saying four at that location.

31
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:54,040
Likewise, what's the expected loss,
if I say nine at that location?

32
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,550
Well, symmetrically,

33
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:58,180
it's just what is the probability
that it actually was a four?

34
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:01,075
And what's the loss of
calling a four a nine?

35
00:02:01,075 --> 00:02:05,620
Okay, so those are the two different
value, the losses, that I want.

36
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:10,620
Now, remember we said before at the best
decision boundary either labeling a four

37
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:14,300
or labeling a nine, the cost,
the expected cost would be the same.

38
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:19,270
So the best decision boundary is where,
is the x such

39
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:23,830
that the probability that
the class is really a nine times

40
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:28,400
the cost of calling a nine a four,
will be equal to

41
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,570
the probability that it's really a four
times the loss of calling a four a nine.

42
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:37,260
When I set those two values equal,
that's the x that I want for

43
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:38,710
my decision boundary.

44
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:42,240
What that means is,
if I'm going to classify a new point,

45
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,140
I'm just going to look at these values,
right?

46
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:44,990
At some new point x.

47
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:48,840
What's the probability that it's really
a four times the probability that I call

48
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,110
a four a nine?

49
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:52,880
If that's greater than
the probability that it's a nine

50
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,710
times the loss of calling a nine a four,
if that's true,

51
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:58,810
I'm going to call this thing a four,
otherwise, I'm going to call it a nine.
