00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,152
All we need to do to get our equation for a new parabola in vertex form is to

2
00:00:04,152 --> 00:00:08,408
look at the old equation in vertex form, and then shift the vertex up by 10.

3
00:00:08,408 --> 00:00:12,816
That means, the right side of the equation, which contains the horizontal

4
00:00:12,816 --> 00:00:17,382
component of the vertex is not going to change at all. The only thing that will

5
00:00:17,382 --> 00:00:22,157
change is the constant added to y on the left-hand side. We need to subtract 10

6
00:00:22,157 --> 00:00:27,037
from here since we will be up by 10, and this gives us an equation of y minus 7

7
00:00:27,037 --> 00:00:32,225
equals negative 7 times x minus 1 squared. To get this in standard form, we just

8
00:00:32,225 --> 00:00:36,941
need to multiply everything out and simplify. That gives us an answer of y

9
00:00:36,941 --> 00:00:39,299
equals negative 7x squared plus 14x.
