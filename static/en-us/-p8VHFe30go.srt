1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,140
So think about that last segment.

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:08,570
What is a company worth if it
provides one dollar every year

3
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:11,550
guaranteed every year in the future?

4
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:14,800
What is that worth if you
could own that company?

5
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:17,790
So here are a couple
of potential answers.

6
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:19,840
One it's worth one dollar.

7
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:24,410
Another at towards $70,
because after that I'll be dead.

8
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:26,055
Not me.
I'm living beyond that.

9
00:00:26,055 --> 00:00:29,940
[LAUGH] Another is while I'm
getting a dollar a year forever, so

10
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:34,120
it must be worth an infinity
number of dollars.

11
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:39,130
And, finally, this company that
produces $1 a year forever

12
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:44,722
is somewhere between $10 and
$25 depending on interest rates.
