1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:06,230
In addition to having query ID and randomization of that ID, the resolver can

2
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:09,820
randomize the source port on which it

3
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:12,810
sends the query, thereby adding an additional 16

4
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:16,000
bits of entropy to the ID that's

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,640
associated with the query. Unfortunately, picking a random

6
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:22,610
source port can be resource intensive and

7
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:25,770
also a network address translator or a NAT,

8
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:32,170
could derandomize the port. Another defense is called the 0x20 or the zero x20

9
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:37,730
encoding, which is based on the intuition that DNS matching and resolution

10
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:42,240
is entirely case insensitive. So capitalization

11
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,920
of individual letters in the domain name

12
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:50,830
do not affect the answer that the resolver will return. This 0x20 bit,

13
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:52,630
or the bit that affects whether a

14
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:56,470
particular character is capitalized or in lower case

15
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:59,640
can also be used to introduce additional entropy.

16
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,420
When generating a response to a query such

17
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:09,960
as this one, the query is copied from the DNS query into the response exactly

18
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:15,970
as it was in the query. The mixed pattern of upper and lower case letters thus

19
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:18,440
constitutes a channel. If the resolver and the

20
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:22,250
authoritative server can agree on a shared key,

21
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:24,810
then the resolver and the authoritative are the

22
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:28,500
only ones who know the appropriate pattern of

23
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,640
upper and lower case letters for a particular

24
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:34,840
domain name. Because no attacker would know the

25
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:37,450
appropriate combination of upper and lower case letters

26
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:41,560
for a particular domain. It becomes even more difficult

27
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:45,030
for the attacker to inject a bogus reply,

28
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,740
because not only would the attacker have to guess

29
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:50,550
the ID, but the attacker would also have to

30
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:55,150
guess the capitalization sequence for any particular domain name.
