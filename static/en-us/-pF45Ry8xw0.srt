1
00:00:03,642 --> 00:00:08,141
Now let's see how the definition of
a problem maps onto the root founding

2
00:00:08,141 --> 00:00:08,740
domain.

3
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:12,660
First, the initial state we're given.

4
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:15,536
Let's say we start of in Arad.

5
00:00:15,536 --> 00:00:20,163
And the goal test,
let's say that the state of being in

6
00:00:20,163 --> 00:00:24,580
Bucharest is the only state
that counts as a goal.

7
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:26,000
And all other states are not goals.

8
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:32,180
Now the set of all the states here
is known as the states space.

9
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:35,436
And we navigate the states
space by applying actions.

10
00:00:35,436 --> 00:00:39,200
The actions are specific to each city.

11
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,240
So when we're in Arad,

12
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:46,200
there are three possible actions, to
follow this road, this one, or this one.

13
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:50,740
And as we follow them we build paths or
sequences of actions.

14
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:55,250
So just being in Arad is
the path of length zero.

15
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:58,580
And now we could start
exploring the space and

16
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:01,590
add in this path of length one.

17
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:06,600
This path of length one and
this path of length one.

18
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:12,020
We can add in another path,
here of length two and

19
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:13,720
another path here of length two.

20
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:16,730
Here's another path of length two.

21
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:25,400
Here's a path of length three,
another path of length two, and so on.

22
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:32,870
Now at every point, we want to separate
the state out into three parts.

23
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,280
First, the ends of the paths,

24
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,660
the farthest paths that have been
explored, we call the frontier.

25
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:46,790
And so
the frontier in this case consists

26
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:53,450
of these states and
are the furthest out we can explore.

27
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:59,710
And then,
to the left of that in this diagram,

28
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:02,670
we have the explored part of the state.

29
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:05,850
And then off to the right
we have the unexplored.

30
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:08,704
So let's write down
those three components.

31
00:02:08,704 --> 00:02:12,865
We have the frontier,

32
00:02:12,865 --> 00:02:21,194
we have the unexplored region,
and we have.

33
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:25,037
Explored region.

34
00:02:25,037 --> 00:02:27,520
One more thing.

35
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:33,350
In this diagram, we've labeled the step
cost of each action along the route.

36
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:36,490
So the step cost of
going between Neamt and

37
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:42,610
Iasi would be 87, corresponding
to a distance of 87 kilometers.

38
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:46,590
And then the path cost is just
the sum of the step cost.

39
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:51,200
So the cost of the path of
going from Arad to Oradea

40
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,654
would be 71 plus 75.
