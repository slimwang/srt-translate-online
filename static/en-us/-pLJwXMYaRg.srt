1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The highest derivative is the first one.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
We have the first derivative, the rate of change,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
but we do not have a second derivative of a rate of change.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Yes, it's the system. We have several equations in parallel. It's explicit.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
The highest derivative appears alone on one side and nowhere else,

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and this maybe a surprise, it's not linear.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
The problem is this term and this term as well.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
They are multiplying one component of the solution by another component of the solution.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 99:59:59,999
This is something like x(t)Â².
