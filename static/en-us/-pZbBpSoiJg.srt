00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,198
Now, once we have the ability to manipulate the canvas, the next step is

2
00:00:03,198 --> 00:00:07,239
figuring out how to do the right way. So, you'll find that as the number of

3
00:00:07,239 --> 00:00:10,633
images in your environment and the number of images in your asset set start

4
00:00:10,648 --> 00:00:14,174
increasing exponentially, the management of that and drawing to the screen, is

5
00:00:14,174 --> 00:00:17,300
actually going to get exponentially harder as well. So, in this unit, we're

6
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:21,082
actually going to introduce the concept of an atlas, and talk to you about how

7
00:00:21,082 --> 00:00:24,986
to boil all of this complexity down into something that's usable, and easy to

8
00:00:24,986 --> 00:00:25,311
do.
