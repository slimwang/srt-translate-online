1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,800
So let's look at edge detection with a simple example.

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:06,120
I'm going to give you my usual, simple image.

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:08,890
Let's use this as an example, and see what we can do with it.

4
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:12,180
So the basic idea of edge detection is, we want to look for

5
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:14,770
a neighborhood with strong signs of change.

6
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:18,930
So let's, for example, look at this pixel, or this neighborhood of one,

7
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:22,960
and look at it with respect to the other pixels around it.

8
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,150
How much is the change from here to there?

9
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:27,470
How much is the change from here to here and

10
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:31,580
also basically just in that neighborhood of these pixels here, figure out,

11
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:34,270
oh is there a big discontinuity here?

12
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:39,820
And of course, there is a significant discontinuity 12 intensity to 90.

13
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:43,550
We can basically start looking at that one by one throughout the whole image, so

14
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:45,600
of course the same when I look at this.

15
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,720
And I compare it with this.

16
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:50,350
There's a discontinuity, a significant one between these two.

17
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:53,560
However, not much so between 90 and 89.

18
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:58,590
Looking at this pixel here, I would also, also have the same type of comparison.

19
00:00:58,590 --> 00:00:59,950
Much more discontinuity here.

20
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:02,537
Of course, I didn't go down all the way here, but

21
00:01:02,537 --> 00:01:06,680
if you notice, 89, 86, 87, 82 were somewhat similar.

22
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:07,940
Not exactly the same.

23
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:10,890
I mean there is discontinuity, just not a significant one.

24
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:13,150
But between 12 and 88 much more.

25
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:15,180
Again we can keep coming down this way.

26
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:20,080
And 9 and 10 have discontinuity, 15 and 12 have discontinuity, but small.

27
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,677
So [INAUDIBLE] when I hit 12,

28
00:01:21,677 --> 00:01:25,530
you basically notice a significant discontinuity here.

29
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:27,530
And also between 12 and 84.

30
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:31,700
So this process basically as a scan through an image.

31
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:34,820
I will be looking for each and every pixel and

32
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:39,570
look in the neighborhood, the four connected next to it itself and say,

33
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:44,660
okay, do I need to put something between those pixels to create an edge?

34
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:47,440
And I can just go through the whole process and see how this looks for

35
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:51,640
this instance, and you can basically see that, of course, just by looking at

36
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:55,620
a contin, discontinuities between different types of things, we can create

37
00:01:55,620 --> 00:02:01,140
this simple, line, which separates out this part of the image with that one.

38
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:05,040
Or basically points out that there is a discontinuity between it.

39
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,360
Here is another way of looking at it.

40
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,090
Basically, now I've just given those gray values and

41
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:11,850
now I can see the edge between the two.

42
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:14,040
Becomes much more clearer this way also.

43
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:17,470
So as we do this, we have to think about various things.

44
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,410
What is the size of the neighborhood?

45
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:23,060
I started off with basically the assumption that the neighborhood size.

46
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:27,200
Which I've always referred to was one because I look at it with respect to that.

47
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,920
Then also what metric represents a change?

48
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:34,170
And in this case we looked at saying is, well let's not basically think they

49
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:39,290
are different if the pixel intensity's different by three.

50
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:43,160
But if it's several orders of in this case, of course, almost 78,

51
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,720
we would put that as an edge.

52
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,270
Or, in this case, you know, again, about 76,

53
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:51,240
so all of those radiations are much larger.

54
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:57,780
So we basically came up with some sort of a threshold, and

55
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:00,980
defined that as where we want to actually look for those changes.

56
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:03,330
If there was with certain amounts, if it was above it or

57
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:06,210
not, we would actually look for that discontinuity.

58
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:10,250
Of course there is discontinuity, much smaller one between each and every pixel.

59
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:12,320
But we will just be looking for larger ones.

60
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,770
So that's one more thing we have to look at.
