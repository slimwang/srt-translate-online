1
00:00:00,263 --> 00:00:03,538
Here's the sequence I calculated,

2
00:00:03,538 --> 00:00:08,298
h-d-l-b-a-c-f-e-g-j-i-k-n-m-o.

3
00:00:08,298 --> 00:00:09,864
So how did I get that?

4
00:00:09,864 --> 00:00:13,260
Recall that the first step is
to divide the levels in half.

5
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:16,100
Everything in the upper subtree
goes into the output array first,

6
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:18,410
followed by the remaining subtrees.

7
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:20,510
So what about the order
within a subtree?

8
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:23,560
To get that order,
you apply the partitioning recursively.

9
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:27,300
So this result HDL is the first thing
you'd get after a whole recursive

10
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,390
partitioning of the upper subtree.

11
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:32,164
Let's make one last observation
about this ordering.

12
00:00:32,164 --> 00:00:34,184
Notice the traversal path.

13
00:00:34,184 --> 00:00:36,321
If you know anything about
space-filling curves,

14
00:00:36,321 --> 00:00:38,222
the pattern should kind
of remind you of that.

15
00:00:38,222 --> 00:00:40,392
I think it's kind of neat
how the path snakes and

16
00:00:40,392 --> 00:00:43,280
slithers its way around the tree,
don't you?

17
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,300
Thibbit.

18
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:45,740
That is the sound a snake makes but
