00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,420
The first principle is the Liskov Substitution Principle named after

2
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:09,880
Barbara Liskov and she proposed the principle that subclass instances should,

3
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:13,670
should satisfy parent class constraints or contracts. That is,

4
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:18,880
if the client module accepts and works correctly on a parent class instance it

5
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,830
should also work when a child class instance is substituted.

6
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:27,220
This implies that child class instances should obey parent class invariants and

7
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:29,780
method contracts including their pre and post conditions.
