00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:05,358
The only value of x that makes this equation true is x equals 3. Great work for

2
00:00:05,358 --> 00:00:09,992
getting that one correct. First we want to get each radical on one side of the

3
00:00:09,992 --> 00:00:15,317
equal sign. So we can add this radical to both sides of the equation. Now that

4
00:00:15,317 --> 00:00:18,916
each radical is on either side of the equal sign we can square both sides to

5
00:00:18,916 --> 00:00:25,183
undo these square roots. So on the left, we'll just be left with the radicand,

6
00:00:25,183 --> 00:00:30,490
6x minus 7. And on the right, we'll be left with this expression, 2x plus 5.

7
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:34,814
Next, we just want to solve this linear equation for the value of x. So we

8
00:00:34,814 --> 00:00:39,996
subtract 2x from both sides and then, add positive 7 to both sides. This will

9
00:00:39,996 --> 00:00:43,778
leave us with 4x equals 12 and then, we divide both sides by 4 to get x equals

10
00:00:43,778 --> 00:00:48,140
3. To double-check our result, we'll plug in x equals 3 into the original

11
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:52,986
equation. When we check x equals 3, we'll get this expression on the left,

12
00:00:52,986 --> 00:00:58,868
which evaluates to root 11 minus root 11, which equals 0. Our answer checks so

13
00:00:58,868 --> 00:01:03,833
we can use this as our solution set, x just equals positive 3.
