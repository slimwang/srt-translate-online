00:00:00,009 --> 00:00:02,476
Congratulations, you have completed unit 5.

2
00:00:02,476 --> 00:00:05,407
You have a search engine that can respond to queries quickly,

3
00:00:05,407 --> 00:00:08,260
no matter how large the index gets.

4
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:10,839
This problem of analyzing the cost of algorithms

5
00:00:10,839 --> 00:00:13,142
and designing data structures that are more efficient,

6
00:00:13,142 --> 00:00:15,659
is one of the core ideas in all of computer science.

7
00:00:15,659 --> 00:00:18,228
It's something we go into a lot more depth on in later courses

8
00:00:18,228 --> 00:00:21,160
that I hope you will take after finishing CS101,

9
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:23,861
including the Algorithms and Theory of Computation course.

10
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:27,947
The main thing we have left to do for our search engine,

11
00:00:27,947 --> 00:00:32,441
is to find a way to get the best page for a given query, instead of all pages.

12
00:00:32,441 --> 00:00:34,524
This is the main thing that made Google so successful -

13
00:00:34,524 --> 00:00:36,591
figuring out a better way to identify the pages

14
00:00:36,591 --> 00:00:38,493
searchers really care about.

15
00:00:38,493 --> 00:00:40,477
Thats what we are going to look at in unit 6.

16
00:00:40,477 --> 00:00:43,000
Hope to see you back soon!
