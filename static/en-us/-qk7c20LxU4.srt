00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,560
We've still got one small
problem with this app now.

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:07,470
If I try to go back to the settings and
change my multiplier to something that's

3
00:00:07,469 --> 00:00:12,779
not really a number,
say just random texts, our app crashes.

4
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:16,055
Not only that, but because it's
stored as a shared preference,

5
00:00:16,056 --> 00:00:18,568
every time I try to relaunch
the app it will crash.

6
00:00:18,568 --> 00:00:22,172
In the next module we'll discuss
some options of dealing with this.
