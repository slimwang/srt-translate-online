1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:02,469
Here we're going to talk
about constructionism.

2
00:00:02,469 --> 00:00:04,700
Constructionism is a learning theory and

3
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:07,730
probably the most influential
learning theory of the past century.

4
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:08,990
If you've taken a psychology class,

5
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:12,050
you're probably familiar with
constructivism, the brain child of

6
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:15,700
Jean Piaget, that describes how people
learn about the world around them.

7
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:19,580
Constructionism is a learning theory
from Seymour Papert, that takes those

8
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:22,110
ideas of constructivism and
applies them to how we should actually

9
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:26,690
develop curricula or develop activities
to best facilitate student learning.

10
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:29,590
Constructionism is really about putting
the learner in the center of learning

11
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:32,890
activity, and having them actually
construct an understanding

12
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:34,710
of whatever concept we're
trying to teach them.

13
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:37,550
It suggests that we can't just pour our
knowledge into a learner's head, but

14
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:40,190
really they have to build their
understanding of whatever we're

15
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:41,690
communicating to them.

16
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:44,790
Now constructionism is kind of
the umbrella over a lot of different

17
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:47,110
pedagogics that we'll
talk about in this class.

18
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:50,190
It's the umbrella over project based
learning, problem based learning,

19
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:53,040
learning by design,
learning by example, learning by doing.

20
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:56,440
All of these things put the student in
the center of the learning process and

21
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:59,060
have them construct their understanding
of a concept through some

22
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:00,500
authentic experience.

23
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:03,280
So constructionism is really
about facilitating that active

24
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,040
learning process, putting the learner in
the center and having them experience

25
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,290
the concept in an authentic way and
construct their understanding of it.
