1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,339
Open up the ViewController.swift

2
00:00:02,339 --> 00:00:05,160
file and navigate to the top.

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:06,509
Here you see a line that shows the

4
00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:08,189
ViewController class that inherits from

5
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:10,859
UIViewController. If you hold down the

6
00:00:10,859 --> 00:00:12,599
option key, you can see that the cursor

7
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:15,750
changes to a question mark. Move the question mark

8
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:17,850
over to the ViewController and left click.

9
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:20,820
Clicking anywhere else dismisses

10
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,089
the documentation pop up. And I'll show

11
00:00:24,089 --> 00:00:26,339
it again. We hold down the option key and

12
00:00:26,339 --> 00:00:29,969
left click. And left clicking on the

13
00:00:29,969 --> 00:00:31,410
UIViewController shows us some

14
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:33,570
documentation for that particular class.

15
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:36,000
Another way to see the full

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,710
documentation is to hold down the option

17
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:39,600
key and double-click the

18
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,590
UIViewController. This will show you a

19
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:46,378
full documentation window. Let's click on

20
00:00:46,378 --> 00:00:50,039
UIViewController. Another way to find this

21
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:51,840
documentation is to go to the menu bar

22
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,210
for Xcode. Go to Help and then

23
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:59,939
Documentation and API Reference, and we

24
00:00:59,939 --> 00:01:02,460
can see that option here. You can also

25
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:04,260
get this window to appear by pressing

26
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:07,140
the key combination shift command + 0

27
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:13,140
anywhere in Xcode. Just like that.

28
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,090
Take a moment now to look for the

29
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:16,590
viewDidLoad() function under the

30
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:23,570
UIViewController documentation
