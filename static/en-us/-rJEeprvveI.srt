1
00:00:00,262 --> 00:00:03,370
All right, it's time for
you to go ahead and install Gradle.

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:07,680
When you're done, try running
Gradle--version from the command line.

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,020
You should get some output that
looks something like this.

4
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:13,730
Go ahead and fill in your Gradle version
number and your groovy version number.

5
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:15,856
Also, let's have a look at
the affected Gradle daemon.

6
00:00:15,856 --> 00:00:21,840
First run, Gradle--stop to stop
any daemons that might be running,

7
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,610
run the hello world task.

8
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:26,590
Note down how long it takes,
then run the task again and

9
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:27,920
see how long it takes the second time.
