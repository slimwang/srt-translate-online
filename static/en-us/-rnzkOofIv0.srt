00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,690
Let's talk a little bit about some of the specifics for

2
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:06,190
data modeling in JSON. First thing we should mention, is that

3
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:09,570
items may have different fields. So you notice there, that for

4
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:12,920
the certifications that actually had a multiplier, we included that multiplier.

5
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:14,790
In the case of Hard Days Night, it was four. But

6
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:17,380
for those that don't actually have a multiplier, we simply left

7
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:21,450
that field out. And as we just discussed, JSON objects may

8
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:25,360
have nested objects. That is, fields may have values which are themselves

9
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:30,350
JSON objects. We can also nest arrays. So, a field may have a value of an

10
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:32,930
array, and that array may have as it's

11
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:36,920
elements other JSON objects, individual values, or other arrays.
