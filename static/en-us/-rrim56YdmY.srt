00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,070
Now, you've got the skills to start
documenting your code with simply

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:05,110
readmes written in Markdown.

3
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:07,939
If and when your code grows,
you may want to

4
00:00:07,939 --> 00:00:10,990
explore other forms of documentation,
but this is a great place to start.

5
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:15,010
Writing great code isn't just about
building something that works,

6
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:18,530
but building something that's both
easy to use and easy to maintain.

7
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:20,220
If you're documenting your code,

8
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:24,240
then you're writing code that's
meant to be used by humans.

9
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,070
Being conscious of this fact beforehand
will make you a better developer.

10
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:30,240
I'm going to leave you with a challenge.

11
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,530
Go revisit some of the projects you've
built and write a readme for them.

12
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:37,820
Make documentation a priority for
all your projects moving forward.

13
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:38,620
You'll thank yourself later.
