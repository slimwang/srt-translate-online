Let's go through the answers together.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
If we call ironcrutchli with x as 0,

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
then 0 is less than 2, so we're going to return 0.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
If we call ironcrutchli when x is 1,

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
1 is also less than 2, so we still return 0.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
This function not so exciting thus far.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
But now we pass in 2 for x, and 2 is not less than 2.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
It is equal to 2, however, so we're going to return 2 + 1, or 3.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
And then over here if we pass in 9, 9 is not less than 2,

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
so we're going to return 10.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Iron Crutch Li was one of the 8 immortals of traditional Chinese mythology.

Not a particularly nice guy, but he did help out the sick.
