1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,000
All right, so now we have a nice
structure for a pets table.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,700
And we know the columns that we want,
so Name, Breed, Gender and Weight.

3
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:07,750
Now what?

4
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:11,720
So for the rest of this lesson, you'll
learn how to make SQLite databases

5
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,970
outside the context of Andriod.

6
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:14,687
And doing so

7
00:00:14,687 --> 00:00:20,110
will prepare you using SQLite later when
we put it into our Pets app in Andriod.

8
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:23,070
Now, what exactly is SQLite?

9
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:25,400
SQLite is a library
that makes it easy for

10
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:30,620
us to create a local database on the
device that our app is interacting with.

11
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:34,190
Now the Lite part of it, refers to the
fact that it's a lightweight version of

12
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:36,360
a typical database.

13
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:39,930
So there are more heavyweight
database options such as MySQL,

14
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:41,950
which offer more complicated features.

15
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:44,310
We won't be dealing with
this option in this course.

16
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:47,050
So for SQLite no server is needed,

17
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:50,940
the data is saved into a text
file locally on our device.

18
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:54,160
The SQLite library is free and
open source.

19
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,330
It's built into Android which is why
you'll be learning this particular

20
00:00:57,330 --> 00:00:58,750
database library.

21
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:03,020
You can also use SQLite in your Android
apps without needing to download or

22
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:04,760
install anything extra.

23
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:07,760
And you can also use the SQL
library directly on your computer,

24
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,770
which is what we'll be doing next.

25
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:12,510
So while SQLite is on our phone already,
it

26
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:16,320
is not something that comes necessarily
pre-installed on our computer yet.

27
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,600
So that's why I'll be giving you some
instructions soon about how to download

28
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,640
and install SQLite onto our computer.
