1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Now we're going to do a quiz and what we're going do is try to calculate how much it cost

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
to actually get an active customer and let's start with the pay-per-click.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Let's assume we're doing a web company and we spent 75 cents

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
on Google AdWords for every click that comes to our website here.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Now assume we actually have figured out that it require 4,025 customers

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
at 75 cents in this campaign.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Next, we just don't want to get them to our website,

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
we actually want them to sign up for our product.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Assume 3.7% of these 4,025 customers actually converted from acquired customers

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:56,000
to activated customers, so the question for this quiz is calculate what was

11
00:00:56,000 --> 99:59:59,999
the customer acquisition cost per customer.
