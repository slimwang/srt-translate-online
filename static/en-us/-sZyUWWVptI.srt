1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:04,169
In this example,
I'm going to create a few constraints.

2
00:00:04,169 --> 00:00:09,039
This is mostly for educational purposes,
as we won't be doing this very often.

3
00:00:09,039 --> 00:00:13,521
Mostly, we'll used stack views for
RUI and most of the time we will create

4
00:00:13,522 --> 00:00:18,185
constraints only for
positioning the outermost stack view.

5
00:00:18,184 --> 00:00:21,340
In order to create a constraint,
we can do it two ways.

6
00:00:21,341 --> 00:00:23,635
By Ctrl dragging, and

7
00:00:23,635 --> 00:00:28,605
also by using the constraints icon,
the one that looks like a TIE Fighter.

8
00:00:29,605 --> 00:00:34,043
In order for
the position of a view to be 100% clear,

9
00:00:34,043 --> 00:00:39,379
we need four constraints,
two vertical and two horizontal.

10
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:44,352
Actually, there's a shortcut that
allows us to specify the exact position

11
00:00:44,351 --> 00:00:49,329
with only two constraints,
one vertical and one horizontal.

12
00:00:49,329 --> 00:00:50,429
Can you think of it?

13
00:00:50,429 --> 00:00:54,109
If a view has an intrinsic content size,

14
00:00:54,109 --> 00:00:57,089
then we only need to set two
constraints, as the remaining

15
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:01,390
information can be obtained from
the intrinsic content size.
