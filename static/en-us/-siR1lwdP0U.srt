00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,240
You could have implemented NSUserDefaults in a number of ways.

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:07,290
Here's how I did it. First I added a method to the app delegate to check if

3
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:11,490
this is the first time this app is run before. This is pretty much the same code

4
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:13,109
used in the example app.

5
00:00:13,109 --> 00:00:16,920
The only thing I changed is what I said to be the default value. Here I set

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:21,329
float to be the default value for slider value key. Remember this is

7
00:00:21,329 --> 00:00:24,210
important, so that you can check this user default throughout the rest of your

8
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:27,000
code, without wondering whether the value is set or not.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,599
Next after looking around the PlaySoundsViewController

10
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:35,460
I thought it made sense to check for the slider value in ViewDidLoad.

11
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:41,549
And using NSUserDefaults floatForKey() method, I set the sliderView.value equal to

12
00:00:41,549 --> 00:00:48,420
NSUserDefaults.standardUserDefaults.floatForKey(SliderValueKey).

13
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:52,259
SliderValueKey is just a constant that I used to store the key string I’ll be using

14
00:00:52,259 --> 00:00:56,189
again and again. For saving the slider state, there are a few methods that would work.

15
00:00:56,189 --> 00:00:58,979
If you save it in slider move

16
00:00:58,979 --> 00:01:02,670
you will always be storing the most up to date slider value. If you stored in

17
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:06,599
play audio, you will see the last value that the user chose to listen to.

18
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:11,670
I chose to save it in play audio and I used

19
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:18,810
NSUserDefaults.standardUserDefaults.setFloat(sliderView.value, forKey:SliderValueKey)

20
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:24,599
to set the user default to the current sliderView.value, and let's run it.

21
00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:33,370
“Is this a persistent yet?”

22
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:37,390
“I hope so.” “I hope so.”

23
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:40,989
And we see that the slider position is in the same place
