1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,930
All right. So, look, that ends the motivation and sort of what computer vision

2
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:07,835
is and why you might do it and how we're going to do it in this class.

3
00:00:07,835 --> 00:00:09,800
Arvid, you have anything else you want to add?

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:10,560
>> Yeah.

5
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:13,850
I just hope that you're excited about the course by now.

6
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:17,530
To make sure that you don't listen to the entire course like a podcast,

7
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:20,420
I'm going to step in with some annoying little quizzes.

8
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:21,550
>> Annoying, huh?

9
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:22,120
>> Yes. >> Oh, okay.

10
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,950
>> They we'll find out.

11
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:24,550
>> Okay.

12
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:26,720
Arvid has been practicing all his life about how to be annoying,

13
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,080
that's what his mother told me.

14
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,460
So I think he's got it down.

15
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:32,840
But anyway, it's time we get started, it's a bit of work but

16
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:36,330
I think if if you do it, you'll learn a lot of computer vision, so

17
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:38,350
let's strap ourselves in and just get going.
