1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,910
So first,
spy on employees of a specific company.

2
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:06,068
You can do this with a trojan horse.

3
00:00:06,068 --> 00:00:10,180
For example, the trojan horse can come
in the form of a utility program,

4
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:14,190
such as a company calendar,
that also spies on the employees.

5
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:17,790
The second task,
cripple an organization's computers.

6
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:19,790
This is a logic bomb.

7
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:23,680
For example, a logic bomb can be
inserted into the company's computer

8
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,670
servers so that when the time is right,
the server will shut down.

9
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:30,460
The third task,
quickly spread information and

10
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:33,160
drive traffic to a specific website.

11
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:34,680
This is a virus.

12
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:39,490
As we know, virus can spread quickly,
for example, through email attachment.

13
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:43,470
And, when triggered, it can perform
a number of malicious activities,

14
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:45,340
such as driving traffic to a website.
