1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,330
So we have three columns. One, one is our event number the second column is

2
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:09,070
the event or stimulus that we're talking about, and the third column is,

3
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:14,650
just in English, what a, what response we expect from from the clock radio when

4
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:19,480
that event takes place. Also, we have already talked about Events 5 and 6, so

5
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:23,150
they also can be filled in. See if you can fill in for the table for

6
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:26,900
Events 12 and 13, which is sliding that mode switch left and right
