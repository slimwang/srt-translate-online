00:00:00,125 --> 00:00:03,759
The update and delete methods look
a lot like the insert method,

2
00:00:03,759 --> 00:00:05,582
except they update and delete.

3
00:00:05,582 --> 00:00:11,068
And, both return the rows modified,
rather than a URI upon completion.

4
00:00:11,068 --> 00:00:14,597
As you complete each section,
uncomment the test updater, or

5
00:00:14,597 --> 00:00:16,803
test delete test to check your result.

6
00:00:16,803 --> 00:00:20,400
Of course, make sure to notify your
content observers, and, of course,

7
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,240
close the database while you're at it
