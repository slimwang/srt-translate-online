1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,620
Now here's a chance for you to
practice typing out the syntax for

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:05,240
a control flow statement.

3
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:06,689
For this given block of code here,

4
00:00:06,689 --> 00:00:10,550
I want you to type it out
exactly into this blank box.

5
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:13,580
Write out the Java keywords if and
else properly.

6
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:17,260
And remember to include the parenthesis
around the test condition.

7
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:19,080
And then remember the braces as well.

8
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,060
When you're done typing it out,
go ahead and answer this question.

9
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:25,440
If we assume that the variable
number of guests has a value of ten

10
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,380
at the start of this statement.

11
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:29,880
Then after it's executed this statement.

12
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,009
What is the ending value
of the variable tip?
