00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,120
Trying to figure out how certain traits are inherited can

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,170
be really difficult. Sometimes we have a trait like one

3
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:08,620
of our parents or the other, and other times we

4
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:11,910
may have a trait not like our parents at all.

5
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:16,170
Take these three examples of families with different traits. For

6
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:19,140
example, look at height in the first scenario. We have

7
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,900
two parents who are relatively short. Will have a son

8
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:25,650
that's taller than both of them. Much taller, in fact.

9
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:28,730
We have a family where the parents have a daughter

10
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:31,370
and a little baby. And they all share the same

11
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:34,950
skin color, roughly speaking. And in this third family, we

12
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:38,220
have one parent who has a disposition of being happy

13
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:40,620
all the time. And the other parent has a disposition

14
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:43,540
of being sad all the time. Both the daughter and

15
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:47,110
the son have a disposition of being happy. What I

16
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:50,990
want you to tell me, is does the indicated trait appear

17
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:54,730
related to one or both of the parents at all? For

18
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:57,390
example, in the case of height, I want you to compare the

19
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:00,820
son to the parents. And see if it appears that in some

20
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:03,880
form or fashion whether it's a combination of the parents or one

21
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:07,550
of the parents sharing this trait, does the son appear related with

22
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:10,520
regards to this particular trait of height. And the same thing in

23
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:13,370
the scenario with skin color and the same thing with the scenario

24
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:16,210
we set up for disposition. Go ahead and tell me which answer

25
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:17,800
you think is best for each case.
