00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,925
Continuing in the vein of graphing equations, let's look at a different

2
00:00:03,937 --> 00:00:08,250
equation. y equals 3x minus 5. To move toward eventually graphing this, let's

3
00:00:08,262 --> 00:00:12,660
start by throwing out this xy table. I've already given you, lucky for you, all

4
00:00:12,672 --> 00:00:16,830
of the x values and for each of them, I'd like you to find the corresponding y

5
00:00:16,842 --> 00:00:17,155
value.
