Here are the four answers. Great work if you've had at least two of those. For

2
00:00:03,971 --> 00:00:07,619
the second one you might have written it as negative root 6 or negative 1 times

3
00:00:07,619 --> 00:00:12,768
root 6. Both are correct. For this third one we can't add the radicals together

4
00:00:12,768 --> 00:00:16,832
since the radicants are different. We do have the same index since we have a

5
00:00:16,832 --> 00:00:21,940
square root. But this radicand is a 2 and this one's a 3. So we leave this as

6
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:27,980
is. Here's a little bit more work to make it more clear. We have 4 root 3 minus

7
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:31,508
2 root 3. So if I have four of these root 3s and I subtract 2 of these root 3s,

8
00:00:31,508 --> 00:00:36,578
I'm left with two of the root 3s. We see that if we factor out a root 3 from

9
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:41,436
the first term and the second term. This would live us with the quantity 4

10
00:00:41,436 --> 00:00:46,326
minus 2 time root 3. We simplify the number in front of our radical sign to get

11
00:00:46,326 --> 00:00:49,522
2. Now you don't need to show this step in your problem solving but if it

12
00:00:49,522 --> 00:00:53,858
helps, you can definitely do it. Whenever I add and subtract radicals I just

13
00:00:53,858 --> 00:00:57,840
look at the numbers in front and then look at what I need to do with them.

14
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,372
Should I add or subtract these? In this case I subtract, so I just have 4 minus

15
00:01:02,372 --> 00:01:06,832
2, which is 2 of 3. This last problem was just like one we've seen before. We

16
00:01:06,832 --> 00:01:11,266
want to make sure that we have a 1 in front of this, a cube root of 3. So we're

17
00:01:11,266 --> 00:01:15,540
really subtracting 9 minus 1, which equals 8. We want to make sure that we keep

18
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:20,518
our root on the end so we have 8 times the cubed root of 3. I hope your getting

19
00:01:20,518 --> 00:01:21,853
the hang of this.
