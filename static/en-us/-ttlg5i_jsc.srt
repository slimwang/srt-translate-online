00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,140
I tried to put a little mathematics into this to try to understand it.

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:07,390
So, say we have a document that's 1,000 lines long.

3
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:13,950
And our viewport is 100 lines high, high.

4
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:19,440
Then our handle would need to be one-tenth of the tray as we scroll.

5
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:22,620
So the size is dependent on that relationship between,

6
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:25,750
how many lines can currently be displayed by the viewport, and

7
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:29,110
how many lines in total does the document have?

8
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:30,490
>> Kay, sounds, sounds good.

9
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:33,330
The size of the scroll bar handle with respect to the size of

10
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:37,930
the scroll bar tray indicates the portion of the document's lines provided by

11
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:40,960
the file manager that are currently visible in the viewport.

12
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,130
We're going to call this the handle proportion association, and

13
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:46,500
it's also a ternary association.
