Let's pick a polynomial function to play with so we can see how the

00:00:02,556 --> 00:00:06,852
intermediate value theorem actually works. I've chosen y equals x cubed minus

3
00:00:06,852 --> 00:00:11,788
3, and its graph pretty zoomed in looks like this. Notice the labels on our y

00:00:11,788 --> 00:00:16,283
axis and on our x axis. Now which integer values of x does the zero here lie

00:00:16,283 --> 00:00:17,609
between?
