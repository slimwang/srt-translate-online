1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,810
Now it's time to make some changes in
Sunshine so that you always get fresh

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:07,240
data and you display a notification
everyday when the weather updates.

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:10,080
To do this,
we'll first start by setting Sunshine up

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,699
with a background
synchronization IntentService.

5
00:00:12,699 --> 00:00:15,269
This IntentService will keep
the database up to date with

6
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:17,239
live weather information
from the server.

7
00:00:17,239 --> 00:00:20,889
Next, we'll optimize this so
the synchronization should only happen

8
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:23,030
if the database was never
synchronized before.

9
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:25,530
After that,
we'll be using FirebaseJobDispatcher.

10
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:28,499
We'll schedule a job that runs every
three to four hours that performs

11
00:00:28,498 --> 00:00:30,640
the same synchronization process.

12
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,179
And finally, we'll have
Sunshine trigger notifications

13
00:00:33,179 --> 00:00:35,850
everyday with updated
weather information.

14
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:39,480
As usual, the exercise code provided
has all of the steps you need to follow

15
00:00:39,479 --> 00:00:40,549
marked as to do comments.

16
00:00:40,549 --> 00:00:43,640
And the solution code is also there
to help you if you ever get stuck.

17
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:43,980
Good luck.
