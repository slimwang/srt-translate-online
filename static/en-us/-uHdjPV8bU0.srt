00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:02,469
About the four write
methods in Firebase.

2
00:00:02,469 --> 00:00:06,610
But it sounds like you want to read
from the Firebase database as well.

3
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:09,780
It's time to become
fully Firebase literate.

4
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:12,810
Reading data in Firebase
is all about Listeners.

5
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:16,129
You set a Listener and then define what
it does whenever it receives new data or

6
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:17,930
changes to existing data.

7
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:19,920
It's always triggered
with initial data and

8
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,540
then it is triggered again whenever
there is new or changed data.

9
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:26,535
There are three ways to add
read Listeners in Firebase.

10
00:00:26,535 --> 00:00:29,830
AddValueEventListener receives
events about changes to data

11
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:31,445
at a specific location.

12
00:00:31,445 --> 00:00:35,260
AddChildEventListener receives events
about changes in the child locations of

13
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:37,380
a given Firebase reference.

14
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:40,370
It is useful when trying to
keep track of lists of data.

15
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:44,250
The third method is
addListenerForSingleValueEvent.

16
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:48,587
AddListenerForSingleValueEvent looks
almost exactly like addValueEvent

17
00:00:48,587 --> 00:00:49,310
Listener.

18
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:51,420
But it does only one
read when you make it.
