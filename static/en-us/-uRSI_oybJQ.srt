1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,330
And here I'd say it's continuous.

2
00:00:01,330 --> 00:00:05,860
Because making $10,000 is just about the same as 9,999 or

3
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:09,940
making 20 bucks is about the same as 19.

4
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:11,010
So there's an order here.

5
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:13,630
So what I'm trying to drive home is that when we

6
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:18,730
make it continuous really implies that there's some sort of an ordering to it.

7
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:22,570
So we find that there's many different outcomes and they fall into linear order

8
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:28,070
where you can make greater or equal decisions, go continuous.

9
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:29,665
If there's many outcomes and

10
00:00:29,665 --> 00:00:33,310
they even occur by numbers without an order, then you go discrete.
