00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,806
Use each side of the equation now as the exponent of e. And then simplify the

2
00:00:05,806 --> 00:00:10,630
left-hand side. What equation does that leave us with? Remember that inverse

3
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:16,670
property we talked about before. A, taken to the power of log base a of x is

4
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:18,270
just equal to x.
