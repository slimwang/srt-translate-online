00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,444
To solve this equation, we want to undo the division by 2. We want to clear the

2
00:00:04,456 --> 00:00:08,926
fraction, so we multiply by 2. Notice this is one whole fraction. I can reduce

3
00:00:08,938 --> 00:00:13,358
the 2's that appear in the numerator and the denominator. I'm left with 3 times

4
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:17,752
the quantity a minus 7. Now, we want to clear the grouping so we can distribute

5
00:00:17,764 --> 00:00:22,547
this positive 3 to each term. 3 times a is 3 a, and 3 times negative 7 is

6
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:27,999
negative 21. Adding 21 to both sides, we get 3 a equals negative 15. So, for the

7
00:00:28,011 --> 00:00:33,638
solution, a is equal to negative 5. Remember, just like all the other equations,

8
00:00:33,754 --> 00:00:39,194
we can check our answer. I can plug in negative 5 for a, and this result should

9
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:44,280
be negative 18. Negative 5 minus 7 is negative 12, 3 times negative 12 is

10
00:00:44,292 --> 00:00:50,041
negative 36. And at negative 36 divided by 2 is negative 18. So our answer, a

11
00:00:50,053 --> 00:00:52,216
equals negative 5, does check.
