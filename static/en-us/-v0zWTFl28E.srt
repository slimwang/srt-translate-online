1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:05,240
Welcome, this lesson is all about
elements and how to size them.

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:08,650
At this point you should feel pretty
comfortable applying style with CSS and

3
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:11,240
picking the right elements for the page.

4
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:12,190
Now that's great, but

5
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:16,059
you haven't really explored
changing the sizes of elements yet.

6
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:18,200
So that's what you'll be
doing in this lession.

7
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,950
You'll be learning how to use something
called the box model to change

8
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:24,100
the dimensions of your elements and
along the way, you'll improve the way

9
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:27,650
that you write meaningful
markup with semantic elements.

10
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:29,286
To help out, James is going to be there.

11
00:00:29,286 --> 00:00:30,797
Hey James.

12
00:00:30,797 --> 00:00:32,310
>> Hey there.

13
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:37,190
>> Now, before we jump into the box
model and semantic elements, James and

14
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:40,280
I are going to play a quick
game called guess the render

15
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:44,420
Now this is going to help us demonstrate
just how useful semantic elements are.

16
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:47,670
>> Cam, by playing a game
do you mean you're going to be

17
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:50,270
playing a game and
I'm going to be winning a game?

18
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:51,210
>> No.
James and

19
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:54,720
I are actually in different rooms and
can't hear each other at the moment.

20
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,500
I have no idea what he just said.

21
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:59,220
I'll assume that he said
he's probably going to win.

22
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:02,660
But I don't need to respond because
I know I'm going to win because

23
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:03,750
I rigged the game.

24
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,520
Now, to play guess the render, James and
I wrote a handful of HTML files for

25
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,958
some simple sites.

26
00:01:10,958 --> 00:01:14,650
Hezekiah is going to pick
out two files ar random, and

27
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:19,070
give one of my files to James and
one of James' files to me.

28
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:20,980
Whoever can read the HTML and

29
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:25,510
draw the website closet to the way it
should be actually rendered will win.

30
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:29,820
And I rigged it because I
know that Hezakya is going to

31
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:32,680
give me some HTML that
uses semantic elements,

32
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:37,060
while James is just going to get
one big mess of divs and p tags.

33
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:38,150
>> That's fair.

34
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:38,680
>> Yeah I know.

35
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,350
Well, take this over

36
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,080
>> All right, will do.

37
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:42,830
This is going to be fun.
