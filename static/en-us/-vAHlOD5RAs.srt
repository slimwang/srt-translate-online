00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:03,440
Our first step in the proof is to
understand the difference between

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:06,980
the maximum matching that
the algorithm finds eventually and

3
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:10,920
the intermediate matchings that
the algorithm produces along the way.

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:11,440
Although actually,

5
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:16,830
we'll state the key claim in terms of
two arbitrary matchings, M and M prime.

6
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:19,180
And actually, I want you to help me out.

7
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:24,470
Think about the graph containing edges
that are in M but not in M prime or

8
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:28,250
vice versa and tell me which of
the following statements are true.
