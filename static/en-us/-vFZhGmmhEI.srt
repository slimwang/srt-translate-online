00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,360
Let's look at the solution
to our virtual memory quiz.

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,010
We said that the computer
has 16 active applications,

3
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:09,490
each with a 32-bit address space.

4
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:12,690
So each potentially sees
a four gigabyte memory.

5
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:15,720
What is the real memory in the system?

6
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:19,210
It turns out that all of these
are potentially correct.

7
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:23,710
We can have a system that has only
two 2-gigabyte memory modules.

8
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:27,570
So it really has a total of
4 gigabytes physical memory.

9
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:30,000
Yet it can run 16 applications,

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,540
each of which thinks that it
has 4 gigabytes of memory.

11
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:38,570
We can also have more memory,
even more memory,

12
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:41,360
a different combination of memory and
so on.

13
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,980
So pretty much what the applications
think they have in terms of memory and

14
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:50,310
what the system really has can be
completely decoupled by virtual memory.
