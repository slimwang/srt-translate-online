1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:04,250
Frameworks were created because projects
required the same initial components, so

2
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:06,230
developers were doing
the same tasks over and

3
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:09,730
over, write out the initial HTML,
add standard default CSS,

4
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:13,370
and perhaps include some initial
basic JavaScript functionality.

5
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:15,130
There are many coding principles, but

6
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:20,240
two of my favorites are KISS, Keep It
Simple, and DRY, Don't Repeat Yourself.

7
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,880
Instead of doing the same steps over and

8
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:25,860
over, developers came up with
a base set of HTML, CSS, and

9
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:29,370
JavaScript, and created starter
projects from these files.

10
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:33,680
These starter projects are used as
a base or framework that can then be

11
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,930
extended with project-specific code
to create individualized websites.

12
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:38,870
A framework is built so

13
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:41,790
that it encourages you to write your
code following standard patterns and

14
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:45,030
to put your project's
files in specific places.

15
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:48,540
This helps to prevent spaghetti code,
to keep everything organized, and

16
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:50,520
to make it easier for
new devs to get up and running.
