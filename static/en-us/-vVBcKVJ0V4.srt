1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,290
But accessibility considerations
won't be enough to reach all users,

2
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:06,620
you also need to consider localization.

3
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:10,150
To reach the most users,
your application should handle text,

4
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:14,050
audio files, numbers, currency and
graphics in ways appropriate to

5
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:16,870
the locales where your
application will be used.

6
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:20,190
This is actually pretty simple if you
use the Android resource framework

7
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:22,980
to separate the localized
aspects of your application

8
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,190
from the core Java functionality.

9
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:28,840
You can put most of the contents of
your apps UI into resource files,

10
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:32,490
whereas the behavior of the UI
is driven by your Java code.

11
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:35,513
For example, if users input
data that needs to formatted or

12
00:00:35,513 --> 00:00:37,910
sorted differently depending on locale.

13
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:40,780
Then you would use Java to handle
the data programmatically.

14
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:43,370
But alternative strings or
layouts can live in the XML.
