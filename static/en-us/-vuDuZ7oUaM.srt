00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,337
Let's do a speedup averaging quiz. Let's say we

2
00:00:03,337 --> 00:00:06,700
have an old laptop and a new laptop. Let's

3
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:09,885
say that we have two applications that are representative

4
00:00:09,885 --> 00:00:13,330
for our workloads: a homework formatting application, and a

5
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:17,510
virus scan application. For homework formatting, going from the

6
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:20,380
old laptop to the new laptop on homework formatting

7
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:22,364
gives us a speed up of 2. For virus

8
00:00:22,364 --> 00:00:25,406
scanning, going from the old laptop to the new

9
00:00:25,406 --> 00:00:29,965
laptop gives us a speed up of 8. So overall, going from the

10
00:00:29,965 --> 00:00:35,150
old laptop to the new laptop gives us a speedup of how much?
