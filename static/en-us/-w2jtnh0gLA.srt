1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,368
On the other hand, our vision still has a lot of developing to do after we're

2
00:00:03,368 --> 00:00:07,768
born. A newborn can only see at about 20-600, which isn't great at all

3
00:00:07,768 --> 00:00:12,759
considering that 20-20 is perfect vision. Objects need to be really close to a

4
00:00:12,759 --> 00:00:17,615
baby for them to be able to see it. It's not until at about age three or four

5
00:00:17,615 --> 00:00:22,298
when vision is similar to that of an adult. An interesting point to make is

6
00:00:22,298 --> 00:00:25,902
that newborns aren't great at seeing color. Our eyes have to develop in order

7
00:00:25,902 --> 00:00:30,086
for us to see color. Remember the rods and the cones in the eye? Our cones need

8
00:00:30,086 --> 00:00:34,810
to develop and merge to the center of the retina for us to see color in detail.

9
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:37,982
When we were born, we primarily use our rods, which allow us to see black or

10
00:00:37,982 --> 00:00:41,972
white or light and dark. This is why babies are so fascinated with high

11
00:00:41,972 --> 00:00:46,686
contrast black and white designs. And when we get older, we use our rods and

12
00:00:46,686 --> 00:00:47,939
our cones.
