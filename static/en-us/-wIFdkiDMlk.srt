00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,530
In this exercise, I'm going to
show you how to use traceview,

2
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:05,180
to identify a function that's
messing with your apps frame rate.

3
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:07,590
Now if you want to follow along,
you'll need to download the compute and

4
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:11,690
memory sample app from the linked
in the instructor notes below.

5
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:14,835
After you install the sample app,
go ahead and press the slow on click

6
00:00:14,835 --> 00:00:17,595
handler button, you'll notice
the familiar dancing pirate.

7
00:00:17,595 --> 00:00:20,165
Then go ahead and press the button
labeled,display an image.

8
00:00:21,595 --> 00:00:25,535
See as you can see, the pirate's dance
pauses and then resumes again when you

9
00:00:25,535 --> 00:00:29,125
do this, and then the Android image
is displayed underneath the button.

10
00:00:29,125 --> 00:00:31,115
Just like before,
it seems like pressing the button,

11
00:00:31,115 --> 00:00:33,825
relates to the pause in
the pirate's dance, so hopefully,

12
00:00:33,825 --> 00:00:37,580
you know what comes next, and
more importantly what tool to use.

13
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:39,650
We're going to profile
the app using traceview, so

14
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:40,412
let's go ahead and do that.

15
00:00:40,412 --> 00:00:43,100
All right, so I want to come
over here to my devices list and

16
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:45,890
make sure that the compute activity's
selected, before we start profiling,

17
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:48,820
I'm going to click on the slow unclick
handler to launch the activity,

18
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:50,290
let's go ahead and
start a trace, like so.

19
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:54,490
Go ahead and hit OK, all right, so the
trace is running now, let's go ahead and

20
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:57,550
click this display an image button,
and there we go.

21
00:00:57,550 --> 00:00:58,920
Let's stop our trace.

22
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,060
So let's go ahead and
look at our output.

23
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,260
All right, so we have a lot
of data here in our output,

24
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:03,860
but what does all of it mean?

25
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:06,390
Now here's a task,
look through the traceview output and

26
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:09,160
see if you can identify some methods
coming from the sample app,that

27
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,500
are using significant CPU resources.

28
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:12,980
Jot down your top two answers here.
