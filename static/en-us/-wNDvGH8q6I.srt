00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,554
We initially set, balance to 100, and target to 200. But target won't change,

2
00:00:04,554 --> 00:00:09,008
so I wont write that down over here. Rate also wont change. The year, starts at

3
00:00:09,008 --> 00:00:13,774
0. Now we compare the balance to the target. The balance is 100, and the target

4
00:00:13,774 --> 00:00:20,070
is 200. 100 is not greater than or equal to 200. So we don't go into the body

5
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:24,571
of the loop. We skip down to the bottom. We never output anything. What would

6
00:00:24,571 --> 00:00:28,103
you say the bug in this code is? How would you fix it? I won't go over this,

7
00:00:28,103 --> 00:00:30,300
but if you're not sure, maybe try it out in BlueJ.
