00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,282
This equation that we just developed is a great start. But one thing that Grant

2
00:00:04,282 --> 00:00:08,503
learned from a businessman at the expo, is that the price of an item actually

3
00:00:08,503 --> 00:00:12,597
effects the number of it that you can sell. So, in this case that would mean

4
00:00:12,597 --> 00:00:16,806
that n actually depends on c. If we let the horizontal axis here represent the

5
00:00:16,806 --> 00:00:20,966
price of an item, or c, and the vertical axis, represent the number of the item

6
00:00:20,966 --> 00:00:25,127
we sell, n. Which of these graphs best represents the relationship between c and

7
00:00:25,127 --> 00:00:29,054
n? Think about what each of them says about how change in the price will affect

8
00:00:29,054 --> 00:00:32,924
the number of units sold. This is a pretty simplistic view of economics, but

9
00:00:32,924 --> 00:00:36,255
just think about which of these is the best choice out of the four.
