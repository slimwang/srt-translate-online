00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,488
Let's put D as the header in this column. D for difference. If you figured this

2
00:00:05,488 --> 00:00:14,398
out yourself, great job. We'll put equals A2 minus B2. And there we have our

3
00:00:14,398 --> 00:00:19,886
difference. Then we'll copy this cell, 'cuz we'll copy the formula. Go to cell

4
00:00:19,886 --> 00:00:26,920
C26. Highlight the whole column C, and then paste. And we get all our

5
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:34,430
differences. Let's calculate the average difference. We get the same thing we

6
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:38,870
got for our point estimate of the differences. Now let's calculate the standard

7
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:47,474
deviation of these. So we have each value, minus the mean. So remember we're

8
00:00:47,474 --> 00:00:52,570
subtracting a negative number, and then square it. So these are our squared

9
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:57,361
deviations from the mean. So we'll sum them up and then divide by n minus 1,

10
00:00:57,361 --> 00:01:04,744
which is 24. Finally, we'll take the square root. We get about 3.69.
