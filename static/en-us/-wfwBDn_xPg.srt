00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:04,510
Understanding objects, fields, and records is important to conceptualize

00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:06,340
the data model that you're building in the music

00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:09,520
festival app. Let's make sure you understand what's going

00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:13,210

00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:19,030

example, a Udacity t-shirt costs $15 and weighs six

11
00:00:32,055 --> 00:00:35,120
