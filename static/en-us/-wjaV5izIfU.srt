1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:02,739
The answer is this language.

2
00:00:02,739 --> 00:00:06,201
{0,1}*1 {0,1}.

3
00:00:06,201 --> 00:00:09,447
Remember, that in order for
the machine to accept the string,

4
00:00:09,447 --> 00:00:12,520
it just has to accept it in any
branch of it's computation.

5
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:18,545
This self loop, on the initial state,
corresponds to the initial {0,1}*.

6
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:24,250
This transition can happen for
the whole length of the string, or

7
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:25,210
it can happen none at all.

8
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,610
In any excepting computation however,

9
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:31,650
it has to stop exactly two
symbols before the end.

10
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:35,400
So that a 1, and then either a 0 or a 1,

11
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:38,680
can be read just before the end
of the input is reached.
