1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,620
Now, here are the changes that
we made to the NumbersActivity

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:05,400
to use an array list
instead of an array.

3
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:09,830
We had started out with
an array of words, but

4
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:14,110
to change it to an array list, I'm
going to change the data type here and

5
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:17,560
put in string between angle brackets.

6
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:21,200
Now, notice that the A and
the L in ArrayList are capitalized

7
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:24,340
because we're using
the exact name of the class.

8
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:28,280
And also remember to capitalize
S in string because string

9
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:31,790
is an object data type and
not a primitive data type.

10
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:36,810
So, we'll keep the words variable and
to initialize the surrealist

11
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:40,860
we also use the new keyword,
but will modify this portion.

12
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:47,140
So we have ArrayList and
it stores a String

13
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:52,900
object out of types and
we end up with two parentheses.

14
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:55,620
And notice that these are empty
parentheses because there's no input for

15
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:56,860
this constructor.

16
00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:00,000
Now since we've changed the data
type of the words variable and

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,610
your pseudo complains
with a bunch of errors.

18
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:04,420
Now let's take a look
at fixing these errors.

19
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,140
In order to add an element to an array
list, we need to call the add method and

20
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:11,230
pass in the new element.

21
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:16,270
So rather than using the assignment
operator like we did for the array.

22
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:18,320
This is how it would
look in the ArrayList.

23
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:21,770
Now I'm going to delete
the portion from the array.

24
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:26,230
And when we're done adding all
the words to the word array,

25
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:27,590
this is what the solution
should look like.

26
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:32,830
And now it looks like we have a lot
of errors in the log messages and

27
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:34,960
let's check out how we can update that.

28
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,290
Instead of accessing an array
element with the name words

29
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:40,529
followed by the position
index in closed in braces.

30
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:45,160
We're going to access each element in
the array list by calling the get method

31
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,060
on the word's object.

32
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:48,300
So this is what that would look like.

33
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,190
In here we're passing in one input,
which is the position index.

34
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:58,585
So I'm passing in zero because I want to
cheat the element at the zero the index.

35
00:01:58,585 --> 00:02:02,880
All right, so I finish typing
out the rest of the logs and

36
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,710
I've modify the comments to reflect
that we're using an array list now.

37
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:08,340
And great, all the errors are gone.

38
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,540
Now let's run the app on the device to
make sure everything still works okay.

39
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:17,610
So when we open the numbers activity,
the screen is blank and that's expected.

40
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:22,450
When we take a look at the Android
LogCat we see messages in the log.

41
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:24,370
So the output should be
the same as last time, but

42
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:27,750
this time we accomplish the results
with an ArrayList instead of an array.
