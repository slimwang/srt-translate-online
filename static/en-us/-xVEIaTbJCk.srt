1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,170
In this example, initially the first
ten pages will be loaded into

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:07,730
memory one at a time,
as they're being accessed one-by-one.

3
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:11,009
First page 9, then page 2, then page 10.

4
00:00:11,009 --> 00:00:14,181
Now at this point,
page 11 needs to be accessed.

5
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:16,392
And that will mean that the first page,

6
00:00:16,392 --> 00:00:20,948
which is the one that's least recently
used, needs to be swapped out of memory,

7
00:00:20,948 --> 00:00:24,470
given that the physical
memory only has 10 pages.

8
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:29,960
Now the really unfortunate thing is that
just as we swapped page 1 out of memory,

9
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:33,560
given that the pages are accessed
one-by-one in a loop,

10
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:37,980
that exact same page, page 1,
is the very next page that's needed.

11
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:41,080
We will have to demand page that in.

12
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:44,060
And given that our physical
memory has 10 pages,

13
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:48,310
we need to pick out another
page to swap out to replace.

14
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:49,640
And that's going to be page 2,

15
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:53,200
given that that's the least
recently used page right now.

16
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:57,323
And guess what, the next page that will
be needed will be exactly page 2 that we

17
00:00:57,323 --> 00:00:58,326
just swapped out.

18
00:00:58,326 --> 00:01:00,259
So the process will continue for

19
00:01:00,259 --> 00:01:04,132
all of the remaining pages during
the execution of the program.

20
00:01:04,132 --> 00:01:09,120
And therefore, the nearest percentage
of the number of pages that need to

21
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:12,370
be demand paged using
the LRU policy is 100.

22
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:15,230
This is clearly a very
pathological scenario.

23
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:19,710
But what it's trying to demonstrate
is that an intuitive policy such

24
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:24,440
as LRU can result in really poor
behavior under certain conditions.

25
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:28,580
For that reasons, operating systems
can be configured to support different

26
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:33,020
kinds of replacement policies that are
used to manage their physical memory.
