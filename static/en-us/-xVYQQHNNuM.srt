Here's a query I use to try to
find the answer to this problem.

2
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:05,530
Pandas add two series without nans.

3
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:08,490
And it looks like the first
result is about adding pandas

4
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:11,470
series with different
indices without getting nans.

5
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:13,500
That sounds like what I'm wondering.

6
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:17,660
The first answer on this page
suggests using the fill value and

7
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:19,760
some sample code is provided.

8
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,951
In the example code,
I can see that the person who posted,

9
00:00:22,951 --> 00:00:26,292
is advocating using the .add function,
instead of the +.

10
00:00:26,292 --> 00:00:30,913
And then the .add function can
take an argument, fill_value=0.

11
00:00:30,913 --> 00:00:33,746
So I'll try that out
on these two series.

12
00:00:33,746 --> 00:00:36,540
And it looks like the result is
exactly what I was hoping for.
