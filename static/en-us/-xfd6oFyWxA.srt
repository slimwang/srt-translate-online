Let us talk about Computational Psychometrics a little bit.

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:08,170
Psychometrics itself is a study of human intelligence, of human aptitude,

3
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:13,350
of human knowledge. Computational Psychometrics for our purposes,

4
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:17,370
is the design of computational agents that can take the same kind of tests that

5
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:20,750
humans do, when they are tested for intelligence or knowledge or aptitude.

6
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:25,760
Imagine that you design an AI agent that can take an intelligence test.

7
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,360
After designing it, you might want to analyze how well does it do compared to

8
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:33,760
the humans on that test? You might also want to compare the errors it

9
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:39,100
makes with the errors that humans make. If it does as well as humans do and

10
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:42,470
if its behavior, its errors are the same as those of humans,

11
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:46,270
you might conjecture then that perhaps its reasoning mirrors that of humans.

12
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:50,220
In this class, we are going to be designing AI agents that can

13
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:54,790
take the Raven's Test of Intelligence. In the process, we will want to use this

14
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:59,130
agents to reflect on how humans might be addressing the same intelligence tests.
