00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:02,710
I'm sure by now this picture is very familiar

2
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:05,910
to you. Showing you the memory hierarchy going all the

3
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:09,162
way from the CPU to the virtual memory on

4
00:00:09,162 --> 00:00:12,040
the disk. You have several levels of caches, of course,

5
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:15,820
the TLB that holds address translations for you, virtual

6
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:19,100
to physical, and you have the main memory and then

7
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:22,190
the virtual memory on the disk. Now, caches are

8
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:25,660
physically tagged and so you don't need to do anything

9
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:29,000
special about them from the point of your virtualizing the

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,170
memory hierarchy. The really thorny issue is handling virtual memory, namely

11
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:40,020
the virtual address to the physical memory mapping, which is the key

12
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:45,310
functionality of the memory management subsystem in any operating system.
