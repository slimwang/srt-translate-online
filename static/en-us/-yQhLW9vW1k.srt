00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,510
Now it's time for a question. Based on

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:06,200
the discussion we've had thus far, what I would

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:08,724
like you to think about is, coming up

4
00:00:08,724 --> 00:00:12,250
to the scorecard for the three different structures that

5
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:15,260
I have identified. One is the monolithic operating

6
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:20,400
system, the DOS-like structure, and the microkernel-based operating system.

7
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,190
And what I would like you to do

8
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:25,650
is think about the features that are important in

9
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:28,870
the structure of the operating system. Extensibility,

10
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:32,580
protection, performance. And try to fill out this

11
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:39,420
score card as to which of these features are adequately met by each one of

12
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:42,188
these structures. So for each of these

13
00:00:42,188 --> 00:00:46,132
operating system structures, monolithic, think about whether it

14
00:00:46,132 --> 00:00:48,852
meets all of the features that I've identified

15
00:00:48,852 --> 00:00:52,030
here. Do the same thing for Dos-like structure.

16
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:54,130
Do the same thing for the microkernel based structure.
