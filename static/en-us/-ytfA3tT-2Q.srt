1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,260
The file is created by a certain user.

2
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:05,560
So the file belongs to user Alice,
let's say.

3
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:08,200
She then becomes the owner of this file.

4
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:10,880
And let's say here she
can choose to decide

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,760
who should have access to this file,
and in what manner.

6
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:17,370
So if confidentiality is
what we are concerned about,

7
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:20,770
then what kind of access
should be controlled for

8
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:24,070
this file that contains
this confidential data?

9
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:25,500
Okay, so that's the quiz about.

10
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:29,070
Remember, entries in an access
controlled matrix cell

11
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:33,640
in a matrix ACM that we just defined,
are some subset of access rights.

12
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,481
So here is the question of saying,

13
00:00:35,481 --> 00:00:39,429
if confidentiality is important what
access rights should you focus on?

14
00:00:39,429 --> 00:00:43,629
What should be present in that entry
in an Access Control Metrics or

15
00:00:43,629 --> 00:00:46,341
what right should not
not be present in it?

16
00:00:46,341 --> 00:00:49,176
So think about the 3 options, and so

17
00:00:49,176 --> 00:00:52,660
let the one that you think
makes the most sense
