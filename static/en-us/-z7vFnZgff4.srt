1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,170
The security of a device
should be established

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:05,760
when the device is turned on initially.

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:09,480
IOS uses trusted bootchain
to achieve this goal.

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:13,658
When an iOS is turned on,
each application processor immediately

5
00:00:13,658 --> 00:00:18,090
executes code from boot only
memory known as the bootrom.

6
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:22,150
This immutable code known as
the hardware root of trust,

7
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:27,400
is laid down during chip fabrication and
is implicitly trusted.

8
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:30,990
In other words,
this code is brunt into the hardware.

9
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:35,350
The bootrom code contains
the Apple root CA public key,

10
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:38,860
which is used to verify
that the low level loader,

11
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:44,060
LLB is signed by Apple properly
before allowing it to load.

12
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:48,590
This is the first step in the chain
of trust where each step ensures that

13
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:51,130
the next is signed by Apple properly.

14
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:54,430
When the LLB finishes its tasks,
it verifies and

15
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:56,740
runs the next stage below the iBoot.

16
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:01,920
Which in turn verifies and
runs the iOS kernel.

17
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,870
This secure bootchain helps ensure that

18
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:08,170
the lowest levels of software
are not tampered with.

19
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:11,950
And allows iOS to run only
on validated Apple devices.
