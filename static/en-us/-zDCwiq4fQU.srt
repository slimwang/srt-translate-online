The best answer is to run scatterplots,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
and the reason is I taught you that you should always look at the data first

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
before doing anything with the data.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
So, here is the scatterplot for those data points.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
It's really interesting. If I look at this, it looks like almost all the guesses are the same.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
That's the case until I realize that my vertical axis goes from 1e22

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
all the way down to -1e22.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Obviously there are outliers in that data.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
This plot makes it completely obvious to me that this isn't good data.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Let's take this plot away, and let's look at the data.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
As before, we notice that there are these extreme cases

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
where we have 1E+22--the same over here.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 99:59:59,999
I have to ask myself how to remove outliers.
