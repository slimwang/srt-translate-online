00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:03,797
It's been awhile since we coded
a toy app from scratch so

2
00:00:03,797 --> 00:00:05,297
this next bit is review.

3
00:00:05,296 --> 00:00:09,955
But it's important set up for
the main event of sending in intent and

4
00:00:09,955 --> 00:00:12,500
recreating the toy app you just saw.

5
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:15,185
If you want to follow along with me,

6
00:00:15,185 --> 00:00:18,992
open the O4A exercise
add new activity folder.

7
00:00:18,992 --> 00:00:23,975
Use the new activity wizard to create
an empty activity named ChildActivity.

8
00:00:25,699 --> 00:00:28,794
You can also select the type of
activity from the drop down.

9
00:00:28,795 --> 00:00:33,533
ChildActivity receives a text
string from the main activity,

10
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:35,168
so let's set that up.

11
00:00:35,168 --> 00:00:43,140
Add a TextView and set the idea of
the TextView to tv _display and

12
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:47,399
while we're at it we'll adjust the text
size and add some default text.

13
00:00:49,009 --> 00:00:53,969
Finally in the ChildActivity class
we need to create a variable to

14
00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:54,949
hold a text view.

15
00:00:56,570 --> 00:01:00,890
On create, we retrieve a reference
from the Text View form the layout.

16
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:03,649
Because we haven't
created the intent yet,

17
00:01:03,649 --> 00:01:06,989
running the app still
shows the main activity.

18
00:01:06,989 --> 00:01:11,709
We can verify that our ChildActivity
was properly created by editing

19
00:01:11,709 --> 00:01:17,679
the android manifest to launch
ChildActivity instead of main activity.

20
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,680
We can do that by moving this intent
filter, which says to launch this

21
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:28,190
activity when the application starts
from main activity to ChildActivity.

22
00:01:28,189 --> 00:01:32,849
And when we run our app again, we see
it with the default text we added.

23
00:01:32,849 --> 00:01:35,469
Now before I forget,
let me switch that back.
