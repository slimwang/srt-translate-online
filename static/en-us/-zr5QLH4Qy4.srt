1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:01,200
Okay.

2
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:03,760
So before Dan gets carried away
with databases,

3
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:05,198
let's look at what happens

4
00:00:05,198 --> 00:00:07,606
when you use an intent
to transition between activities.

5
00:00:07,766 --> 00:00:09,114
Within Sunshine,

6
00:00:09,114 --> 00:00:13,387
if you tap on a list in the main activity
it opens up the detail activity.

7
00:00:16,962 --> 00:00:19,230
But the main activity
remains on the backstack,

8
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:22,080
ready to reappear as soon
as you hit Back.

9
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,670
Now, in that example,
both activities are within the same app.

10
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:28,794
But as we learned in lesson three,
you can also watch the browser

11
00:00:28,794 --> 00:00:30,507
or Maps app from Sunshine.

12
00:00:35,281 --> 00:00:37,451
Or for that matter,
the user can hit Home.

13
00:00:41,065 --> 00:00:44,521
And launch apps from there,
or they can use the Recent key

14
00:00:44,521 --> 00:00:46,800
or switch to another app
using Notifications.

15
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:50,630
All of these options mean you can end up
with a lot of apps on your backstack.

16
00:00:57,947 --> 00:01:02,440
Now, keep in mind that our resources
on devices are extremely limited.

17
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:06,230
So it's not a good idea to have dozens
of apps sitting idle in the background.

18
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:07,880
Android solves this for us,

19
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:11,320
so you don't have to use
those awful task killer apps.

20
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,010
So, how does it do that?

21
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:16,630
Well, it kills low priority applications
that you haven't used in a while.

22
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,500
We'll go into detail on exactly how
it figures out which app needs to die

23
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:21,630
in lesson six.

24
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:24,040
But for now, it's important to realize

25
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,750
that your app isn't in control
of its own destiny.

26
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:28,732
It can be killed at any time.

27
00:01:32,089 --> 00:01:34,055
So you need to know
how to deal with that.

28
00:01:34,055 --> 00:01:36,916
And that means understanding
the lifecycle of an activity

29
00:01:36,916 --> 00:01:40,100
and the signals we get from the framework
to indicate its progress

30
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,299
through the lifetime.
