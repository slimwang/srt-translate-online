1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,099
Now let's consider
the computational problem at hand.

2
00:00:03,099 --> 00:00:05,619
Given a system of three planes.

3
00:00:05,619 --> 00:00:08,353
Can we determine their
unique intersection point?

4
00:00:08,353 --> 00:00:11,218
As we can see doing just a few steps.

5
00:00:11,218 --> 00:00:14,712
The algebra is going to be a nightmare
if we try to symbolically solve for

6
00:00:14,712 --> 00:00:15,890
the solution.

7
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:20,290
Also, it's not clear how generalized any
formulas we end up with to systems and

8
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:24,080
higher dimensions, which we
eventually like to be able to solve.

9
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,140
Instead, is there some sort of
algorithm we can follow that will

10
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:30,090
always find the solution
to a linear system?

11
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:31,830
In fact, there is.

12
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:36,410
The algorithm we will follow is based
on three operations that we'll apply to

13
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:38,440
the equations in the system.

14
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:41,950
However, before we start trying
to manipulate equations.

15
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:45,430
Let's think about what sort of
manipulations would be valid.

16
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:49,770
Primarily we don't want to do anything
that would change the geometry of

17
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:54,910
the planes represented by the equations,
and therefore change the solutions.

18
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:58,820
Also, we should be able to reverse
the operations we perform.

19
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:02,050
In order to obtain the original
pair of equations.

20
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:05,480
First of all,
it's certainly legal at any time to swap

21
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:08,100
the order of two
equations in the system.

22
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:11,320
Since intersections of planes don't
depend on the order in which we

23
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,080
list them.

24
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,810
This is perfectly fine.

25
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:16,030
We don't change our solution set at all.

26
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:18,650
Also, we can easily undo this operation

27
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:21,970
just by swapping the two equations
back to their original order.

28
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:24,220
What's another type of
operation we could do.

29
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:26,420
Well, if we have an equation and

30
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:29,730
we multiply both sides of
the equation by the same number.

31
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:31,770
Then the equation will stay true.

32
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:34,385
However if we were to
multiply through by zero.

33
00:01:34,385 --> 00:01:36,740
Then the operation would
not be reversible.

34
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:41,360
We would not be able to divide through
by zero to obtain the original equation.

35
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,170
So we need to add a caveat.

36
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:46,990
We can multiply an equation
by any non-zero number.

37
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:49,660
Now, does this operation
preserve the solution?

38
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:50,410
Yes.

39
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:55,300
Multiplying through by a non-zero scalar
just multiplies the normal vector.

40
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:58,360
Whose coordinates are these
coefficients, by a scalar.

41
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,670
So we'll be pointing
in the same direction.

42
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:05,040
Moreover, you can algebraically
verify that any point you select

43
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,880
on the original plane satisfies
the new equation and vice versa.

44
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,660
So the two planes consist
of the same sets of points.

45
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,720
I.e., they're the same.

46
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,750
Also since we specify that alpha
must be a non-zero number.

47
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:23,860
The operation is reversible simply by
multiplying through by one over alpha.

48
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:26,280
Third, if we have two equations.

49
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,980
We can add one equation to the other.

50
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:31,800
Does this operation
preserve the solution set?

51
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,911
Well, suppose we had a point x,

52
00:02:33,911 --> 00:02:37,129
y, z that was in
the intersection of two planes.

53
00:02:37,129 --> 00:02:42,436
In other words the point x, y,
z satisfies both of these equations.

54
00:02:42,436 --> 00:02:46,570
Now suppose we added the first
equation to the second equation.

55
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:48,400
This equation we know to be true,

56
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,490
because it was assumed true
in the previous system.

57
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:55,097
In the new second equation,
this quantity is equal to k one,

58
00:02:55,097 --> 00:02:57,026
because of the first equation.

59
00:02:57,026 --> 00:02:59,192
And this quantity is equal to k two,

60
00:02:59,192 --> 00:03:02,860
because of the second
equation from the old system.

61
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:05,720
Therefore, this new
system is true as well.

62
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:09,220
X, y,
z satisfies both of these equations.

63
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:14,190
Therefore x, y, z is in the first
plane and in the new second plane.

64
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:19,076
Which means that the point x,y,z is in
the new intersection of the two planes.

65
00:03:19,076 --> 00:03:23,729
Since this is true for any point,
x, y, z in the old intersection.

66
00:03:23,729 --> 00:03:27,601
It means that all of the points in
the old intersection are contained in

67
00:03:27,601 --> 00:03:29,520
the new intersection.

68
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:33,390
Also, because we can easily
reverse this operation

69
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:37,420
by subtracting the first equation
from the second in the new system.

70
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:41,360
This means that the new intersection
does not contain any points that weren't

71
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,050
in the old intersection.

72
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:45,370
So the intersections are the same.

73
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:47,450
So the solution is preserved.

74
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:50,040
Now suppose I modified the operation.

75
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:54,630
So that instead of adding just one
times the first equation to the second,

76
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:56,790
I add an arbitrary amount.

77
00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:00,250
Alpha, times the first equation
to the second equation.

78
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:04,490
Notice that the same logic I applied
earlier also holds in this case.

79
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:08,400
So instead of just adding some
equation to another equation.

80
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,270
I can add a multiple of
one equation to another.

81
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:16,420
As I stated earlier, it's easy to
reverse this operation as well.

82
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:20,320
We just need to add negative alpha
times the first equation to the second

83
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,070
equation, to get back
to the original system.
