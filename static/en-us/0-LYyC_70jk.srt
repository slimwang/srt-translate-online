1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:04,660
So, Jones, Tanaka and
Muller are all family names.

2
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:08,620
I got them from a database, of common
family names in different countries.

3
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:11,650
Jones is one of the most common
family names in the U.S. and

4
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:13,420
in England, and Wales.

5
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:16,750
Tanaka is one of the most
common family names in Japan.

6
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:20,188
And Muller, is one of the most common
family names in Germany and Austria.

7
00:00:20,188 --> 00:00:25,150
But Mary J.Washington, isn't a family
name, it's a person's full name.

8
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:27,610
We wouldn't expect to see
a single database column,

9
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:32,619
that held full names for some rows,
and just family names for other rows.

10
00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:35,490
So Mary J.Washington
is the correct answer.

11
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:38,790
So here we've seen that when we think
about pieces of data that might be in

12
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:41,600
a database, we have to think
not only about their type, but

13
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,840
also their meaning,
what they represent in the real world.
