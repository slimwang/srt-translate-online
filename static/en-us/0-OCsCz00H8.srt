1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,550
So Anchor, I was thinking that there
are so many game apps out there already,

2
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:04,790
why would I look for

3
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:08,130
another game to play when there's
already Bejeweled and Fruit Ninja?

4
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:12,340
>> That's a great question, because even
if a new game is a lot of fun to play,

5
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:14,650
it won't necessarily be profitable.

6
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:17,160
And its popularity may fade with time.

7
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,835
Luckily, that's what
this course is about.

8
00:00:19,835 --> 00:00:22,720
We'll talk about three main
topics that'll help your game

9
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,970
keep its players coming back and
help you make money.

10
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:27,640
What are those topics Suzanne?

11
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:30,520
>> Well, the first lesson
will be about engagement.

12
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:33,560
Which is how to design your game so
that people play it often and

13
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,830
stay interested over time.

14
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:38,310
The second lesson will discuss
the different models for

15
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:42,180
monetization, like using ads and
in-app purchases.

16
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:45,530
And our third and last lesson will
be about publishing best practices,

17
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:49,150
like testing your game and
getting your game noticed.

18
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:52,484
>> As you go through this course,
keep in mind that the best and

19
00:00:52,484 --> 00:00:56,421
the easiest way to make your game
profitable is to start thinking about

20
00:00:56,421 --> 00:00:57,969
monetization right away.

21
00:00:57,969 --> 00:01:01,310
As you're building your game,
don't leave it as a last step.
