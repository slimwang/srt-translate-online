1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,550
What choices did you pick David?

2
00:00:01,550 --> 00:00:04,840
>> So there's a few different ways we
can do the mapping between the sun,

3
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:07,740
the planet on the left and the nucleus
and the electron on the right.

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:12,090
If we look only at the top half of each
representation all we can really say

5
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:15,510
is that the sun must map to one of them
and the planet must map to one of them.

6
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:17,550
Because these relationships
are symmetrical,

7
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:21,210
if I don't consider the bottom half
it wouldn't matter which is which.

8
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:23,690
If I look at the bottom half of
the representations however,

9
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:26,848
it tells me which part of the Solar
System must correspond to which part of

10
00:00:26,848 --> 00:00:27,930
the Atomic Structure.

11
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:29,410
The planet revolves around the Sun, and

12
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:31,550
the electron revolves
around the nucleus.

13
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:32,240
So the planet and

14
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:36,050
the electron must correspond because
both are doing the revolving and the Sun

15
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:38,970
and the nucleus must correspond because
they are the centers of the revolution.

16
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:42,540
So, the sun corresponds
to the nucleus and

17
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:45,010
the planet corresponds to the electron.

18
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:46,320
>> This is right, David.

19
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,210
Another thing to take away from here is,
look at the depth of understanding it

20
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:54,760
requires in order to be able to make
the right kind of correspondences.

21
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:58,330
If one did not have the right kind
of model for the solar system and

22
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:01,960
atomic structure that captures
the deep relationships,

23
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:05,930
then the mapping may not be done and
the alignment wouldn't work.

24
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:08,430
And we would not be able to
understand the atomic structure

25
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:10,490
in terms of the solar system.

26
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:16,210
This models deep and rich models of
the two systems, the target problem and

27
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:21,260
the source case are essential to
deciding how to align them, how to map

28
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:24,870
them, and as we will see in a moment,
what to transfer and how to transfer it.
