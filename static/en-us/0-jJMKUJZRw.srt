1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,860
So, to apply policing to Token Buckets,

2
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:06,320
what's often done is to use what's called

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:08,960
a Composite Shaper, which is to combine a

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,890
Token Bucket Shaper with a Leaky Bucket. The

5
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:14,960
combination of the Token Bucket Shaper with

6
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,970
the Leaky Bucket Shaper allows for Good policing,

7
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:21,960
confirming that the flow's data rate does not

8
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:25,500
exceed the average data rate allowed by the

9
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,680
smooth Leaky Bucket is easy. But, the

10
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,600
implementation is more complex since each flow

11
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,650
now requires two counters and two timers.

12
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:36,620
One timer and one counter for each bucket.
