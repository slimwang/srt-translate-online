1
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:03,190
Okay. So now we turn to a big topic

2
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:06,380
when you use Datastore, queries. And we will start

3
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:08,570
by giving you an overview of the types of

4
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:12,150
queries that we will run. Let's do that by looking

5
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:14,600
at Conference Central, where we will build out the

6
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:18,570
show conferences function. In the first tab here, we

7
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:22,580
can see all the conferences. This query is called

8
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:26,020
query by kind, because we will search for all entities

9
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:28,580
that are of the conference kind. In the

10
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:30,930
second tab, we can see all the conferences

11
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:34,560
created by the user. This query is called

12
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:38,160
query by kind, filter by ancestor, because we will

13
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,100
search for all conferences that have the user

14
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,620
as their ancestor. Remember, this is the ancestor

15
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:47,560
relationship we established between the conference, and the

16
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:51,190
profile that created the conference. And finally, in the

17
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:53,610
third tab we will see all conferences the

18
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:56,930
user has registered to attend. This query is

19
00:00:56,930 --> 00:01:00,520
called query by kind filter by property, because

20
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:03,000
we will display all conferences that are in the

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,590
attended conference property of the profile entity. Remember,

22
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:10,140
this is to has a relationship we created

23
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,810
between a profile and the conferences they registered

24
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:16,170
to attend. And one more thing. In this part,

25
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:18,150
you can further restrict the search result by

26
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:21,260
applying filters. And as you can see from the

27
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:23,600
drop down menu, these are properties in the

28
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,950
conference kind. So therefore, these will also be a

29
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:31,780
query by kind, filtered by property. Okay. So

30
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:33,490
these are the query types we will look at

31
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:36,840
now. Query by kind, query by kind filtered by

32
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,360
ancestor, query by kind filtered by property. The query

33
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:46,510
by kind filtered by property, is a little bit advanced stuff. The other ones

34
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:48,230
are pretty straight forward though, so you'll

35
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:50,410
start off by adding them to Conference Central.
