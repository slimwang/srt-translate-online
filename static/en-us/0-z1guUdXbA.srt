That's right Lauren. Cortisol is a hormone produced by the body and it is

2
00:00:03,659 --> 00:00:08,679
important to give us fuel during emotional arousal and stressful events.

3
00:00:08,679 --> 00:00:12,159
However, cortisol is also a part of the immune system functioning and it

4
00:00:12,159 --> 00:00:15,987
decreases the number of immune cells available in the blood stream to fight off

5
00:00:15,987 --> 00:00:21,985
infection. Therefore, when we are stressed we are more likely to get sick. As

6
00:00:21,985 --> 00:00:26,510
an example, when I was getting ready to write this lesson, I became very sick.

7
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:31,146
I got a terrible cold. I was really stressed. I had to write this lesson. I was

8
00:00:31,146 --> 00:00:35,652
behind in my grading. I had theses to review. And on top of it, my poor cat,

9
00:00:35,652 --> 00:00:39,886
Nonsense, was sick. It's no doubt, then, or surprising, why students get sick

10
00:00:39,886 --> 00:00:44,227
around mid-term and finals. The important thing to remember here, is that when

11
00:00:44,227 --> 00:00:47,811
we experience a stressful event, cortisol is released, which decreases our

12
00:00:47,811 --> 00:00:52,570
immune system functioning. Now, we're going to go to Greg, and look at how we

13
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:53,590
handle stress.
