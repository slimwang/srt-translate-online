1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,270
All right? Well, what's the answer?

2
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:07,380
Well, the answer is still six, remember there were six degrees of freedom?

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:14,330
There are, only three angles heading, pitch, and roll.

4
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:16,790
Euler omega, phi, kappa, or whatever.

5
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:22,070
There are, three angles that define that rotation matrix, so

6
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:25,080
that's not nine independent numbers, all right,

7
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:29,900
there's only three angles, and then there are three translational values, and

8
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:33,700
that's why there are still six extrinsic parameters,

9
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:37,810
even though we can use a three by four or sometimes even a four by four.

10
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:42,560
So, we've just basically taken away of turning those six numbers into a matrix

11
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:47,000
form that allows us to apply it to the location of the points in one frame,

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,860
to get the location of the points of another frame.
