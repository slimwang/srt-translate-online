1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,300
So another important thing that you can do with this representation

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:06,520
is recover the joint distribution. Remember a couple, a couple slides ago

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:08,790
we looked at the issue of how can we go from

4
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:11,260
the distrib, joint distribution to specifying

5
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:12,900
what the probabilities are, the conditional

6
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:16,210
probability tables, they're called, at each of these nodes. But we

7
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:18,350
can actually go the other direction as well. We can go from,

8
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:20,940
from the values in these conditional probabilities tables in each of

9
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:23,440
the nodes, to computing the probability

10
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,650
of any combination, any joint combination

11
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:28,610
of variables that we want. So, it turns out it's really, really

12
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:31,270
simple. We can just go and use these same ideas and say

13
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:35,700
the joint probability for some assignment to the variables, is equal to

14
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:40,130
just the product of all the individual values. So the probability that that

15
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:42,950
value of A would be taken times the probability that that value

16
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:45,230
of B would be taken times the probability that that value of

17
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:48,070
C would be taken, conditioned on those are the values that were

18
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:50,540
chosen for A and B. So it's just like in the sampling case.

19
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:50,840
>> Right, and

20
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:53,540
that's much more compact a representation.

21
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:55,550
>> That's a good observation, yeah. So how, if

22
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:58,620
these were Boolean variables, how many values would we

23
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:01,300
need to specify for the joint distribution in the

24
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:05,280
standard representation, where you just assign probability to everything.

25
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,770
>> Well if I ignore the fact that there are some constraints that we might be

26
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:09,220
able to take advantage of, it would be

27
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:11,630
2 to the 5th, because there are five variables.

28
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:13,260
>> Right, but here we've broken it down

29
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:16,770
into smaller chunks so, the probability of A,

30
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:19,420
it's just specified by single number. Probability of B is

31
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:22,500
specified by a single number. Probability of C is specified

32
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,480
for a single number for each combination of A and

33
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:29,190
B. That's four of them. This also requires four values and

34
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:31,730
this requires four values. So this is really, what, it's

35
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:34,937
like 2 to the 5th minus 1 I guess. Because, if

36
00:01:34,937 --> 00:01:38,017
I tell you the first 31 values, the last, the

37
00:01:38,017 --> 00:01:42,640
32th value, it's just 1 minus the sum of the other.

38
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:49,738
This is 14 numbers versus 31. You are right, it is more compact, 31 is bigger.

39
00:01:49,738 --> 00:01:51,370
>> Right but let's imagine that all of the

40
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:55,070
variables were in fact completely independent of one another,

41
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:58,240
then you would have 5, you would only need

42
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:02,440
5 numbers. It would be the product of the unconditionals.

43
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,320
>> Yeah, which is what we'd get if we had kind of like just a

44
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,060
set of weighted coins. If they're unrelated to

45
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:07,960
each other, but each one has some probability

46
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:11,030
of coming up heads, the probability of getting some, some particular

47
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:13,920
combination like, A is heads and B is tails and C

48
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,370
is heads and D is heads and E is heads. We

49
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:18,880
could just break that down to the probability of the individual events.

50
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,310
>> So then all of the, just like with the joint distribution where

51
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:26,090
you have this exponential growth, because you need to know everything. Here you

52
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:28,960
have the exponential growth that only depends upon the number of parents you

53
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:32,910
have. If you have no parents, then it is constant, if you have parents,

54
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:35,480
then is grows exponentially with the number of parents.

55
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,620
>> Right, so the fewer number of parents,

56
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:38,390
the more compact the distribution ends up being.
