00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,170
Now in this course so far, we've seen a ton of different equations involving two

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:09,932
variables. Things for example like y equals 3x plus 2. Now equations in two

3
00:00:09,932 --> 00:00:14,156
variables can express input and output, causing effect or some sort of other

4
00:00:14,156 --> 00:00:18,644
relationship involving dependence. The note seemed like the two variables in the

5
00:00:18,644 --> 00:00:22,730
equation would each play a different role. Perhaps it's that one of these two

6
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:26,764
variables needs to depend on the other. Now just like in this equation right

7
00:00:26,764 --> 00:00:30,860
here, a lot of the other equations we've seen at different parts of the class,

8
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:36,019
have been written in the same form. As y equals some sort of expression

9
00:00:36,019 --> 00:00:40,037
involving x. We saw that we could write quadratics in this form too. And there

10
00:00:40,037 --> 00:00:44,384
were a lot of situations in which isolating y by itself on one side was really

11
00:00:44,384 --> 00:00:48,863
conveinent for solving for different quantites. Now those equations were all

12
00:00:48,863 --> 00:00:52,896
written in the form y equals some expression where x is the variable. And if we

13
00:00:52,896 --> 00:00:56,666
have an equation that's written in this form, which of these three statements

14
00:00:56,666 --> 00:01:01,470
down here do you think is implied? In an equation like this does x depend on y?

15
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:07,369
Does y depend on x? Or, is there no relationship of dependence between x and y?

16
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:11,926
In other words, does one of these two quantities help determine the value of the

17
00:01:11,926 --> 00:01:12,553
other one?
