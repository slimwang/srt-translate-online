00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,381
The reason we reject the null, is because this probability is so low. Let's

2
00:00:04,381 --> 00:00:08,996
pretend that the null hypothesis is true, and there's actually not going to be

3
00:00:08,996 --> 00:00:15,650
a difference between our new population and our current population parameters.

4
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:19,615
If the null hypothesis is true, what's the probability of getting this sample

5
00:00:19,615 --> 00:00:24,600
mean? Rated in terms of a proportion. This is just what you did in lesson

6
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,654
seven. You calculated where the sample mean falls on this distribution of

7
00:00:28,654 --> 00:00:32,250
sample means, and then you used the Z table to find the probability greater

8
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:34,673
than that value.
