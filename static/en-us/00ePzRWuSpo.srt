1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The answer is this is a chance node so we take the average of 0 and 16.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
That's no longer 2. It becomes 8.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
We take the average of 9 and 4. That's no longer 2.5. It becomes 6.5.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Notice what's happened now is Max now chooses 8 over 6.5.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
and now the rational action has shifted from B to A. What's gone on here?

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
We notice that just by making a change to the evaluation function,

7
00:00:32,000 --> 99:59:59,999
we changed the rational action.
