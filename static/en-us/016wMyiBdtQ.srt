1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:03,241
>> How does this sort of work into the design process? I mean, I've heard of

2
00:00:03,241 --> 00:00:06,633
this thing rapid prototyping, how does that, what's that all mean as far as 3D

3
00:00:06,633 --> 00:00:11,619
printing. >> The real hindrance with 3D printing right now is scale. It's very

4
00:00:11,619 --> 00:00:15,458
cost prohibitive to print things like that are very large and scale. We have a

5
00:00:15,458 --> 00:00:19,242
motor cycle in the gallery. But, that's pretty big print and it took a lot of

6
00:00:19,242 --> 00:00:23,932
time and so there's this other idea out there called rapid prototyping and there

7
00:00:23,932 --> 00:00:28,692
you see products like one, two, three make things that take very large objects

8
00:00:28,692 --> 00:00:32,968
like this elephant. Or last year refer maker fair we did a 12 foot tall trojan

9
00:00:32,968 --> 00:00:37,105
horse out of cardboard. >> And it takes those big elements and it takes them out

10
00:00:37,105 --> 00:00:40,948
into folded panels or it takes them like as you can see in the octopus in the

11
00:00:40,948 --> 00:00:45,102
background into sliced cardboard cutouts. So we can use something like a laser

12
00:00:45,102 --> 00:00:48,475
cutter to make things very larger very quickly. >> So it's just a matter of

13
00:00:48,475 --> 00:00:52,105
time, so right, I usually think of three D printing because, since you're doing

14
00:00:52,105 --> 00:00:54,882
layer by layer by layer, that can take a while. >> Yeah. >> The higher

15
00:00:54,882 --> 00:00:57,570
resolution you have, I would think the more layers you have to put down. >> Yeah

16
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:02,260
its a really interesting time too because the high end 3D printers are extremely

17
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:06,675
high res and very slow [laugh] and very high cost. In the consumer grade

18
00:01:06,675 --> 00:01:11,436
printers, things like a maker bot or a typing machine they're extremely low res

19
00:01:11,436 --> 00:01:15,852
and very fast [laugh] but their cost is kind of going up and the high res stuff,

20
00:01:15,852 --> 00:01:20,199
the cost is kind of going down so I think the next couple of years, we're going

21
00:01:20,199 --> 00:01:24,495
to see a meet in the middle. And you're going to end up with this great device

22
00:01:24,495 --> 00:01:28,464
that almost anybody can use and give you know, a print that is very usable for

23
00:01:28,464 --> 00:01:29,423
multiple things.
