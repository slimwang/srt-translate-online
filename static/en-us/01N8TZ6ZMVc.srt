1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:03,120
As for the core data question.

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,760
I think this was the weakest
point of this candidate.

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:12,540
I'm not sure if he has a lot
of experience with core data.

4
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:16,680
But again, this is a specific framework.

5
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:17,890
It is very common.

6
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:19,409
Many applications use it.

7
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:26,800
But I wouldn't discard him on this one.

8
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,660
Not at all,
because you can always learn this.

9
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:34,890
There was this, where he answered
about a different part of core data,

10
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:35,750
than what I asked.

11
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,120
Might have been a clever strategy or
maybe a misunderstanding.

12
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:45,740
So, perhaps I would ask more
questions about core data,

13
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:49,740
if the project that we were
going to work in, use core data.

14
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:51,750
But otherwise, that would be fine.
