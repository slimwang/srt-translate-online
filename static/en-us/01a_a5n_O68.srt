1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:01,760
So here's a proposal.

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:06,250
I'm going to give a point every time the
learner answers a question correctly.

3
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:07,160
>> That makes a lot of sense.

4
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:09,910
>> That means a lot of sense, so you
basically get credit for being right.

5
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:10,683
>> The learner gets credit.

6
00:00:10,683 --> 00:00:12,340
>> The learner gets credit for
being right.

7
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:12,910
>> Okay.

8
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:18,160
>> I'm also going to give + 1 to the
teacher, and for the teacher, I'm also

9
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:23,070
going to give them credit plus one every
time the learner answers correctly.

10
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:25,630
>> Good, so
their incentives are aligned.

11
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:27,170
>> Yes, their incentives are aligned.

12
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:30,866
The learner gets credit for
demonstrating they've learned, and

13
00:00:30,866 --> 00:00:32,384
the teacher gets credit for

14
00:00:32,384 --> 00:00:35,029
demonstrating they
the least know something.

15
00:00:35,029 --> 00:00:36,980
So, what do you think is
going to happen here?

16
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:39,270
>> That learner's happy
getting answers right, and

17
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:41,890
the teacher is happy when
the learner gets answers right.

18
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:45,192
So they should work
together to maximize,

19
00:00:45,192 --> 00:00:49,880
I guess not necessarily learning,
but ask easy questions.

20
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:53,500
If you ask easy questions, then
the learner wins and the teacher wins.

21
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,030
>> That's exactly right, I think.

22
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:56,230
So hopefully it makes sense.

23
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:59,840
So if let's say this question or
questions way down here are so

24
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,570
easy that anybody can get them right.

25
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:05,349
Then if I ask questions down here,
the learner will get them right.

26
00:01:05,349 --> 00:01:06,680
So it's good for the learner, but

27
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:10,690
also because the learner will get them
right that's good for the teacher.

28
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:13,620
>> Right, but that doesn't seem to
really make sense for this problem,

29
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:17,130
in that we really want to
be asking questions

30
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:19,470
roughly at the level
where the learner is.

31
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:20,564
>> Well, that makes sense.

32
00:01:20,564 --> 00:01:22,160
But let me ask you one other quick,
before we get there,

33
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:24,840
let me ask you one other possibility.

34
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,240
Since this doesn't give us what we want,
right,

35
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,110
basically this says always
stick to easy questions.

36
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:33,520
>> Right.
>> And we'll both do well.

37
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,860
What happens if I say okay well
the problem here is I've incentivized

38
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:38,620
the learner in a way that
kind of makes sense, right,

39
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:41,360
learner wants to get a correct
answer to good questions, right.

40
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,850
But I've incentivized the teacher
to go easy on the student.

41
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:44,850
So why don't I make it so

42
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:48,900
that the teacher loses a point every
time the student gets something right.

43
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:51,180
>> So now,

44
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:55,590
the teacher is not incentivized
just to give easy questions.

45
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:56,500
What's going to happen here?

46
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,920
>> Well, part of me feels like that now,

47
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,730
it just seems like that the right
thing for the teacher to do then,

48
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:03,870
from the teacher's perspective,
is give hard questions.

49
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:05,300
The learner should try to answer them,

50
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:06,610
but learner's not going to
be able to answer.

51
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:08,630
>> Right, so what I should do is just
immediately go to all the really,

52
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:10,910
really hard questions about dinosaurs.

53
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:12,510
You can answer them.

54
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:16,420
You don't have the background and
the sort of fundamental math and

55
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:18,510
calculus to answer
the questions about dinosaurs.

56
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:20,410
And so you're going to keep
getting them wrong, but

57
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:22,690
the teacher is going to do just fine.

58
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:25,710
And in fact, not only will the teacher
lose a point every time the learner

59
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:26,630
answers something correctly.

60
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:29,930
Let's say actually,
the teacher gets a point every time

61
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:33,360
the learner answers incorrectly,
which is sort of the same thing.

62
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,960
>> Yeah.
>> But allows me to say

63
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,930
the teacher racks up points-
>> Yes.

64
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:38,820
>> By making you do
things that are wrong.

65
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:39,570
Okay?

66
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:42,520
So this is just kind of broken, right?

67
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:46,930
The kind of obvious thing to do here
where I'm going to give the student

68
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:50,440
credit for demonstrating thing,
demonstrating they've learned things,

69
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,760
they have knowledge.

70
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,430
And give the teacher credit for
either demonstrating that

71
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:59,330
the student has knowledge or doesn't
have knowledge, gives me bad answers,

72
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:01,840
and in particular, doesn't help
me with the goal of learning.

73
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,710
It doesn't help the student and
it doesn't help the teacher.

74
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:06,650
It just gives them whatever credit
they're supposed to get when they can

75
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:07,610
bother to get it.

76
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:10,470
>> So ok, if the teacher getting + 1 for

77
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:14,100
the learner getting something correctly
ended up making things too easy, and

78
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:17,770
a minus 1 made things too hard,
then right in the middle is a zero.

79
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:21,460
So what about the teacher get zero for
learner answering correctly.

80
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,286
>> Well, the teacher get zero for
the learner answering correctly,

81
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:24,980
then it doesn't matter
what the teacher does.

82
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:26,630
>> So, maybe the teacher
can do the right thing now.

83
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:27,460
>> But why?

84
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:30,600
It's just like the coco example you've
given before, what reason do I have.

85
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:34,500
And we certainly don't want this
to be the teachers high payment.

86
00:03:36,505 --> 00:03:37,005
>> [LAUGH]
>> Although.

87
00:03:37,005 --> 00:03:38,300
>> Would that work in this case?

88
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,970
No, because now that the learner would
want to get to maximize the side

89
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:43,410
payments, then we're back to
the original problem that you said.

90
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:47,570
Which is, if the teachers paid off for
the learner giving correct answers,

91
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:51,690
then the questions are just going to
end up being too easy to be meaningful.

92
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:52,490
>> That's right.

93
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:56,330
And there's really no side payment for
the teacher to give the student.

94
00:03:56,330 --> 00:03:58,400
But you said something
earlier that I really like.

95
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,830
You said, what did you say,
you said something,

96
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:03,910
before he went down this path of the
minus one and getting hard questions,

97
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:07,300
you said something about what
the teacher ought to be doing.

98
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:10,110
>> The teacher ought to be asking
questions, I don't know, so

99
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:12,860
that the learners kind of
getting half of them right.

100
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:15,020
>> So I like that, so
let's sort of take a step back and

101
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:16,220
kind of see what that
would sort of mean.
