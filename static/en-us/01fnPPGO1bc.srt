1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:01,730
What did you get, David?

2
00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:05,440
>> So like before, because this is
an or, as soon as we see that A is true,

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:08,189
we can go ahead and
write down true for all of these.

4
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:11,090
When A is false,
we just need to evaluate B or C.

5
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:13,490
When B is true,
we know it's already true.

6
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:15,490
And then if B is false
we need to look at C.

7
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:18,210
If C is true, then it's still true,
and if C is false,

8
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:20,480
then all three are false and
that's the only time it's false.

9
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,500
Over here,
we've moved the parentheses but really,

10
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,050
we're not changing what we do.

11
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:27,860
We can think of it as stating
at the bottom with C being true.

12
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:29,910
Anytime C is true,
the entire thing is true.

13
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:33,600
So C is true here, here, here, and here.

14
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,870
If that evaluates to false,
we need to look at A or B, and so on.

15
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:39,050
So we end up doing
the exact same process.

16
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:39,807
>> That's good, David.

17
00:00:39,807 --> 00:00:42,496
And this property is called
the associative property.

18
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:46,614
The associative property
simply says that we can change

19
00:00:46,614 --> 00:00:51,255
the location of the parentheses here,
A or parentheses B or C,

20
00:00:51,255 --> 00:00:56,526
parenthesis close, has the same value
as A or B parenthesis close or C.

21
00:00:56,526 --> 00:00:59,330
So that we can change
the location of the parentheses.

22
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:01,410
The same would have been true
if these were both conjunctions.

23
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:06,355
So if it was A conjunction
parentheses B conjunction C or

24
00:01:06,355 --> 00:01:13,120
A conjunction B, conjunction C,
it would have had the same values.

25
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,790
>> The difference between
these formulas and

26
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:19,040
the ones we were doing before
are the values of these operators.

27
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,996
Associative property works when
it's both ors or both ands.

28
00:01:23,996 --> 00:01:27,280
Distributive property worked when
there was a mixture of operators.
