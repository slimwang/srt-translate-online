00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:04,989
Personality traits are dispositions to behave in a particular over time. So,

2
00:00:04,989 --> 00:00:10,888
traits are connected directly to the disposition to behave. Let's look in an

3
00:00:10,888 --> 00:00:18,690
example. Here we see Miriam and Biriam. Miriam is usually very friendly. Watch.

4
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:22,087
See, someone cut her in the lunch line and she was nice about it. She holds the

5
00:00:22,087 --> 00:00:25,831
door for people when they're walking in. Someone even hits her car when they

6
00:00:25,831 --> 00:00:30,697
weren't paying attention. She was less nice to the person in this situation,

7
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:36,344
but tried to be understanding. Someone gave her a million dollars and she was

8
00:00:36,344 --> 00:00:41,410
extra nice to them. Now let's go to Biriam, who's usually not very friendly.

9
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:45,254
Somebody cut him in line and he rudely makes them know how wrong they were to

10
00:00:45,254 --> 00:00:50,621
cut him. Someone's walking up and he doesn't hold the door for them. Someone

11
00:00:50,621 --> 00:00:54,013
hits his car when they weren't paying attention and he's really, really rude

12
00:00:54,013 --> 00:00:59,351
about it. Someone gives him a million dollars and then we see him be kind of

13
00:00:59,351 --> 00:01:01,989
nice to that person.
