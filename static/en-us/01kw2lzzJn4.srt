1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,020
We have our basic response status line,
and

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:08,410
just like the request, the status line
is followed by a number of headers.

3
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:09,900
I'll give you a few examples.

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:13,800
Here are some headers that are commonly
included with HTTP responses.

5
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:16,760
Now, just like the client request,

6
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:19,980
the headers that you see
aren't always the same.

7
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:22,150
Some of them are required.

8
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:25,280
And when I say required,
I mean usually there.

9
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:29,320
But the web has evolved organically
over time, so many of the headers that

10
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:34,400
are required are often not there,
or things will work without them.

11
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,840
But anyway, okay.

12
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,820
So Date is there all the time,
that's when the request happened.

13
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,220
No surprise there.

14
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:44,220
Server, this is similar to
the User Agent header on the request.

15
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:46,070
This is the, generally the name and

16
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:49,540
version number of the server
that's handling the response.

17
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:53,100
Now, personally,
I try to never include this.

18
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,040
Or if I do include it,
I make something up.

19
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:58,970
Because otherwise,
you're just giving free information to

20
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:03,890
a would-be hacker who wants to know
what vulnerabilities work against you.

21
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:06,640
Content- Type, very popular.

22
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,800
This is the type of document
that's being returned, this is so

23
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,442
your browser knows how to display it.

24
00:01:11,442 --> 00:01:15,042
So text/html is a common one, obviously.

25
00:01:15,042 --> 00:01:16,490
That's what an HTML page would be.

26
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:24,430
You could see image/png, or image/gif
if it's an image, that sort of thing.

27
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:27,320
Your Content- Length is how long
the document that follows is.

28
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:30,350
Content- Length is often included but

29
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:33,920
it's not strictly required because
the browser will know when that

30
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,480
document's done receiving data
because the connection may close.

31
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:41,290
There's other ways of also telling the
browser that I'm done sending data, but

32
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:43,150
it's not super relevant
right this second.
