1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
And the answer would be this box over here

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
and this box over here, nothing else.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
This guy has clearly 4 positive nearest neighbors,

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
so no matter what the 5th one is we stay positive.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Similarly, this guy over here,

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
when you draw a circle,

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
has probably these 4 guys as nearest neighbors,

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
perhaps this one as well, but it is a little further away.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
With those 4 ones, it already has 3 pluses,

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
so whatever the 5th one is it can't overturn, it must be positive.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
All of these are negative, even this one over here has just 2 pluses as neighbors

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
that are positive, and those guys over here are all negative.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Similarly, over here there are possibly 2 pluses

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
in the 5 nearest neighbors,

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
but these guys over here are all negative, and this guy is

16
00:00:46,000 --> 99:59:59,999
surrounded by negative examples, so they will just be negative.
