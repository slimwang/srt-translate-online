1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,230
In order to get the most
out of this course,

2
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:04,830
you should have a good grasp
of Python programming.

3
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:08,610
If you are comfortable making and
using functions, classes,

4
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:12,920
dictionaries and understand the basics
of properties, decorators and

5
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:16,710
lambda functions,
you're in good shape for this course.

6
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:17,330
A few links for

7
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:20,640
brushing up on these topics
are available in the instructor notes.

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,190
We will be using the Flask
web development framework.

9
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:25,860
And SQLAlchemy extensively
in this course.

10
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,960
If you're not familiar with the basics
of Flask, please check out the official

11
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,380
Flask documentation or
Udacity's full stack Foundations course.

12
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:36,490
Links to both of these can also
be found in the instructor notes.

13
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:39,390
An understanding of OAuth 2
flows will also be very helpful

14
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:41,910
when it comes to securing our web API.

15
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:46,130
I highly recommend completing Udacity's
authentication authorization course, or

16
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:49,400
reading through some of Google's Oauth
2 documentation before attempting this

17
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,020
portion of the course.

18
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:54,430
I highly recommend using a Vagrant
environment for this course.

19
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:57,260
Vagrant will allow you to work in a
virtual machine with a shared folder you

20
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:59,360
can access on your host computer.

21
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:02,280
This way, if anything accidentally
gets messed up in the vagrant machine,

22
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,379
it won't affect your host machine.

23
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:06,505
A link to downloading and
installing a Vagrant machine,

24
00:01:06,505 --> 00:01:08,600
pre-installed with all
the necessary libraries for

25
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,440
this course, can also be found
in the instructor notes.

26
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:14,380
We will be delving into the Google and
FourSquare documentation, and

27
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:16,970
playing with their APIs
later in this course.

28
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:19,480
You will need developer accounts for
both of these applications,

29
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,840
which can be created free of charge.

30
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:24,740
Links for creating these accounts,
if you do not previously have them,

31
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:26,200
can be found in
the instructor notes as well.
