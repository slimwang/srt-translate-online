1
00:00:00,126 --> 00:00:02,041
Let's see another way to use memcache.

2
00:00:02,041 --> 00:00:05,380
You don't have to set anything
up to get ndb to use memcache,

3
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:09,583
but you can also use the memcache API
directly and save custom strings to it.

4
00:00:09,583 --> 00:00:11,640
So we're going to use memcache for
saving and

5
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:14,792
getting announcements about
conferences that are nearly sold out.

6
00:00:14,792 --> 00:00:18,906
You can imagine, for example, that your
web application might display a banner

7
00:00:18,906 --> 00:00:22,250
ad to encourage people for
conferences that are nearly sold out.

8
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:25,667
There might be other things you would
want to announce on your website too.

9
00:00:25,667 --> 00:00:28,860
Maybe if you get a special speaker for
a particular conference or

10
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:30,583
to announce a special promotion.

11
00:00:30,583 --> 00:00:33,746
For the sake of simplicity, we're just
going to create announcements about

12
00:00:33,746 --> 00:00:35,353
conferences that are nearly sold out,

13
00:00:35,353 --> 00:00:37,750
because the goal here is just
to learn how to use memcache.

14
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:40,960
But announcements are a good example of
the kind of thing you might want to save

15
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,130
in memcache without saving
them to the datastore.

16
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:46,833
If an announcement gets evicted from
memcache, there's no loss of real data.

17
00:00:46,833 --> 00:00:50,167
And it doesn't really matter,
no business transactions are affected.

18
00:00:50,167 --> 00:00:52,292
No one loses their
place at a conference.

19
00:00:52,292 --> 00:00:55,250
And the next announcement will
likely come along soon, anyway.

20
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:58,385
Announcements are very transient and
they don't need to be saved for

21
00:00:58,385 --> 00:00:59,583
long-term or backed up.

22
00:00:59,583 --> 00:01:02,847
So they're perfect candidates to be
saved in memcache and only in Memcache,

23
00:01:02,847 --> 00:01:04,417
they don't need to go in datastore.

24
00:01:04,417 --> 00:01:07,467
That way you get all your announcements
without using any datastore quota.
