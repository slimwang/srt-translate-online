00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
This is a long unit, and I know things are definitely getting tougher.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,221
If you are having trouble I hope you will take advantage of the course forum,

3
00:00:06,221 --> 00:00:08,611
there is lots of great discussions there with other students in the class,

4
00:00:08,611 --> 00:00:10,073
as well as the course staff.

5
00:00:10,073 --> 00:00:11,610
I want to make sure everyone sticks with the class,

6
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:14,693
so we asked Sergey Brin to explain why you should do that.

7
00:00:15,304 --> 00:00:18,196
[Sergey Brin - Co-founder, Google] [S. Thrun speaking] So will you entice students

8
00:00:18,196 --> 00:00:20,781
to stick with the class and computers? [both chuckle]

9
00:00:20,781 --> 00:00:25,612
I certainly recommend that you continue with the class

10
00:00:25,612 --> 00:00:28,521
and go all the way through it to completion

11
00:00:28,521 --> 00:00:36,199
to really make sure that you get a deep first cut at computer science and at programming.
