00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,513
For a tilted cylinder we were able to look at and think about what axis to

2
00:00:03,513 --> 00:00:07,061
rotate around. However we usually won't be able to do this. If I gave you two

3
00:00:07,061 --> 00:00:10,850
arbitrary vectors and said quick what's the axis of rotation? Best of luck to

4
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:14,291
you, I sure couldn't do it. Happily there's an easy way to get the axis of

5
00:00:14,291 --> 00:00:18,056
rotation and it's called the cross product. In three.js you call it like this,

6
00:00:18,056 --> 00:00:22,088
it takes two vectors as its inputs, and the result is put into the vector three

7
00:00:22,088 --> 00:00:26,285
itself. The third vector is in fact the axis of rotation or at least one of

8
00:00:26,285 --> 00:00:29,605
them. The direction is determined by the right hand rule. You wrap your hand

9
00:00:29,605 --> 00:00:33,509
from the first vector, in this case the cylinder to the second vector, in this

10
00:00:33,509 --> 00:00:37,365
case the y axis. This then points along the axis of rotation. If we computed the

11
00:00:37,365 --> 00:00:41,141
cross product of these two vectors in the opposite order we would go from the y

12
00:00:41,141 --> 00:00:45,010
axis to the cylinders vector. And we would get the opposite rotation axis.

13
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:48,650
Recall how the dot product gives us the cosine between two vectors, the length

14
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:52,122
of the cross product result is in fact proportional to the sine of the angle

15
00:00:52,122 --> 00:00:55,656
between the two vectors. There is one special case I'm going to point out and

16
00:00:55,656 --> 00:00:58,824
its kind of a headache. If the cross product gives back a vector that is of

17
00:00:58,824 --> 00:01:01,944
length 0 or nearly so then the two vectors are either pointing in the same

18
00:01:01,944 --> 00:01:05,503
direction or in directly opposite directions. You can use the dot product of the

19
00:01:05,503 --> 00:01:08,675
two vectors to figure out which, if they point in the same direction, then

20
00:01:08,675 --> 00:01:12,516
you're done. You don't need to rotate at all. If they point in exactly opposite

21
00:01:12,516 --> 00:01:16,954
directions, then you need to rotate 180 degrees. However, the rotation axis

22
00:01:16,954 --> 00:01:21,553
you'll get back from the cross product is actually 0,0,0, which is no axis at

23
00:01:21,553 --> 00:01:24,870
all. At this point, you basically need to choose some arbitrary axis that is

24
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:27,920
perpendicular to your vectors and use that for rotation, or just form the

25
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,047
rotation matrix directly. Here for example I use the x axis since I know y is

26
00:01:32,047 --> 00:01:35,528
going to be perpendicular to it. See the additional course materials on a good

27
00:01:35,528 --> 00:01:39,282
way to solve this problem in general. The mathematical notation for a cross

28
00:01:39,282 --> 00:01:43,395
product is this, a big X. The length of the vector produced by the cross product

29
00:01:43,395 --> 00:01:47,171
is equal to the sign of theta, that's the angle between the two vectors, times

30
00:01:47,171 --> 00:01:51,450
the length of A. Times the length of B. The cross product itself is computed by

31
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:56,017
multiplying neighboring elements of the two vectors' coordinates. For the x

32
00:01:56,017 --> 00:02:01,794
coordinate, we multiply Ay times Bz and then subtract Az times By. For the y

33
00:02:01,794 --> 00:02:07,536
coordinate we multiply Az times Bz minus Ax times Bz. I like to do this kind of

34
00:02:07,536 --> 00:02:11,636
x cross thing here as we did before. So I tend to take this and wrap it around

35
00:02:11,636 --> 00:02:18,116
to this side. So it's Az times Bx, and Ax times Bz. For the last coordinate we

36
00:02:18,116 --> 00:02:23,104
do the same thing, Ax times By minus Ay times Bx. At the end we have a vector

37
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:26,594
that describes the axis of rotation from one vector to the other. And in fact

38
00:02:26,594 --> 00:02:30,728
this vector will be perpendicular to both of these two. Oh, and one more thing.

39
00:02:30,729 --> 00:02:33,754
If you want to use this vector later you probably going to want to normalize it,

40
00:02:33,754 --> 00:02:35,509
because its length will be pretty obscure.
