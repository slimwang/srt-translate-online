1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
to understand the solution, it's useful to draw the exponential function.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
e⁰ is 1 and then it goes up exponentially to really large numbers.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
If you've ever heard Ray Kurzweil talk about the future of society,

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
you've seen these curves--everything goes up exponentially.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Everything is just exponential.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
And further, if you go back in time to negative values,

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
this thing slowly drifts down to 0.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Of course, that's not very exciting, so we never talk about exponential in the negative space.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
However, it turns out that all the arguments of the exponential are at best 0

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
and otherwise are negative, because the exponential is monotonic--

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
that is the larger its argument, the larger its exponential value.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
It ought to be optimized where this thing over here is the largest,

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
and where is that the case?

14
00:00:46,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Well, it's exactly where µ hits 0.
