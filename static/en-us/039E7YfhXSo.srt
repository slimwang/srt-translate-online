1
00:00:00,456 --> 00:00:05,050
I came up with between seven to
ten classes, including the paddle,

2
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:09,560
the ball, the score display, the
dividing line, the field of play itself.

3
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:13,330
And anywhere from like
20 to like 100 methods.

4
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:16,980
Again, the point of this
exercise is just to show you that

5
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:19,830
even a pretty simple game
involves a lot of code.
