00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,914
So if you're really thinking like a Pythonista, I think you'll be able to answer

2
00:00:03,914 --> 00:00:07,448
this quiz even though I haven't explained it yet. So, what do you think a

3
00:00:07,448 --> 00:00:11,936
ValueError is, as was raised in this example? So, here are the choices, it could

4
00:00:11,936 --> 00:00:17,100
be something really special, unlike anything we've seen before in Python. It

5
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:21,394
could be a str that describes an error. It could be an object that is an

6
00:00:21,394 --> 00:00:26,343
instance of the Exception type. It could be an object that is an instance of the

7
00:00:26,343 --> 00:00:31,333
IOError type. It could be an object that is an instance of the ValueError type.

8
00:00:31,333 --> 00:00:35,563
And I'll tell you the hint that exactly two of these are correct.
