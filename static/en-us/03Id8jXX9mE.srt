00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:02,890
David, how did you fill up these boxes?

2
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:05,220
>> So
there are three possible moves here.

3
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:07,840
A on the table, A on D, or D on A.

4
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:11,879
So up top I have A on D, moving A to D.

5
00:00:11,879 --> 00:00:16,700
In the middle I have moving D up to A,
and on the bottom I have A on the table.

6
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:17,700
>> That looks right, David.
