1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,140
So what's a different representation?

2
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:04,770
Well it's nothing more
recent newer approach,

3
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:07,090
it's what's referred to as point clouds.

4
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:09,360
And point clouds are essentially,

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:14,210
you take all of your depth
pixels that you hit.

6
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:17,920
And you say, aha that's a little,
we used to use the word voxel,

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,170
that's a little voxel of stuff.

8
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:23,110
And I'm just going to hang
it out there in space and so

9
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:27,100
I would get this constellation
of points that's just a cloud.

10
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:30,110
Okay, now I actually can't
see inside surfaces, so

11
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:32,970
it's maybe a cloud that I
can only see the outside of.

12
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:36,900
But if I had like another camera and
I knew how those cameras were related.

13
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:42,240
I could take the points that it saw and
stick them out in the same cloud area.

14
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:45,820
And eventually, I would have this
big point cloud of depth points and

15
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:50,170
it would be a lot easier to reason
about the geometry of those.

16
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:50,680
Now of course,

17
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:54,640
when we do this that point cloud sort of
doesn't know how it got created, right?

18
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,920
So did I look at it from here or
did I look at it from there?

19
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:00,690
So, I don't have that free
space information anymore.

20
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:06,270
So point clouds of course,
have their advantages and disadvantages.

21
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:08,860
The biggest one is probably that
it's viewpoint independent, right?

22
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:12,040
So, because it's viewpoint independent,
I can

23
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:17,170
merge different point clouds as long as
they're in the same coordinate system.

24
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:20,670
And I can actually reason
more about the geometry.

25
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:23,770
The disadvantages include,
so for example it's not,

26
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:25,090
it might not be very dense, right?

27
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:26,720
And in depth image,
I've got depth everywhere.

28
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,110
Point clouds,
whatever points I got, I got.

29
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:31,230
And if I want to know what's
the depth going this way,

30
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:35,130
I might not know the answer,
I just know about these set of points.

31
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:40,720
And so fundamentally, you've also
lost this free space stuff, okay?

32
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,860
Because you don't know how we,
so I have a point right here,

33
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:46,690
I don't know if it was viewed
from this way or from this way.

34
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:51,410
If it was viewed this way, I know that
all these pixels along this ray are free

35
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:56,110
from here to over there, I don't have
that representation in point clouds.

36
00:01:56,110 --> 00:02:02,080
The other thing is as I get
further away essentially my cloud,

37
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:06,520
each individual pixel that I see is
taking up a bigger and bigger voxel.

38
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:10,810
So the point cloud density, sorry,
the point cloud resolution, you know,

39
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:13,830
how big is a point cloud, point.

40
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:17,730
The resolution is determined by
how far way from the depth sensor

41
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:21,145
I observe that point, so
nearby ones are tight little points,

42
00:02:21,145 --> 00:02:24,940
further back, they're bigger voxels.

43
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:27,900
But I didn't tell you yet
about the biggest advantage,

44
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:33,840
the biggest advantage about point
clouds is the point cloud library.

45
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,790
There's all this code out there and
it continues to grow, called PCL for

46
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:39,850
the manipulation of point clouds.

47
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:43,210
And so, that's code you don't
have to write, all right?

48
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:46,050
So, it allows you to operate on depth,
just not worrying about

49
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:49,060
the details of the bookkeeping
about these depth representations.

50
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:51,570
So that's, that's really a huge element.

51
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:55,310
And one might even say if it wasn't for
the PCL, the Point Cloud Library,

52
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:59,730
point clouds would not be
nearly as popular as they are.

53
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:03,075
Eh, here's a, [COUGH] here's
a pointer to, what's the website?

54
00:03:03,075 --> 00:03:05,410
Pointclouds.org, all right?

55
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:06,665
Which tells you something, right?

56
00:03:06,665 --> 00:03:09,160
.org, this is open source.

57
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:12,010
So it continues to, to grow,
and continues to improve.
