1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So, wow, you now understand a lot.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
You understand the variance which is the spread of the data squared.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
You understand standard deviation which is the same without the square,

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
and the other way to compute all of those in a single pass to the data

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
using only these running counters.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Let's try it profound. You're really deep into statistics now.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
So, let me ask you two tricky questions.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
This is a secret, please don't tell anybody, but I'm actually considering, at least hypothetically,

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
to give everybody a raise, and we're lucky to ask is what the effect of the raise is

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
on the mean and standard deviation of the distribution of salaries in the company.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm considering two types of raises, a fixed amount of $1000

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
and what's called of relative raise of 20%.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Now, that changes the mean and/or the standard deviation to potentially different values

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
they call µ’ and σ’ and the changes either multiplicative,

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
which would be the factor over here, or additive.

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
If there is no multiplicative change, just put one over here.

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Can you guess what the effect is of adding $1000 to your salary

18
00:01:12,000 --> 99:59:59,999
on the mean and the standard deviation?
