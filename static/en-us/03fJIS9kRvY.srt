1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:01,230
As I mentioned before,

2
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:04,375
the timeline you're working on
is specific to your Cohort.

3
00:00:04,375 --> 00:00:07,290
We've talked already about what a big
commitment Nanodegrees are, and

4
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:08,250
we designed the timeline for

5
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:11,010
this Nanodegree with a commitment
of ten hours a week in mind.

6
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:15,060
Now you're going to find out what your
timeline is in just a second, and please

7
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:18,040
note the dates listed are the dates by
which you need to submit your projects.

8
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:20,860
Now, that doesn't mean you have
to have met specifications for

9
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:23,180
each of those projects
by the dates listed.

10
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:25,700
It just means that you need to have
put your best effort forward for

11
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:26,890
each of those projects.

12
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:30,160
And be in a good place to finish
them up, if you haven't already.

13
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,920
Remember though,
by the time you graduate,

14
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,580
you'll need to have met specifications
for each of these projects.
