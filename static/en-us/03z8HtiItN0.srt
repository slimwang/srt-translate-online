00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,460
It turns out that this answer would be negative 6. Let's see why. You might

2
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:08,140
have thought to multiply these together to get the square root of positive 36

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:12,999
which equals 6. But we know that's not true since 6 is a real number and these

4
00:00:12,999 --> 00:00:17,458
two are imaginary numbers. The product rule does not hold for imaginary

5
00:00:17,458 --> 00:00:22,404
numbers. It only holds for real numbers. This was our product rule, and before

6
00:00:22,404 --> 00:00:26,116
X and Y had to be greater than zero, that was so that we would leave these

7
00:00:26,116 --> 00:00:32,600
radicals for real numbers rather than real numbers. instead of multiplying

8
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,544
these radicans together, let's simplify each one by using our imaginary number

9
00:00:35,544 --> 00:00:42,300
I. So we'll have 2 I here and 3 I for here. Multiplying, we will get 6 I

10
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:47,864
squared... We can replace this i squared with its corresponding value negative

11
00:00:47,864 --> 00:00:53,364
1. We substitute that in to get times negative 1 which equals negative 6, our

12
00:00:53,364 --> 00:00:54,993
answer.
