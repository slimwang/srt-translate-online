00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,562
We already said that the value of X that makes the denominator equal to 0, which

2
00:00:04,562 --> 00:00:08,832
is the first way that we can find a critical number was 4, so that will be one

3
00:00:08,832 --> 00:00:13,299
of them. The other way we can look for critical numbers is to set the numerator

4
00:00:13,299 --> 00:00:17,531
equal to 0 and solve for X. So if we set 2 X minus 18 equal to 0 we end up with

5
00:00:17,531 --> 00:00:19,903
X equals 9. So that must be our other one.
