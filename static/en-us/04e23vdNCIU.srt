00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,260
You've learned that the API's explorer lets you

2
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:05,070
try out the API that your application exposes through

3
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:08,100
endpoints. Google uses the API's explorer in the

4
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:10,590
same way, to let you investigate the API that

5
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:13,050
are publicly available for the service that it

6
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:18,480
provides. For example let's consider Google's translation service. You

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,580
can go to translate.google.com to translate text from

8
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:25,270
one language to another, right in the browser. Hm,

9
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:30,470
wonder what lemon cake is in Spanish? Pastel de limon. I wonder if I said that

10
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:32,580
right? You can use the browser like this

11
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:35,930
to do translations. But you can also write applications

12
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:39,450
that do translations, using the translate API. You

13
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:42,180
can try out the translate API using the

14
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:45,580
APIs explorer. It's easy to find the API

15
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:50,130
explore for Google's public APIs. Just search for it.

16
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:55,490
Here it is, first result. When you go to the APIs Explorer. You see the list of

17
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:58,450
all the APIs that Google provides for developers to

18
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:01,020
use. You can search, or scroll down to the

19
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:05,000
translate API, and click it. Then you see the

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,160
functions that the translate API exposes. These are functions

21
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,595
that you, the developer, can use in your own

22
00:01:11,595 --> 00:01:15,150
applications. 'Kay now it's your turn to try at

23
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:20,590
the translate API, using the APIs Explorer. So go to the APIs Explorer for the

24
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:23,483
translation service. To find out the meaning

25
00:01:23,483 --> 00:01:26,430
of the name Gundega in English. Gundega is

26
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:29,350
our instructional designer for this course. You

27
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:34,610
could use the language.traslations.list function to translate text.

28
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:37,460
Set the target language to en, which stands

29
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:40,630
for English. When you figured out what Gundega

30
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:43,310
means in English, write it in this text

31
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:46,540
field here. When you submit a translation, you can

32
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:49,650
tell the translation service what the source language is.

33
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:50,870
Or you can let it try to figure out

34
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:53,650
the source language for itself. So, one more

35
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:55,700
thing for you to figure out, is what is

36
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:59,020
a source language for Gundega. When you've figured that

37
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:01,770
out, go ahead and check the appropriate check box.
