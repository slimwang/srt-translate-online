1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,120
Let me just wrap up by doing a couple quick things. Earlier

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,190
on when we were talking, you made a kind of offhand comment about,

3
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:09,210
or maybe I made an offhand comment, about the fact that because we're

4
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:12,750
doing this little prisoners dilemma thing, we have this sort of wall here,

5
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:15,710
we're going to end up in this little bad place. Right? With

6
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:18,590
the -6, -6. And there was this kind of notion that what if

7
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:21,510
we could hear each other, would that make a difference? And the answer

8
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:25,190
was, no not really, because who ever goes first is going to lose.

9
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:26,290
And if you try to get people to go at the

10
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:29,210
same time, well in some sense, that's the same thing as having

11
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:32,049
a wall and you can't hear each other if you have

12
00:00:32,049 --> 00:00:34,080
to go at exactly the same time. Right, does that make sense?

13
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:37,640
>> I didn't quite understand. Why does the first, person who goes first lose?

14
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:40,840
>> Because if I find out whether you're going to cooperate or

15
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:44,010
defect, then I will just then do the thing that makes sense.

16
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:47,440
So if you do anything but defect, I will defect, and

17
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,500
then I will win and you will lose. So whoever goes first

18
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:53,920
runs the risk of the other person screwing them over. So.

19
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,750
>> I see. Unless, unless that person defects.

20
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:58,680
>> Right, but if that person defects, the other person's going to defect.

21
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,770
>> Right, so, but you don't lose any more than you would have.

22
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,660
>> That's true, and, but you still end up in this kind of

23
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:06,130
unfortunate place. So, one question you might

24
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:07,340
have there is, yeah, but that's just

25
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:10,230
because you can only do this once. But what if you could do this

26
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:15,510
twice? So, lets imagine were, going to be in this situation today and then were

27
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:17,870
going to be in this situation tomorrow because, you

28
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:22,970
know, you keep leading me astray. So, whatever happens today

29
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:25,620
I can use as information, for what I might

30
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:28,410
do tomorrow. So, if I decide to go ahead and

31
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:31,700
cooperate this time. And you defect, and I know

32
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:34,260
you're the kind of person who defects, and so when

33
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,160
we're in this situation again, I am definitely going to

34
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:40,810
defect. So maybe in that situation, it's in your best

35
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:42,760
interest to go ahead and cooperate

36
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,910
because, then we can keep coopoerating together,

37
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:47,560
and in the end it sort of works out. So maybe this notion

38
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,213
of not just playing prisoners' dilemma

39
00:01:49,213 --> 00:01:51,540
once, But playing prisoner's dilemma twice or

40
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:55,380
three times, or four times, or five times, might come to a different result.

41
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:56,820
>> Yeah, that seems plausible. I mean, I could

42
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:59,880
imagine saying to you though this channel in the

43
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:03,920
wall, something that says, you know, cooperate with me

44
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,940
or, yeah, right, or I will, I will stop cooperating

45
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:09,389
with you. And so, you get more reward if you, if you cooperate with me.

46
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:11,910
>> Right. So, my question to you is,

47
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:15,000
what does happen exactly in this set? Where

48
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,550
I have two versions, two consecutive games of

49
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:21,640
prisoner's dilemma to play. What am I going to do?

50
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:24,450
>> Ok, well now I mean, we could turn this into a

51
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:26,780
game, right? I mean, that's what you were teaching us how to do.

52
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:27,302
>> Yeah.

53
00:02:27,302 --> 00:02:31,860
>> So you, so now the game has four,

54
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,730
well, I don't know. So one way to do it is

55
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:36,540
to say A has a choice to make on the first

56
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:40,620
step, and [COUGH] that could be cooperate or defect, and then

57
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:43,480
the second step could be cooperate or defect, so there's four possibilities.

58
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:43,790
>> Right.

59
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:47,180
>> B has the same four possibilities. But maybe we can actually

60
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:52,080
have A be responsive to B. So A has two things to

61
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,150
do on the first step and then two things to do on

62
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:57,120
the second step for each thing that B did on the first

63
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,400
step, for a total of eight combinations.

64
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,470
>> Right. You could do that. [CROSSTALK]

65
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:03,300
>> So if we made an eight by eight matrix, we should be able to solve it.

66
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,750
>> Right. So, that's pretty easy to do.

67
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:07,260
You just kind of draw an eight by eight

68
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:10,330
matrix in, you know, that many dimensions. And

69
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:11,810
it, you know, you end up right here.

70
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:14,890
>> I wasn't thinking about that many dimensions. I

71
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:17,140
just thought, like the normal kind of matrix. But, okay.

72
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:18,220
>> Oh, I see, I see, I see.

73
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:19,655
>> I mean its eight by eight, so that's kind

74
00:03:19,655 --> 00:03:22,170
of a pain. Right. So, its 64 cells and, I guess,

75
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:23,890
I guess we don't want to fill that out.

76
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:26,880
>> Yeah, but you know. We could fill that out. But, I'm going to help

77
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:29,530
you out here by pointing out You know what? It's not going to make a difference.

78
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:30,470
>> Oh.

79
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:32,360
>> So, here. Let's see if I can walk

80
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,970
you through why it's not going to make a difference.
