00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,440
My name is Vishal Makhijani.

2
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:04,240
I'm the President and
Chief Operating Officer here at Udacity.

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:07,330
I have one big job and that's to
help our folks help our students.

4
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:09,910
I think what students always have to
remember is they have to be the best

5
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:12,060
salesperson possible for their idea.

6
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:15,340
And what that means is being able
to crisply articulate exactly what

7
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:18,600
their idea is in a few short sentences.

8
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,330
It's important not to get
too lost in the details.

9
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:23,550
It's important to really understand
what your idea is about and

10
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:27,050
be able to tell anyone who wants to know
exactly what your idea is all about.

11
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:31,250
Like anything else that's important,
practice is really important.

12
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:34,590
Try it out, try it out on your friends,
try it on your parents,

13
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:35,790
try it out on your colleagues.

14
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:38,370
Try it out on anyone that will listen,
in fact.

15
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:40,180
Don't be worried about sounding foolish.

16
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:43,360
Keep continue to work on that really
crisp pitch of what your idea

17
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,070
is all about with any and
all who will listen to it.

18
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:48,870
Don't worry about giving that
idea away or any secrecy.

19
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:52,400
The better you get at talking about
your idea in a way that excites and

20
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,450
engages people,

21
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:55,770
the better opportunity you have to build
that great thing that you want to build.
