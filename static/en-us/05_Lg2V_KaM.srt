00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:04,260
So before we get started with the analysis in this lesson, I want to talk

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:08,210
a little bit about the general process of questioning, modeling and validating.

3
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:13,871
The purpose of the iterative QMV process of analysis is meant to

4
00:00:13,871 --> 00:00:18,579
take a vague question and turn it into something that is answerable.

5
00:00:18,579 --> 00:00:21,389
We start with something that is vague and general.

6
00:00:21,389 --> 00:00:24,872
For example, when will a person tweet next?

7
00:00:24,872 --> 00:00:28,656
And we try to turn it into something that is quantitative, concrete and

8
00:00:28,656 --> 00:00:32,180
with uncertainty bounds that are clearly indicated.

9
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:35,710
A good way to think about this process is like a camera looking at

10
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:37,930
something initially out of focus.

11
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:41,090
Over time, we slowly bring it into focus.

12
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:43,800
The important thing to note is that this is a process of

13
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,930
discovery and exploration.

14
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:50,380
Like exploration, we initially don't really know anything about the problem.

15
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:54,190
It's only through the iterations that we come to understand the problem, or

16
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:56,730
even what the questions are that we should be asking.

17
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:01,160
For example, initially we think that the really important thing to ask is,

18
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,330
when will the person tweet next?

19
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:07,030
But only after performing an investigation, we might discover that

20
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:11,880
the more important question is, what is this person's immediate social network?

21
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,750
Now, let's get started with a real problem.
