00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,060
Hello, my name is Mustaque Ahamad.

2
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:05,240
I'm a professor of computer
science at Georgia Tech, and also

3
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:09,630
a member of the Georgia Tech Institute
for Information Security and Privacy.

4
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:12,050
I've been at Georgia Tech for 30 years.

5
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:14,030
And it's been a great journey.

6
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:18,040
My research interests are in computer
systems and system security.

7
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:21,990
In addition to doing research and
teaching, I served as Director of

8
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:26,370
the Georgia Tech Information
Security Center from 2004 to 2012.

9
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:30,597
I also co-founded Pindrop Security that
is commercializing our research that we

10
00:00:30,597 --> 00:00:32,328
did here in telephony security.

11
00:00:32,328 --> 00:00:36,240
I'll be co-teaching this course
with Professor Wenke Lee.

12
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:40,220
Both of us have taught this
course on our campus many times.

13
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:43,200
We're delighted to bring this course
to all of you in this new format.

14
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,790
The course,
Introduction to Information Security,

15
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:49,930
provides a broad overview of
the field of cyber security.

16
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:54,490
Unlike our adversaries who just have to
find one way to compromise our systems,

17
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:57,940
we have to secure every
aspect of these systems.

18
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:01,020
I'll be starting with topics
like software security.

19
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:05,099
Operating system security,
database security and so on.

20
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:07,000
Once I'm done with part one,

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,600
we're going to move on to part
two with Professor Wenke Lee.

22
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,117
>> Hello.

23
00:01:11,117 --> 00:01:12,325
My name is Wenke Lee.

24
00:01:12,325 --> 00:01:15,380
I'm a professor of
Computer Science at Georgia Tech.

25
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:18,470
I'm also the co-director of
the Georgia Tech Institute for

26
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:20,330
Information Security and Privacy.

27
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:24,598
My research interest are in systems and
network security, applied cryptography,

28
00:01:24,598 --> 00:01:26,080
and data mining.

29
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,840
I've also cofounded
company called Amala.

30
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:32,040
It commercializes our
research in detection.

31
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,500
I'll be covering the second
half of this course.

32
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:39,470
The topics will include cryptography,
security protocols, network defenses,

33
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:42,415
malware, web security,
and mobile security.

34
00:01:42,415 --> 00:01:46,360
Mustaque, I'm very excited about
bringing this course to students.

35
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:50,030
>> Absolutely, and by the time we
are done, hopefully they'll have great

36
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:54,330
understanding of the basic principles of
cyber security, and walk over lots of

37
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:58,260
practical techniques that help us
all stay safe in our online world.
