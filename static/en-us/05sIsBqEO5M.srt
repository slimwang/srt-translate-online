00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,660
One of the things you may have noticed, 
is that our app database continues

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:07,110
to grow forever, 
eventually filling up the device.

3
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:09,640
This is a great way 
to get our app uninstalled.

4
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:13,030
So let's fix this. 
Add code to delete weather data

5
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:17,173
that is more than one day old. 
Use the Calendar function

6
00:00:17,173 --> 00:00:18,899
to do data arithmetic.
