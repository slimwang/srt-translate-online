00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Let me now make your life harder.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Suppose our probability of a certain other kind of disease is 0.1,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
so 10% of the population has it.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Our test in the positive case is really informative,

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
but there's a 0.5 chance that if I'm cancer-free the test, indeed, says the same thing.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
So the sensitivity is high, the specificity is lower.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 99:59:59,999
And let's start by filling in the first 3 of them.
