00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:03,810
So far in this course, when you've
written SQL queries in the web-based

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:07,660
editor, we've hidden away the mechanism
that actually connects to a database and

3
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:09,470
runs your queries.

4
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:13,370
Some place back here, there's actually
a database running those queries.

5
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:16,540
Now, let's open up this box and
see how it actually works.

6
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:19,640
Behind our web server,
we're running Python code

7
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:23,668
that connects to an sqlite
database using DB-API calls.

8
00:00:23,668 --> 00:00:27,260
The Python DB-API isn't a library.

9
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:28,050
It's a standard for

10
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:31,320
Python libraries that lets your
code connect to databases.

11
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,050
There are dozens of
different libraries for

12
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:35,850
different database systems
that follow this standard.

13
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:39,663
The standard specifies what functions
you'll call to connect to a database,

14
00:00:39,663 --> 00:00:42,150
to send the queries and to get results.

15
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:45,030
So, if you learn the DB-API functions,

16
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:47,870
you can apply that knowledge
with any database system.

17
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:51,280
Although, the details of what each
database can do are different,

18
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,350
adapting Python code from one to
another is quite straightforward, but

19
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:57,790
each database system
has its own library.

20
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:00,640
And as you can see,
some of the library names are a little

21
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,940
bit different from the names of
the database systems that we work with.

22
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:07,720
For exercises in the browser,
we use the sqlite3 library.
