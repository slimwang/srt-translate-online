00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:05,960
We've evolved to recognize color and
shapes at a very basic level.

2
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:08,970
Just as we saw how shape and
arrangement can tell us a lot.

3
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:12,410
We also infer information from
an item's color and appearance.

4
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:14,890
Color can tell us if
a particular food looks ripe or

5
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:19,170
rotten, if we should stop or go or
if our battery is running low.

6
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:22,880
It can be used to direct attention or
imply hierarchy and structure.

7
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,670
Material design encourages
you the app developer

8
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:28,970
to embrace bold
purposeful uses of color.

9
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:32,185
Not just for aesthetics, but
to make your app easier to use.

10
00:00:32,185 --> 00:00:34,985
The material design color pallet
includes a set of primary and

11
00:00:34,985 --> 00:00:38,185
secondary colors that can
be used across devices.

12
00:00:38,185 --> 00:00:42,045
One note on the material pallet is
that it is in no way restrictive.

13
00:00:42,045 --> 00:00:44,405
These aren't the only allowed colors.

14
00:00:44,405 --> 00:00:47,685
If you have established brand colors,
use them.

15
00:00:47,685 --> 00:00:50,785
It is however a great hand
picked starting point

16
00:00:50,785 --> 00:00:51,845
that you can use to get going.
