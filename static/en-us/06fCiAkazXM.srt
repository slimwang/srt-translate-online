00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,238
After solving, we find that x is $10,000 and y is $15,000. Congrats if you got

2
00:00:04,238 --> 00:00:08,486
both of these right. If you didn't, that's okay, too. Follow along with me in

3
00:00:08,486 --> 00:00:12,902
the solution, and then pause it when you find a mistake. Then continue solving,

4
00:00:12,902 --> 00:00:17,313
and see if you can get these answers. Remember, mistakes are okay. And this is

5
00:00:17,313 --> 00:00:22,032
the time that we learn from them. I'm going to rewrite this first equation by

6
00:00:22,032 --> 00:00:26,525
subtracting x from both sides to get y is equal to 25,000 minus x. I did this so

7
00:00:26,525 --> 00:00:31,105
I could use substitution. I think that's the easier choice here. Now I perform

8
00:00:31,105 --> 00:00:35,811
the substitution, then I can distribute my 8 hundredths to both terms. Here's my

9
00:00:35,811 --> 00:00:40,800
first term, 2,000, and my second term, negative 8 hundredths times x. I subtract

10
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:46,064
my constant term to move every constant to the right. And then that leaves me

11
00:00:46,064 --> 00:00:51,477
with x on the left. I combine my like terms, then I divide by the coefficient of

12
00:00:51,477 --> 00:00:56,713
x. I get x is equal to 10,000 or $10,000 which we invested at 7%. And remember

13
00:00:56,713 --> 00:01:01,939
this is a system of equations. And so we have two variables, x and y. Well we

14
00:01:01,939 --> 00:01:07,217
know if x is $10,000, y must be $15,000, since those two have to add up to

15
00:01:07,217 --> 00:01:12,819
$25,000. And as always, we can check our answers. By plugging in x and y into

16
00:01:12,819 --> 00:01:16,090
both equations, we'll get true statements.
