00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,269
Excellent job with some simple,
but important work.

2
00:00:03,269 --> 00:00:06,192
Your camera is the only window your
player has into your game world.

3
00:00:06,192 --> 00:00:09,792
So, make sure it presents
the best your world has to offer.

4
00:00:09,792 --> 00:00:12,876
So, now we have GigaGal,
some platforms to jump on, and

5
00:00:12,876 --> 00:00:15,078
a camera that can move around the level.

6
00:00:15,078 --> 00:00:17,334
It's awfully quiet in there though.

7
00:00:17,334 --> 00:00:20,470
In the next level let's adds
an evil robot buddies to play with.
