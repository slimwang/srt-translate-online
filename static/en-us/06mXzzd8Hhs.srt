1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,760
Now that we have our
competitive analysis laid out,

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:05,330
we need to complete a key
part of our pitch deck,

3
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:08,160
and coincidentally,
part of your final project.

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,600
This is the value proposition.

5
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:15,590
Our value proposition is our promise
of value to our customers or investors.

6
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:18,680
Now it explains what problem
our product solves, and

7
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:20,960
what benefits we're
giving our customers.

8
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,840
We need a frame or value proposition so

9
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:26,680
everything we learn in this lesson
is clear, organized, and powerful.

10
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:30,110
The leading template for value
propositions in use today was written by

11
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:33,140
none other than Geoffrey Moore,
in his book Crossing the Chasm.

12
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:35,350
So let's hear from the expert himself.

13
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:38,254
>> When it comes to articulating
a value proposition,

14
00:00:38,254 --> 00:00:42,148
we have a template that we use in our
practice which has got six lines and

15
00:00:42,148 --> 00:00:44,865
it's proved over the years
to be pretty useful.

16
00:00:44,865 --> 00:00:49,660
So the first line is for and
that's just like who you're talking to.

17
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:52,560
And we'll talk about market
segmentation, but we're going to talk to

18
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:57,340
what we call the poster child in your
segment, you're perfect target customer.

19
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:59,813
And the next line is called who.

20
00:00:59,813 --> 00:01:04,797
And that specifies the state
that your target customer

21
00:01:04,797 --> 00:01:08,165
would be in, in wanting your offer.

22
00:01:08,165 --> 00:01:12,010
So you have for these people,
who are in this state of mind.

23
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:17,220
Then the third line, it's called
our product or our service is.

24
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:20,280
And that's where you categorize
your offer generically.

25
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,480
It's a little bit like,

26
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:24,460
what aisle in the supermarket would
I go to to find your product?

27
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:26,160
It's sort of that sort of
thing is in line three.

28
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,230
So you're not trying to
differentiate in line three,

29
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:30,990
you're just trying to say what you are.

30
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:34,830
And then that, and then the fourth
line is your primary benefit.

31
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:40,100
The thing that basically, it speaks a
lot to the state that the customer's in.

32
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:43,410
Typically if the state is a problem
state this is the answer to that

33
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:44,250
problem kind of thing.

34
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:48,140
And then the last two lines help
position you against your closest

35
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:49,090
competitor.

36
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:53,210
So unlike, and this is where you
put your closest competitor, and

37
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:58,750
what's important here is that you not
pick a competitor that's ineffective or

38
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:00,740
not valuable to the customer.

39
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:04,170
You want to pick a legitimate
alternative that this customer

40
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:06,160
should probably be thinking about.

41
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:09,780
But then what you say is unlike
this competitor, our offer, and

42
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:11,150
that's the sixth line.

43
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:13,800
And you state your primary
differentiation there.

44
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,614
And it's not that our offer is better.

45
00:02:16,614 --> 00:02:20,503
It's typically what you normally do
with differentiation, is you say,

46
00:02:20,503 --> 00:02:23,021
they are good for this and
we're good for that.
