This table here is taken from a survey by Tobias Riege and Jorg Rothe.

00:00:04,639 --> 00:00:09,180
I had chose the development of better and better algorithms for 3-SAT

3
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:13,700
So up here, you can see the deterministic algorithms for 3-SAT

4
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:16,430
and down here you can see randomized algorithms for 3-SAT

5
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:18,728
and you can see how over the years the algorithms

6
00:00:18,728 --> 00:00:22,130
get better and better and better and the same thing over here.

7
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:24,529
Now, this is of course going to be a rather easy question,

8
00:00:24,529 --> 00:00:29,200
but which of these two algorithm categories generally seems to be better

9
00:00:29,200 --> 99:59:59,999
Is it the deterministic algorithms up here or the randomized algorithms down here.
