00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Now I'm going to talk about strategies for a minute.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Remember a strategy is a function, which takes a state as input,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and it's output is one of the action names, roll or hold.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I want you to write a strategy function, which we're calling clueless.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
So its a function that takes a state as input,

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
and it's going to return one of the possible moves, roll or hold.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
It does that by ignoring the state

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
and just choosing one of the possible moves at random.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So go ahead and write that.
