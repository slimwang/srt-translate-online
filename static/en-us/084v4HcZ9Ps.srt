1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,220
Notice that these three strategies differ as to where knowledge of

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:05,010
the participants is held.

3
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:08,734
In general, there's a spectrum between centralized solutions where knowledge of

4
00:00:08,734 --> 00:00:12,550
all invariants is in one place, and completely decentralized strategies, okay?

5
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:14,850
Which of these three strategies is most centralized?
