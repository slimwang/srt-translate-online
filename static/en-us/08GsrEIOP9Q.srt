1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,360
The more that I think about it,
is that all of the values in a row,

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:06,440
are part of the same sentence
describing something.

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,986
For instance,
describing the country of Columbia.

4
00:00:08,986 --> 00:00:14,370
Columbia has a population of 47
million and the literacy rate of 94%.

5
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:17,760
And all of the values in a column,
are ones that have the same role or

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,376
place, in different sentences.

7
00:00:19,376 --> 00:00:23,690
So, this number, describes about Brazil,

8
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:27,510
the same sort of a fact, that this
number describes about Colombia.

9
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:29,890
They're both population figures,
but for different countries.
