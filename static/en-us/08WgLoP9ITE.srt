As I talked about earlier, if 2 lines are parallel, that means that they have

2
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:11,305
the same slope. Considering what parallel means, and your understanding of how

3
00:00:11,317 --> 00:00:16,995
to form equations of different lines, can you tell me, then, what the equation

4
00:00:17,007 --> 00:00:21,177
of a line parallels to the line, y equals 1/2x plus 3, but that has a y

5
00:00:21,189 --> 00:00:23,620
intercept of 0 negative 2 would be.
