1
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:04,471
It's a common mistake to only test
the app in the best case use scenarios,

2
00:00:04,471 --> 00:00:07,734
such as in our home or in our office
where we're writing our code and

3
00:00:07,734 --> 00:00:09,902
we have a really good
Internet connection.

4
00:00:09,902 --> 00:00:14,424
But as professional Android developers,
it's important to take into account and

5
00:00:14,424 --> 00:00:17,911
test the worst case or edge case
scenarios in which our app will be

6
00:00:17,911 --> 00:00:20,123
used and perhaps behave unexpectedly.

7
00:00:20,123 --> 00:00:23,727
Sometimes this means that our app may be
used in places where there's a spotty

8
00:00:23,727 --> 00:00:26,610
Internet connection and
that's where a loading indicator,

9
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:29,991
such as the one we added in, comes in as
a great way to let the user know that

10
00:00:29,991 --> 00:00:31,788
we're still working on the request.

11
00:00:31,788 --> 00:00:34,910
It's also possible that the user
will be in a place with no Internet

12
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:35,874
connection at all.

13
00:00:35,874 --> 00:00:37,594
So what happens then?

14
00:00:37,594 --> 00:00:42,255
Does the app appear blank or
does it unexpectedly crash?

15
00:00:42,255 --> 00:00:45,015
Well, building a polished
user experience

16
00:00:45,015 --> 00:00:47,695
means handling all of these edge cases.

17
00:00:47,695 --> 00:00:50,538
Now I want you to examine the current
behavior of the quake report app when we

18
00:00:50,538 --> 00:00:51,724
have no Internet connection.

19
00:00:51,724 --> 00:00:55,335
We can test this by turning
on Airplane Mode on a device.

20
00:00:55,335 --> 00:00:58,318
When you go on airplanes,
you usually turn on this mode.

21
00:00:58,318 --> 00:01:01,959
Airplane Mode disables Wi-Fi,
Bluetooth and cellular connectivity,

22
00:01:01,959 --> 00:01:03,727
meaning the device is now offline.

23
00:01:03,727 --> 00:01:07,401
Pull down the notification shade and
under the Quick Settings,

24
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:11,902
turn on Airplane Mode, then you should
see an airplane icon in the status bar.

25
00:01:11,902 --> 00:01:15,665
If your version of Android looks
different, you can also find this option

26
00:01:15,665 --> 00:01:19,136
in the Settings app underneath
the section Wireless and Networks.

27
00:01:19,136 --> 00:01:21,214
See the link below for more help.

28
00:01:21,214 --> 00:01:24,510
Now go ahead and
kill the app using the Resets menu, and

29
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:27,030
then start it up from scratch.

30
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:29,650
When that happens,
what do you see in the app?

31
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:31,320
Go ahead and
write your answer in this text box.

32
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,690
When you're done,
browse around other apps and

33
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:37,590
check what happens when there
is no Internet connectivity.

34
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:39,910
If you find any particularly good or
bad examples,

35
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:42,390
feel free to share them on the
discussion forum linked below the quiz.
