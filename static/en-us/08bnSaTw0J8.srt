1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:02,953
I'll start with the small layout.

2
00:00:02,953 --> 00:00:08,760
At min-width 450 pixels, the only
real change from the default, is that

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:12,538
the light blue and the green elements
both take up 50% of the viewport.

4
00:00:12,538 --> 00:00:17,070
So, at min-width 450 pixels,
I set width 50% for

5
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:20,260
the light blue and the green elements.

6
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:21,006
So far, so good.

7
00:00:21,006 --> 00:00:26,300
At min-width 550 pixels,
it looks like the only difference is

8
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:30,640
that now the red box only takes up 40%
of view port, while the orange box,

9
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,830
takes up 60% of the view port.

10
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:35,690
So, I made my change,
and well to be honest,

11
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:38,150
this doesn't quite look
like what I expected.

12
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:41,070
I thought the red box would be
probably a little bit farther over.

13
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:42,660
So you know what, let's go ahead and
change something.

14
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:47,440
Inside Dev Tools, I'll change that 40%,
which I was mistaken about.

15
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,080
And I'll change that to 33%,

16
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:54,493
which means that the width of
the orange box needs to be 66.6%.

17
00:00:54,493 --> 00:00:58,420
I was a little bold there and instead
of testing first, I just went ahead and

18
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:01,690
set the widths inside my source code,
but looking at this height,

19
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:03,940
this isn't actually what I expected.

20
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:06,330
I think the orange isn't
taking up enough space, and

21
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:08,940
I think the red is taking
up too much space.

22
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:13,430
So, I think I'll use devtools
to make some adjustments.

23
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:17,250
Instead of 40 60, I'll go ahead and
make it one-third and two-thirds.

24
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:21,144
So, red becomes 33.3%,
and orange becomes 66.6%.

25
00:01:21,144 --> 00:01:24,910
All right, that's looking a lot better.

26
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:27,380
And lastly, there's min-width,
800 pixels.

27
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:32,320
The only difference between 550 and
800 pixels, is that with 800 pixels,

28
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,770
there are now left and right margins.

29
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:37,540
At the break point with
the min-width of 800 pixels.

30
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:41,270
I went ahead and
set a fixed width of 800 pixels and

31
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:44,480
then a margin left and
margin right of auto.

32
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,620
With a quick save and
a refresh of the browser,

33
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:51,305
it looks like the page now has
margins on the left and right.

34
00:01:51,305 --> 00:01:52,890
Already, that looks pretty good.
