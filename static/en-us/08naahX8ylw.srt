In the previous exercise I modified the drinking bird's geometry itself a bit

2
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:07,816
from the original model. I'm going to let you use your detective skills to

3
00:00:07,816 --> 00:00:13,494
figure out what I've changed. Which part has slightly different geometry; the

4
00:00:13,494 --> 00:00:18,228
hat, head, the body bulb, or the legs and feet? Once you figure out what part

5
00:00:18,228 --> 00:00:23,098
has changed. Think about why I modified it. I won't test you on this. Sadly, the

6
00:00:23,098 --> 00:00:27,238
computer can't grade essay questions yet. But there's an interesting reason. By

7
00:00:27,238 --> 00:00:31,270
the way, even if you're not doing the exercises, you should be able to look at

8
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:33,573
the exercise code and see what's changed.
