00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:03,820
For this programming exercise, you need to alter the variable tenure,

2
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:07,190
so that way, it was measured in years instead of days. And

3
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:10,080
this should make a lot of sense, since 365 days would

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,950
be one year, and 730 days would be two years. Now for

5
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:16,370
the binwidth, let's set it equal to one so we get

6
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:20,200
a count for yearly users. Running this code, we can see our

7
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,860
histogram. And notice here that we have a different color. And I

8
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:25,510
did that by changing the hex code. To get a finer view

9
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:28,580
of our data, we could set the bandwidth equal to .25. It

10
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:30,880
looks like the bulk of our users had had less than two and

11
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,100
a half years on Facebook. To improve this plot in one more

12
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:37,510
way, I can change the x axis, so that way it increments by

13
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:40,460
one year. To do that, I can add the layer of scale

14
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:43,970
x continuous, and set the breaks from one to seven. I'm also going to

15
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:46,290
limit our data so that we only see users from zero to seven

16
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:49,340
years. Writing this code, we can see we have a very nice histogram.
