00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:04,490
Now that we've finished coding the
Gaussian elimination algorithm and we've

2
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:09,620
coded how to extract a solution from the
reduced row echelon form of a system,

3
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:13,930
let's go one step further and
give our program the ability to output

4
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:19,140
a Parameterization of the solution set
if there are infinitely many solutions.

5
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:23,930
I've added a new class called
Parameterization to my lynsis module.

6
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:28,180
To initialize a Parameterization object,
you need to pass in a base point,

7
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:32,020
which is a vector and a list of vectors,
the direction vectors.

8
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:37,151
For an example of what this means,
let's look at the plain x + y + z = 1.

9
00:00:37,151 --> 00:00:40,810
Suppose this is the solution set
to some system of equations.

10
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:47,810
We could rewrite x as 1-y-z and
then treat y and z as free variables.

11
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:54,340
So if we parameterize x, y, and
z, the base point would be 1 0 0,

12
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:58,640
because y and z don't have constant
terms, and x has a constant term of 1.

13
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:04,510
Then the vector multiplied
by y would be -1 1 0 because

14
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:10,080
x has a -y term, y has 1 times y and
z has no y term.

15
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,991
And similarly, the vector
multiplied by z would be -1 0 1.

16
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:19,170
In this case, y and z are the parameters
of the parametrization.

17
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:23,590
The base point of this parameterization
would be the constant vector 1 0 0 and

18
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:29,490
the direction vectors are the vectors
multiplied by y and z, the parameters.

19
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:34,654
These are the vectors -1 1 0 and -1 0 1.

20
00:01:34,654 --> 00:01:35,728
You can find the code for

21
00:01:35,728 --> 00:01:39,110
the parameterization class in
the instructor notes as well.

22
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:43,320
For this quiz, your goal is to write
a program that outputs a parametrization

23
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:48,540
object representing the solution to
a system with infinitely many solutions.

24
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:51,240
To test that your program
is working correctly,

25
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:54,680
here are three systems with
infinitely many solutions.

26
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:58,180
Enter the correct parameterizations
into the boxes provided.

27
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:05,035
The first system is 0.786x + 0.786y

28
00:02:05,035 --> 00:02:10,175
+ 0.588z = -0.714 and

29
00:02:10,175 --> 00:02:14,975
-0.138x- 0.138y +

30
00:02:14,975 --> 00:02:19,271
0.244z = 0.319.

31
00:02:19,271 --> 00:02:24,185
The second system is 8.631x +

32
00:02:24,185 --> 00:02:30,747
5.112y- 1.816z = -5.113.

33
00:02:30,747 --> 00:02:36,938
And 4.315x +11.132y-

34
00:02:36,938 --> 00:02:41,730
5.27z = -6.77 and

35
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:46,722
-2.158 + 3.01y-

36
00:02:46,722 --> 00:02:52,123
1.727z = -0.831.

37
00:02:52,123 --> 00:02:57,217
The third system is 0.935x

38
00:02:57,217 --> 00:03:04,953
+ 1.76y- 9.365z = -9.955 and

39
00:03:04,953 --> 00:03:09,859
0.187x + 0.352y-

40
00:03:09,859 --> 00:03:15,143
1.873z = -9.991 and

41
00:03:15,143 --> 00:03:20,049
0.374x + 0.704y-

42
00:03:20,049 --> 00:03:25,333
3.746z = -3.982 and

43
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:30,239
-0.561x- 1.056y

44
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:36,040
+ 5.619z = 5.973.

45
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,430
In the code for
the parameterization object,

46
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:42,810
the parameters are named t sub i for
some number i.

47
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:47,300
But, for the purposes of this quiz,
please use the letters t for

48
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:49,560
a parameter if there's
just one parameter.

49
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,720
This would be called t1
in the Python module.

50
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,090
And used t and
s if there are two parameters.

51
00:03:56,090 --> 00:04:00,307
So t would be t1 in the python module,
and s would be t2.

52
00:04:00,307 --> 00:04:00,810
Good luck.
