00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,003
Here's a list of inequalities for you. And for each one, I'd like you to tell me

2
00:00:05,003 --> 00:00:10,061
which number it says could be greater, a or b, or neither. And then also, tell

3
00:00:10,061 --> 00:00:14,357
me if the inequality says that a and b could be equal to one another.
