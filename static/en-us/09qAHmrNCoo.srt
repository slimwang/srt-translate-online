00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,445
The vertical and horizontal asymptotes of this rational function divide the

2
00:00:03,445 --> 00:00:08,720
coordinate plane into four different sections. Which of these four sections

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,226
does the graph lie in? Check off the proper boxes to show approximately the

4
00:00:12,226 --> 00:00:15,230
points that the graph is going to go through.
