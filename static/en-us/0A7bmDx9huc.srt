00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:00,760
Alright.

2
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:03,500
It took a little bit of time, but this is what I came up with.

3
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:06,620
This is the same code that we had before and really the only new

4
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:11,410
parts here are iterating through the dates and the descriptions for each job.

5
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:13,820
Here, I'm doing the same thing we did before.

6
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:17,020
I'm replacing some data from the HTML work

7
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:20,700
dates string with the dates from my work object and

8
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:25,110
then I'm appending the formatted dates to the last element of class work entry.

9
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:26,550
Same thing with description.

10
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:30,550
I'm replacing the placeholder data with work.jobs(job).description, and

11
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:35,610
then appending the formatted version to the last element of class work-entry.

12
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:36,829
And this is what we see on the page.
