00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:05,512
Colors are a big part of app design,
from branding to visual consistency.

2
00:00:05,512 --> 00:00:09,759
And I like a lot of colors, but
a little can go a long way.

3
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:14,289
If you think about some nicely designed
apps like Google Maps, music players, or

4
00:00:14,289 --> 00:00:17,399
email, they generally
use only a few colors.

5
00:00:17,399 --> 00:00:21,379
And they use contrast to highlight
different components within the app.

6
00:00:21,379 --> 00:00:23,789
In general,
colors should always work together and

7
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:28,099
help to distinguish between views and
interactive components like buttons.

8
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:31,080
For these reasons,
Android material design guidelines

9
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:34,929
recommend having a primary color and
an accent color.

10
00:00:34,929 --> 00:00:37,950
The primary color is the main
color base for your app.

11
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:41,870
Views and components like the menu bar
will generally include this color.

12
00:00:41,869 --> 00:00:44,269
And the accent color is
typically brighter, and

13
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:48,190
serves to draw attention to key
elements like buttons in an app.

14
00:00:48,189 --> 00:00:48,670
In fact,

15
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:52,423
there is some helpful online tools that
can help you chose a color pallet.

16
00:00:52,423 --> 00:00:53,990
And I've linked to a couple
in the notes below.

17
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:57,840
It's common to chose three slightly
different shades of the primary

18
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,720
color to use and one accent color.

19
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,609
For our app, we'll be using a dark
purple as a primary color, and

20
00:01:04,609 --> 00:01:06,730
orange as an accent color.

21
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:10,400
I've chosen purple and orange because
they are near opposite colors.

22
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,170
Which means they have a high contrast
that's great for visibility.

23
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:16,760
Choosing two very different
colors like this will make

24
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:19,359
anything I want to highlight very clear.

25
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:20,439
And when you choose colors for

26
00:01:20,439 --> 00:01:24,469
any app, keep in mind how you'll use
them to add clarity and consistency.
