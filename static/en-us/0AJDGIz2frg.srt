00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,559
Now, did you pick up on how I kind of tricked you on that one? There aren't

2
00:00:03,559 --> 00:00:09,330
sleep spindles or k-complexes in stage three sleep. So both of these are no.

3
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:14,271
Sleep spindles and k-complexes are only seen in stage two sleep. Here is a

4
00:00:14,271 --> 00:00:18,977
sleep spindle because it's a short burst of brain activity. And here we see a

5
00:00:18,977 --> 00:00:23,842
k-complex because it's a single high voltage burst of energy. And this isn't a

6
00:00:23,842 --> 00:00:26,285
sleep spindle or a k-complex.
