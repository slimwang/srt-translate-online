1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:05,170
Now to displace those rectangles
that surround the airport codes,

2
00:00:05,169 --> 00:00:08,073
we've provided you with some drawables
that would help, namely this

3
00:00:08,073 --> 00:00:12,210
shape_rectangles_stroke.xml, don't
worry about what's inside this xml for

4
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:14,670
now, just think of it
as a typical image.

5
00:00:14,669 --> 00:00:18,509
So we simply go back to the activity
name and then drag in an image view,

6
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:22,030
we can specify the drawable to
be the shape rectangle stroke.

7
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:24,140
And then lets move back
to the text view, so

8
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:27,500
that we can change it with a height.

9
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:32,350
Lets set it with 60dp, and
the height to 80dp, and so

10
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:36,179
now we can go back to the design mode,
and start creating our constraints.

11
00:00:36,179 --> 00:00:38,670
I'll create a left
constraint to the parent and

12
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:41,109
a top constraint to our passenger name.

13
00:00:41,109 --> 00:00:44,490
And then in the text view,
I'll just make sure the margin left

14
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:48,710
is equal to 32dp and
the margin top is 16.

15
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:52,620
Also if you ever change the margin left
you just need to make sure the margin

16
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:54,189
start is the same.

17
00:00:54,189 --> 00:00:56,500
And then let's have a look,
it looks a lot better.

18
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:00,170
And then we can do the exact same
thing with our right rectangle

19
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:02,609
except that we set
the constraint to the right.

20
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:04,489
And then, the top to the bottom of name.

21
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:09,320
That line between those two rectangles
is simply in view with the heights up to

22
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:13,559
one pixel and having the background
color the same as the rectangles.

23
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:17,079
But to make this line stretch out
as these rectangles move apart or

24
00:01:17,079 --> 00:01:20,329
come closer, we have to set
the constraints from the left,

25
00:01:20,329 --> 00:01:23,510
to the left rectangle and
from the right to right rectangle.

26
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:27,400
And to center it vertically, we've also
set the top constraint to the bottom of

27
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:31,140
one of the rectangles and the bottom
constraint to top of another rectangles.

28
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:34,200
Again, it might not be very obvious
here in the visual editor so

29
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,590
let's go back to the text.

30
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:38,170
You can see that I've
created the constraint left

31
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:40,530
to the right of the left rectangle.

32
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:43,460
And the right constraint to
the left of the right rectangle.

33
00:01:43,459 --> 00:01:46,589
And then the top to the bottom
of the right rectangle.

34
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:49,510
And the bottom to the top
of the right rectangle.

35
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:52,109
These two here guarantee that
the line would be centered

36
00:01:52,109 --> 00:01:54,019
vertically between the rectangles.

37
00:01:54,019 --> 00:01:58,039
And this here going to use other line
will stretch and shrink as those

38
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:02,180
rectangles move depending on the size
of your phone or the orientation of it.

39
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:04,980
You can see I have also hard coded
the layout height to be one.

40
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:08,770
And I have set the layout width to be
zero because it will stretch based

41
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:11,110
on those constraints here.

42
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:15,640
Now when you set to horizontal or
vertical constraints from the both sides

43
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:18,979
of a view, the view can react
in one of three different ways.

44
00:02:18,979 --> 00:02:22,049
You can see that from the properties
window on the side here.

45
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:24,490
The view can either have a fixed size,

46
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:26,969
which means that you
specify the dimension.

47
00:02:26,969 --> 00:02:31,009
Either in the textbox here or
in the text in the XML file itself.

48
00:02:31,009 --> 00:02:34,060
And that means that regardless
of what these constraints are,

49
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:37,020
it will maintain its dimension
that you've specified.

50
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:39,945
It could also be set to be any size,
which means it.

51
00:02:39,944 --> 00:02:43,064
Something like a spring,
that stretches or

52
00:02:43,064 --> 00:02:45,775
shrinks to maintain those constraints.

53
00:02:45,775 --> 00:02:48,375
The final option is Wrap Content.

54
00:02:48,375 --> 00:02:50,335
Which means it would only expand or

55
00:02:50,335 --> 00:02:53,525
shrink to make sure that it
wraps its contents inside.

56
00:02:53,525 --> 00:02:57,319
So, we'll set the vertical
type to be fixed.

57
00:02:57,319 --> 00:02:59,430
And the horizontal type to be any size.

58
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:02,480
You could also change
the bias of how strong or

59
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:05,959
weak each of the constraints are and
that moves the line either up or

60
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,830
down depending on how
strong each constraint is.

61
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:11,200
So for
now we're just going to set that at 50%.

62
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:15,089
Now I just went ahead and
added those two extra text views and

63
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:19,189
I've set the constraint to be from the
left and right for the rectangles and

64
00:03:19,189 --> 00:03:20,889
the top and bottom to the line.

65
00:03:20,889 --> 00:03:24,079
This guarantee's that the text would
be centered within the rectangle and

66
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,300
aligned with the line.

67
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:27,773
Then I added four more text views and

68
00:03:27,772 --> 00:03:30,987
created for all of them,
left constraints and

69
00:03:30,987 --> 00:03:35,370
then four more text fields for
the boarding and arrival times.

70
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:39,286
I'll make sure that it is on top
label here is align to the right, and

71
00:03:39,286 --> 00:03:42,121
then everything else is
constraint to the left.

72
00:03:42,121 --> 00:03:44,878
Now there is one more constrain
type that I want to show here and

73
00:03:44,877 --> 00:03:46,690
it's called the baseline constraint.

74
00:03:46,691 --> 00:03:50,420
And this is symboled with this line
here which is only for text views.

75
00:03:50,419 --> 00:03:55,247
And it allows you to create constraints
between different text views regardless

76
00:03:55,247 --> 00:03:57,734
of how large the text
view size itself is.

77
00:03:57,735 --> 00:03:59,890
It just allows you to
align the text inside it.

78
00:03:59,889 --> 00:04:03,129
Now it's time to create the design for
the blue table down here.

79
00:04:03,129 --> 00:04:07,379
Again, the header of the table is just
a rectangle with a background color, and

80
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:10,060
the body is another rectangle
with another background color.

81
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:12,530
So I've added two new image views here.

82
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:15,379
One for the table header,
another one for the table body.

83
00:04:15,379 --> 00:04:19,129
I've set the background color to
be colorPrimary for the body and

84
00:04:19,129 --> 00:04:21,000
colorPrimaryLight for the header.

85
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,509
And I'll set the headers constraint
to be pointing to the departure time

86
00:04:25,509 --> 00:04:28,149
on the top, and
to the parent from the left.

87
00:04:28,149 --> 00:04:29,579
And then I'll just add
the text views for

88
00:04:29,579 --> 00:04:31,479
all the information inside the table.

89
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,379
Next is the bar code,
which should go down here, and

90
00:04:34,379 --> 00:04:36,069
that's just another image view.

91
00:04:36,069 --> 00:04:38,129
Which I can add here in the text and

92
00:04:38,129 --> 00:04:43,779
I'm just planning to source to this MIP
map which I've also provided you with.

93
00:04:43,779 --> 00:04:45,479
And then finally the flight code and

94
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:48,319
the plane image are the things
that are still missing.

95
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:50,819
So the flight code is
just another text view.

96
00:04:50,819 --> 00:04:53,550
I've set the text up in Display1.

97
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:58,470
And use the primary color, offset
the top constraint to be the divider so

98
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:02,870
that it's always underneath this
line divider we created earlier.

99
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:05,149
And the left constraint to
the left rectangle, and

100
00:05:05,149 --> 00:05:06,759
the right constraint to
the right rectangle.

101
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:09,420
That guarantees that it's always
going to be centered between them.

102
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:12,610
Perfect, that's looking pretty good so
far.

103
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:15,280
In the next video let's see
how to add this plain image.
