00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:03,710
So, when you're walking into a brick and
mortar store in the real world.

2
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:06,170
It's pretty obvious that you're
going to put down some money and

3
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:07,450
you're going to buy something.

4
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:08,610
Is that similar for apps?

5
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:10,630
>> Yes and no.

6
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:13,320
If you wish to charge user
before they download your app,

7
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,190
you can do it in a simple way.

8
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:17,550
First, create a Merchant Account.

9
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:21,520
Second, set the prices for
your app in the Developer Console.

10
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,290
Third, you can optionally
include advertising or

11
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:28,790
use In-app billing to sell
additional features or content.

12
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:32,400
Web links to all the three stages
in the instructor notes down below.

13
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:36,640
It's important to remember
who are you targeting?

14
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,570
Since this model may limit your
app monetization potential.

15
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:42,800
Particularly in developing market.

16
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,330
You may be able to achieve greater
revenue by using the freemium or

17
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:47,380
subscription models.
