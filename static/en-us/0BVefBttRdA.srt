00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,650
Today, we're going to be talking about distribution channels.

2
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:08,180
How does your product get from your company to your customer?

3
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:11,220
You're all familiar with the business model canvas.

4
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:15,810
We've already talked about value propositions and we've talked about customer segments

5
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:20,520
in the last two lectures, but today we're going to talk about channels.

6
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,900
So let's take a look at our business model canvas.

7
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:28,990
Channels is just one of the nine boxes in the canvas and it's a series of hypothesis

8
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:33,110
of how does our product get from our company to our customer.

9
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:37,990
Now, when companies first started, there were essentially manufacturing concerns

10
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:43,920
and they hired agents, outsiders to be their sales channel, and the first types of companies we had

11
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:49,790
made physical products and therefore, had physical channels--salespeople, stores, etc.,

12
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:53,550
but with the emergence of the web, we now have web and mobile channels.

13
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:57,630
And so a choice for us is picking the right distribution channel.

14
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:03,180
We're going to talk about physical versus web mobile channels.
