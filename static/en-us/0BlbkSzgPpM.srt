Welcome back, we're moving fast through this course. This week, we've explored

2
00:00:04,304 --> 00:00:08,444
rational functions. We learned about how to sketch their graphs, find their

3
00:00:08,444 --> 00:00:12,940
domain and range, and any vertical and horizontal asymptotes. In our

4
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:17,774
investigations, we also encountered slant asymptotes. Finally, we began looking

5
00:00:17,774 --> 00:00:22,810
at graphing and answer questions about piecewise function. As usual, we have a

6
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:27,019
few problems from the recent work to summarize. Let's look at those now.
