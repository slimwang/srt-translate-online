00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,072
Let's consider the same problem with a constant added to our dividend. The

2
00:00:04,072 --> 00:00:08,232
dividend is simply the thing that we're dividing into, and the divisor is the

3
00:00:08,232 --> 00:00:12,672
second thing that we're dividing by. How would adding this constant 4 change our

4
00:00:12,672 --> 00:00:16,891
answer? What new term would we need to include? Take some time to think about

5
00:00:16,891 --> 00:00:20,440
this, and then when you're ready, write your answer in this box.
