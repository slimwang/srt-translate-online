1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:05,050
So for this situation source cognitive architectures selected not

2
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:06,418
one goal but to.

3
00:00:06,418 --> 00:00:11,010
So this SOAR theory this is called an impasse.

4
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:16,340
An impasse occurs when the decision maker cannot make a decision

5
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:20,180
either because not enough knowledge is available or because multiple courses of

6
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:24,160
action there are being selected and the agent cannot decide among them.

7
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,690
In this case two actions have been selected and

8
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:28,300
the agent cannot decide between them.

9
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:31,620
Should the pitch throw a curve ball or a fast ball?

10
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:37,110
At this point SOAR will attempt to learn a rule that might break the impasse.

11
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:39,610
If the decision maker has a choice between the fast ball and

12
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:41,600
the curve ball and it cannot decide it,

13
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,270
might there be a way of learning a rule that decides between what to

14
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:50,180
throw in a particular situation given the choice of the fast falling curve ball.

15
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:54,850
For this now SOAR will invoke episodic knowledge.

16
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:56,360
Let's see how SOAR does that and

17
00:00:56,360 --> 00:01:01,910
how it can help SOAR learn the rule that results in the breaking of the impasse.

18
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:06,870
So imagine that SOAR had episodic knowledge about the previous event,

19
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:08,860
about the previous instance of an event.

20
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:13,890
And this previous instance of an event in another game

21
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:18,510
it was a fifth inning bottom of the fifth inning, if the weather was windy it

22
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:23,980
was the same batter though, Parra, who bats left handed.

23
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:28,580
It was a similar kind of situation and the pitcher threw a fastball and

24
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:30,024
Parra hit a homerun out of it.

25
00:01:30,024 --> 00:01:31,870
Now we want to avoid that.

26
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:33,970
The current pitcher wants to avoid it.

27
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:38,395
So given this episodic knowledge about this even set occurred earlier,

28
00:01:38,395 --> 00:01:42,850
SOAR has learning mechanism that allows it to

29
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:46,740
encapsulate knowledge from this event into the form of

30
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:50,440
a production rule that can be used as part of the procedural knowledge.

31
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:54,370
And the learned rule is, if two operators are suggested, and

32
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:58,006
threw a fast ball is one of those operators, and the batter is Parra,

33
00:01:58,006 --> 00:02:01,280
then dismiss throw-fast-ball operator.

34
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,490
This is the process of learning called chunking.

35
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:10,120
So, chunking is a process, a learning technique that's SOAR uses

36
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:13,500
to learn rules that can break impasse.

37
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:17,270
First note, that chunking is triggered when impasse occurs.

38
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:20,969
In this situation, the impasse is that two rules got activated and

39
00:02:20,969 --> 00:02:23,362
there is no way of resolving between them.

40
00:02:23,362 --> 00:02:27,327
So the impasse imagery tells the process of chunking,

41
00:02:27,327 --> 00:02:29,980
what the goal of chunking is.

42
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:32,670
Find a rule that can break the impasse.

43
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:36,131
SOAR now searches for the episodic memory and

44
00:02:36,131 --> 00:02:42,210
finds an event that has some knowledge that may break the impulse.

45
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:46,183
In particular, it looks like a perceptual current situation that we had in

46
00:02:46,183 --> 00:02:47,073
previous shot.

47
00:02:47,073 --> 00:02:51,629
And compared to the perceptions of previous situations, of the event memory,

48
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:53,125
the episodic memory, and

49
00:02:53,125 --> 00:02:57,420
find that any information available of the current batter.

50
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:02,000
If some information is available that tells, SOAR the result of some previous

51
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,010
action that also occurs in the current impasse, then SOAR picks that event.

52
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:11,380
So now it tries to encapsulate the result of the previous event,

53
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:12,890
in the form of a rule.

54
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:16,850
In this case, it wants to avoid the result of a homerun, and

55
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:21,050
therefore it says dismiss that particular operator.

56
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:23,230
If it wanted that particular result,

57
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:26,290
it would have said throw that particular operator.

58
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:30,580
We said earlier that in cognitive systems, reasoning, learning and

59
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:33,170
memory are closely connected.

60
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:35,100
Here is an example of that.

61
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:39,361
We're dealing with memory, procedural memory, we're dealing with memory that can

62
00:03:39,361 --> 00:03:42,380
deal with procedural knowledge and episodic knowledge.

63
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:44,690
Dealing with reasoning, decision making.

64
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:47,250
We're also dealing with learning, chunking.

65
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:50,998
