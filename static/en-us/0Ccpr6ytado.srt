00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Existing markets--well, the customers--well, they're know. We know who they are. They exist.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
The customer needs--well, we could ask them--

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
"What do they really care about for gains and pains." They could tell us.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Competitors, by definition, they are many.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
The risk--well the risk is lack of branding, lack of sales, lack of distribution,

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
and well unfortunately, sometimes your product really does not live up to the claims.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Example, well the Google. It's an existing market.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Go ahead and try to enter your search business to that. It's a dominant player in search.
