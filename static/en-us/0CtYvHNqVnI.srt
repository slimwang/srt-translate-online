1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,919
Let's update the viewDidLoad function,

2
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:03,810
so that the stop recording button is

3
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:05,910
disabled right from the start.

4
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:08,820
Like this line “stopRecordingButton.isEnabled = false”.

5
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:11,820
This disables

6
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,320
the stop recording button by default.

7
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,019
But now we need a way to re-enable this

8
00:00:16,019 --> 00:00:17,730
button after the user begins recording

9
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:20,519
in the same way we want to disable the

10
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:22,949
stop recording button again after the

11
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:25,980
user finishes recording. There are two

12
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:27,539
functions that you wrote earlier that

13
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:30,028
can help us here. They are recordAudio

14
00:00:30,028 --> 00:00:33,509
and stopRecording. In the recordAudio

15
00:00:33,509 --> 00:00:35,789
function, add a line to enable the stop

16
00:00:35,789 --> 00:00:37,890
recording button and add another line to

17
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:40,320
disable the record button, as the user is

18
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,079
already recording at this point.

19
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:44,399
I’m also going to remove our print statement

20
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,109
from earlier.

21
00:00:46,109 --> 00:00:48,810
Finally, in the stop recording button

22
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:51,780
we should add these three lines

23
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:53,880
The first enables the record button.

24
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,590
Since we're done recording,

25
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:58,590
we could start a new recording at this point.

26
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:00,299
The next line is to disable the stop

27
00:01:00,299 --> 00:01:01,799
recording button, because at this point

28
00:01:01,799 --> 00:01:05,040
there's nothing left to stop. And finally

29
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,769
we'll update the label to Tap to Record.

30
00:01:07,769 --> 00:01:10,228
And I’m also going to remove our print

31
00:01:10,228 --> 00:01:11,700
statement from this function.

32
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:17,670
Alright, let's test it. We can see right

33
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:19,379
away that the stop recording button has

34
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:23,670
been disabled when the view loads.

35
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:25,799
If we click to record, the label changes and

36
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:26,969
the stop recording button becomes enabled.

37
00:01:26,969 --> 00:01:30,090
At the same time, the recording

38
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,250
button is disabled, because we should be

39
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:36,750
recording at this point. If we hit stop,

40
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:38,129
then the recording button is enabled

41
00:01:38,129 --> 00:01:40,379
again and the label changes back to its

42
00:01:40,379 --> 00:01:45,920
original state.
