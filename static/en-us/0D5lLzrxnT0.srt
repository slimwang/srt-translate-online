1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:04,649
Some of the issues that arise from doing this, we talked about keeping a pile,

2
00:00:04,649 --> 00:00:08,988
and it's really the system as a whole that keeps the pile and we're not going to

3
00:00:08,988 --> 00:00:14,363
explicitly represent the system ourselves. There was the phrase that we had,

4
00:00:14,363 --> 00:00:20,230
has been counted, and really has been counted is more a description of

5
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:25,647
a state then an action verb. Okay, so we could say count is an action verb but

6
00:00:25,647 --> 00:00:30,259
has been counted as more a stative, or stative situations, so

7
00:00:30,259 --> 00:00:36,230
we're going to revisit that when we get to looking at relationships. And

8
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:42,040
the phrases is set to, examine, and consists of. Well if you think about it

9
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:47,470
those are really an expression of what is the case.

10
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:50,610
So, when you examine something, you find out what is the case there.

11
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:54,880
If you examine a counter, you get back the count. These are really

12
00:00:54,880 --> 00:01:00,250
ultimately going to be represented in our implementation with some kind of eq,

13
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:05,770
equality check. And so, we're going to assume that all the classes that we have

14
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:10,460
eventually come out with are going to have an equality operator associated with

15
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:13,820
them. So we're not going to explicitly model those at this time.
