1
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:03,250
In this lesson, you learned how to create reports and

2
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:05,939
charts and dashboards. And really to wrap that all up

3
00:00:05,939 --> 00:00:10,700
in a nutshell, you learned how to present data visually,

4
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:13,420
to people in a way that they can understand it.

5
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:16,290
Dashboards especially allow you to see exactly what you want to

6
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:19,550
see, when you want to see it, where you want to see

7
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:22,410
it. In the next lesson, you're going to learn how

8
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:26,060
to automate manual tasks using workflow rules and approval processes.

9
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,630
It's going to be a lot of fun. See you there.
