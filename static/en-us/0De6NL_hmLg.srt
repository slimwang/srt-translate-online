00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,210
The next thing I want us to find, is the horizontal asymptote of this function.

2
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:06,939
Remember that the way we found this before, was we divided the numerator by the

3
00:00:06,939 --> 00:00:13,513
denominator. So, why don't we take a step back and just do that first? So let's

4
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:17,616
start by just doing that division. What is 8 x squared minus 1 divided by 4 x

5
00:00:17,616 --> 00:00:19,600
squared minus 9?
