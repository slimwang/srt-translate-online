1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:04,715
So here you can see I've implemented
the ActivityDetectionBroadcastReceiver

2
00:00:04,715 --> 00:00:07,880
class, and this extends
BroadcastReceiver as we had said.

3
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:12,120
In here I've just created
the onReceive @Override and

4
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:15,350
this takes a Context context and
an Intent intent.

5
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:19,250
Now you may notice that this class
is embedded within the main class,

6
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:22,430
here's my opening bracket for the class,
and here's the closing bracket for

7
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:23,390
the class.

8
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:27,578
But underneath here, we still have
the closing bracket of the main class,

9
00:00:27,578 --> 00:00:30,648
our main activity, and
there is its opening bracket.

10
00:00:30,648 --> 00:00:34,451
So our entire class is encapsulated
within the main class, and

11
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:38,899
this is really useful because we can
then pass data back to the main class,

12
00:00:38,899 --> 00:00:42,002
or call methods on the main
class from inside here.

13
00:00:42,002 --> 00:00:45,646
So what we're going to do now is
implement the onReceive function.

14
00:00:45,646 --> 00:00:49,330
So this is going to catch the data that
was broadcasted by the local broadcast

15
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:51,830
manager with the activities details.

16
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:55,690
And we'll take them and use that to
update the UI on the main class itself.
