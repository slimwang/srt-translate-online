Hi, my name is Sydney Richardson.

2
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:06,939
I'm an iOS developer at Double Dutch
where we make mobile event apps.

3
00:00:06,939 --> 00:00:11,330
I was originally studying art and
graphic design,

4
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:14,502
but I really loved math and science.

5
00:00:14,502 --> 00:00:18,053
And when I went to college
my parents were like,

6
00:00:18,053 --> 00:00:21,708
why don't you study something
within engineering?

7
00:00:21,708 --> 00:00:26,320
And my graphic design teacher encouraged
me to look into computer science.

8
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,170
So, I took a class.

9
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:33,300
Since I've been here, we've been working
on our in-app direct messaging service,

10
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:37,640
where users at an event can
connect to people one on

11
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:43,150
one without having the barrier of not
having their contact information.

12
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:48,430
We use Xcode, and we've been we're
writing everything in Objective-C.

13
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:52,430
You face a lot of different problems,

14
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:58,430
including view problems, or
API connection problems,

15
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:03,189
core data, core location, and bluetooth.

16
00:01:03,189 --> 00:01:06,447
But, first I looked at
Apple documents and

17
00:01:06,447 --> 00:01:11,708
what do i need to know before I start
coding something with core data?

18
00:01:11,708 --> 00:01:16,280
And they'll give you
the directions to get started.

19
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:19,150
If you're having a problem you can
just look it up on the Internet and

20
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:21,050
someone is bound to have answered it,

21
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:23,850
or someone is also going to
be in the same boat as you.

22
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:30,960
I think mobile programming is a lot of
fun because you can immediately see

23
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:36,454
it on your device, or you can
immediately impact your friend or you.
