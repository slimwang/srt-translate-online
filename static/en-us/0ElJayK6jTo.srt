1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:00,880
All right, Charles.
So

2
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:05,140
now that I've talked through how we can
compute these outcome based estimates

3
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:06,700
with these TD1 estimates,

4
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:10,510
I'm going to try to tell you that
it's not exactly what we want.

5
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:15,000
I'm going try to explain why
TD1 kind of is wrong sometimes.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,480
>> Okay.
>> To do this we're going to go back to

7
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:22,430
the example we've looked at before where
we've got this markup chain with rewards

8
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:29,330
and we're observing some trajectories
through it like S1, S3, S4, S final.

9
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,320
And so we observe a bunch of those and

10
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:36,050
then the last one we
observe starting from S2.

11
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:38,740
S2, S3 S5, SF, okay?

12
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:43,266
And now what we want to figure
out is what does TD1, or

13
00:00:43,266 --> 00:00:46,855
an outcome based estimate,
give us as an approximation for

14
00:00:46,855 --> 00:00:49,250
the value of S2 given this set of data?

15
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:53,350
And then we'll compare it to what we get
with the maximum likelihood estimate.

16
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:54,800
>> Okay.

17
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,110
Wait, you want me to do this?

18
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:56,680
>> Yeah.

19
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:59,420
>> Oh, okay, so it really is a quiz?

20
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:01,680
>> Yeah, that's what this word is.

21
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:02,500
>> All right, fine.

22
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:05,840
I think I have some questions, but
in fact, let me ask some of them now.

23
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,110
>> Yeah, I think we should make sure

24
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:08,550
it's clear enough that
you can work on it.

25
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:14,570
>> Okay, so you want me to tell you
what the value of S2 is or what I would

26
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:21,630
estimate the value of S2 to be using
sort of the TD1 outcome based estimate.

27
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:26,320
>> And there it should be the average
of the reward sequences that we've

28
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,550
seen upon encountering S2.

29
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:34,200
>> Okay that makes sense but
that has to start from somewhere.

30
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,460
>> Right, the equations require
you start from somewhere?

31
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:41,470
>> We can just average it across all the
encounters that we've had of that thing.

32
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:44,830
Since we're averaging the first time
we see it, that is the estimate.

33
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:47,580
The second time we see
it that's half of it.

34
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:48,850
>> Okay that's fair.

35
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:50,160
Okay I can deal with that.

36
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:53,450
And by maximum likelihood
estimate you just mean the value

37
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:57,020
that best fits the model,
which in this case is the MDP itself?

38
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:01,220
>> Yeah, so given the data that we've
seen so far, you can make an estimate of

39
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:06,880
how likely it is to go from S3 to S4,
S3 to S5, S1 to S3, S2 to S3.

40
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,690
So you can use the data that you’ve seen
to estimate the probabilities in this

41
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:13,770
model, which aren’t going to be exactly
what they show here because this

42
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:14,640
is the true model.

43
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,790
But we can estimate
it based on the data.

44
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:20,690
And then we can say, okay, given that
estimate, what is the value of S2?

45
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:22,090
>> Okay, that seems reasonable.

46
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:23,570
Okay, I can do that.

47
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:24,260
>> All right.
So but

48
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:26,330
you should probably also ask
what the discount factor is.

49
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:28,140
>> Oh, yeah, what’s the discount factor?

50
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:29,130
>> Good question.

51
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:31,350
Just for simplicity we'll go
with gam equals one again.

52
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:32,310
>> Okay, go.
