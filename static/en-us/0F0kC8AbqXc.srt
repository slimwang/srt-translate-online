1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,620
Lot of people are faced
with this problem of

2
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:06,540
how do you evaluate the level of
security that comes with the system.

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:11,970
No one more concerned about this then,
for example, the Defense Department.

4
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:13,660
They have a lot of sensitive data.

5
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:17,830
So they actually address this problem
of how do you do security evaluation?

6
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:20,820
How do you establish how trustworthy or

7
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:26,080
level of assurance, level of trust that
you can associate with a given system?

8
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,800
And they actually came up with a trusted
computer system evaluation criteria.

9
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,540
This is work that goes
back to actually the 80s.

10
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:39,890
And this is called the Orange Book or
TCSEC Requirements.

11
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:42,370
Trusted Computer System
Evaluation Criteria.

12
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:45,780
What you see here is,
actually it doesn't the color.

13
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:47,090
Actually it is orange.

14
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:49,880
Copy the color page of that report.

15
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:53,780
Now one of the people who were involved
in designing that, Roger Shell,

16
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:56,510
who signed it, my copy.

17
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:59,750
So I just provided you
a picture of that.

18
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:04,840
So the question is if you
are sort of tasked with this,

19
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:09,350
develop a sort of violation
criteria that we can use to

20
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:12,840
assess the trustworthiness or
security of the system.

21
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,100
What would be those criteria?

22
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:19,020
I think some of the discussions we have
had for example about functionality and

23
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:20,260
how well it's done and so

24
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:24,820
on, should actually factor into these
requirements that we're going to have.

25
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:30,450
So the Orange Book that I mentioned sort
of captured the evaluation criteria,

26
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:35,660
and came up with sort of way to
place a system in a division,

27
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:38,040
and within a division, a certain class.

28
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:42,430
So, the four divisions were D,
C, B and A.

29
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:46,330
The less than really refers
to the least trustworthy and

30
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:49,000
we'll see why D was
the least trustworthy.

31
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,690
And A was the highest level of trust.

32
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:57,260
And within that, for example,
the division C had C1 and C2, so C1

33
00:01:57,260 --> 00:02:02,080
doesn't do certain things that C2 does
for it to be more trustworthy, okay?

34
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:05,150
So this ordering that we have
is going from least trustworthy

35
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:06,810
to the highest level of trust.

36
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:10,250
B1, B2, B3 means three classes
within the duration B.

37
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:12,450
Well, D really didn't
have to do anything.

38
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:16,640
If you didn't do, think about
your old MS Dos, if you didn't

39
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:21,720
isolate the trusted computing base
from untrusted code, basically

40
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:25,930
untrusted code could hook operating
system functions in whatever way.

41
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:31,110
There's no protection against tampering,
bypassing, or things like that.

42
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:35,060
See, one of the things it has to do is
do authentication and access control.

43
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:36,660
Okay?.
Access control.

44
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:39,480
It only has to do discretionary
access control but

45
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:43,000
of course to do access control it
also has to do authentication and

46
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,390
if it does that then it addresses
a bunch of other things.

47
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:49,430
Just sort of giving you
quick highlights here but

48
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:53,800
of course in a TC isolation and
stuff like that has to be here too.

49
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,920
So that places you in division C.

50
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:59,510
If you implemented
mandatory access control.

51
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:04,540
For example, BLP like model, where
that will move you up to division B.

52
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:08,610
And you can verify,
use formal verification techniques.

53
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:10,490
Specification in verification.

54
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:13,990
If you went that far,
then that's what will be needed for

55
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:16,620
you to get into division A.

56
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:21,870
Most systems that we use that
the security features that they provide,

57
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:25,540
commercial systems that are widely
deployed, they're basically in

58
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:30,350
the C division and C1, C2, or
whether they move up to get B1,

59
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:32,610
of course,
they have to do mandatory axis control.

60
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:36,920
So we said SELinux, for example,
does implement Mac So C1 and

61
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,690
C2 actually depends on
what functionality.

62
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:43,680
So here it, shouldn't be confused by
the fact that this we're talking about

63
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,880
functionality with discretionary and
mandatory access control.

64
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:52,220
This is actually how well effort you put
into making sure there are no problems.

65
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:58,010
So it's how well you you do,
you testing, testing,

66
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:02,970
based on all these auditing support and
audit logs and things like that.

67
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:07,670
You will have different classes, but the
main idea here is that most systems that

68
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:12,320
we use widely these days,
they basically division C some

69
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:18,269
implement Mac features and they get
into this division B1 that I have.

70
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:22,400
If you want to move up to B2 for
example, what you may have to do is,

71
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:27,750
you have to, whatever security
model that your system is,

72
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:32,080
underlies your system, you have to have
a proof of correctness for that model.

73
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,700
Or you also have to have a speck for
the TCB.

74
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:40,240
It doesn't have to formally done,
but you have to have a narrative

75
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,480
specification of the TCB and
what it does.

76
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,730
Of course if you want
to move up to B3 or

77
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:49,750
A1 beside that's formal verification
that you have to do an,

78
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:52,720
that the TCB is implemented
correctly and things like that.
