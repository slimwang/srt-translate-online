Let me do a final quiz. This is related to playing golf.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
We have a normal distribution with µ and σ² from which we draw A.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
We do the same with B using the same µ and σ². Now we combine A+B and you just add them up.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Now I would like to know how the new µ and the new σ² looks like.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
And as before, I give you a number of possibilities.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
So there are seven options in total from 2µ all the way to 0.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Please put your green number into these fields over here.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
So this will be a number within 1 and 7,

9
00:00:33,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and it indicates that the corresponding term is the correct answer for µ‘ and σ‘².
