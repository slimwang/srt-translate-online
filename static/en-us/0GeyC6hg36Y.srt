1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,810
In this lesson we're going to create and
save Conference entities.

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:06,410
These will represent the conferences
that users of our app

3
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:07,440
will create and attend.

4
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:12,950
Then we'll learn how to run queries and
use filters to query for conferences.

5
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:15,540
Let's say you've got a trip
to San Francisco in June.

6
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:18,500
You might want to check to see if there
are any conferences going on in June

7
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:19,780
while you're here.

8
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:23,070
I'll show you how to write
the code to run queries like that.

9
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:26,730
You've already learned that App Engine
optimizes query results by using

10
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:28,390
indexes.

11
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:30,620
I'll help you explore how
to create indexes, and

12
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:33,537
how to structure your queries
to make the best use of indexes.

13
00:00:33,537 --> 00:00:35,230
Constructing queries and

14
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:39,430
app engines have some differences in
querying over a relational database.

15
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:42,120
We'll explore how some of those
differences affect the way you write

16
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,350
queries.

17
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:46,560
Another key feature our application
needs is to let users register

18
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,010
for a conference.

19
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:50,720
The registration process
involves several steps.

20
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:52,860
If you enter your credit
card number to buy a ticket,

21
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:56,620
you want to make sure you get the ticket
before the payment goes through.

22
00:00:56,620 --> 00:01:00,270
So we'll use the registration process
to show how to use transactions to

23
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:02,350
make sure all the different
steps happen together.

24
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,830
Let's go create some conferences.
