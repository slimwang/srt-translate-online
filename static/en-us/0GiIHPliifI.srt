1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:04,650
So let's look at,
does label L1 dominate L2?

2
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:10,250
It doesn't because secret actually
is not higher than top-secret.

3
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:12,810
The domination fails right here.

4
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:14,260
This doesn't contain this either,

5
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:16,210
because there's no
South-America in here.

6
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:19,100
So L1 doesn't dominate L2.

7
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:21,130
Does L2 dominate L1?

8
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:25,590
Well, top-secret actually
is higher than secret but

9
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:30,230
the compartment here doesn't include
Asia, so the containment doesn't hold.

10
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:34,790
So L2 doesn't dominate L1 either and
the two are different, so actually,

11
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:38,730
in this case we're going to run into the
third option, which is the correct one.

12
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:42,080
Neither L1 nor
L2 dominates the other one and

13
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,429
they're different, so
they can't be compared.
