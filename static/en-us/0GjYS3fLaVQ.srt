1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:03,380
Users can get connected with
your app in many different ways,

2
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:05,020
from recommendations from family,

3
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:09,520
friends, or colleagues, searching
an app store, or using a search engine.

4
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:13,526
Research done by Google and
found that about 52% of app users

5
00:00:13,526 --> 00:00:17,476
surveyed found new apps through family,
friends, and colleagues.

6
00:00:17,476 --> 00:00:22,920
40% through just browsing an app store,
and 25% through search engines.

7
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:27,200
So, you can think beyond just the app
store to get your app out there.

8
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,700
You're going to want to get family,
friends, and

9
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:31,310
colleagues talking about your app and
sharing it.

10
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:33,770
So there are a ton of different
distribution channels

11
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:35,910
to give your users access to your app.

12
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:37,870
But what's right for your business?

13
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:39,670
Now here are some ideas to
kind of get you started.

14
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:43,930
You could consider having your
app preloaded into a phone.

15
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:46,760
No, I'm sorry, Apple and
Samsung probably aren't going to

16
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:50,110
come beating down your door just
to load your app on their phones.

17
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:51,460
But you can pay for it.

18
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:53,440
Pay a lot that is,
it's pretty expensive.

19
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,690
Your app will be preloaded onto
a specific mobile device and

20
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:58,579
people will just be exposed to it.

21
00:00:58,579 --> 00:01:00,650
And their more likely
to actually use it.

22
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:02,080
So the conversion rate for

23
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:06,000
these preloaded apps is
significantly higher than average.

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,964
You can optimize your own website,

25
00:01:07,964 --> 00:01:11,631
make sure to have a widget that can
be pasted on to a mobile website or

26
00:01:11,631 --> 00:01:15,778
Facebook pages for example that will
take your users directly to your app.

27
00:01:15,778 --> 00:01:18,496
Or, you could create a mobile
web version of your app.

28
00:01:18,496 --> 00:01:23,147
Now creating a mobile web version coded
in HTML5 is a great way to enable wide

29
00:01:23,147 --> 00:01:27,210
distribution outside of just
the smartphone audience.

30
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:30,010
Also, people can engage with your
product before they commit to

31
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:33,500
downloading it, which is a much
higher commitment on their end.

32
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:36,420
And don't forget about
the marketing workhorse, email.

33
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:40,470
You can also consider just emailing
links to your app to your users.

34
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:43,170
We'll go over many more options
later in the course, but

35
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:45,490
I want you to get started
thinking about these things.

36
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:46,550
Start getting creative,

37
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:49,080
because when it comes to
marketing ideas, sky's the limit.
