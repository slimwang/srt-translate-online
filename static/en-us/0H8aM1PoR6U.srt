1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,840
After we connect the client in
the onStart, it takes some time for

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,220
the connection to happen.

3
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:08,340
And when it does,
the onConnected callback will fire.

4
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:09,820
This is the meat of our app.

5
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:12,590
We've connected to location services,
so we should be

6
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:16,610
able to get the last location
from the fused location provider.

7
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:19,480
And if we do get something,
then we can read the latitude and

8
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:20,940
the longitude from it.

9
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:22,540
We convert that to a string and

10
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:25,250
then load it into the appropriate
text field as you can see here.

11
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:29,690
Now, remember, all this will happen
if last location is not null.

12
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:33,020
So, here I've just checked if
mLastLocation is not equal to null,

13
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:34,480
then I will do all of this.

14
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,320
Because if it was equal to null,
then getting the latitude and

15
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,990
getting the longitude
might produce an error.
