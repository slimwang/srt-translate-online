[Thrun] This is a quiz in which I compare EM versus K-means.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Suppose we are giving you 4 data points, as indicated by those circles.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Suppose we have 2 initial cluster centers, shown here in red,

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
and those converge to possible places that are indicated by those 4 squares.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Of course they won't take all 4 of them; they will just take 2 of them.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
But for now I'm going to give you 4 choices.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
We call this cluster 1, cluster 2, A, B, C, and D.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
In EM will C1 move towards A or will C1 move towards B?

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
And in contrast, in K-means will C1 move towards A

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
or will C1 move towards B?

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
This is just asking about the left side of the diagram.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
So the question is will K-means find itself in the more extreme situation,

13
00:00:44,000 --> 99:59:59,999
or will EM find itself in the more extreme situation?
