1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:05,129
A common pattern is when the most
important element of your UI

2
00:00:05,129 --> 00:00:06,639
is the content.

3
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:09,480
Think of a catalog or a photo app.

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:12,380
The most important
aspect is the picture.

5
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:17,375
Put some extra chrome here and
there, content is king.

6
00:00:17,375 --> 00:00:21,550
Now, let's layout the views,
we'll have a label here,

7
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:25,830
an image view in the middle and
down here I'll have a button.

8
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:31,480
Now, we're going to put this three
views inside a vertical stack view.

9
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:36,264
And then,
pin the stack view to the margins.

10
00:00:36,264 --> 00:00:43,823

11
00:00:43,823 --> 00:00:46,072
[SOUND] Not good.

12
00:00:46,072 --> 00:00:50,940
Auto layout is not using
the frame that is was instructed.

13
00:00:50,939 --> 00:00:55,775
You can fix this quite easily by

14
00:00:55,776 --> 00:01:01,170
clicking here and update frames.

15
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:05,049
So still not exactly
what we're looking for.

16
00:01:05,049 --> 00:01:10,500
Let's see how it looks
like on landscape.

17
00:01:10,501 --> 00:01:13,480
So let's make a check list of

18
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:17,299
all the little things that
aren't working as they should.

19
00:01:17,299 --> 00:01:21,799
First of all,
the button is way too tall and

20
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:25,769
there's a lot of wasted
space on the sides.

21
00:01:25,769 --> 00:01:28,420
So remember the commandments?

22
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:32,920
The first commandment,
tweak the properties of the stack view,

23
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:36,299
will fix our problem number two.

24
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:38,780
So we're going to set
the alignment to fill.

25
00:01:40,109 --> 00:01:43,689
To fix the other issues we
need the third commandment,

26
00:01:43,689 --> 00:01:46,420
change compression and hugging.

27
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:50,760
The image over here is being too
stubborn about it's size, so

28
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,070
let's lower that.

29
00:01:52,069 --> 00:01:54,398
Both the content hugging and
the compression.

30
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:57,786
[BLANK_AUDIO]

31
00:01:57,786 --> 00:02:03,150
Last but not least, let's make sure
that the whole image is always shown,

32
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:08,109
and has the right proportions so
we need to set its mode to aspect fit.

33
00:02:10,931 --> 00:02:14,020
Just to make sure that the image
view is working correctly

34
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:17,250
I'll use one of the images
that I have here.

35
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:22,889
Now, it's perfect although we could add
some separation between the elements.

36
00:02:22,889 --> 00:02:27,729
That's very easy,
we just select the Stack View and

37
00:02:27,729 --> 00:02:31,119
create some spacing, let's say 8.

38
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,500
And now, it does look perfect.

39
00:02:33,669 --> 00:02:38,339
So try it on some other
devices by clicking here and

40
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:40,370
also some orientations.

41
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:45,430
Make sure it works, try it on
a simulator, maybe even on a device.

42
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:49,936
Before you move on, please make
sure you understand everything that

43
00:02:49,936 --> 00:02:54,454
didn't work at the beginning,
why it didn't, and how we fixed it.

44
00:02:54,454 --> 00:02:54,504
