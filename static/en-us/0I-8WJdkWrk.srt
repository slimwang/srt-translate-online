1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The answer here is you get no path.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This criterion alone asks that all the y's are as similar as possible.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
If it's minimized, then all the y's are the same, which means you only get a single point,

4
00:00:11,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and we get no path at all.
