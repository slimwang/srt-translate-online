1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,710
So similar to before now, just like I opened this aperture,

2
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:07,860
I can open a specific aperture region of specific control,

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:11,840
that would only get light through, I mean, in a controlled manner to my camera.

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,300
So far I've talked about what kind of control to put in here.

5
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:15,560
We'll talk about that in a bit.

6
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,660
But imagine that we could do this, and

7
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:20,990
of course now a novel scene would be generated for this camera.

8
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:24,860
Of course, I can move this, and generate new sources of light, and

9
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:29,080
that would allow me to produce a whole new way of doing cameras.

10
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:33,810
Of course, all of this suggests is now we have a novel form of photography.

11
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:37,210
This is referred to as dual photography, and you can imagine that both

12
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:42,190
the camera and the projector, the light source and the sensor, are swappable.

13
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:43,620
You can actually swap them around, and

14
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:45,540
that's what they mean by dual photography.

15
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:47,310
We'll explain that in a bit.

16
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:51,300
In this instance what I would do now is, I would basically open a specific

17
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:55,300
aperture and relate it back to what light source was illuminating it.

18
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:58,660
So that way now I can actually start seeing more controllable,

19
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:02,330
what illumination results in what changes in the image.

20
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:06,060
By just controlling these two aspects together, we could learn a lot more.

21
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:09,940
At least, learn more about the scene and how it's illuminating and

22
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:11,210
how to capture it.

23
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:15,250
Question is, in doing so, can we come up with a newer form of

24
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:19,870
image representation that says more about this image than it did before?
