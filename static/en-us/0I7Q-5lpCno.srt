1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:02,150
Are you ready to give it a try?

2
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:03,850
What are the set of media queries,

3
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:08,590
you need to apply in order to
apply styles from these classes?

4
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:10,950
Use this diagram as a guide.

5
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:15,010
Class AA applies from 0 to 400 pixels.

6
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:19,380
Class BB applies from 301 pixels to 600.

7
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:24,650
CC applies for any browser with a width,
greater than 601 pixels.

8
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:30,131
And DD applies for any browser with
a width greater than 961 pixels.

9
00:00:30,131 --> 00:00:31,900
You'll need to write four media queries.

10
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:38,130
One for class AA, one for
class BB, CC, and DD.

11
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:42,200
In order for a class to display,
set it to display block.

12
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,890
And when you type out your answers.

13
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:48,210
Don't worry about new lines, just make
your media queries one long line so

14
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:49,720
they fit in the box.

15
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:53,970
I'll go ahead and start you off with
@media for each of the media queries.

16
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:57,580
And then at the end of it I went
ahead and drew these curly braces.

17
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:01,170
If these were real media queries,
this is where the styles would go.

18
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:02,330
Finish them up and good luck.
