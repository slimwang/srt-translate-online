1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,140
Okay, we are going to talk about a technique called

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:05,290
hashing, and hashing is a technique we can use

3
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:10,010
to verify the legitimacy of, of our data. So,

4
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:12,010
what is, what is, what is hashing, what is a

5
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:15,300
hash. Basically a hash is, is, is a function,

6
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:18,380
now let's call it H, that when you apply

7
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:21,985
this function to some data, you get Y. Now,

8
00:00:21,985 --> 00:00:24,665
so we'll say X is some data basically you know,

9
00:00:24,665 --> 00:00:29,288
ultimately a number but you know, it's, it's you know how data is presented in a

10
00:00:29,288 --> 00:00:33,350
computer. Most of our functions will be dealing

11
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:36,618
with string and it returns this value Y,

12
00:00:36,618 --> 00:00:43,270
which is a fixed length bit string. Usually you know on the the order of. Now,

13
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:46,230
depending on the algorithm, 32 to 256 bits,

14
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:49,900
you know, are the, are the the algorithms

15
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:52,306
we'll be dealing with. It, it can be arbitrarily

16
00:00:52,306 --> 00:00:54,910
length, but the, the kind of common functions we'll be

17
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:58,540
dealing with basically take X you know data X

18
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:01,850
of any size, you know, some big, long bit string,

19
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:05,720
and returns a function, or returns a value Y

20
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:10,120
that is fixed length. and, and hashes have a lot

21
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,380
of uses. And they have a lot of properties

22
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:15,100
too. So let's talk about some of the properties of

23
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:18,230
this hash function H. Okay, so generally, a

24
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:19,780
property of a hash function. A good hash

25
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:22,240
function H is that for a particular value

26
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,260
of Y. For a particular output. It's really difficult

27
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:30,720
to find an X that'll generate that Y. You

28
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,460
know there is, it's, it's very difficult to find a piece of data

29
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:40,340
that hashes to something specific. Likewise, it should be infeasible, you know,

30
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:44,410
practically impossible to find a particular input X.

31
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:48,570
For particular output Y. So if we hash some

32
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:51,300
value into some you know, other value Y. We

33
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,260
take that other value Y and we cannot reverse

34
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:55,470
this. This means it's a, a, a one-way

35
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:57,890
function. Another property of a hash function, a good

36
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:01,610
hash function, is you can't modify X without significantly

37
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:05,420
modifying Y, and. Generally you want if you just

38
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:08,270
change one bit in X, which could be you know, thousands

39
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:12,870
of bytes long, you want Y to be completely different. And

40
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:15,260
again, this, this you know, kind of hinges on some of

41
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:18,930
these other properties as well. But basically the whole idea is that

42
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:22,160
for any particular X, you get a unique Y. You can't

43
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,000
get the X from that Y, and changing the X just a

44
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,350
little bit gives you a totally unique Y. So, there's very

45
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:30,440
little correlation between X and Y. You know, each of these properties

46
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,890
has a vocabulary word associated with it

47
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:35,960
and some more rigorous explanation. And if you

48
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,550
would like to learn about those things,

49
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:43,900
you should take CS387, which is applied cryptography.

50
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,640
And this is you'll learn, you'll learn

51
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,660
about hashes to death, we're going to use hashes

52
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:51,234
quite a bit in this lecture because it's a really handy way of verifying data.
