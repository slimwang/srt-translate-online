00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,572
So a x gets bigger and bigger, our function is going to approach the line y

2
00:00:04,572 --> 00:00:10,800
equals 2x plus 7. This is called a slant asymptote. We'll see in a second how

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,642
this shows up on our graph, but first, I'd like for us find the vertical

4
00:00:13,642 --> 00:00:18,710
asymptote for this function. Please write its equation in this box.
