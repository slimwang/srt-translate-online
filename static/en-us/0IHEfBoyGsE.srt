00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Well, now for the answer--the issue with html input of course,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
is that it contains confidential information.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
We really don't want the entire world to know who we are

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and which websites we visit.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
So, we have seen that there is indeed confidential information in here.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
If we center out this data in order to reproduce the bug,

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
this means that the sensitive data may be out of control.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
This means that developers may get access to it

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
with plenty of possible issues that follow.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
There are multiple solutions to that.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
First to keep the data secret, for instance you could sign

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
a nondisclosure agreement with your customer

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
before you ever get access to such data.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
The second option is simply to anonymize the data.

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
That is, you produce a version of the data

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
with the sensitive information removed.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
You can also use a technique like Delta Debugging

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
to simply file the input automatically

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
and to keep only those characters that are actually required to reproduce the failure.
