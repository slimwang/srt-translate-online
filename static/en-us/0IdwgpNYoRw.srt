00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,670
Let's take a quiz that looks at
a problem involving timeslices and

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:05,060
their values.

3
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:09,420
On a single CPU system, consider
the following workload and conditions.

4
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:13,990
We have ten I/O bound tasks in
the system and one CPU bound task.

5
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:17,370
The I/O bound tasks
issue one I/O operation

6
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:21,330
every one milliseconds
of CPU compute time.

7
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:25,160
I/O operations always take
10 milliseconds to complete.

8
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:28,930
The context switching
overhead is 0.1 millisecond.

9
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:31,910
And at the end also all
tasks are long running.

10
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:35,770
So we're not reporting any kind
of execution time for the tasks.

11
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:39,580
Given this, answer first,
what is the CPU utilization for

12
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:44,430
a round robin scheduler with
a timeslice of one millisecond.

13
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:47,410
How about for
a 10 millisecond timeslice?

14
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:52,440
Provide the two answers here, and round
them up to the nearest percent value.

15
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,220
The formula for

16
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:56,620
computing CPU utilization is
provided in the Instructor's Notes.
