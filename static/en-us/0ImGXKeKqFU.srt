1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
And the answer is 48.6.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
And obviously, it's not quite as trivial as the calculation before

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
because there's 2 competing actions.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
We can try to go north, which gives us the 77

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
but risks the chance of falling into the -100.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Or we can go west, as before, which gives us a much smaller chance

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
to reach 77, but avoids the -100.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Let's do both and see which one is better.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
If we go north, we have a 0.8 chance of reaching 77.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
There's now a 10% chance of paying -100

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
and a 10% chance of staying in the same location,

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
which at this point is still a value of 0.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
We subtract our costs of 3, and we get 61.6

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
- 10 - 3 = 48.6.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Let's check the west action value.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
We reach the 77 with probability 0.1

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
with 0.8 chance we stay in the same cell,

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
which has the value of 0,

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
and with 0.1 chance, we end up down here,

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
which also has a value of 0.

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
We subtract our costs of -3,

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
and that gives us 7.7 - 3 = 4.7.

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
At this point, going west is vastly inferior

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
to going north, and the reason is we already propagated

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
a great value of 77 for this cell over here,

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
whereas this one is still set to 0.

27
00:01:28,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So, we will set it to 48.6.
