00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,070
The solution to this absolute value in equality is the interval from negative

2
00:00:05,082 --> 00:00:10,628
infinity to negative 7 3rds unioned with the interval from 1 to infinity. Lets

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:15,798
see how we got that. When I see an absolute value inequality with a greater than

4
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:21,029
or equal, I know that I'm going to have a union. Which means that I have to

5
00:00:21,041 --> 00:00:26,394
separate this into two different cases, and connect them with an or. So, I'm

6
00:00:26,406 --> 00:00:31,657
going to write my two cases right here. The first case is, 3x plus 2 is greater

7
00:00:31,669 --> 00:00:36,946
than or equal to 5. It's exactly the same as the original problem, without the

8
00:00:36,958 --> 00:00:42,157
absolute value, and then I need the or. The second case is going to be the

9
00:00:42,169 --> 00:00:47,174
absolute value or 3x plus 2, and we have to switch the direction of the

10
00:00:47,186 --> 00:00:52,833
inequality. And we have to change the sign. So, the absolute value of 3x plus 2

11
00:00:52,845 --> 00:00:58,139
is greater than or equal to 5. Is the same as the compound inequality 3x plus 2

12
00:00:58,151 --> 00:01:02,970
is greater than or equal to 5, or 3x plus 2 is less than or equal to negative 5.

13
00:01:03,078 --> 00:01:07,839
Remember, when we're solving compound inequalities, we need to solve each of

14
00:01:07,851 --> 00:01:13,287
these inequalities independently. So, let's start with this one. I can subtract

15
00:01:13,299 --> 00:01:19,643
2 from both sides, and I get 3x is greater than or equal to 3, and divide both

16
00:01:19,655 --> 00:01:25,206
sides by 3, and I get x is greater than or equal to 1. For the second

17
00:01:25,218 --> 00:01:31,769
inequality, I do the same thing, by subtracting 2 from both sides, And I get 3x

18
00:01:31,781 --> 00:01:38,430
is less than or equal to negative 7. Divide both sides by 3 and I get x is less

19
00:01:38,442 --> 00:01:44,713
than or equal to negative 7 3rds. If I want to draw this on the number line,

20
00:01:44,851 --> 00:01:51,620
we'll put 0 right here. Here's 1. And negative 7 3rds is equal to negative 2 and

21
00:01:51,632 --> 00:01:57,340
1 3rd. To graph x is greater than or equal to 1 on the number line I use a

22
00:01:57,352 --> 00:02:03,320
square bracket and I know I want everything greater than. To graph x is less

23
00:02:03,332 --> 00:02:09,759
than or equal to negative 2 and 1 3rd I go about negative 2 and a 3rd and, since

24
00:02:09,771 --> 00:02:15,625
x is less than. Then I want to go in that directions, and that's how we get our

25
00:02:15,637 --> 00:02:21,428
interval notation here we have negative infinity to negative 7 3rd with a square

26
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:27,248
bracket because it's less then, or equal to, and I union that with the interval

27
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:33,251
from 1 to infinity again with the square bracket because it's greater than. Are

28
00:02:33,263 --> 00:02:36,813
equal to. Let's try one more absolute value inequality.
