1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:01,120
Here are my plots for

2
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:04,740
the total number of minutes spent
in the classroom in the first week.

3
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:08,029
We saw earlier that the mean number
of minutes spent was much higher for

4
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:09,820
students who passed the project, and

5
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:13,245
we can see that here since these labels
are increasing faster than these.

6
00:00:14,305 --> 00:00:17,565
We can also see that for students who
passed, the number of students who fall

7
00:00:17,565 --> 00:00:22,165
into one of the longer buckets is higher
relative to the non-passing students.

8
00:00:22,165 --> 00:00:26,300
On the other hand, the rough shape of
the two histograms is fairly similar.

9
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:28,560
Most students spent
the shortest amount of time.

10
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:29,270
And then fewer and

11
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:32,880
fewer students fall in each bucket
as you increase the amount of time.

12
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,990
This shape holds for
both students who pass and

13
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:37,690
students who don't
pass the first project.

14
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:40,990
These are the histograms for
number of lessons completed.

15
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:44,600
Again, the shapes of the two histograms
look fairly similar to each other

16
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:47,160
although you can see that the mean
is higher for passing students.

17
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,510
Which is in line with
what we saw earlier.

18
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:52,340
Finally, here are the histograms
that I got for number days visited.

19
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:56,840
You'll notice that in both histograms
there are these weird gaps.

20
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,550
That's because of
the number of bins chosen.

21
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:01,600
This data can only be
integers from 0 to 7,

22
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,069
so if too many bins are created,
then some bins will be completely empty.

23
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:06,910
And that's what happened here.

24
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:09,730
I'm going to fix this later in the
lesson, but if you'd like to fix it now,

25
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:12,140
there's some advice in
the instructor notes.

26
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:13,090
Ignoring the gaps for

27
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:17,180
a moment, I can see that the shapes of
these two histograms are very different.

28
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:20,480
For non-passing students, the shape
is similar to earlier, where less and

29
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:23,840
less students are in each bucket as
the bucket corresponds to more and

30
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,020
more days.

31
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:28,000
However, for the passing students,
there's a very different pattern.

32
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,230
You can see that students who passed the
first project are about equally likely

33
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:34,669
to visit the classroom 7 days
during their first week, as 0 days.

34
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,441
To make these histograms,

35
00:01:37,441 --> 00:01:41,606
I added to the line plt.hist(data)
to my described data function.

36
00:01:41,606 --> 00:01:44,250
That way I would be able to
easily make the histogram for

37
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:47,870
each metric by rerunning the later
cells where I describe the data.

38
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:51,200
And the histograms would show up
next to the summary statistics.

39
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,970
Of course in order for this line to
work I needed to import map plot lib.

40
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:58,770
And I also added the line %pylab
inline to the top of the cell.

41
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:02,160
So that my plots would show up within my
notebook and not in a separate window.
