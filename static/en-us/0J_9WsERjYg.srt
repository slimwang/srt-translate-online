1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:04,260
We mentioned before that YouTube can be
a great platform to host videos as part

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:05,920
of your content marketing.

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:09,090
Now YouTube could also be a great
place for paid marketing.

4
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:10,990
It's still a young advertising place, so

5
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:13,760
you may find cheaper rates than
you would on, let's say, AdWords.

6
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:17,430
Now there are a ton of different ad
formats on YouTube, and at least for

7
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:21,310
videos, you only have to pay for the ads
that people actually engage with.

8
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:24,238
So if someone skips your ad,
you don't have to pay a cent.

9
00:00:24,238 --> 00:00:28,218
Now, on the other hand, creating a high
quality video and hosting it for

10
00:00:28,218 --> 00:00:31,888
free on YouTube can generate buzz
around your product or service.

11
00:00:31,888 --> 00:00:35,780
And if you promote it on social media,
you can encourage virality.

12
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:38,660
If you're considering advertising
on YouTube with videos,

13
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:41,618
remember that the viewer's
attention span can be pretty short.

14
00:00:41,618 --> 00:00:44,440
So, you want to invest in
a high quality video that can

15
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:45,580
hook your users really quickly.

16
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:49,290
So let's explore just a couple
of the different formats you

17
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:52,910
can use on YouTube because there
are ton of options available to you.

18
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:55,930
Check out the link in the instructor
notes if you want to see all of them.

19
00:00:55,930 --> 00:01:00,150
One option is the desktop or
mobile video mastheads.

20
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:02,970
These are video ads that
play on YouTube's homepage.

21
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:05,515
On a desktop,
they play without any sound and

22
00:01:05,515 --> 00:01:10,180
it'll end as a thumbnail of your video
or any other video from your channel.

23
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:14,240
On mobile, the video thumbnails will be
available for your users to click on.

24
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,450
You can even add a link
directly to your website.

25
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:17,935
Let's look at what it does look like.

26
00:01:17,935 --> 00:01:19,515
So, here's the video masthead.

27
00:01:19,515 --> 00:01:23,425
You can also have a rich media
masthead which would go here as well.

28
00:01:23,425 --> 00:01:26,905
So the rich media mastheads
are seen in that same location.

29
00:01:26,905 --> 00:01:30,775
You can do a ton with the custom
mastheads from carousels,

30
00:01:30,775 --> 00:01:32,875
use cool videos or just images.

31
00:01:32,875 --> 00:01:34,590
There's a lot of options out there.

32
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:38,200
That's surprising I know but
you can also have a video ad.

33
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,870
I'm sure you've noticed these ads
playing before different videos that

34
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:41,680
you've seen on YouTube.

35
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,982
Now there are different options for
the video ads.

36
00:01:43,982 --> 00:01:48,917
Nonskippable in-stream video ads
are videos that appear pre-mid or

37
00:01:48,917 --> 00:01:53,120
post-roll when viewing
different content on YouTube.

38
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,630
They could be around
15 to 30 seconds long.

39
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:59,700
And the viewer must watch the entire
ad before they're able to watch their

40
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:00,900
selected video.

41
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:04,451
Now, for the skippable ads,
you can go to the true view format.

42
00:02:04,451 --> 00:02:07,250
And there are a few different
types of true view ads.

43
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:09,600
So you have the in-stream
that play before video,

44
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,410
and you're allowed to
skip after five seconds.

45
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:15,130
You could have display ads
that are suggested videos,

46
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:17,080
in that suggested video list.

47
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,460
Let's check that out.

48
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:20,082
Here's an example of a display ad.

49
00:02:20,082 --> 00:02:23,360
And this is an example of
an in-stream overlay ad.

50
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,030
There are a few more options for
true view ads.

51
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:28,650
You can check the link in
the instructor notes for more.

52
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:32,750
You can have your standard display ads,
which are similar to what you just saw.

53
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:35,770
And you also saw
the in-video overlay ads.

54
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:39,180
They pop up, then you can select them
while you're watching a video, or

55
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,770
you have the option of closing them.

56
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:44,618
But as I said before, there
are a ton of ad options in YouTube.

57
00:02:44,618 --> 00:02:47,060
You can even do live streaming ads,
if you'd like, so

58
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:48,780
check out the documentation
to learn more.
