00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:05,693
We've looked closely at circles, so now let's examine ellipses. Ellipses are

2
00:00:05,693 --> 00:00:10,709
very much like circles. There's just one exception. The distance we go in the x

3
00:00:10,709 --> 00:00:16,277
direction will be different from the distance we go in the y direction. So,

4
00:00:16,277 --> 00:00:19,876
sometimes we might move further from the center in the x direction than we

5
00:00:19,876 --> 00:00:25,700
would vertically in the y direction. And other times we might go further in the

6
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:30,970
y direction from the center, than we would in the x direction from the center.

7
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:34,691
We'll see a lot of similarities between circles and ellipses, so lets try

8
00:00:34,691 --> 00:00:39,428
looking at a circle first. There's this amazing online graphing calculator

9
00:00:39,428 --> 00:00:43,560
called Desmos. If you've never heard of it, I highly recommend that you check

10
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:47,700
it out. It allows us to easily enter in equations. And we can instantly see

11
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:51,720
what the graph looks like. For now we're going to look at the equation of a

12
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,960
circle, but if you ever want to play around with this on your own, go to

13
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:59,268
www.decimals.com. You can create your own account and then start to draw and

14
00:00:59,268 --> 00:01:05,410
save your own graphs. For circles we know they have equal amounts of x squared

15
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:11,620
and y squared. And if we take the square root of this number, we'll get six.

16
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:15,492
That's the radius of our circle. The distance to any point from the center to

17
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:21,320
another point on the circle. But what if we wanted to graph this equation?

18
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:26,298
Notice that we have different amounts of x squared and y squared now. Now, I'm

19
00:01:26,298 --> 00:01:29,850
going to go ahead and let you know that this will be the graph of an ellipse.

20
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:34,094
So, let's see how we can graph it ourselves. First we'll take the equation and

21
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:38,838
we'll divide through by the number 36. When we divide each term by 36, we'll

22
00:01:38,838 --> 00:01:44,492
get one fourth x squared here. one ninth y squared here and 1 on the other side

23
00:01:44,492 --> 00:01:49,550
of the equal sign. So, we're going to ignore our first equation of the circle

24
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:55,480
for now. We've taken this equation and rearranged it into this. Now, can you

25
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:58,646
tell me what are the two x-intercepts?
