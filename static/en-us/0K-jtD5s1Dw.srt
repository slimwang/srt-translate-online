00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,497
I think this should be called vertex form since, as we've seen, we can just read

2
00:00:04,497 --> 00:00:08,927
off the coordinates of the vertex, which is at h,k. That's why this form is so

3
00:00:08,927 --> 00:00:13,412
useful, and also because we can see from the coefficient of a about how wide the

4
00:00:13,412 --> 00:00:17,469
graph is going to be. Now, there may be some variation depending on what source

5
00:00:17,469 --> 00:00:21,373
you look at for what we should call this equation, but for the purposes of this

6
00:00:21,373 --> 00:00:25,404
class, we're going to call this the vertex form for the equation of a parabola.

7
00:00:25,404 --> 00:00:29,229
You may see other names elsewhere and there's not one that's absolutely right or

8
00:00:29,229 --> 00:00:33,048
absolutely wrong, but for the sake of speaking the same language, know that this

9
00:00:33,048 --> 00:00:35,186
is what I mean when I talk about vertex form.
