1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:04,740
So overall, Sam I think did
a great job with the interview.

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:07,240
Again, it's not important that
you get everything right.

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:11,260
I think you hit on the things that I
thought were important in the interview.

4
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:15,960
So being able to have knowledge
of intents and services, and

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,800
those things were important and maybe
a sense of use everyday in all your

6
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,500
applications, but at least he has
a good knowledge and a grasp for that.

7
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,540
His solutions, I think sometimes
when you ask people these very

8
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:28,960
open ended questions, they freeze.

9
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,810
So he has some creative
solutions I think, but

10
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:33,820
I kept kind of probing and
like, what else could happen?

11
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:35,350
He did a great job there.

12
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:39,730
I would have liked if he followed up
with more questions like I've made some

13
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:42,860
questions very vague and
he asked some follow up questions, but

14
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:45,190
I think there's plenty
more to kind of touch on.

15
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:49,830
Again it's just important when you don't
have a very well structured problem,

16
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:54,780
there is structure, but
the interviewer has that knowledge and

17
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:58,340
some of the concepts, you could tell
he's used in the past like there

18
00:00:58,340 --> 00:00:59,800
are some things about
Android that he used but

19
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:04,650
he did not quite understand like maybe
the names or some of the concepts.

20
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:09,920
So I think kind of making sure that
you can resolve this thing that

21
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,660
you've done in Android to the name of it
is as important as well, but overall,

22
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:17,420
I think Sam did a great job and he's
the type of developer we wish to hire.
