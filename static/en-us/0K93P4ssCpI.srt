>> Okay. Clearly it can be on or off and,

2
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:31,110
a part of the abstraction process is deciding that for the purposes of,

3
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:35,990
our, our understanding of the radio here. That, we're not going to

4
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:40,530
be concerned with as if there were any states between the two. Now if we were,

5
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:44,190
went down to the electronic level, there would be some voltage levels and

6
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:46,650
there would be, you know, transitions going on there.

7
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:49,070
But that's that's not what we're concerned with here.
