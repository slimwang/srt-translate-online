1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:01,292
So, let's take a look at problem one.

2
00:00:01,292 --> 00:00:05,337
That is, what's the probability of
getting the observation sequence,

3
00:00:05,337 --> 00:00:07,250
given lambda, given an HMM.

4
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:10,704
It's the first I want to look at
a naive solution, and then, you'll see

5
00:00:10,704 --> 00:00:14,785
how the cool solution is so much
much better than the naive solution.

6
00:00:14,785 --> 00:00:18,894
So, let's start off by pretending,
assume for the moment,

7
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:21,667
we actually know the sequence of states.

8
00:00:21,667 --> 00:00:25,505
Okay?
So, that's q sub 1 through q sub cap t.

9
00:00:25,505 --> 00:00:27,575
Right, q sub 1 through q sub cap t.

10
00:00:27,575 --> 00:00:30,840
That's the actual state
at time one through time,

11
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,890
to each one of them is an s sub j,
right?

12
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:36,935
So, maybe it goes from state three,
to two, to four or whatever.

13
00:00:36,935 --> 00:00:38,820
One through t is the time, okay?

14
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,050
So, we're going to assume that.

15
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:44,480
And the other thing we're going to
assume is that the observations

16
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,810
only depend upon
the state that you're in.

17
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:50,690
So, when we say, independent
observations, what we mean is

18
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:54,270
that if you knew this state, then
the probability of observation is just

19
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:57,680
dependent on the state and
not dependent upon anything else.

20
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:01,982
Well, if that's the case,
then the probability of the particular

21
00:01:01,982 --> 00:01:05,220
observation, observation sequence,
given the state sequence.

22
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:09,630
Well, because of independence, it's just
the probability multiplied times each

23
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:14,460
other of the output of that,
of the particular symbol

24
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:18,830
seen at time t, given that you're
in the particular state at time t.

25
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:20,930
And that taken the whole product.

26
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:23,720
And that's just these b variables,
right?

27
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:29,510
So, b of q1 that of o1, means
the probability given that I'm in q1,

28
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:33,890
whatever q1 happens to be,
of outputting o1, and et cetera.

29
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:34,390
Okay?

30
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:36,930
So, if we knew the state sequence,

31
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:40,823
then we could just multiply this to
get the observation of the sequence,

32
00:01:40,823 --> 00:01:45,230
of the likelihood of the observation
sequence given the state sequence.

33
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:48,180
But for any given state sequence,

34
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:51,750
I can tell you the probability
of getting that state sequence.

35
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:54,010
Right.
It's just a very simple product shown

36
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:54,820
here, right?

37
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:58,630
So, if I know it's q1 through q cap t,
then it's the probability,

38
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:01,970
here's pi of q1,
of starting in that state.

39
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:07,275
And then, a of q1q2, is the probability
of going from that state,

40
00:02:07,275 --> 00:02:11,847
q1, to whatever the next state,
q2 is, times a q2q3,

41
00:02:11,847 --> 00:02:14,792
all the way up to a qt minus one, to qt.

42
00:02:14,792 --> 00:02:15,375
All right?

43
00:02:15,375 --> 00:02:19,319
So, assuming I knew the sequence,
I could tell you the probability.

44
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:24,910
Well, you say, in that case,
I can do the following.

45
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:29,520
Given that I can compute
the probability of a sequence,

46
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,500
of an observation sequence,
given a state sequence.

47
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:37,320
And given that I can compute the
probability of any given state sequence.

48
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:42,246
Well, then, obviously, we can compute
the probability of getting that

49
00:02:42,246 --> 00:02:47,417
output sequence by just summing over
the all the different state sequences.

50
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:49,609
Right?
Taking the probability of the state

51
00:02:49,609 --> 00:02:53,425
sequence times the probability of the
observation given the state sequence,

52
00:02:53,425 --> 00:02:56,570
summed, as I said,
over all the state sequences.

53
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:57,280
Okay?

54
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,250
You could just do that.

55
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:03,070
Of course the problem with doing that
is it would take you a long time.

56
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:03,900
How long?

57
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,600
A really, really, really long time.

58
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:12,340
And the reason is,
this is summed over all possible paths.

59
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:14,459
All possible state sequences.

60
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:15,640
All right?

61
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:20,300
Well, their end states and
their T times steps, that's N to the T.

62
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:23,090
Okay?
Exponential in time into the T.

63
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:26,150
And each one costs t calculations
because I have to figure out

64
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:33,230
the probability of oh, so the complexity
of that is T times N to the T.

65
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:36,870
That, as we say, is a really long time.

66
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:39,000
So, it's not such a good solution.

67
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,833
So, you think we can
do something better?

68
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:41,985
Well, of course, we could or

69
00:03:41,985 --> 00:03:44,070
else I wouldn't be standing
here wasting your time.
