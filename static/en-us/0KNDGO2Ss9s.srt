00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:03,310
Here's a brief quiz on the component models.

2
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:04,910
You might have heard of WordPress,

3
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:08,550
it is a content management solution for blogs.

4
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:12,920
Here are some requirements taken from the WordPress codex, for

5
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:14,290
requirement stocking.

6
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:18,160
For each requirement, determine whether it concerns component syntax,

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,610
component semantics, or component composition.

8
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:26,190
The first requirement states, any text output by the Action function,

9
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:30,515
will appear in the page sources at the locations where the action was invoked.

10
00:00:30,515 --> 00:00:35,850
Secondly, use well-structured, error-free PHP and valid HTML.

11
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:40,710
The third requirement states, actions are triggered by specific events that

12
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:44,550
take place in WordPress, such as publishing a post, changing themes, or

13
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:47,040
displaying an administration screen.

14
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:51,030
The action is a custom PHP function, defined in your plugin, and

15
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:54,390
hooked that is set to respond to some of these events.
