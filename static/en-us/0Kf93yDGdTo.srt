1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:04,520
Our past quiz showed the power of string
concatenation and string slicing.

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:08,020
We could generate new mad lib sentences,
by just changing verb and

3
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:11,860
noun replacement variables, rather than
having to rewrite the sentence over and

4
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:12,890
over again.

5
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:17,430
But finding where noun or verb are,
by guessing what the index may be, and

6
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:21,330
adjusting until we found the right
position, can be a bit tedious.

7
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:23,260
Imagine if we had to find where noun or

8
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:25,700
verb is in a string of
a thousand characters long.

9
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:28,010
That would take far
too much of our time.

10
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:31,530
Luckily, we've already learned about
a method that can help us out with this.

11
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:34,844
For the following quiz, you'll be asked
to use the string.find method you

12
00:00:34,844 --> 00:00:36,776
learned about with Dave
in the last lesson.

13
00:00:36,776 --> 00:00:40,873
To find out where instances of noun and
verb occur in a longer string.

14
00:00:40,873 --> 00:00:45,025
As a refresher if we set
a string test to how are you, and

15
00:00:45,025 --> 00:00:47,917
we then use test.find("are"),

16
00:00:47,917 --> 00:00:53,090
we'll be returned with the index
word in the parenthesis is found.

17
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:57,329
In this case will be returned with 4.
