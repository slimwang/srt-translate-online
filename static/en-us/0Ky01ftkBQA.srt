00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:05,240
The fourth section is titled Experimental Conditions. A software design study

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:08,820
normally means running several versions of a program, making measurements, and

3
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:13,220
evaluating the results. These programs' executions take place on computers

4
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:17,150
configured with resources. Such as their number of cores, the amount of RAM,

5
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:21,470
their clock speed, and potentially net, the networking that networks them

6
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:25,800
together. To support the goal of repeatability, this configuration information

7
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,010
should be explicitly documented in your report. The fourth section of the design

8
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:34,370
study describes the experimental conditions under which the study is conducted.

9
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:37,960
In particular, it describes the environment of which the study will take place.

10
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:41,940
This includes elements such as the machines, [COUGH] their models,

11
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:45,680
operating systems, programming languages any virtual machines and

12
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,527
their versions. Where relevent, the network, the build and

13
00:00:49,527 --> 00:00:53,258
execution parameters, input files, and confounding factors. Such as

14
00:00:53,258 --> 00:00:57,460
other users on the machines at the same time or other, processes going on
