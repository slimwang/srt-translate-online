00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,882
Well, I paid $2 per mile. So if I drive another mile, I pay 2 more dollars. So

2
00:00:05,882 --> 00:00:11,900
driving 2 miles would cost $24, and again, if I drive one more mile, I pay

3
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:18,089
another $2. So it costs $26 to drive 3 miles and $28 to drive 4 miles.
