00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:05,419
Besides unary and binary constraints, we
could have constraints that involve 3 or

2
00:00:05,419 --> 00:00:07,740
more variables or soft constraints,

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:11,580
like the fact that I prefer to teach
on a Tuesday/Thursday schedule.

4
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:15,129
Problems with preference constraints are
called constraint optimization problems

5
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:17,640
and are solved with linear programming.

6
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:20,859
>> There are lots of examples of
constraint satisfaction problems.

7
00:00:20,859 --> 00:00:23,789
Sudoku is a classic game which can be
solved with any of the methods we will

8
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:24,640
be teaching.

9
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,859
>> Other examples include car assembly,
job scheduling in factories, class

10
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:33,549
scheduling, spreadsheets, transportation
scheduling, or floor planning.

11
00:00:33,549 --> 00:00:35,929
Many of these require
real valued variables.
