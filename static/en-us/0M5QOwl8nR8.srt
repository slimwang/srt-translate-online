00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,296
Hopefully that question
wasn't too difficult.

2
00:00:02,296 --> 00:00:06,411
The question asks us to use
a string.find method to locate NOUN and

3
00:00:06,411 --> 00:00:09,719
VERB in the string text, and
to store those positions

4
00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:14,230
in the variables noun_position and
verb-position, respectively.

5
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:17,492
If you use the string.find method,
this is pretty easy to do, and

6
00:00:17,492 --> 00:00:19,189
it'll save you a lot of headache.

7
00:00:19,189 --> 00:00:22,504
Since the .find method
follows this syntax,

8
00:00:22,504 --> 00:00:28,031
we'll replace string_to_search,
with text, and this (x) with noun,

9
00:00:28,031 --> 00:00:33,237
for noun_position, and with a verb for
our verb_position variable.

10
00:00:33,237 --> 00:00:35,048
And that's all there is to it.

11
00:00:35,048 --> 00:00:38,746
I'd say that this method is a better
alternative than having to count 175

12
00:00:38,746 --> 00:00:39,450
characters.
