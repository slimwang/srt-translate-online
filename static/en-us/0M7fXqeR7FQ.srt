1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:04,810
One attack on confidentiality is called eavesdropping,

2
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:07,700
where an attacker, Eve, might gain unauthorized

3
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:11,340
access to information being sent between Alice

4
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:14,280
and Bob. So for example, if Alice and

5
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:19,820
Bob were chatting on instant message, or if Alice sends an email to Bob, the

6
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:25,980
potential exists In other words, there's a threat that Eve might be able to hear

7
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:28,730
that communication. There are various packet sniffing

8
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:33,320
tools, such as wireshark and tcpdump, that

9
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:36,570
set a machine's networking interface card into

10
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:39,790
what's called promiscuous mode. If Alice, Bob,

11
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:45,610
and Eve are on the same local area network Where packets are being flooded.

12
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:47,800
For example, if they where being connected

13
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:51,330
by a hub that flooded all packets everywhere,

14
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:55,700
or if the learning switch did not have an entry for Alice or Bob then Eve might

15
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:58,040
be able to hear some of those packets.

16
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:00,880
If the network interface card is in promiscuous mode.

17
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:04,110
Than Eve's machine will be able to capture

18
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:07,350
some of the packets that are being exchanged between

19
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:10,460
Alice and Bob. Its worth thinking about how different

20
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:16,340
types of traffic might reveal important information about communication.

21
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:19,345
For example, the ability to see DNS

22
00:01:19,345 --> 00:01:22,800
look-ups would provide the attacker information about, say,

23
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,650
what websites you're visiting. The ability to capture

24
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:29,040
packet headers might give the attacker information, not

25
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,920
only about where you're exchanging traffic, but what

26
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,450
types of applications you're using. And the ability

27
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:37,940
to see a full packet payload would allow

28
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:41,930
an attacker to effectively see every single thing

29
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:44,260
that you are sending on the network. Including

30
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:47,620
content you're exchanging with other people. Such as private

31
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:51,450
message, email communication, and so forth. Given the

32
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:54,160
ability to see a packet, Eve might not only

33
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,690
listen to that packet, but might also modify

34
00:01:56,690 --> 00:02:00,150
it and re-inject it into the network, potentially after

35
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:03,350
altering the state of the packet. If additionally Eve

36
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:07,030
could suppress the original message Let's consider an attack

37
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:13,960
on authenticity. If, in addition to being able to observe packets that traverse

38
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:17,610
the network, Eve could re-inject packets after

39
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:21,880
having modified them, and suppress Alice's original

40
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:26,660
message, then Eve could effectively impersonate Alice.

41
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:28,320
This is sometimes called a 'Man in

42
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:32,280
the Middle' attack. Alice could also make it appear as though this message came

43
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:37,040
from Alice. In which case, the attack would be an attack on message integrity.
