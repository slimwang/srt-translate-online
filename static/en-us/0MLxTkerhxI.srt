If we have 10 sections: one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine,

2
00:00:05,317 --> 00:00:12,130
ten. Let's look at the posts: one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight,

3
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:18,028
nine, ten. Now, we have one post before every section, and eleven, there's one

4
00:00:18,028 --> 00:00:22,485
after. So the answer was the 11 posts.
