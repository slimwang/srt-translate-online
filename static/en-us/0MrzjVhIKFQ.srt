1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:05,350
There's another tool that provides the
same kind of information as host does,

2
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:07,570
but in a more technical and
complete form.

3
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:10,850
So the host tool shows more human
readable information, spelled out in

4
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:15,474
English sentences like, such and so
name is an alias for this other name.

5
00:00:15,474 --> 00:00:22,550
Or this name has address 52.25.84.3.

6
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:27,560
The dig tool shows the same
information more or less.

7
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:30,180
But in a form that's more readable for
scripts and

8
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:33,920
is closer to the way that it's stored
in the DNS server's configuration file.

9
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,250
Let's take a look.

10
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:40,600
So here I did dig www.udacity.com,
and here we see a question

11
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:45,490
section that says, what is the request
that we sent to the DNS system?

12
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:48,420
And an answer section that
says what we got back.

13
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:52,650
See, here's the name that
host says was an alias.

14
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:56,030
We can see as we saw before
alias is done with CNAME.

15
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:58,540
And here's the name that host
said it was an alias too.

16
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:04,860
And likewise, these names have
A records with the IP addresses.

17
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:07,170
But dig also gives us other information.

18
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:09,530
It tells us what server
answered our query.

19
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:12,890
It tells us some metadata like,
when the query was answered.

20
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:15,960
And it also includes some other
fields that say how the query worked.

21
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,480
We won't go into those in this course.

22
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:20,600
But it's worth noting that you can get a
lot of information out of DNS this way.
