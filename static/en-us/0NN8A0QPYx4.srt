1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:01,560
All right, so let's continue looking at

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:04,100
this correspondence problem a little bit more.

3
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:07,390
Here we have two images, this is courtesy of Andrew Zisserman.

4
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:11,630
And we've got an epipolar line, and again, we've got horizontal epipolar lines.

5
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:13,770
So here we have both scan lines, left and

6
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:16,830
right image, and a plot of the intensity profiles.

7
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:18,450
And of course, they're going to look pretty similar,

8
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:20,600
because there should be matches along the way.

9
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:21,250
But you know,

10
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:26,030
there are slight differences in, in exactly what the profiles look like.

11
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:27,510
There's a little bit of noise and

12
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:30,640
there also might be some ambiguities of finding where you match over here.

13
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,940
It might be challenging over there.

14
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:35,770
So we're going to look at this a little bit more carefully.

15
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:37,660
We've pulled out a window on the left.

16
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:42,740
And we're going to slide that along the epipolar line that window on the right.

17
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:45,420
All right, let's take a look at a particular window.

18
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,280
So I'm showing you the two little bands that are sort of the height of

19
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,280
the window.

20
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,180
And from the left image band, we're going to pull out a particular point.

21
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:57,880
All right, so here's this point, and its window that's associated with it.

22
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:01,530
So that means we have to pull out the right band, that's the same,

23
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:04,129
it's the epipolar band, if you will, it's the epipolar line, but

24
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:05,140
with the window height.

25
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:09,880
And we're going to slide that window from the left across the right band.

26
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:13,500
And if we do that, and we were doing, say, cross correlation, well,

27
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:17,770
you would see this nice high peak right where the thing is supposed to match.

28
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:21,360
So the window was picked sort of between these two dark squares here and

29
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,040
of course the best match is right between these two dark squares just like you

30
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,210
would expect.

31
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:29,720
The problem of course is we put a window over a nice, essentially the fact it

32
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:33,600
looks a lot like a surveyor's target of black squares and white squares.

33
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,760
What happens if our window falls over this area on the left

34
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:40,320
image band that's pretty textureless?

35
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,760
I mean, there's some variation in tensity, it's a little hard to see here.

36
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:48,490
Now if I correlate that with the right band, what do I get?

37
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:51,760
Well, I see a result that looks like this, okay?

38
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:54,620
And of course, the question is, where's the match?

39
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:59,050
Because you'll notice before, I had a nice strong match above that 0.5 value.

40
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:01,230
Now I get multiple matches and

41
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:04,470
I know that the match is supposed to be somewhere where the question marks are.

42
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:08,820
But it'd be pretty hard to justify picking that one over any others.

43
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:10,900
So how could we fix this?

44
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:13,250
Well our problem, of course, is that the window is so

45
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:18,100
small that it didn't catch any sort of, significant texture.
