1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,910
And the answer to that is that we only need to install 2 devices--

2
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:09,310
one up here and one down here.

3
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:12,070
This one up here covers those 3 cables,

4
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:16,000
and this one down here covers these 3 here, so this one is covered twice.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,680
But we need at least 2 devices to cover the whole network and actually,

6
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,130
in this case, this is the only possible solution for this.

7
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:26,180
But of course, a computer can't just see that 2 devices suffice.

8
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:30,920
So Alice's algorithm 'trying all possibilities' would have to go through

9
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:34,005
all of the possibilities that you could have of installing a device

10
00:00:34,005 --> 00:00:38,940
at a certain communication point or not installing one.

11
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:43,750
So, in this case here, that would be 16 different possibilities

12
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:48,120
if we give the communication points little letters here

13
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,160
so we can better distinguish them.

14
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:56,360
So Alice's algorithm 'trying all possibilities' would have to consider

15
00:00:56,360 --> 00:01:00,750
installing no device at all, which would of course not be a valid solution.

16
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:06,610
It could try installing just a device at 'A' which, again, would not be a valid solution,

17
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:07,920
and so on.

18
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,430
And of course the algorithm would also find solutions that are valid

19
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:15,050
but would use more than the minimum number of monitoring devices

20
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:16,470
that are actually needed.

21
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:21,170
But since the algorithm tries all possibilities, it will also find this solution here

22
00:01:21,170 --> 99:59:59,999
using just 2 devices.
