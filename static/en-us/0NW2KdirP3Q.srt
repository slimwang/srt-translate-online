00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,141
Here's the correct answer, and great job if you got it right. We can factor a 2

2
00:00:05,141 --> 00:00:10,125
a from the first two terms to give us 2 a times a plus 4. The second two terms

3
00:00:10,125 --> 00:00:15,233
share a b, so we can factor that out, leaving us with b times a plus 4. Now this

4
00:00:15,233 --> 00:00:20,399
term and this term share an a plus 4, so we can factor that out, leaving us with

5
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:23,045
2 a plus b. And here are our two factors.
