1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:03,040
VR technology can't
exist without tracking.

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:06,480
It allows a computer to know
where you are in space.

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:11,960
To do this,
all major VR systems rely on a chip

4
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:16,990
called an Inertial Measurement Unit,
or IMU for short.

5
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:21,580
An Inertial Measurement Unit enables
high speed rotational tracking.

6
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:25,690
This means the chip knows
how it is being rotated.

7
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:31,063
We're going to talk more about
IMUs in an upcoming lesson.

8
00:00:31,063 --> 00:00:35,328
Unfortunately, IMUs can't
tell where an object

9
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:40,110
is actually located in space,
only how it's rotated.

10
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:44,870
In order to tell where
objects are located,

11
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:49,010
modern VR systems employ a variety
of positional tracking techniques.

12
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:53,440
Sometimes they use cameras.

13
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:58,660
Sometimes they use lasers and
precise clocks.

14
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:00,900
Sometime they use magnetic fields.

15
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:05,480
Positional tracking is
an area of active research.

16
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:08,450
And there isn't yet
a universally accepted technique.

17
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,930
We'll talk more about this
too in the upcoming lesson.

18
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:18,790
But for now just know that VR requires
some kind of tracking in order to work.

19
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:26,600
It’s how the system allows your body
movements to control the VR world, okay.

20
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:30,140
We've looked at the major
components of VR hardware,

21
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:35,040
now let’s talk about some of the biggest
challenges in creating high quality VR.
