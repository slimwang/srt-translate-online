00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:04,930
Now that you have a product idea, it is
time to move to the validation process.

2
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:09,830
Remember that a lot of ideas look
great on paper, but fail in real life.

3
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:12,280
Validating your idea
could help you determine

4
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:15,000
if your idea is as good as it sounds.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,410
>> As you validate your idea,

6
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:19,070
you may find that your idea
isn't as good as you thought.

7
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:21,810
In that case,
you might need to generate new ideas, or

8
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:23,990
combined new ones with new ones.

9
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:26,900
Just be careful that you don't get
stuck at this point in the course.

10
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:28,970
We want you to put something
in front of users and

11
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:31,960
understand the process of going
from an idea to a product.

12
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:36,530
>> One way to validate your idea,
is to do user research.

13
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:40,960
In the next videos, you will learn how
to do user research from Tomer Sharon,

14
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,550
our researcher in Google New York.
