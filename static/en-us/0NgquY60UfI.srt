1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,828
So I searched for AVAudioUnitTimePitch example, and

2
00:00:03,828 --> 00:00:07,600
I came across a stack overflow page that was promising.

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,990
By the way, a link to this website is also available in the instructor notes.

4
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:13,500
This page pointed me to some code, and

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,390
also highlighted a video on a website called.

6
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:17,900
WWDC.

7
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:20,350
Now, WWDC, or

8
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:25,180
World Wide Developer Conference in an annual event Apple hosts in California,

9
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:29,110
where Apple engineers showcase new technologies to software developers.

10
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:31,830
One video in this website was particularly helpful.

11
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:34,720
It's called AVAudioEngine in Practice.

12
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:36,100
I looked through this video and

13
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:39,120
discovered a new way of working with sound in iOS 8.

14
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,600
A link to this video is also available in the instructor notes, and

15
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,640
I recommend that you bookmark it now, and watch it later.

16
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:48,790
By the way, you will need the Safari browser to play this video.

17
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:49,540
This video and

18
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:54,730
the previous [INAUDIBLE] page led me to some code, and here is that code.

19
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:57,930
Now, before I run this, I want you to read through this, and

20
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:01,140
see if you can translate this code into simple English.

21
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:04,830
By the way, this is the sort of activity that expert software engineers will do

22
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:06,180
on a daily basis.

23
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:09,140
See if you can make reasonable guesses about what's going on here, and

24
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:11,350
then you can submit your answer in this box.

25
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:14,270
You can refer to the lines in this code by the line numbers that

26
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:15,000
are provided here.
