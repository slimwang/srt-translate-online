1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,270
Change is going to be about what when we talk about functions?

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:05,750
Well change is going to be about derivatives, all right?

3
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:06,520
And this is why we're going to be

4
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:08,920
able to talk about derivatives with respect to our functions.

5
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:12,740
So here we have a very simple image, and

6
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:17,400
I'm going to show you a plot here of a horizontal row, so if we just take a row.

7
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,310
And we would just plot it.

8
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:21,670
You'd see it starts out high and then it comes down smoothly and

9
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:22,760
then it goes back up again.

10
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:25,650
All right, so this is a nice smooth image.

11
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:28,940
Well as you remember, when you were taking a look at change back in

12
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:30,700
calculus class, you would take the derivative.

13
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:33,570
If I apply the derivative to that function,

14
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:35,350
I would get a function that looks like this.

15
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:39,299
So this is the first derivative of that scan line, and these edges,

16
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:46,080
which are these edges, correspond to these extrema of the derivative.

17
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:50,850
That is, here's, somewhere down here is where the maximum negative slope is.

18
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:53,300
And somewhere over here is where the maximum positive slope.

19
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:55,120
This is the maximum negative.

20
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,680
That's the maximum positive.

21
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:00,500
So, finding edges is going to have something to do

22
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:03,050
with finding peaks in the derivative.

23
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:06,390
So how are we going to find these extreme in the derivatives?

24
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:09,280
Well, the same way we found other things, right.

25
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,570
How do we find Waldo?

26
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:15,730
We ran some filter, we applied some filter and looked for its response.

27
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:18,720
So we're going to filter our image with the appropriate word is

28
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,060
operator in order to find these peaks in the derivatives.
