00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,362
Let's go through a simple example of type one and type two errors. Have you

2
00:00:04,362 --> 00:00:08,119
ever sipped a beverage that was too hot, and you burned your tongue? Let's say

3
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:12,570
that the null hypothesis is that the beverage is fine to drink. It's not too

4
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:17,600
hot, it's perfect. The alternative hypothesis then, is that the beverage is too

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:22,524
hot to drink. So, now, four things can happen. One thing, which often happens

6
00:00:22,524 --> 00:00:25,926
to me, because I'm hasty, is you decide the beverage is fine to drink but then

7
00:00:25,926 --> 00:00:31,192
it's too hot and you burn your toungue. Another thing that could happen is you

8
00:00:31,192 --> 00:00:35,350
decide that the beverage is fine to drink now and indeed it is, then you enjoy

9
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:40,680
drinking it. Another thing that can happen is you think the beverage is too hot

10
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,344
now so you wait until it cools but it's actually fine to drink, and then by the

11
00:00:43,344 --> 00:00:48,858
time you drink it it's cold. And finally, you might think the beverage is too

12
00:00:48,858 --> 00:00:52,398
hot, and indeed it is, so you wait to drink it, and then by the time you do,

13
00:00:52,398 --> 00:00:59,300
it's perfect. Now put A, B, C, or D, in the respective boxes it belongs here,

14
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:03,803
and remember what H not, and H a are.
