1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The answer is the third choice.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
We're only looking for signatures here, so we don't need to encrypt the document.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
We don't care about confidentiality.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
We can send the document in clear, but what we want to send along with it

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
is something that proves that it's the document that Alice intended.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
To do that we need to do something that uses Alice's private key.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
That's these two options.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
If we use the public key--well, anyone can do that.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
The public key could be known to anyone else.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
We're assuming that the private key is only known to Alice.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
The only one who could compute these two things would be Alice

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Then we have a choice of which one of these two things is better.

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
If we believe we can have one-way hash functions that have the collision resistance

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
properties that we talked about.

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Then this is much better, because the output of the hash function is

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
small fixed-size value.

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
It's only for a given security level. It might be 256 bits.

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
We can encrypt that much more cheaply than if we had to encrypt the whole document

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
using RSA.

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
That's why this is the best choice, and lot's of protocols are based on this kind of solution

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
where we use RSA to encrypt something small, which could be a hash value

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
or it could be an encryption key.

23
00:01:10,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Then we use that with symmetric crypto for the rest of the message.
