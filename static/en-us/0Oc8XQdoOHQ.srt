1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,770
So how to be successful with SCO.

2
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:08,640
The first thing that we need to remember
is first of all not to overdo it and

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:09,660
not to underestimate it.

4
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:16,309
Back in the day you could make
a lot of money with SCO just by

5
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:22,440
exchanging links and optimizing for
specific keywords on your website.

6
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:25,210
That was amazing.

7
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:26,980
That was the gold rush of SCO.

8
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:28,630
But that's not happening anymore.

9
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:31,060
A lot of websites
are getting slapped and

10
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:34,650
a lot of people who made a lot of money
are not making that money anymore.

11
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:37,550
And they don't have
a choice because what

12
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:40,440
was working back then
is not working anymore.

13
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:44,130
And the best thing that you
should remember with about SCO

14
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:49,520
is that it's the most the relevancy
of your offering to the audience.

15
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,920
And when people
are using search engines,

16
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,130
they are basically asking questions.

17
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:58,196
So if you'll think about it,
if you're typing into the search engine,

18
00:00:58,196 --> 00:01:01,210
cheap clothes New York.

19
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:03,450
We're basically asking a question,
right?

20
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:05,620
Where can I find cheap
clothes in New York?

21
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:08,540
Or what kind of cheap clothes
can I find in New York?

22
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:10,540
And so on and so forth.

23
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:14,260
So you want your website
to be ranked in the top.

24
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:18,070
So you want to create some kind
of answers to those questions.

25
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:21,980
So if we are thinking also about
what kind of content to create, so

26
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:24,560
we need to entertain,
or we need to educate.

27
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,260
We need also to answer questions.

28
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:28,160
One of the most important things is

29
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:32,230
how to know which keyword
we should invest on.

30
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:33,340
There are so many keywords.

31
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:38,310
People are arriving to our site using
50,000 different kinds of keywords.

32
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:40,320
Some of them are even titles.

33
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:45,550
So they were branded, that they were
using our name, some of them were not.

34
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:47,740
How can we know what to use?

35
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:52,870
So there's a lot of ways, similarly is
one of them that you can search for

36
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:56,500
the keywords that are leading
users to your competitors,

37
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,680
the keywords that are leading users
to the websites on mobile apps that

38
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,430
you think are similar to yours.

39
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:05,820
And you can start and
finding those keywords,

40
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:10,258
creating the list, and then you know
what kind of content to create and

41
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:13,630
what kind of questions
you want to answer on.

42
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:19,840
You want really to avoid nasty tricks,
black header CO.

43
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,820
This can be very gratifying
in the beginning.

44
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:27,150
You can get a lot of users, but
you'll eventually get slapped.

45
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:30,300
It happened in the past,
it will happen in the future.
