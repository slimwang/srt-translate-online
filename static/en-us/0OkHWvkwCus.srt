Now that you've seen alpha and jitter in action I'd like

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:05,640
you to use your new knowledge of them to explore the relationship

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:09,730
between friends initiated and age. Build your plot up in layers

4
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:12,540
and be sure to use the g g plot syntax. I really

5
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:15,500
recommend playing around with this in RStudio, and then once

6
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,790
you've got your finalized plot, copy and paste your code into the

7
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:22,240
browser and submit it. There's no right or wrong answer here and

8
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,330
there's a couple of different ways to make the plot. So just

9
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:28,670
be sure that once you have your final plot, you copy and paste all of your code

10
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:32,250
into the browser and submit. After you've created your

11
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:35,090
plot, share any of your findings in the discussions.
