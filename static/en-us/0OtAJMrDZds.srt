00:00:00,006 --> 00:00:04,480
Now, once again I've laid out a function for you, in the same format as before.

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:09,355
We have one oval that contains some possible values of x, and another oval that

3
00:00:09,355 --> 00:00:14,080
contains some possible values of f of x, and some values of x mapping to other

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,469
values of f of x. So, using this diagram, I'd like you to tell me what the

5
00:00:18,469 --> 00:00:23,180
domain of this function is, and what the range is. And as before, if you have

6
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:27,467
multiple answers in either box, please separate them by commas.
