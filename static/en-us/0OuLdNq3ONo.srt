00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,060
In this and in the remaining lessons for

2
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:06,090
the course, we turn our attention to
the study of polynomial algorithms.

3
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:08,450
First however, a little perspective.

4
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:09,830
In the beginning of the course,

5
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:12,530
we defined the general
notion of a language.

6
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:16,480
Then we began to distinguish
between decidable languages and

7
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:17,240
undecidable ones.

8
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:21,531
Remember that there were uncountably
many undecidable ones, but

9
00:00:21,531 --> 00:00:23,950
only a countably many decidable ones.

10
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:29,710
In comparison, the decidable ones should
be infinitesimally small, but I'll give

11
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:34,240
them this big circle here anyway,
because they're so interesting to us.

12
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,400
In the section of
the course on complexity,

13
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:40,510
we considered several subclasses
of the decidable languages.

14
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:44,400
P, which consists of those languages
decidable in polynomial time.

15
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:50,400
NP, which consists of those languages
that can be verified in polynomial time.

16
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:55,970
And within this we have this little
bend of NP complete problems,

17
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:57,840
which are the hardest problems in NP.

18
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:03,350
If any one of these turned out to be
polynomial, then P would expand and

19
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:05,290
swallow all of NP.

20
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:09,670
Or equivalently, we can think of NP
collapsing down into this class P.

21
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:12,980
In this section,
we're going to focus on this class P,

22
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:16,470
the set of polynomially
decidable languages.

23
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:20,160
The overall tone here will hopefully
feel a little more optimistic.

24
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,960
In the previous sections of the course,

25
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:24,380
many of our results were
of a negative nature.

26
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:27,240
No, you can't decide that language, or

27
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:31,480
no that problem isn't trackable
unless P is equal to NP.

28
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:34,310
Here, the results will
be entirely positive.

29
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:38,030
No longer we'll be the excluding
problems from a good class.

30
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:40,930
We'll just be showing the problems
are in this good class, P.

31
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:46,320
Yes, you can do that in polynomial time
or it's even a low order polynomial, and

32
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,870
we can solve huge instances in practice.
