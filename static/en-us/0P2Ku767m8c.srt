00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,770
Here the answers to the quiz,
AsyncTaskLoader

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:06,990
is a type of Loader that uses
an AsyncTask to do the background work.

3
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:09,780
There are other types
like Crystal Loader

4
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:13,430
which you'll learn about in the next
course when we discuss databases.

5
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:17,020
Now to create a custom Loader that
searches a list of earthquake object

6
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:21,120
we can define an EarthquakeLoader
class which extends from

7
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:23,470
AsyncTaskLoader List Earthquake.

8
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,290
The generic type in brackets is
the type of data we want loaded.

9
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:31,290
As for the last blank,
within the EarthquakeLoader class,

10
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:34,320
we need to override
the loadInBackground method,

11
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,600
which will run on the background thread
and then return a list of earthquakes.
