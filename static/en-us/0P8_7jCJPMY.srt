Before we said that we can translate our absolute value inequality, to say that

2
00:00:05,226 --> 00:00:10,225
the distance between x and 4 was at most 5. Now, however, we have the distance

3
00:00:10,225 --> 00:00:15,236
between x and 4 is at least 5. How would you translate this into a mathematical

4
00:00:15,236 --> 00:00:19,816
expression? Just as a hint try to use some absolute value signs and an

5
00:00:19,816 --> 00:00:20,717
inequality.
