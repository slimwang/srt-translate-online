1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,870
Let's emulate a custom device.

2
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:07,970
It should have the following
characteristics, a width of 412 pixels,

3
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:13,330
a height of 603 pixels,
a device pixel ratio of 3.5, and

4
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:15,930
then the user agent
string should be this.

5
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:18,850
You'll find a copy of it
in the instructor notes.

6
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:21,110
When you open the URL in
the instructor notes,

7
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:24,010
you'll see a website that looks
a little something like this.

8
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:27,780
Pop open Dev tools, and
then go ahead and start Emulation mode.

9
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:29,900
When you've successfully
emulated the device,

10
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:32,980
you'll see a code appear
somewhere on this website.

11
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:34,890
Type your code into
this box to continue.
