1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:02,570
After hearing about these
approximation schemes,

2
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:06,460
the optimist may be saying, hey,
maybe every NP complete problem

3
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:08,950
admits a fully polynomial
time approximation scheme.

4
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:12,834
Unfortunately, this isn't
true unless P is equal to NP.

5
00:00:12,834 --> 00:00:16,484
There are some problems where
approximating the optimum within certain

6
00:00:16,484 --> 00:00:19,055
factors, would lead to
a polynomial algorithm for

7
00:00:19,055 --> 00:00:20,930
solving every NP complete problem.

8
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:25,510
This phenomenon is known as
the hardness of approximation, and

9
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:27,860
occupies an important place
in the study of complexity.

10
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:39,600
We'll illustrate this idea by showing
that the traveling salesman problem

11
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,540
is hard to approximate to
within any constant factor.

12
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:46,290
In case you haven't seen the traveling
salesman problem before,

13
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:51,360
it can be stated like this, we're given
a graph G and usually all the edges

14
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:57,320
are present and with each one of them
is associated some cost or a distance.

15
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,450
We'll assume that all edges are present,
so

16
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:03,460
we won't draw them in our example
graphs like this one here.

17
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:07,320
The goal is to find the minimum
cost Hamiltonian cycle.

18
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:11,670
That is to say, we want to visit each
of the vertices without ever visiting

19
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:16,440
the same one twice, and to do so
in a way that minimizes

20
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:20,810
the sum of the costs associated with
each of the edges that we chose.

21
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:23,660
This problem is NP-complete in general.

22
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:28,960
And even a constant factor approximation
is impossible unless P = NP,

23
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:29,960
as we will prove next.
