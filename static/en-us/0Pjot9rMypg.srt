00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:04,740
Let's look at the solution for our 1-Bit History Quiz. We have a 1-Bit history

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:08,650
that starts at zero. And two bit counter for each possible history,

3
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:12,810
all counters start at strong not taken. And the pattern we are trying to predict

4
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:18,670
is the not taken, not taken, taken, etc. After 100 repetitions of this pattern,

5
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:21,930
what is the total number of mispredictions that we will have seen?

6
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:25,000
One way to approach this problem is simply to work through the table like we

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,740
have seen before. So we will have our state, the prediction, the outcome, and

8
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:36,140
whether we are correct. And now we will just work through the outcomes.

9
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:42,351
The outcomes will be N, N, T, N, N,

10
00:00:42,351 --> 00:00:48,690
T, etc. And of course we will not go through a 100 repetitions of this. Pretty

11
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:52,430
soon the predictor will start to be very consistent about what it's predicting

12
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:58,141
in each round of the pattern. The state initially is zero, strong not taken,

13
00:00:58,141 --> 00:01:03,980
strong not taken. The prediction as a result of that will be use 0th counter,

14
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:08,630
which is saying strong not taken. So the prediction will be not taken.

15
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:14,819
This agrees with the outcome, so we are correct. Update the predictor. So

16
00:01:14,819 --> 00:01:20,018
the state will be zero because the outcome was not taken. Strong not taken will

17
00:01:20,018 --> 00:01:23,737
be updated with a not taken outcome, so it stays strong not taken, and

18
00:01:23,737 --> 00:01:28,870
the other counter just stays the same. Now the predictor again, will predict not

19
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:33,870
taken, using zero and strong not taken. And it will again be correct.

20
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:39,810
So, the history stays at zero, the strong not taken stays at strong not taken,

21
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:43,220
and the other counter just stays the same. And at this point,

22
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:48,000
we will again, with the history of zero use this, predict not taken strongly and

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,230
be wrong this time. So after one round, we have a single misprediction.

24
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:58,634
The history will be one now. And the predictor here

25
00:01:58,634 --> 00:02:04,940
will be updated to weak, not taken, because there has been a taken outcome.

26
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:09,449
And the other predictor just stays the same. Now we will use a history of one,

27
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:14,420
to index say strong not taken. So the outcome will be not taken and

28
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:20,040
be correct. Next, we will keep the strong not taken here.

29
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:26,420
The other counter stays the same. The history becomes zero because of this, and

30
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:31,800
we will use a history of zero to index into the weak not taken state, and

31
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:36,230
thus predict not taken again. Again we are correct in our decision.

32
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:42,820
Next, the history stays zero, because the decision was not taken.

33
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:47,240
The update of the weak not taken goes back to the strong not taken,

34
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:52,000
because the decision was not taken, the other counter stays the same.

35
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,720
And using the history of zero, we will index and use this counter.

36
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,160
This counter says strong not taken, so we will predict not taken.

37
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:04,520
This will disagree with the taken prediction, so we will have a misprediction.

38
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:08,311
This concludes round two. As you can see, at the end of round two,

39
00:03:08,311 --> 00:03:11,495
we have the same state that we had at the end of round one.

40
00:03:11,495 --> 00:03:16,316
So now, pretty much what happened in round two will repeat more times.

41
00:03:16,316 --> 00:03:21,228
Overall, in the 100 repetitions of this, in each repetition we have a single

42
00:03:21,228 --> 00:03:26,455
misprediction. So, the correct answer is that we have 100 mispredictions, or

43
00:03:26,455 --> 00:03:32,190
one-third of our decisions are wrong. As you can see,

44
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:36,640
the 1-bit history predictor is not a great predictor for this type of a pattern.
