1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:04,130
The answers at the app bar should
stay in place at the first and

2
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:05,990
the third screens.

3
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:06,550
Let's take a look.

4
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:10,910
In the first screen,
since the app bar is above the content,

5
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:16,140
forming a step, the content surface
should slide beneath the app bar.

6
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:18,020
In the second screen,
since the app bar and

7
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:22,010
content are adjacent surfaces,
they form a seam.

8
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:24,150
When you slide the content surface,

9
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:28,770
the app bar has to move as well to
make space for the content surface.

10
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:33,110
In the last screen, the app bar is
below the content surface, again,

11
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:34,690
forming a step.

12
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:37,290
But, this time,
when scrolling the content, it should

13
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:41,070
cover the app bar since the content
surface is at a higher elevation.
