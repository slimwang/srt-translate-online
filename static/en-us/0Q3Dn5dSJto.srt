1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,576
Alright.

2
00:00:00,582 --> 00:00:05,025
I need to think about how many rounds of divisions I'll have. I know my cells

3
00:00:05,037 --> 00:00:09,245
are going to replicate over one day. One day is 24 hours. I know my cell divides

4
00:00:09,257 --> 00:00:13,775
every 2 hours, so I can take 24 hours and divide it by 2 hours, that'll give me

5
00:00:13,787 --> 00:00:18,490
12. This is the number of rounds of division I'll have. My cells are quadrupling

6
00:00:18,502 --> 00:00:23,110
each time after a round of division. I went from one cell to four cells. So

7
00:00:23,122 --> 00:00:27,915
remember, this cell would split into four more cells. This one would, too. And

8
00:00:27,927 --> 00:00:32,527
this one would, too. And so, would this last one. I went from 1, to 4, to 16.

9
00:00:32,631 --> 00:00:37,248
I'm quadrupling the number of cells I have. So my base should be 4, and I have

10
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:42,865
12 rounds of division, 4 to the 12th. And I get an answer of 16,777,216. That's

11
00:00:42,877 --> 00:00:48,443
a ton of cells. We are going to figure out an easier way to write this number in

12
00:00:48,455 --> 00:00:51,191
the next section. Great job for now if you got that right.
