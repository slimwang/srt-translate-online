00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:06,166
Here x must equal positive 1. Nice problem solving if you figured this out. We

2
00:00:06,166 --> 00:00:11,364
start solving this problem by multiplying x times x plus 2. Since we're adding

3
00:00:11,364 --> 00:00:16,053
two logs with the same base, we can just multiply these arguments together. So

4
00:00:16,053 --> 00:00:20,751
we'll have log base 4 of x times x, which is x squared, and x times 2, which is

5
00:00:20,751 --> 00:00:27,693
plus 2x. The log base 4 of 3 stays on the right-hand side of the equation. Now

6
00:00:27,693 --> 00:00:30,804
that we have a logarithm on one side of the equation here and a logarithm of

7
00:00:30,804 --> 00:00:35,494
something else here, we can set these two things equal to one another. We

8
00:00:35,494 --> 00:00:39,462
want to factor this quadratic, but first we need to subtract 3 from both sides,

9
00:00:39,462 --> 00:00:47,635
to set it equal to zero. Now factoring, we get x plus 3 times x minus 1. We set

10
00:00:47,635 --> 00:00:51,796
each of these factors equal to 0 so x can equal negative 3 or x can equal

11
00:00:51,796 --> 00:00:56,650
positive 1. Now keep in mind that we want these arguments to be positive so

12
00:00:56,650 --> 00:01:01,776
that way we can take a log of them. So if x were equal to negative 3, I would

13
00:01:01,776 --> 00:01:07,679
have a negative number here. I can't take the log base 4 of negative 3. That's

14
00:01:07,679 --> 00:01:13,746
not possible. So this solution is out. This means the only solution is x equals

15
00:01:13,746 --> 00:01:15,513
positive 1.
