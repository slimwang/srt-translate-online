1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:04,330
Recall the tree based reduction
where its dual or broadcast.

2
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:06,830
Now, even though, it doesn't
attain the lower bound on end,

3
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:08,920
it doesn't mean it's no good.

4
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:09,480
So, even though,

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:14,770
this term depends on log p, it doesn't
mean that it's a terrible algorithm.

6
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:19,360
The question is, under what condition,
is it still a reasonable algorithm?

7
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:22,270
So I've listed a bunch of choices here,
and I want you to check all that apply.
