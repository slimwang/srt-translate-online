1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,450
The next step is to monetize a new app.

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:04,830
So we click on this button here.

3
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:08,790
And that brings us to the page
where you can add your app.

4
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:12,690
So how does AdMob know about your app?

5
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:17,730
It does so by searching in the Google
Play store or in iTunes App Store.

6
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:21,340
Yes, that means that before you
can connect your app to AdMob,

7
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:24,760
it must be available on
one of these two outlets.

8
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:27,870
So the Google user I registered
the AdMob account with

9
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:30,870
has already published an app
to the Google play store.

10
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:32,990
So I will search for it here.

11
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:35,110
And as you can see,
I've found the app here.

12
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:39,580
And I will select this app and
attach it to the AdMob account.
