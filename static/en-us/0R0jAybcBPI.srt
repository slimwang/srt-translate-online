00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:04,273
That was bad. It shouldn't have skipped from here back up to the next letter.

2
00:00:04,273 --> 00:00:07,933
The o in Hello is the beginning of a new vowel group, but the program didn't

3
00:00:07,933 --> 00:00:13,650
count it that way. It looks like it didn't run these lines, because inside

4
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:19,020
vowel group is already true. But that's a mistake. Inside vowel groups should

5
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:24,618
be false, because the letter before o was l, which is a consonant. How would

6
00:00:24,618 --> 00:00:29,030
you fix that? I'll make a few suggestions and you can pick the one you think

7
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:34,044
will work and implement it. Should we remove the condition, if not inside vowel

8
00:00:34,044 --> 00:00:39,356
group, so that we always increment counts for vowels. We could change the

9
00:00:39,356 --> 00:00:43,572
condition of the inner if block from not inside vowel group to count equals

10
00:00:43,572 --> 00:00:50,424
equals 1. We could set inside vowel group to false right after count plus plus

11
00:00:50,424 --> 00:00:57,190
or set inside vowel group to false when letter is not a vowel.
