1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
And the answer is these 4 points over here.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
And the reason is, if you draw the line of equal distance between C1 and C2,

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
the separation of these 2 cluster areas falls over here.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 99:59:59,999
C2 is down there. C1 is up here.
