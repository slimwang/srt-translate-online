1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
This is our first quiz.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Given a single image and given parameters of the camera like the focal length

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and all the other parameters, can we recover the depth or range of a scene?

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
And I'll give you a couple of possible answers.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Yes, always; sometimes; or never.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
We haven't even talked about this. This requires some thinking on your end.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 99:59:59,999
But give it your best try.
