1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:04,019
So we've been talking about
sort of MAC models and BLP,

2
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:08,560
Bell and
LaPadula is one example of that.

3
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:10,280
That's the Biba model.

4
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:13,970
Anytime we talk about a model, you have
to say what's the nature of the labels?

5
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:15,090
How do you compare them?

6
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:16,670
What kind of rules do you have?

7
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:19,230
Similar to what we had in the BLP model.

8
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:23,880
The Biba model actually
is dual of the BLP model.

9
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:28,370
And this duality is because rather
than focusing on confidentiality,

10
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:32,390
which is what BLP focuses on,
Biba focuses on integrity.

11
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:37,330
Integrity is defined, somebody being
able to write or corrupt data.

12
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:41,790
The interpretation here is that, when
you say it is top secret information,

13
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:44,240
it is really top secret information or
something like that,

14
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,720
or the information indeed
should be at that level.

15
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:49,570
So think about the sort of, quality
of information rather than disclosure

16
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:52,130
of information that
confidentiality focuses on.

17
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:59,080
So it's dual because the rules actually
are opposite of what we had in BLP.

18
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:01,660
When you're concerned about
information quality or

19
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:04,440
integrity you want to read-up.

20
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,704
Because anything below you is lower,

21
00:01:06,704 --> 00:01:10,370
I mean information with lower integrity,
you don't want to read that.

22
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:12,687
So reads in BLP you have read-down,

23
00:01:12,687 --> 00:01:16,170
here you're going to have
read-up in the Biba model.

24
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:20,440
BLP you have write-up,
in Biba you have write-down.

25
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:25,240
So if you're at a certain level,
well, the integrity of

26
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:29,440
the information that you can create and
then write is either at your level or or

27
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:33,120
it's less integrity than
the level at which you are.

28
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,710
So you're able to write down.

29
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:38,000
Again, we're not concerned about
confidential disclosure here.

30
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,250
We're concerned about
information integrity.

31
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:45,260
Okay, so let's look at an example
to clarify this a bit.

32
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:49,640
Let's say integrity could be high
integrity, medium integrity, or

33
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,420
low integrity.

34
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:55,290
So saying information quality, think
of your favorite newspaper that you

35
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:59,760
trust a lot, let's say for me,
it may be the New York Times,

36
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:04,880
the information that appears there is
highly likely that I can trust it.

37
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:09,960
Your supermarket tabloid,
let's say at the other end.

38
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:14,180
Apologies to anyone who
may be a fan of those.

39
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:15,900
When you're talking
with confidentiality,

40
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:19,350
anyone, it's not about
controlling who can see it.

41
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:21,910
It's controlling how
good the information is.

42
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:24,460
So here it's high, medium, or low.

43
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:26,380
Compartment could be similar to BLP,

44
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:28,840
depending on what
the information is about.

45
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:34,130
Really, it's the topics of the document
that contains that information.

46
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:35,600
So label here.

47
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,950
So anytime I quote a model I
said I want to talk about,

48
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:39,280
what does the label look like.

49
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:44,010
So, high, medium, low is ordered again,
totally ordered compartments,

50
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:46,280
partially ordered,
because they are sets.

51
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:49,450
And, the model says low
integrity information should

52
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:51,490
never flow into high
integrity documents.
