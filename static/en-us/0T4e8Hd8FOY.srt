1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,930
Our goal is to create a model to understand a phenomenon.

2
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:06,090
We cannot do this in isolation.

3
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:08,690
Modeling must be done in tandem with forming and

4
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:12,100
reforming questions, and validating the model that we create.

5
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:14,680
The process of model building in data analysis can be

6
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:17,050
thought of as occurring in three phases.

7
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:19,730
Questioning, modeling, and validating.

8
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:22,870
In the course of analysis we are constantly iterating back and

9
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:26,790
forth among these things in successive loops that build upon each other.

10
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:30,330
So it turns out that the single most frequent call to AT&T's helpline is,

11
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:32,118
when will my UVerse technician arrive.

12
00:00:32,118 --> 00:00:35,680
And so AT&T thought it would be valuable to create a model for

13
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,430
performing this prediction.

14
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:40,910
So my modeling process began with a simple question.

15
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:43,070
When will my service tech arrive?

16
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:47,090
Now in order to make this question answerable, it has to be made quantitative.

17
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:50,610
And so we must choose a metric that captures this phenomenon
