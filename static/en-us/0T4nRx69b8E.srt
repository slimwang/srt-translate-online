00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,730
So, what is the big picture with

2
00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:04,710
virtualization? In either of the two approaches that

3
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:07,530
I mentioned, whether it is full virtualization or

4
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:12,090
parel virtualization, we have to virtualize, the hardware

5
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:16,530
resources and make them available safely to

6
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:19,330
the operating systems that are running on top

7
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:22,300
of the hypervisor. And when we talk about

8
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:26,560
hardware resources, we're talking about the memory hierarchy,

9
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,440
the CPU, and the devices that are there

10
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,580
in the hardware platform. How to virtualize them

11
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:36,040
and make them available in a transparent manner

12
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:39,750
for use by the operating systems that live above

13
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:43,050
the hypervisor? And how do we affect? Data

14
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:46,760
and control transfer between the guest operating systems

15
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:48,780
and the hyper-visor. So these are all the

16
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:51,870
questions that we will be digging deeper into in

17
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:55,840
this course module. That wraps up the basic introduction to

18
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,390
virtualization technology And now it is time to roll up

19
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:03,410
our sleeves and look deeper into the nuts and bolts

20
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:07,130
of virtualizing the different hardware elements in the hypervisor. .
