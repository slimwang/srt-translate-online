1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:05,160
So to summarize the advantage of RC over SC, is that, there is no waiting for

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:10,310
coherence actions on every memory access. So you can overlap computation with

3
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:13,420
communication. So the expectation is that you

4
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:15,380
will get better performance in a shared

5
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:20,300
memory machine if you use the RC memory model, compared to an SC memory model.
