1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,966
And the answer is if the pattern is the empty string, then that matches anything,

2
00:00:03,967 --> 00:00:09,532
because the empty string occurs in every text, even if the text is itself empty.

3
00:00:09,533 --> 00:00:12,466
So we just return "true" no matter what.

4
00:00:12,467 --> 00:00:18,399
If the pattern is the dollar sign, that means that matches only at the very end of the text.

5
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:23,366
So we want to return "true" only if the text is the empty string.

6
00:00:23,367 --> 00:00:30,132
So we say "return does the text equal the empty string?" True if that's true, false if that's false.

7
00:00:30,133 --> 00:00:36,866
And I put parentheses around it just as a convention of when you're checking in a return value.

8
00:00:36,867 --> 00:00:40,667
It makes it a little bit easier to see that this is a return value.
