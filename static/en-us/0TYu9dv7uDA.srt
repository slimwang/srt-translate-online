1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,140
Let's use this method of selecting a range of rows and

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:07,300
columns to extract a larger portion from an image.

3
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:10,620
By the way, this is also known as cropping an image.

4
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:12,710
Let's use a different picture this time.

5
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:14,309
Let's see what it looks like.

6
00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:16,460
All right, a classic two-wheeler there.

7
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:20,154
Let's check the size of the image first.

8
00:00:20,154 --> 00:00:23,780
All right, 320 by 500.

9
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:27,700
When cropping this image, we'd want our limits to be within this range.

10
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:37,120
Let's say we want to select rows 110 through 310, and columns 10 through 160.

11
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,190
I wonder what we'll find there.

12
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:42,020
That's the front wheel.

13
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:42,820
No points for that.

14
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:45,950
So what is the size of the cropped image?
