1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,280
>> All right Charles, so, so, what do you think the answer is here?

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:04,470
>> Actually I don't know what you're looking for here.

3
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:07,100
>> Oh, okay. Well, so one thing that's true. We

4
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:10,120
had to sample the, the variables from A to E.

5
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:10,541
>> Mm-hm.

6
00:00:10,541 --> 00:00:12,620
>> And that's alphabetical order. So do

7
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:13,780
you think that's what I was looking for?

8
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:19,190
>> Maybe in this case but I would think that that wouldn't be generally true.

9
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:21,610
>> True. Right. So, yeah, alphabetical is not what I

10
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:25,260
was looking for. So, there's it's a graph theoretic property

11
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:27,350
that says we want to basically put the nodes

12
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:29,330
in order, so that you always put the things

13
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:31,680
that have incoming links that haven't been visited yet

14
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:34,610
after the ones where you, they have been visited.

15
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:36,270
>> Oh, so it is a lot like alphabetical

16
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:38,990
or a lot like lexo-, lexicographic, but it's topological.

17
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:42,290
>> There we go. Yeah, that's what I was looking for. So, topological sort.

18
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:43,990
>> Which makes perfect sense.

19
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:46,590
>> Right, and so this a standard thing that you can do with a graph, and it's

20
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:48,340
very quick to, to actually compute one of

21
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:51,550
these. It does depend on a particular property, though.

22
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:55,010
>> Let's see. Topological only makes sense if you really can

23
00:00:55,010 --> 00:01:00,120
go from no parents to parents. So, it cannot be cyclical. You

24
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:04,319
can't have arrows that take you back. So, E can't be a

25
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:07,100
parent of A and also have A be one of its parents.

26
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:07,510
>> That's right.

27
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:08,570
>> So it must be acyclic.

28
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:10,820
>> Must be acyclic, right. And that's going to

29
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:12,690
be true in these cases, because we're always going

30
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:17,150
to set it up so that in a, in a Bayes net, the variable that we're each

31
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:20,440
variable depends on other variables. But they all, it ultimately has to bottom

32
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:24,870
out. There can't by cyclic dependencies. So, it is a directed acyclic graph.

33
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:27,790
>> So, what would it mean if there were cycles?

34
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:29,800
>> I don't know. I don't know what to do with such a graph.

35
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,370
>> It just doesn't mean anything at all, I guess.

36
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:34,910
>> Yeah, I mean, there, there is a family of undirected models.

37
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:36,321
>> Mm-hm.

38
00:01:36,321 --> 00:01:39,365
>> But we're talking only about the directed ones here. So, the directed

39
00:01:39,365 --> 00:01:42,380
ones yeah, it'd have to be acyclic for the, for the probability distribution

40
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:43,100
to be meaningful.

41
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:44,065
>> Well, that makes sense.

42
00:01:44,065 --> 00:01:46,870
>> I'm sure we could make something up, but this is, typically

43
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:50,710
this is how it's done. It's, it's, we constrain ourselves to acyclic graphs.

44
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:52,350
>> Well, if a Bayesian network is

45
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:55,809
supposed to capture conditional independencies, then if you

46
00:01:55,809 --> 00:01:58,540
add cycles, that's like saying there are none,

47
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:01,440
right? I'm not even sure what that means.

48
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,830
>> I could make it mean something. So here,

49
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:07,490
we, we want the probability of A, conditioned on probability

50
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:11,230
of A. Well, maybe that's like probability of what, what A was one time step

51
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:13,037
ago. Or it could mean that it, you

52
00:02:13,037 --> 00:02:15,437
know, that, that we've actually putting constraints on

53
00:02:15,437 --> 00:02:18,040
the joint assignment to all the variables.

54
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:21,330
But, yeah, it's not really, it doesn't really,

55
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:22,860
it makes things more complicated and that's not

56
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:24,740
he model that, that is the typical one

57
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:26,110
>> Okay, fair enough.
