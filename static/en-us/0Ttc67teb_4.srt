1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:04,620
Thus far, we've seen how to design and implement

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:07,580
scalable algorithms that go into the guts of an

3
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:10,750
operating system for a parallel machine. Now it is

4
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:13,820
time to look at a case study of an operating

5
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:15,740
system that has been built for a shared memory

6
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:19,740
multiprocessor. This operating system is called Tornado. And the

7
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:22,560
purpose of this case study is to understand the

8
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,210
principles that go into the structuring of an operating system

9
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:28,870
for a shared memory multi-processor. Thus far,

10
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:31,010
we have covered a lot of ground on

11
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:33,630
parallel systems. And as a reminder, I want

12
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:35,750
to tell you that you should be reading

13
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:40,010
and understanding the papers by Merigram and Scard

14
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:44,240
on synchronization. Anderson and others on communication issues

15
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:48,190
in parallel systems, Skilante and others on scheduling

16
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:51,330
federal loans, scheduling. To get the full benefit

17
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:54,230
of all the lectures you've seen already, you definitely should

18
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:57,020
read and understand all those papers. And all these papers

19
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:59,490
are listed in the reading list for the course anyhow.

20
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:02,590
And what we're going to do now is look at how some

21
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:06,730
of the techniques that we've discussed thus far gets into

22
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:09,950
a parallel operating system. So, I'm going to look at one

23
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:13,070
or two examples of parallel operating system case studies, so

24
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:16,680
that we can understand these issues somewhat in in more detail.
