1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:03,220
Alright, now, part of the reason, we can't just solve these

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:06,590
kinds of problems by solving, a system of linear equations and just

3
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:08,680
being done with it, the reason we have to do these squares

4
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:12,480
is because of the presence of errors. The training data that, that

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,290
we are given, has errors in it. And it's not that

6
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:19,950
we're actually modelling, a function, but ,the thing that we're seeing is

7
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:23,230
the function plus some, you know, some error term on each piece

8
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:26,010
of data. So, I think, it's reasonable to, to think about where

9
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:28,340
did these errors come from? So, I don't know,

10
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:30,270
what do you think ,Charles, why, why is it we're

11
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:32,310
trying to fit data, that ,has error in it,

12
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:34,940
can't we just, can't we just have no errors? [LAUGH]

13
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:37,340
>> I would like to have no errors. Certainly ,my code, has

14
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:40,900
no errors. [CROSSTALK] well, so let's see where might errors come from.

15
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:46,340
So, they could come from, sensor error, right? Just ,somehow you're, you're

16
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:51,380
getting inputs and you're getting outputs and that output's, being read by,

17
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:55,320
some machine or by a camera or by something and you just, there's just

18
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,480
error in the way that you read the data. Just an error in the sensors.

19
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,870
>> Alright, can you think of other ways. I guess, I

20
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:03,140
guess ,in this case you're imagining that the data came by

21
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:06,570
actually measuring something, with the machine. So that, that makes, a

22
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:09,740
lot of sense. What other ways, can we put together the data?

23
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:12,350
>> I don't know I could think of a bunch. I mean

24
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:16,450
the error, well, the errors could come, maliciously. There could be some,

25
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:19,750
something out there, that is trying to give us bad data.

26
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:22,260
>> Alright, that seems like a possibility, that, when the

27
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:25,740
data set was collected, let's say that we're collecting, various,

28
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:30,990
Oh, maybe if I. Oh, this happens, this happens a

29
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:33,830
lot. So, so, if you're trying to collect data from

30
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:36,770
other Computer Science departments and you're trying to put together,

31
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:39,340
some kind of collection of, you know, how much do you

32
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:43,748
spend on your. Graduate students ,say,uh, sometimes ,these departments will

33
00:01:43,748 --> 00:01:47,108
actually misrepresent the data and give you give you, things that

34
00:01:47,108 --> 00:01:48,945
are wrong. Because, they don't want to tell you the

35
00:01:48,945 --> 00:01:50,910
truth, because they're afraid of what you are going to do.

36
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:51,940
>> Yeah, I've noticed that everyone does

37
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:53,779
that except, for Georgia Tech and Brown University.

38
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:58,850
>> Yeah, there are highly honest and reputable universities in my experience.

39
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:00,360
>> Yeah, that's what I feel.

40
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,800
>> well, another time that you can get data, is if somebody, is,

41
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:08,180
copying stuff down. So, what about sort of the idea of a transcription error.

42
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:09,370
>> Uh-huh.

43
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:10,350
>> So we're just, you know, we've

44
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:12,730
copied everything, but, you know, there's, there's

45
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:15,990
just some of the, some of the lines that got filled in just got mistyped.

46
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:17,960
>> Yeah, and you think ,that's different from sensor error?

47
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,280
>> Well, it's, it's maybe a slightly different

48
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,020
kind of sensor error, right? So ,sensor errors

49
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:25,270
were actually saying there's something physical, that's being

50
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:29,220
measured and there's just noise in that. Transcription

51
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:31,605
error, is similar except it's a person. [LAUGH]

52
00:02:31,605 --> 00:02:31,730
>> Mm.

53
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:33,390
>> Right? The, the there's a little blips in the

54
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:35,620
person's head and they can do, it can be a

55
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:38,090
very different kind of error. You can get, like transpositions

56
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:41,600
of digits, maybe instead of ,um, just you know, noise.

57
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:46,530
>> Okay, how bout, how bout one more? How about ,uh,

58
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:50,680
there's really, just noise, in the process. So how about that, that we

59
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:54,360
took in input X, but there's something else going on in the world, that

60
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,395
we weren't measuring, and so the output

61
00:02:57,395 --> 00:02:59,815
,might depend on other things besides, simply

62
00:02:59,815 --> 00:03:02,440
,the input that we're looking at. So what would be an example of that?

63
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:05,910
>> So an un-modeled influence, might be, well, if we're.

64
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:07,205
>> [CROSSTALK] Let's look at the housing data.

65
00:03:07,205 --> 00:03:08,800
>> That's what I, that's what I was thinking

66
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,770
exactly. So ,in the housing data ,we were just

67
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:15,550
trying to relate, the size of the houses, to the price, but, there's

68
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:18,130
a lot of other things like size of the houses to the price and

69
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:19,540
>> Location, location.

70
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:22,480
>> Location and location, right those are three really good reasons, that

71
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,370
are not in the particular regression,

72
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:27,107
that we did, that could ,actually influence

73
00:03:27,107 --> 00:03:30,580
the prices. So right, that and, you know, the quality of the

74
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:33,980
house and who, who built it, and, you know, the colors, the colors.

75
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:36,850
>> Even, even, even time of day, or what

76
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:39,620
the interest rates were that morning, versus the, what

77
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:42,100
people thought they might be the next day. Who knows?

78
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,530
>> Right and so all these different things are

79
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:46,950
being considered ,in that particular regression, so we're just

80
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:48,840
kind of imagining ,that it's noise, that it's just

81
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:52,340
having a, a ,uh, bumpy influence on the whole process.

82
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:52,840
>> Sure.

83
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:57,280
>> All right. So, so what I'd like you to do is select ,the ones

84
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,350
that you think actually are important, the

85
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:01,990
ones that, that, that could actually come up,

86
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:05,420
when you're using machine learning and regression to solve your problems.
