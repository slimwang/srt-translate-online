1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
And I'm sure you guessed this correctly--we're taking the sum of the outcomes of the normalized

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
by the total number of experiments and because the outcomes is 0 and 1, the sum over here

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:18,000
cannot exceed the value n; hence, this expression over here will always be between 0 and 1,

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
which is the value of probability.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
For reasons that should be obvious in a minute, we call this the maximum-likelihood estimator.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Keep this formula in mind--it is a really good way to guess an underlying probability

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
that might've produced any given data set.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Let's generalize this to more than two outcomes.
