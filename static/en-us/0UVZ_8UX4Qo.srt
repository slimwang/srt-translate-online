1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:04,770
The method would look like river.replace and the first argument would be i and

2
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:10,900
the second one would be x, the return value would be Mxssxssxppx. Let's look at

3
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:15,060
the javadoc to see why. To find the javadoc for the string class we'll search,

4
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:19,370
and I'm just doing this in Google. So, I'm in the documentation for the string

5
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:27,595
class. You want to scroll down and look for the Method Summaries. Under the

6
00:00:27,595 --> 00:00:33,338
method summaries, there are a couple of different options for replace. Let's

7
00:00:33,338 --> 00:00:38,463
look at this one. It has a detailed description here, it takes a target and

8
00:00:38,463 --> 00:00:43,500
replacement. The target is the things that we want to replace, and the

9
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,250
replacement is what we should replace them with. So in our case, the target

10
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:50,810
would be i in quotation marks, and the replacement would be x in quotation

11
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:57,240
marks. We can demo how this works in BlueJ. On the river string, I call replace

12
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:04,480
and I replace i with x. [SOUND], and we got what we expected.
