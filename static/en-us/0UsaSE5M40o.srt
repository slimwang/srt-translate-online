1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:02,040
Now its your turn.

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:04,570
Add activity transitions
between the main activity and

3
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:08,080
the detail activity for
both portrait and landscape views.

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,220
So, start by creating new themes,
the main and detail activity and

5
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:13,150
applying them in the android manifest.

6
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:17,060
The, create enter and return transition
resources for both portrait and

7
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:20,870
landscape that match the video
that we have playing here.

8
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:22,470
Note that the animation resources for

9
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:27,560
the main activity just set the window
content transitions flag to true.

10
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:31,390
Add the transition resources then to v21
versions of the app in detail activity

11
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:32,570
styles, and

12
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:36,274
the start the activity using the bundle
from makeSceneTransitionAnimations.
