1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
This one was tricky--you're going to count start on the left and on the right

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
and these points over here defined the critical region.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:21,000
If you were to move it inbound, you'd find that 0.022 plus 0.005 becomes larger than 0.025

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
with just half of the confidence that you have to exclude over here.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Now since we know that these must smaller or equal to 2.5% each,

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
we have to exclude 3 and 11 from the critical region,

7
00:00:37,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and 3 shall be fine for these two sample tests.
