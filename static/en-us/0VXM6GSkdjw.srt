1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,570
So how can we deal with the case where either v or u already has an assignment?

2
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:06,700
Do we have to modify the search tree for that?

3
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:09,740
Do we have to initiate a brute force search in that case?

4
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:12,980
Or is it the case that we do not need to worry at all

5
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:17,140
because it's actually quite obvious what to do with those vertices?

6
00:00:17,140 --> 99:59:59,999
Please select whichever you think is correct.
