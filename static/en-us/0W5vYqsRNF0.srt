00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
So welcome back to statistics 101. Today, we're going to learn something insanely cool.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
You might remember from the very beginning of this class that we had

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
data sets that involve more than one dimension.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
For example, the size of a house is relative to its price, and initially, we talked about scatter plots,

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
we talked about bar charts but we didn't talk about what's the holy grail of statistics,

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
and that is fitting a line through the data points.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
After this unit, you'll be able to fit a line to data points like those

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
and you'll even be able to tell me what the residual error is in that fit, and that allows us

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
not just to understand the data but also to make predictions about points we've never seen before.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
So let's dive straight in--so let's talk about lines and let's talk about the technology

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
to fit lines to data called linear regression.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
It has two dimensional data such as the age of a person

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
and the person's income and this is obviously made up data.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Then linear regression tries to fit a line that best describes the data.

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
So how do we specify a line--suppose we call the horizontal x as x

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
and suppose we call the vertical axis y then the lines commonly described

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:21,000
with a functional relationship between x and y of the following form y=bx+a.

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
So let us look at lines. Let's take this simple example y=2x.

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Let's add units to the axes of coordinate system and let me draw 3 different examples of lines.

20
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
The blue line, the green line, and the red line and for this example y=2x.

21
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Can you imagine which of the three lines would be described for this equation.

22
00:01:41,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Please check one of these three boxes.
