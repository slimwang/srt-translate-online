1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:01,970
Okay, so, how man do you want to look at?

2
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:05,190
>> Well in this case it, you know, I feel like I could draw a, a

3
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:07,620
kind of extended city block zone and capture

4
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:09,990
maybe, I don't know, five of the points.

5
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:11,350
>> Okay, let's do it. So let's find our

6
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:14,680
five, our five nearest neighbors. So let's see. This is

7
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:20,040
clearly close, that's one over here. I'd

8
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:25,540
say this is close. I'll say this one is close. This one's close.

9
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:27,830
None of the other blue ones are actually that close. And I'd

10
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:31,400
say that's the next closest one, so here are my little five points.

11
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:36,090
That all seem relative near. So what does that tell you?

12
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:39,360
>> Well, I mean, it's, it feels like it

13
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,090
suggests that red is not a bad choice here.

14
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:43,110
>> Mm

15
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:44,830
>> It's in a reddish part of town.

16
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:47,400
>> Yeah, I get that. So, so you think it's a

17
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:51,820
pretty, fair thing to bet that this should be red then?

18
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:55,220
>> Yeah I mean I think that if you were really asking me seriously

19
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:58,980
I would wonder about that blue point to the right of the highway and whether

20
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,620
that had any influence.

21
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:02,320
>> That's pretty far away.

22
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,710
>> Yeah, it's not that far away.

23
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:05,470
>> Well in Atlanta, once you cross highways

24
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:07,070
you might as well be an infinite distance away.

25
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:10,360
>> Well so, okay, but. That's a good point then.

26
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:13,610
So, I guess I was interpreting your notion of distance as

27
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:16,830
being, you know, like straight line distance on the map. But

28
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:19,510
maybe that doesn't make sense for this kind of neighborhood example.

29
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:21,660
>> Hm, no, that's a good point. So,

30
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:24,600
we've been talking about distance sort of implicitly.

31
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:29,785
But this notion of distance. It's actually quite important. So maybe distance is

32
00:01:29,785 --> 00:01:31,820
straight-line distance, maybe it's as the crow

33
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:34,460
flies. Maybe it's driving distance. Maybe it

34
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:37,180
has to take into account the fact that, when you cross highways in

35
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:39,080
Atlanta, you're typically moving into a completely

36
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:41,390
different universe. These sorts of things matter.

37
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:45,170
>> Yeah. So I could imagine I don't know, like Google Maps distance.

38
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:47,820
>> Right. Or how many paths can you get there

39
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,730
and which is the shortest one given the traffic? There's all

40
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:51,900
kinds of things like that you could do. So. So that's

41
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:54,410
fair, that's fair. But that just says that this, this distant, we

42
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:56,320
have to be very careful what we mean by distance and

43
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,600
that's okay. But let's just say for the sake of this discussion

44
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,410
that these are the closest points by some reasonable measure of

45
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:06,860
distance. So, in that world, would you be happy if you had

46
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:10,600
to pick a single example? a single output, a single label

47
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:14,340
of red ,uh, blue or green. Would you be happy picking red?

48
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:15,360
>> Yeah, I

49
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,220
mean you know, not ecstatic, but okay.

50
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,910
>> That's fair. So, I like this. So, we, we

51
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:24,460
went from just picking our nearest neighbor to picking our nearest

52
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:27,220
neighbors. And ,what's a good value you think we should,

53
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:29,590
we should stick to with neighbors? We started with one and

54
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:32,410
that clearly wasn't good. You picked, at least not in

55
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:36,370
all cases and you came up with five. So what do

56
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:39,150
you think? What, what, if I'm going to call this algorithm something,

57
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:40,550
what do you think five nearest neighbors? What do you think?

58
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:41,050
What should I call it?

59
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:44,570
>> Five seems good. I mean I feel like that, that's gotta be universal.

60
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:45,660
>> The number five?

61
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:46,190
>> Yeah.

62
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:48,430
>> Well it is in Atlanta but it might

63
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:50,290
not be univeral in wherever it is you are.

64
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:52,760
>> We'll call it the Georgia Tech nearest neighbors.

65
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:56,330
>> That doesn't seem like an algorithm that's going to to be used very much.

66
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:59,730
>> Fair enough. All right. So what about,

67
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:01,590
we could do as many nearest neighbors as

68
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:05,570
is appropriate. Or maybe we should just make it a free parameter and call it K.

69
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:07,380
>> Ok, I like that. K nearest neighbors, so we'll have K

70
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:09,320
nearest neighbors. And we'll pick our K numbers. Oh, and you said

71
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,880
something fancy there, by the way. You said free parameter. I like

72
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,880
that. We should, we should come back to that again. So we

73
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:17,890
have an algorithm, k nearest neighbors. Which takes K nearest neighbors as

74
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:21,930
a way of deciding how you're going to label some query point here.

75
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:26,240
And we've identified two parameters to the algorithm so far. K Which

76
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:29,810
is the number of neighbors we're going to use. And some notion of distance.

77
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:30,310
>> Oh, sure.

78
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:30,610
>> Which

79
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:32,770
here we were kind of using in the sort of obvious way,

80
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:35,530
but there might be other ways we might want to use distance here.

81
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:38,030
>> Yeah, like I could imagine if the houses, if,

82
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:42,500
had additional features like how many Square footages they had.

83
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,510
>> Right, stuff like that. That would make perfect sense.

84
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:47,720
So, so really distance, we're using distance here in a kind

85
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:50,520
of in an over loaded sense, because this is something

86
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:54,100
on a map. But really distance is a standard for similarity.

87
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,940
>> Similarity, good. It's kind of standard

88
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:57,210
for the opposite of similarity.

89
00:03:57,210 --> 00:04:00,210
>> [LAUGH] Well distance is just a kind of similarity, right?

90
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:03,760
But in case of, you know, points on the map. Similarity,

91
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,930
it sort of makes sense because as you said when we

92
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:07,270
were talking about real estate, location,

93
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:10,660
location, location matters. So, there, similarity

94
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:13,760
really is kind of the inverse of distance. But in other

95
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,649
ways, things like the number of veterans you have, whether you're

96
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:18,100
one on side of the highway or the other, the school

97
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:21,089
district you're in, things like that, are other things you might add

98
00:04:21,089 --> 00:04:24,940
as features or dimensions when you talk about similarity or distance.

99
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:26,870
Okay, so I like this. I think we have a general algorithm

100
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:29,580
now and I think it does a pretty good job of

101
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:33,200
addressing the points you brought up. We no longer have to worry

102
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:36,490
about overfitting as much, at least it seems that way to

103
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:38,880
me. And we have a way of being a little bit more

104
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,830
robust to this, you know, not having an exact data point

105
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:45,830
in the database. So ,maybe we should turn this into an algorithm.

106
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:46,610
>> Yeah,

107
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:47,250
let's go for it.

108
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:47,980
>> Okay, let's do that.
