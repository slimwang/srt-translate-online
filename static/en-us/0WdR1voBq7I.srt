1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,730
All right. Let's try creating a maintenance ticket and see if this works.

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:03,160
>> Sounds good.

3
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:06,850
>> So the technician I'm guessing will be me.

4
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:10,130
>> Yeah. So in this case it has to be you, but I mean, usually

5
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:13,290
there'll be a bunch of people in an organization, so you could add any user.

6
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:17,550
>> Okay. the stage will be the Udacity Stage, let's say. Status, New.

7
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:20,940
Priority high and let's say that the

8
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:23,430
description is that everything is completely broken.

9
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:25,120
>> Got your work cut

10
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:25,740
out for you, Andy.

11
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:29,050
>> I know. This is bad news. So save.

12
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:31,160
>> So you should be able to see the tasks

13
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:33,800
that we've just created from this page. But we'd have to

14
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:37,220
add that related list of the activities and activity history onto

15
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:39,030
the page layout in order to be able to see that.

16
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:40,520
>> Okay, so I'll edit the layout.
