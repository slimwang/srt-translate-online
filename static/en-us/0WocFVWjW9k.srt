1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:04,140
The communication all comes from
the two broadcast operations.

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:11,820
Their cost depends on what
you assume about the cost of

3
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:17,970
a broadcast.

4
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:23,370
The little m in these formulas
denotes the size of the message.

5
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:24,370
Now for this question,

6
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:27,930
little m corresponds to the size
of these little blocks.

7
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:28,620
How large are they?

8
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:34,030
Recall that the dimensions
are n over root P by s.

9
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:36,230
Now to get the total
volume of communication,

10
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:41,430
remember that we execute this pair
of broadcasts, n over s times.

11
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:43,840
Thus the total communication
volume we have to pay for

12
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,410
is n/s times the size of each message.

13
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:50,860
That, it turns out is n
squared over square root of P.

14
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:53,840
So assuming a choice of
these two implementations,

15
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,870
here are two possible correct pairings.

16
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:58,480
If you assume the tree based algorithm,

17
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,040
then a correct pair would be log P and
log P.

18
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:05,269
If, on the other hand, you assume
the bucketing based algorithm,

19
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:09,114
then a correct pairing would be P and 1.
