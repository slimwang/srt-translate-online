1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,950
So here is the question you
were asked to answer, and

2
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:05,330
here is one possible answer.

3
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:09,340
Select name from animals where
species equals llama, and

4
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:16,000
birthdate is greater than or equal to
the beginning of 1995, January 1, 1995.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,210
And birthdate is less than or
equal to December 31, 1998.

6
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:25,750
So, just as when you did this manually,
your query should have found one llama,

7
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:27,220
Allison the llama.

8
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:29,630
Now we can have the database
find our llamas for us,

9
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:31,520
instead of doing it by hand.

10
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:34,470
This is a pretty big help if we
have lots and lots of llamas.
