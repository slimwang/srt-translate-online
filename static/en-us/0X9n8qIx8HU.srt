1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:03,830
So for the question of where to store
the background color information.

2
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:06,580
We could have stored the background
color in the Word object.

3
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:09,380
So that means for all number words

4
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:12,480
we could pass in the orange color
as an input in the constructor.

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,830
But that would be a lot of wasted memory
because we're remembering the same color

6
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:19,780
for all the words in the same category.

7
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:23,340
If we want to reduce the amount of
repeated information in our app,

8
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:26,460
the more appropriate place is
to store the color information

9
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,410
in the WordAdapter class.

10
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:32,650
So each activity has its own
list view and WordAdapter.

11
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:36,390
So for each WordAdapter,
we can store a color inside it,

12
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:38,510
according to the category
it was created for.

13
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:43,062
So as I wrote here, we can store
the background color information in

14
00:00:43,062 --> 00:00:46,660
the WordAdapter, so every time a new
WordAdapter object is created for

15
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:51,050
a certain list, it will apply the same
background color to all list items.

16
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:53,450
So following this logic,

17
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:57,410
the WordAdapter in the numbers
activity would store the orange color.

18
00:00:57,410 --> 00:01:02,030
The WordAdapter in the family activity
would hold the green color and so on.

19
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:05,224
Well, you may be wondering why don't
we just store it in the activity then?

20
00:01:05,224 --> 00:01:08,210
Because each activity
has a different color.

21
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:11,430
Well, the activity does
need to know the color but

22
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:14,550
only when we initialize the WordAdapter.

23
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:15,840
So ultimately,

24
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,370
the WordAdapter has to store the color
as a global variable so that it can

25
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:24,810
keep referring back to the color every
time it creates a new list item layout.
