1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The answer is the first one.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Bob should compute yA to the xB power modulo q.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
The second one would compute the same thing.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
This is in fact exactly what Alice computed,

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
but Bob can't do this because he doesn't know xA.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
The third one wouldn't compute the same key,

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
so the correctness property is that Alice and Bob obtain the same key,

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
and we can show this by just plugging in the values.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
The key Alice computed was yB to the xA.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
The value of yB is g to the xB, so that's equivalent

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
to g to the xB xA mod q.

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The key that Bob would compute--and we'll write that as key BA

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
since we haven't yet shown that they're equivalent using this equation.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Well, yA is g to the xA, so this is g to the xA xB mod q.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
And we already showed that powers of powers are commutative,

16
00:00:47,000 --> 99:59:59,999
so these two are equivalent.
