00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:04,406
Let's extend these ideas to a more complicated situation. You might have

2
00:00:04,406 --> 00:00:07,826
received a survey that I sent out, asking you to rank your engagement and

3
00:00:07,826 --> 00:00:13,700
learning, from 1 to 10. Thank you to everyone who took this poll. I collected

4
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:16,976
the first 235 scores, as reported by Saturday, March 16th And I put them in a

5
00:00:16,976 --> 00:00:23,175
link at the bottom so you can click on that and analyze the data. I removed any

6
00:00:23,175 --> 00:00:27,960
blank responses but that's it. One thing to note before beginning to analyze

7
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,380
this data is that I didn't state a very clear operation definition of

8
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:36,540
engagement and learning. FOr example if someone has only had time to view one

9
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:41,486
lesson, but then life got in the way. Their engagement might be one. That

10
00:00:41,486 --> 00:00:46,610
doesn't necessarily mean that they didn't enjoy what they were watching. So,

11
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:51,110
there are many arbitrary reasons why someone may choose the number they did.

12
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:54,728
This is a good example, where confidence intervals are not necessarily the best

13
00:00:54,728 --> 00:01:00,400
way to analyze this data after some kind of intervention. Because there's not a

14
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:03,760
real meaning to the scores people give, but in general, we know that higher

15
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:09,420
scores are better, and this is where hypothesis testing comes in. First let's

16
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:14,162
get to know this data. Here are histograms showing students' responses. For

17
00:01:14,162 --> 00:01:18,797
this next example, let's just focus on engagement. What are the mean and

18
00:01:18,797 --> 00:01:23,106
standard deviation engagement scores? Even though the responses are a sample,

19
00:01:23,106 --> 00:01:27,410
just treat it as a population for the sake of this example. You're welcome to

20
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:30,714
also calculate the mean and standard deviation for learning if you're

21
00:01:30,714 --> 00:01:35,693
interested. But we really only need the parameters for engagement.
