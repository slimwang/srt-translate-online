00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,014
Here, the graph of y equals x squared is this red curve and the graph of y

2
00:00:04,014 --> 00:00:08,218
equals x squared minus 3 is the greenish-yellow one. You can see that these

3
00:00:08,218 --> 00:00:12,535
curves are actually identical. The only difference comes from the presence of

4
00:00:12,535 --> 00:00:17,044
this minus 3 in the equation, y equals x squared minus 3. This shifts the graph

5
00:00:17,044 --> 00:00:21,272
down 3 units. If we shifted the green curve up 3, then it would exactly overlap

6
00:00:21,272 --> 00:00:25,121
with the red one. This is pretty interesting. This is exactly what we saw

7
00:00:25,121 --> 00:00:29,215
earlier when we were dealing with Grant's profit equation and graph. When we

8
00:00:29,215 --> 00:00:32,859
changed the constant term on the end, it moved the graph up and down.
