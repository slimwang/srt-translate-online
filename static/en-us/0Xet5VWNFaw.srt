00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:04,019
This exercise has illustrated the construction of an analysis model for

2
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:07,370
the text browser problem. We haven't yet begun to solve the problem,

3
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:12,080
which is what design is all about. To begin thinking about design ask yourself,

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,110
what is the key design question with which any implementation of

5
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:19,530
the text browser must deal? We're not going to answer that question right now,

6
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:22,950
but we will come back to this a little while later, and maybe by that time you

7
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:26,470
will have thought through what it would take to actually to do a design here.
