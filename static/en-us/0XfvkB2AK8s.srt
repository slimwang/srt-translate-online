>> Solving for x, we get x equals 24 for this equation, and x equals 28 for this

2
00:00:05,075 --> 00:00:10,017
equation. Interestingly enough, these are the x-coordinates of the two

3
00:00:10,017 --> 00:00:15,383
x-intercepts of our graph. So remember what we actually did? We started off by

4
00:00:15,383 --> 00:00:20,812
picking out 0 as the y value for which we wanted to find corresponding x values.

5
00:00:20,812 --> 00:00:25,482
On this parabola. Plugging in that value for y, or in other words substituting

6
00:00:25,482 --> 00:00:29,969
in 0 in the place of y in the equation, we solve for x. To get the corresponding

7
00:00:29,969 --> 00:00:34,582
x coordinates at the various points on the graph where the y coordinate is 0. So

8
00:00:34,582 --> 00:00:40,534
the reason that we have two answers here is because there are two points on the

9
00:00:40,534 --> 00:00:44,596
graph, 4,0 and 28,0 that are the same Y value of zero.
