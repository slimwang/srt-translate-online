00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,150
So after plotting histograms and looking at peoples guesses

2
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:07,130
about their audience size, I wanted to see how

3
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:10,120
that matched up with there actual audience size. So

4
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:13,300
then at that point I turned to scatter plots. So

5
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:16,420
here's an example of the first scatter plots that

6
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:18,630
we did looking at this. So on the x

7
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:23,070
axis is how many people actually saw that post.

8
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:25,810
And on the Y axis is how many people our

9
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:30,020
survey respondents guessed saw the post. If they guessed

10
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:33,880
perfectly accurately, their guess would fall along this dotted diagonal

11
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:37,110
line. That's the perfect accuracy line. But one of the

12
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:39,910
things that stands out with, in the scatter plot, is

13
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:43,050
that you see these horizontal stripes. That's again because

14
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:45,470
people are guessing these regular numbers. You see a really

15
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:49,140
clear stripe at about 50 and another really clear stripe

16
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:50,860
at a hundred, and a little bit of a stripe

17
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:54,532
at 200. And you really see that these all of this,

18
00:00:54,532 --> 00:00:58,310
the points on the scatter plot are just this big cluster at

19
00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:03,720
the bottom. So people are guessing very small numbers. 20, 50, something

20
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:08,959
like that, when in reality their audience size is 100 or 200.
