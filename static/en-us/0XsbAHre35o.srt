00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,556
It's a really good idea to be familiar with some common algorithms for

2
00:00:03,556 --> 00:00:08,090
processing values in a loop. You've seen a couple of them already. You've seen

3
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:11,429
how to compute the average of a sequence of inputs and you've seen how to find

4
00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:15,448
the largest element. There are quite a few more like that, counting matches,

5
00:00:15,448 --> 00:00:19,507
finding the first match, position of the first match, finding all matches. And

6
00:00:19,507 --> 00:00:22,920
so on, and so on. Instead of me tediously telling you something about each of

7
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,834
them, we've prepared a fact sheet where you can find the pseudo-code and an

8
00:00:25,834 --> 00:00:31,060
example for easy reference. And Sara will practice a couple of those with you.

9
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:34,651
The point is that you want to be familiar with what algorithms are out there,

10
00:00:34,651 --> 00:00:37,829
so that you can adapt them as necessary.
