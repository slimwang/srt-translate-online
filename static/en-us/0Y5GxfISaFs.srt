00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:02,180
Here's the algorithm I had in mind.

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:07,110
It's the FFT, or
the fast Fourier transform.

3
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:10,050
It's used in lots of places,
including signal and image processing,

4
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:14,370
turbulence simulation, molecular
simulation among many, many others.

5
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:16,560
And, since you've
mastered bitonic merge,

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,910
you basically know how to
parallelize an FFT as well.

7
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:24,980
Indeed, there is a fantastic lesson
on the FFT in another OMSCS class.

8
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:27,360
We'll put a link in
the instructor's notes.

9
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,070
As far as jokes go, here's one.

10
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:34,030
Oh dear, that is really awful.

11
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:37,150
I think even a tenured professor can
get fired for telling a joke like that.

12
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:38,870
You're going to edit this out, right?
