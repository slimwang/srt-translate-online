1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The answer is the first and the third are true.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
For the first one we know that the size of r is equal to φ(n).

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
That's the way the totient is defined.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
It's the number of positive integers less than n that are relatively prime to n.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
That's exactly how we define r.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
The second one is not true.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
In order for this not to be true, it would mean that there is some element where a xi mod n

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:29,000
is equal to axj mod n, but that's not the case, because a and n are relatively prime.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
We know that these values must all be different.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
The only way these could be equal is if xi is equal to xj.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
That means that the sets are the same size, and this set contains numbers only up to n - 1.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
This set also contains numbers from 1 to n - 1.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
That's why we know that s actually contains the same elements as r.

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
It must be a permutation of r.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Now we can use a similar idea to what we used in the proof for Fermat's little theorem.

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
We can take the product of these two sets.

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Since we know the contain the same elements, we know their products are also equal.

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Here is what we get: the Π(R) is equal to the xi's all multiplied together,

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
which is equal to the Π(S), which is equal to these values all multiplied together.

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:22,000
We also know from this property that the number of terms is φ(n).

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
That's true on both sides.

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
That means we can separate out the a's from the x's.

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:38,000
We're going to have a^φ(n) times all the x's--still equal to this product.

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Now we can do the division.

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Removing the x's from both sides, we end up with exactly what we need,

26
00:01:45,000 --> 99:59:59,999
which is that 1 is congruent to a^φ(n) mod n for any a and n where a and n are relatively prime.
