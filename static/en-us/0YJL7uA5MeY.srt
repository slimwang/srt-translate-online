1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,235
To figure out each of these points, we just need to look at the point above on

2
00:00:03,235 --> 00:00:08,760
f and switch the order of the coordinates. So instead of 0, negative 1, we'll

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:14,163
have negative 1,0. Instead of 1,2, we'll have 2,1. And instead of negative 1,

4
00:00:14,163 --> 00:00:17,809
negative 4, we'll have negative 4, negative 1.
