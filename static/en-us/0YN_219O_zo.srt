1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:02,520
Once you've got all of
your features implemented,

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:04,990
you'll have a working prototype for
your app.

3
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:08,210
There might still be one or
two bugs that you need to work out, but

4
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:12,140
it's a really great time to start
getting feedback from other students and

5
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:13,380
family and friends.

6
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:17,760
So go ahead, take a minute and
share your app to the forums.

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,280
You can just export a zip file and

8
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:24,210
share that, or even better, you can
share a link to your GitHub repo.

9
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:27,940
The goal here is to get user feedback
on the look and the feel and

10
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:29,880
the functionality of the app.

11
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,659
It's a lot easier to
implement changes now than it

12
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:34,625
will be further on in
the development cycle.

13
00:00:35,676 --> 00:00:39,490
Also make sure that you let users know
of any known bugs so that you're not

14
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:43,250
getting duplicate reports of things
that you already know are wrong.

15
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:46,580
Then, take the time to review
two of your classmates' apps.

16
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:47,460
You never know.

17
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:48,900
You might learn something.

18
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:49,970
Check this box when you're done.
