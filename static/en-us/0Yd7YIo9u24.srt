1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:01,780
Now it's time for you to reflect and

2
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:05,860
try to apply what you have learned in
this lesson to a real life scenario.

3
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:08,430
Think back on an example
scenario you came up with

4
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:12,730
in the lesson one reflection exercise
whether it was at school or work.

5
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:16,100
Think about what type of data you
would expect to go in the database and

6
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:18,790
what type of data you would
consider to be invalid.

7
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:22,270
For example, if you're keeping track of
student test chords, you wouldn't want

8
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:25,830
negative test scores in the database,
that just wouldn't make sense.

9
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:29,480
So think about your scenario and then
share about it in the discussion form

10
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:30,600
and I look forward to hearing from you
