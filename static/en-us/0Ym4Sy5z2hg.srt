00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Here's our age distribution again and they come at certain frequencies.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Two of the people in the database are 19 years old, one is 20, one is 21,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
three at 22 and so on--there's 11 individuals.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
When I ask you the obvious question now--give me the lower quartile,

5
00:00:17,000 --> 99:59:59,999
the median and the upper quartile in these three boxes over here.
