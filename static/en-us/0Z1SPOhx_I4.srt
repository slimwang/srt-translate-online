1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:03,000
The first part of the answer
is that we're trying to map

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,165
a CNF formula into a 3-CNF one.

3
00:00:06,165 --> 00:00:09,570
We're trying to show that
3-CNF is as hard as CNF.

4
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:14,020
So that if we could solve 3-CNF,
we would solve CNF as well.

5
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:17,430
The such that part is a little subtle.

6
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:21,180
It's important to realize that the 3-CNF
formula we get doesn't have to be

7
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:24,130
logically equivalent to the general
CNF formula that we put in.

8
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:26,210
As we'll see,

9
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:29,210
it won't even make sense to talk about
having the same truth assignment

10
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:32,830
satisfy both formulas, because they'll
have different sets of variables.
