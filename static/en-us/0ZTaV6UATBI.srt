00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:06,518
>> If we look at this graph, it looks like 50,000 splits the data in half. So,

2
00:00:06,518 --> 00:00:13,388
we have about 500 values on this side and 500 on this side. 500 split in half is

3
00:00:13,388 --> 00:00:19,878
250. So, we know that the first quartile has to occur when there are 250 values,

4
00:00:19,878 --> 00:00:24,520
Which will be somewhere here. This is to the right of 25,000.
