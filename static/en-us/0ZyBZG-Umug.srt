1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:02,580
All right. So let's say that we look at our data

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:07,210
and it's clearly non-normal. Or we use a statistical test like

3
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:10,710
the Shapiroâ€“Wilk test and find that our data's non-normal that way.

4
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:13,170
Is there anything that we can do? Well, first off there's

5
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:15,380
some math that says that we have enough data. That we

6
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:18,040
have, you know, a large enough sample size we can actually

7
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:21,440
use tests that assume normality. For example, the t test. Even

8
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:25,750
when our data is not normal. But there also exists nonparametric tests

9
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:28,195
that we can use to compare two samples. A

10
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:31,480
non-parametric test is a statistical test that does not assume

11
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:35,820
our data is drawn from any particular underlying probability distribution.

12
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:39,020
One such test is the Mann-Whitney U Test which is

13
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:42,370
also sometimes referred to as the Mann-Whitney Wilcoxan Test.

14
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:44,820
This is a test of the null hypothesis that two

15
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:48,370
populations are the same. Again I don't want to go to

16
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:50,980
in depth into the theory of how this test works,

17
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:52,330
but I did want to tell you that things

18
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:54,340
like this exist and show you that this test

19
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:56,970
can also easily be implemented in Python using Psi

20
00:00:56,970 --> 00:01:02,310
Pi. We'd simply say U and P are equal

21
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:08,660
to scipy.stats.mannwhitneyu. And provides as arguments are two samples

22
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:11,224
which we'll call here X and Y. This function

23
00:01:11,224 --> 00:01:14,220
will return U, the Mann-Whitney test statistic. As well

24
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:16,110
as P, which is the one sided P value

25
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:18,920
for this test. The P value here again acts as

26
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:21,780
it did for the T test. Note that the Mann-Whitney

27
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:24,040
U test simply tests whether or not these samples came

28
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,940
from the same population. But not necessarily which one has

29
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:29,250
a higher mean or a higher median or anything like

30
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:32,180
that. Because of this it's usually useful to report Mann-Whitney

31
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:35,450
U test results along with some other information. Like, the

32
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:38,630
two sample means, or the sample medians, or something like that.
