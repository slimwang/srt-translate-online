Hi there, welcome back.

2
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:06,125
This week, we only have one lesson for
you, but it's an awesome one.

3
00:00:06,125 --> 00:00:08,240
You'll get an introduction
to TensorFlow,

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,585
a framework developed at Google
useful for building neural networks.

5
00:00:11,585 --> 00:00:15,652
Vincent Vanhouke, a Principal Scientist
on the Google Brain team will get you

6
00:00:15,651 --> 00:00:17,131
started with TensorFlow and

7
00:00:17,132 --> 00:00:20,830
teach you a lot of deep
learning basics along the way.

8
00:00:20,829 --> 00:00:23,820
Afterwards, Saraj will show you
how to deal with messy data and

9
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:26,629
get it ready to use in neural networks.

10
00:00:26,629 --> 00:00:27,179
Let's get started.
