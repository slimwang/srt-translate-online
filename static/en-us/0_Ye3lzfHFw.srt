00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:04,860
You may be thinking, wow this app looks
cool, but how do I even get started?

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:07,040
So lets go over a few quick basics.

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,960
First, this app is sort of similar to
some of the previous apps we've made

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,490
in this networking course.

5
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:14,280
You should feel comfortable using
those apps as references, or even for

6
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:15,830
some starting code.

7
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:17,790
Secondly, in the previous
apps we've made,

8
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:21,400
we've used various client API's to
build out the apps functionality.

9
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:25,850
For on the map you'll be using two
such client APIs, the Udacity API and

10
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:26,730
the Parse API.

11
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:31,330
You'll be using the Udacity API
to authenticate users.

12
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:34,130
You'll do this by working with a web
service method that we've exposed for

13
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:35,570
this purpose.

14
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:38,960
This Udacity API guide should
take you through the process.

15
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,500
The Parse API you'll be
using to access data for

16
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,329
the student pin locations and lengths.

17
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:46,880
Parse is a common solution
used by mobile apps for

18
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:50,420
a persistent data in the cloud, and
is an alternative to using core data,

19
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:52,820
which we'll actually be talking
about in the next course.

20
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:55,290
Note that while Parse does
have a SDK available for

21
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:59,990
iOS, we want you to use the Parse
web API for the on the map project.

22
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:03,150
This Parse API guide should take you
through the process of using Parse for

23
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:03,960
this purpose.

24
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:05,985
For this app,

25
00:01:05,985 --> 00:01:09,179
you'll also have the option to enable
users to login through Facebook.

26
00:01:09,179 --> 00:01:10,530
This feature is not required, but

27
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:13,990
we still want to give you some info
in case you decide to attempt it.

28
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:16,790
To enable Facebook login,
you'll need to do the following.

29
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:20,030
Read through Facebook's documentation
on their login feature.

30
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:23,250
Connect your own Udacity user
account to your Facebook account,

31
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:26,670
which can be done on the account
settings page of the Udacity website.

32
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:29,590
And at the bottom of the Udacity API
Guide, you'll find some methods that

33
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:31,890
you'll need to implement to get
the Facebook login working.

34
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:36,310
The last point I want to make is if you
think of the app as one massive project,

35
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:39,230
it can appear very daunting and
make it hard to get started.

36
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:42,540
That's why it's better to see the app as
a bunch of pieces that make a whole, and

37
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:44,800
tackle one chunk at a time.

38
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,670
Making a simple wire frame or
setting up the networking code of one of

39
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:50,710
the aforementioned clients
is a good place to start.

40
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:52,890
As always, check out the forums for
help or pointers.
