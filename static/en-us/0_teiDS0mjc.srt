1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,199
When it comes to paid marketing, you're
going to want to give it some extra

2
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:05,973
thought, and consider a few
things before going out there and

3
00:00:05,973 --> 00:00:07,543
paying to acquire new customers.

4
00:00:07,543 --> 00:00:11,025
After all, we are a start-up so
we want to spend our money wisely.

5
00:00:11,025 --> 00:00:13,825
Now, if you want to make sure
your growth is sustainable and

6
00:00:13,825 --> 00:00:16,865
your money is well spent,
you want to keep in mind a few metrics.

7
00:00:16,865 --> 00:00:21,767
Starting with ARPU or your average
revenue per customer, the LTV or

8
00:00:21,767 --> 00:00:26,501
lifetime value per customer, and
the CPA cost per acquisition.

9
00:00:26,501 --> 00:00:29,652
Now, you want to think about how much
money you're willing to spend per

10
00:00:29,652 --> 00:00:31,132
customer to get them in the door.

11
00:00:31,132 --> 00:00:34,523
So these are the things you need
to consider to determine this.

12
00:00:34,523 --> 00:00:37,529
So there's your ARPU,
your average revenue per user.

13
00:00:37,529 --> 00:00:41,398
So how much money are you going to
make per given customer over a certain

14
00:00:41,398 --> 00:00:42,127
time frame?

15
00:00:42,127 --> 00:00:46,401
Knowing your ARPU and your retention
rate, so how long you're keeping your

16
00:00:46,401 --> 00:00:50,358
customers with you can help you
calculate your lifetime value or LTV.

17
00:00:50,358 --> 00:00:53,094
Your LTV is the amount of money
you're likely to make from

18
00:00:53,094 --> 00:00:56,742
a given customer over the time that
they're affiliated with your company.

19
00:00:56,742 --> 00:01:00,818
Okay, let's take the lifetime
value of a gym member for example.

20
00:01:00,818 --> 00:01:05,269
So let's say the member spends $20
a month over three years on their

21
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:06,180
membership.

22
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:10,213
So that's $20 a month for
12 months for three years,

23
00:01:10,213 --> 00:01:13,589
giving you a total
lifetime value of $720 for

24
00:01:13,589 --> 00:01:17,964
that one customer in total revenue,
about $240 per year.

25
00:01:17,964 --> 00:01:21,385
Now, for startups who haven't
acquired any customers yet,

26
00:01:21,385 --> 00:01:24,164
determining your LTV is
nearly impossible to do.

27
00:01:24,164 --> 00:01:27,526
But since it's so helpful in
helping you define your goals and

28
00:01:27,526 --> 00:01:31,921
setting a baseline, It's really worth an
effort to at least estimate it based on

29
00:01:31,921 --> 00:01:35,607
the number of transactions a given
customer will make over a month or

30
00:01:35,607 --> 00:01:36,598
even over a year.

31
00:01:36,598 --> 00:01:38,501
Okay, let's take a aBARKment for
example.

32
00:01:38,501 --> 00:01:43,144
We charge $20 a month as a fee for
sitters to be listed on our site.

33
00:01:43,144 --> 00:01:47,338
And every time they get a sitting job,
we get 15% of what they're charging,

34
00:01:47,338 --> 00:01:49,982
which averages out to be
around $15 per month.

35
00:01:49,982 --> 00:01:54,241
And most sitters stay with us for
about 24 months, so

36
00:01:54,241 --> 00:01:57,680
this makes their lifetime value $840.

37
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,568
Your LTV and average revenue per
user is going to help drive how

38
00:02:01,568 --> 00:02:05,005
much you're willing to
spend to get new customers.

39
00:02:05,005 --> 00:02:08,866
So, if our cost per acquisition is
too close to our lifetime value or

40
00:02:08,866 --> 00:02:12,551
average revenue per user,
then we're doing something wrong.

41
00:02:12,551 --> 00:02:16,937
However, if our cost per
acquisition is $70 per sitter,

42
00:02:16,937 --> 00:02:21,583
we're profiting about $770 per
sitter we have on our site.

43
00:02:21,583 --> 00:02:25,599
This should make our average revenue
per user higher than how much it costs

44
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:28,665
us to gain that user,
which is really what your goal is.

45
00:02:28,665 --> 00:02:33,009
One thing I want to point out is you
should be looking at your LTV or

46
00:02:33,009 --> 00:02:34,306
ARPU per segment.

47
00:02:34,306 --> 00:02:36,338
Think back to market
segmentation about this.

48
00:02:36,338 --> 00:02:40,038
That way you can determine how much you
could have paid to acquire different

49
00:02:40,038 --> 00:02:41,690
users from different segments.

50
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:46,588
For example, if we decide to have our
dog owners pay a $50 monthly fee,

51
00:02:46,588 --> 00:02:49,748
and then we get 15% of
all of their bookings,

52
00:02:49,748 --> 00:02:54,488
which average out to about $22.50
a month and they stay with us for

53
00:02:54,488 --> 00:02:58,280
three years,
we're looking at an LTV of $2,610.

54
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:01,312
So we know we can spend more to
gain dog owners, because their

55
00:03:01,312 --> 00:03:05,362
lifetime value is significantly higher
than the lifetime value of dog sitters.

56
00:03:05,362 --> 00:03:08,143
Now, if your company has
different subscriptions,

57
00:03:08,143 --> 00:03:11,540
you may see that people in one
subscription group have a much lower

58
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:14,962
lifetime value than somebody
from another subscription group.

59
00:03:14,962 --> 00:03:18,718
That'll help you determine how much you
want to spend on getting people into

60
00:03:18,718 --> 00:03:20,396
different subscription tiers.

61
00:03:20,396 --> 00:03:24,006
For example, if people in the lowest
paying subscription don't stay with

62
00:03:24,006 --> 00:03:24,635
you as long,

63
00:03:24,635 --> 00:03:27,918
you're not going to want to spend as
much to acquire them as a customer.

64
00:03:27,918 --> 00:03:31,439
However, if people in, say your
platinum level stay with you for

65
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:33,807
a long time and
spend a ton of money with you,

66
00:03:33,807 --> 00:03:37,601
you can be willing to spend a little
bit more to acquire that customer.

67
00:03:37,601 --> 00:03:40,677
Now having said that,
our company is a marketplace.

68
00:03:40,677 --> 00:03:45,549
So in order to maintain this healthy
marketplace We have to ensure both

69
00:03:45,549 --> 00:03:46,962
supply and demand.

70
00:03:46,962 --> 00:03:50,593
So sometimes we may need to spend more
on sitters to sustain our supply or

71
00:03:50,593 --> 00:03:52,116
else the company would fail.

72
00:03:52,116 --> 00:03:55,007
Being a company the offers to
babysit your dog without people

73
00:03:55,007 --> 00:03:57,967
to actually babysit the dog,
it wouldn't work out too well.

74
00:03:57,967 --> 00:04:02,497
So these metrics are valid across online
customer acquisition channels and

75
00:04:02,497 --> 00:04:04,132
they're just beginning.

76
00:04:04,132 --> 00:04:05,977
You can also consider conversions.

77
00:04:05,977 --> 00:04:10,872
So, how many people actually become
customers, bounce rates for emails and

78
00:04:10,872 --> 00:04:14,197
even traffic from specific channels and
much more.

79
00:04:14,197 --> 00:04:17,632
We'll talk more about a few of these
during this lesson and the next.

80
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:20,814
So let's hear from Talley about
her advice on paid marketing.

81
00:04:20,814 --> 00:04:23,880
And then, we'll start talking
about our first channel, SEM, or

82
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,150
search engine marketing.
