00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,714
For the CPU code we'll actually just look at three lines of C source code

2
00:00:03,714 --> 00:00:08,479
without worrying about details like allocating memory or initializing the array.

3
00:00:08,479 --> 00:00:12,349
Here's our code. The first line is setting up the loop.

4
00:00:12,349 --> 00:00:15,852
We're going to loop from i = 0 until i = 63,

5
00:00:15,852 --> 00:00:18,420
incrementing i each time we walk through the loop.

6
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:20,830
What are we going to do on each iteration of the loop?

7
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:24,834
We're going to fetch the input value at array location i,

8
00:00:24,834 --> 00:00:29,069
multiply it times itself and store it into the output array.

9
00:00:29,069 --> 00:00:31,336
There's two interesting things to note about this code.

10
00:00:31,336 --> 00:00:34,903
One, we have only one thread of execution,

11
00:00:34,903 --> 00:00:38,106
and that thread explicitly loops over all of its input.

12
00:00:38,106 --> 00:00:42,484
We define thread here as one independent path of execution through the code.

13
00:00:42,484 --> 00:00:45,270
This definition is also going to apply to our GPU code.

14
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:49,418
Two, note this code has no explicit parallelism. This is serial code.

15
00:00:49,418 --> 00:00:54,754
There's only one thread and it loops 64 times, doing one computation per iteration.
