Hi, everybody. Welcome to the final unit of the course.

2
00:00:02,772 --> 00:00:06,974
We're delighted that you stuck with us and hopefully learned a whole lot about parallel programming with Cuda.

3
00:00:06,974 --> 00:00:09,511
Now, this unit is going to be a little bit different.

4
00:00:09,511 --> 00:00:14,117
Instead of discussing one topic in depth, we're going to go wide and discuss many topics briefly.

5
00:00:14,117 --> 00:00:16,920
The goal is to give you some pointers to things that you can follow up,

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,362
according to your own interest and needs.

7
00:00:18,362 --> 00:00:19,747
Let's get started.
