1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,659
We controlled for the time at which participants took the pill, the place at

2
00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:09,028
which they slept, because they all slept in the sleep lab, and what the pill

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:13,693
looks like? It looks the same for both the active and the placebo. We did not

4
00:00:13,706 --> 00:00:18,343
however control for gender and age. We can, however, minimize the impact of

5
00:00:18,355 --> 00:00:23,124
these variables on the results. Let me elaborate on this a little bit. Let's say

6
00:00:23,136 --> 00:00:27,921
that only females were assigned to the active pill. And only males were assigned

7
00:00:27,933 --> 00:00:32,661
to the inactive pill. Then, if people who took the active pill slept better. We

8
00:00:32,673 --> 00:00:37,354
wouldn't know if it was due to the medication in the pill or maybe women just

9
00:00:37,366 --> 00:00:42,421
sleep better than men. In this particular experiment, we are not controlling for

10
00:00:42,433 --> 00:00:47,231
these demographic variables, but we can minimize their impact on our results

11
00:00:47,243 --> 00:00:48,893
through random assignment.
