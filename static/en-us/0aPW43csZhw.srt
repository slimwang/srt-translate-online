1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:03,810
Now let us suppose that we get a new order in which a customer wants

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:09,080
a chair that weighs over 200 grams, costs at most $20, and has four legs.

3
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:15,090
Given the specification, what configuration process can use this knowledge to

4
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:19,250
fill in the values of all the variables to satisfy the specification. So

5
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:23,050
the first thing the process might do is to write down all the constraints that

6
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:25,340
are given as part of the input specification. So

7
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:28,590
the mass is greater than 200 grams, the cost is less than $20, and

8
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:34,190
the count of legs is 4. Now suppose that a configuration process has an abstract

9
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:39,280
plan which first decides on the value of the cost variable before it

10
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:44,360
decides on other variables. Let us also further suppose that this plan for

11
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:48,030
deciding the cost evenly distributes the cost between the greatest

12
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:52,790
components until unless specified otherwise by the specification. In this

13
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:57,500
case the cost plan distributes this cost of $20 between the four components and

14
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:01,990
assigns less than five for each one of them. Now we define an expanding plan.

15
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:06,140
This is two aspects to it, refine and expand. Index and

16
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:09,775
aspect we deal with the components instead of the chair as a whole. And

17
00:01:09,775 --> 00:01:13,299
the define aspect we deal with more detailed variables that were not there in

18
00:01:13,299 --> 00:01:18,910
the chair. Consider the component legs, for example. We already know the count,

19
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:22,490
four, in the input specification. We know the cost, no more than $5

20
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:27,270
from the higher level plan. Now we can design by using the other two variables,

21
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:31,520
25 grams and wood, for example. We can do the same for the other components.

22
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,770
As we assign values to the variables of each of these components, we get

23
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:39,470
a complete arrangement of all these components here, with values assigned to

24
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:43,650
each of the variables. Given the specific values we assign to the variables for

25
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:47,990
each of the components, we can now compute whether the constraint given in

26
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:51,830
the input specification are satisfied. In this particular example,

27
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:56,710
both the mass and the cost of the chair satisfy the input constraints. Note that

28
00:01:56,710 --> 00:02:01,250
the define and expands step in this particular process might have operated

29
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:05,900
a little differently. It is also possible that define and expand step might say,

30
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:09,680
the less, decide on the material before we decide on any of the other features.

31
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:13,280
Plus within thin complex configuration process, different designers may

32
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,620
use different plans and different plans to find expansion mechanisms.

33
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:21,390
Of course it is also possible that once we have a candidate solution,

34
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:25,540
the candidate solution may not necessarily satisfy the input constraints. So

35
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:27,961
the cost may turn out to be more than $20, for example.

36
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:32,950
In that case there are two options. Either we can iterate on the process,

37
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:36,850
loading the cost, or we can go about changing the specification.
