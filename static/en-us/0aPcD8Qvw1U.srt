Hi, my name is Jenny Kim. I'm a project manager here

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:06,860
at Udacity. And my job is basically to, basically to keep,

3
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:10,940
a whole bunch of different people and processes and resources organized

4
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:15,250
so that the courses are delivered on time. Including this course.

5
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:17,670
So, I'm going to tell you a little about my phone.

6
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:19,240
It's a new phone. I got it a couple weeks ago.

7
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:23,460
It's a, it's a a Nexus 5. The screen is awesome.

8
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:26,160
It's really pretty. It's really fun to touch and to use.

9
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,670
The one thing is I haven't actually made it a phone yet

10
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:31,580
because I don't have the little SIM card. I haven't had time

11
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:34,400
to go get that done, so I just use it on wi-fi

12
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:38,910
networks for the time being. So far my favorite app is Gmail.
