1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,765
Now, where would you place tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon on this chart? Would it

2
00:00:04,765 --> 00:00:09,338
go here? Not very awake and not very aware. Would it go here? Really aware but

3
00:00:09,338 --> 00:00:14,211
you're not awake. Would it go here where you're not aware but you are awake? Or

4
00:00:14,211 --> 00:00:18,784
would it go here where you're awake, but not completely aware? Select one that

5
00:00:18,784 --> 00:00:22,432
you think is where the tip-of-the tongue phenomenon would be on this chart of

6
00:00:22,432 --> 00:00:27,348
awareness and wakefulness. So, the more awake you are, you're over here and the

7
00:00:27,348 --> 00:00:30,036
more aware you are, you're up here.
