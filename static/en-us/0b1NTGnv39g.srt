Hi, I'm joined by Jenny Tong, the
Developer Advocate on the Firebase team.

3
00:00:22,921 --> 00:00:23,449
Welcome Jenny.

4
00:00:23,449 --> 00:00:24,560
>> Hello.

5
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,840
>> So I've got this friend
who has developing an app and

6
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:28,665
considering Firebase.

7
00:00:28,665 --> 00:00:31,002
Who's wondering if you have a little
time to answer some questions.

8
00:00:31,002 --> 00:00:32,920
>> Of course.
>> So, I guess the most basic question

9
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,340
is, do you have some examples of
Firebase being used in the real world.

10
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:39,690
>> Yes, a few examples come to mind
of a few great uses of Firebase.

11
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:45,880
One is Go To Meeting which uses Firebase
for real time signaling between clients.

12
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:49,000
So you know when somebody's
taken the mike to speak.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,390
Another example is Twitch TV,
which does video game streaming.

14
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:57,040
They use it for signaling all
their streams coming online.

15
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:01,590
My favorite is probably
Warby Parker's location in New York.

16
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:05,319
Warby Parker uses it to control
the pneumatic system that delivers your

17
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:06,780
glasses to you.

18
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:07,930
Right while you're waiting.

19
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:08,625
>> That's really cool.

20
00:01:08,625 --> 00:01:09,400
>> Mm-hm.

21
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:12,470
>> So why did these
developers go with Firebase?

22
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:15,820
What was unique about Firebase
that made it the choice for them?

23
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:19,600
>> So, I think the thing that makes
Firebase unique because there's a lot of

24
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:24,130
options for building back ends for you
is just how easy it is to use Firebase.

25
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:27,010
People usually get pretty comfortable
with Firebase after a few hours and

26
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:29,840
have a production-ready app
within In a couple of days.

27
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:30,670
>> That's awesome.

28
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:33,420
So in your opinion what
is like the killer app or

29
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:36,410
the most differentiating
piece of Firebase?

30
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:40,220
>> So I think the applications that
work best with Firebase are ones that

31
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:45,950
are going to be generating a lot of
structured data from user interactions.

32
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:49,600
Like one of the classic cases of this
is chat which is one of the deceptively

33
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,900
hard things to build on your own.

34
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:55,480
So things that you can model,
think of as

35
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:59,240
a track communication between multiple
people work really well in Firebase.

36
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:03,770
>> So just expanding on that, in your
opinion what are the classic uses?

37
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:05,540
What are the best apps that
are suited for Firebase?

38
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:08,220
>> The best apps that are suited for
Firebase.

39
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:13,030
So any situation where you have
like low frequency information or

40
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:17,140
medium frequency information coming
from mobile apps or web applications,

41
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:21,300
that need to be synchronized back and
forth between multiple platforms.

42
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,050
[INAUDIBLE] Web and mobile.

43
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:27,670
All those combinations, or even
signaling internet of think systems and

44
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:31,410
you don't want to build up independent
infrastructure for each one of those.

45
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:34,140
>> All right well Jenny thanks a lot for
your time today.

46
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:34,640
>> You're welcome.
