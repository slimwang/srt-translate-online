00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:04,800
One of the biggest challenges to VR,
is simulator sickness.

2
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:10,760
You may have heard that some VR
experiences can make you feel queasy,

3
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:13,550
dizzy, or give you headaches.

4
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:16,370
And this is absolutely true.

5
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:18,220
Some experiences can
cause those effects.

6
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:24,570
The good news is that you as a VR
developer, have the power to fix it.

7
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:30,405
This nano degree will teach you how to
make a VR app that is comfortable for

8
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:32,198
everyone.

9
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:35,340
Okay, so
what makes people uncomfortable?

10
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:42,320
Well pretty much anything that causes
a mismatch between your body's internal

11
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,940
sense of motion and the data your brain
receives from your visual system.

12
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:54,520
So if what you see doesn't
line up with your body feels,

13
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,920
then you'll start to
become uncomfortable.

14
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:01,930
Scientists believe natural
selection favored this trait

15
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:06,159
because of poison berries and other
innocuous-looking foods that harm you.

16
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:11,230
Poisons tend to make you feel dizzy.

17
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:16,110
And the best response is to eject
the bad food from your stomach

18
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:17,060
as quickly as possible.

19
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:23,650
Well, when VR isn't done correctly the
mismatch between your visual system and

20
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:27,820
your bodies internal sense of motion
triggers the exact same response.

21
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:33,590
This course is going to talk a lot
about the things that trigger simulator

22
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:37,380
sickness and we're going to
talk about how to fix them.

23
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:40,110
By the end of this course,

24
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:43,480
you'll be making VR apps that
are comfortable for everyone.
