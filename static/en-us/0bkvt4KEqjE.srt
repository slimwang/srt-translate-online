00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,040
Now that you're familiar with the basic R commands,

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:05,200
let's look at some more data. This time we'll be

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:08,215
looking at data collected from a survey of Reddit users.

4
00:00:08,215 --> 00:00:11,220
Reddit's a social and entertainment website where users can post

5
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:14,620
links and comments about trending news. This survey asks users

6
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:18,940
about demographic information such as gender, age, nationality and employment

7
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:21,720
status. It even asks users what type of cheese they

8
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:25,160
would be. And whether they prefer dogs, cats, or turtles.

9
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,740
Download the data set from the instructor notes and load it into

10
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:30,400
R. Once you've done that, take a look at the data by

11
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,560
using the stir function. Now when I try to read in the

12
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:37,060
file, sometimes I might get an error, and this is pretty common,

13
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:40,000
so I would suggest looking at your current working directory to figure

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,380
out the problem. Often times your directory isn't where your file is

15
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:47,320
stored. Alright, so I've set my directory, and now I'm going to try

16
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:51,448
this code up here again. And there we go, there's our data.

17
00:00:51,448 --> 00:00:53,600
Running the stir command, we can see that there's lots

18
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,150
of data here. Most of these variables have a type

19
00:00:56,150 --> 00:01:00,170
of factor. Now, a factor's a categorical variable that has

20
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:03,200
different flavors or levels to it. An example of this

21
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:06,660
would be employment status. This variable has many different levels

22
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:10,440
such as employed full time, or employed part time. Or

23
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:13,950
not working. One thing we might be interested in is

24
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:17,040
how many people are in each group of employment status.

25
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,270
We can table that variable to see the number in

26
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:22,250
each of these groups. Running this code I can see the

27
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:25,950
table. We can also get these counts and other data points

28
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:28,970
by running the summary function on our data frame. I encourage

29
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:31,640
you to check out the outfit of this for yourself. In

30
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:35,840
addition to factor variables like employment status, the R programming language

31
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,520
also has other data types like list and matrices, but we

32
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,150
really won't be working with them in this course. We've included

33
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:44,650
a reference for data types in the instructor notes, so if

34
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:46,580
you would like to learn more about those, check it out.
