1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:02,400
What if we have more data available?

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:06,560
Can we determine if the additional data
will result in a better prediction?

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,890
We also have some data that shows
the contract value per client against

4
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:11,460
the average number of tickets.

5
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:15,560
Using Google Sheets, we can plot
the data with a linear equation and

6
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,210
a value for r squared.

7
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:22,377
In this case, we have a linear equation
with an r squared value of 0.785.

8
00:00:22,377 --> 00:00:27,790
This new data is similar to the original
data when comparing values of r squared.

9
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:31,570
But what if we could use both sets of
data to develop a better predictor?

10
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:35,180
Let's introduce multiple linear
regression, which builds upon the simple

11
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:39,330
linear regression by using more data to
strengthen the correlation coefficient
