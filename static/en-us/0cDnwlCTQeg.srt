00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,160
We just used the ideas of
conditional probability and

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:07,110
independence in the context of our
polynomial verification algorithm.

3
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:09,170
Now let's discuss these
ideas in general.

4
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:13,050
We define the conditional
probability that an event E occurs,

5
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:17,810
given that an event F occurs,
as the probability that E and

6
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:21,760
F occur divided by
the probability that F occurs.

7
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,430
We can visualize this quantity
using a traditional Venn diagram.

8
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:28,580
We draw the whole sample
space as a large rectangle.

9
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:31,550
And within here we draw the set F,
like so.

10
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:34,490
When we talk about
the conditional probability of E,

11
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:40,520
given F, we are restricting ourselves
to the set F within the sample space.

12
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:45,310
Thus, only the portion of E that
is in F is important to us.

13
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:48,730
And to make this a proper probability,

14
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:51,830
we have to renormalize by
dividing by the probability of F.

15
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:57,720
That way the probability of E,
given F, and the probability of not E,

16
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:00,140
given F sum up to one.

17
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:05,550
An interesting situation is where
the probability of an event E, given F,

18
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:08,290
is the same as the probability
when F isn't given.

19
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:10,860
This implies that E and

20
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:15,210
F are independent,
one event doesn't depend on the other.

21
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:20,460
Formally, we say that two events, E and
F, are independent if the probability of

22
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:25,420
E and F is the probability of
E times the probability of F.

23
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:30,510
Note that this is a slightly more
general statement than this equality.

24
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:35,700
The probability of E, given F, isn't
defined if the probability of F is zero.
