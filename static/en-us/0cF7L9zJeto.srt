1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,920
The proof is relatively straightforward.

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:06,939
Recall that sigma star is
the union of the strings of size 0

3
00:00:06,939 --> 00:00:10,890
with those of size 1,
with those of size 2, etc.

4
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:16,300
And our overall strategy will be just
to assign the first numbers to sigma 0.

5
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:21,250
And the next to sigma 1, and
the next to sigma 2, etc.

6
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:25,680
More formally, we can can define N sub
K to be the total number of strings

7
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,430
of size at most K, and then use
this to create the correspondence.

8
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:35,470
Thus, Nk will be the last number
assigned to a string of length k.

9
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:38,700
So in this way,
1 will get assigned to the empty string,

10
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,300
the only element of sigma 0.

11
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:45,070
And then the next number
N0+1 through N1 that'll get

12
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:50,560
assigned to all the strings of length 1.

13
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:54,196
And in general, Nk-1+1 through Nk,

14
00:00:54,196 --> 00:01:00,470
those set of numbers will get assigned
to sigma k, the strings of length k.

15
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:04,640
Within each one of these arrows, you
can do the correspondence in any way.

16
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,360
Lexographical order is as good as any.

17
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,260
For example,

18
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:11,830
we can enumerate all the strings
over the binary alphabet like this.

19
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,380
First we assign one to the empty string,
then we enumerate

20
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:20,550
all strings of length one,
then those of length two, ans so forth.

21
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:24,400
This is the main theorem that we will
need here concerning countability.

22
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,490
But while we're on the subject,

23
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:29,530
we'll say a few words about countability
in general as a kind of bonus.

24
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:31,130
The same argument here,

25
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:35,110
shows that a countable union
of finite sets is countable.

26
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:39,045
Suppose that our collection
of sets is S0, S1, etc.

27
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:44,220
And without loss of generality,
we're suppose that they are disjoint.

28
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:47,120
If they happen not to be disjoint,
we can make them so

29
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,690
by just subtracting out from Sk.

30
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:52,560
All the elements it
shares with the sets,

31
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,710
s0 through Sk-1 then the argument
proceeds just as before.

32
00:01:57,710 --> 00:02:01,880
We assign the first numbers to S0,
the next to S1, etc.

33
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:06,780
Now it turns out that we can actually
prove something even stronger

34
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,750
than the original statement here.

35
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:12,630
We can replace the word finite
with the word countable, and

36
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:16,580
say that a countable union of
countable sets is countable.

37
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:19,030
Notice that our current
proof doesn't work.

38
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:23,690
If we tried to count all of the elements
of S0 before any elements of S1.

39
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:29,530
We might never get to the elements
of S1 because S0 could be infinite,

40
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:31,820
nevertheless this theorem is true.

41
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:38,940
For convenience of notation, we'll let
the elements of SK be XK0, XK1, etc.

42
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:45,370
And then we can make each SK
a row in a grid as shown here.

43
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:48,940
Again, we can't go row by row here
because we might not ever finish

44
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:51,860
the first row if S0 is infinite.

45
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:57,440
On the other hand, we can go diagonal by
diagonal since each diagonal is finite.

46
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,870
The union of all the Sk is
the union of all the rows, but

47
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:05,610
it's also the same thing as
the union of all the diagonals.

48
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:09,960
Each diagonal being finite, we can apply
the original version of this theorem

49
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:13,840
to prove that a countable union
of countable sets is countable.

50
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,290
You can also just translate the indices
here on X into an enumeration as well.

51
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:21,890
Note that this same idea proves
that the rationals are countable.

52
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:27,570
Imagine putting all the fractions with a
one in the denominator in the first row.

53
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:32,790
All those with a two in the denominator
in the second row, all those with

54
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:35,880
three in the denominator in the third
row, and so on and so forth.
