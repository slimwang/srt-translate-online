1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,902
Negative 1 and 3 halves, or 1 and a half, is correct. Excellent algebra skills

2
00:00:04,902 --> 00:00:08,389
for getting that one right. When we look at the quadratic equation, we want to

3
00:00:08,389 --> 00:00:12,514
look for our greatest common factor first. Each term shows a factor of 5. So I

4
00:00:12,514 --> 00:00:17,545
can factor that out. We can factor the 5 out, leaving us with 2a squared, minus

5
00:00:17,545 --> 00:00:21,937
a, minus 3. Remember to keep writing this as an equation. All of these factors

6
00:00:21,937 --> 00:00:27,000
multiplied together equal 0. Next I want to find factors of negative 6 that sum

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,628
to negative 1. I can use negative 3 and positive 2. We remove an a from the

8
00:00:31,628 --> 00:00:35,581
first group of terms and a positive 1 from the second group of terms. There's no

9
00:00:35,581 --> 00:00:39,747
other greatest common factor for these two terms except 1. I notice that I have

10
00:00:39,747 --> 00:00:44,737
2a minus 3 for both of the parenthesis. This lets me do factoring by grouping.

11
00:00:44,738 --> 00:00:49,601
We factor 2a minus 3 from this first term and the second term to leave us with a

12
00:00:49,601 --> 00:00:54,130
product of factors. Next we set each factor equal to 0, and then we solve for

13
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:59,356
the values of a. We know 5 doesn't equal 0, so this is not a solution. A could

14
00:00:59,356 --> 00:01:05,233
equal negative 1, or a could equal 3 halves. And this would be our solution set.
