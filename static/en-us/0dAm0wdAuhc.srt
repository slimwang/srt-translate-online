00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So now it's time for us to get some practice with an application of the Forward Euler Method.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This time, we define a function for you called trajectory --

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
that's going to determine the trajectory of a particle.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
We've already set the step size, the acceleration to the gravity and the initial speed of the particle.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Inside the definition, we've created an array called angles that's starts out at 20

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
and increases with increments of 10 up to 70.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
This creates a set of angles at which the particle can take off.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Over here, we see an example of what a ballistic trajectory of a particle

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
with a given initial angle might look like.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The next step is to create variables for position and velocity.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Each of these is an array where the number of rows equals the number of steps

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
that are going to be taken plus 1 and 2 columns.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Your job is to find equations for the position and velocity of a particle that show how

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
changing the initial take off angle of the particle changes its trajectory.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Fill in your code here and good luck.
