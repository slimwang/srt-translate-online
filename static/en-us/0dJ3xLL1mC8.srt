1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:02,920
Direct currently has some
technical limitations.

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:06,310
The first is disposition notification.

3
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:08,700
In certain situations,

4
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:11,950
it's very important to know that
a direct message has been received.

5
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:14,850
Clinical laboratories, for example,

6
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:17,990
are using Direct to send results
back to ordering physicians.

7
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:23,060
An abnormal result may
require urgent attention.

8
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:27,890
Confirmation of delivery is available,
although currently not very robust.

9
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:30,020
But it is accomplished
using encrypted and

10
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:33,430
signed message disposition notification.

11
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:37,020
Efforts to make this more robust
are discussed in the text.
