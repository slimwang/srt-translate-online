1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So the question is: suppose that Alice forgets the value that she used

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
for the initialization vector--she encrypted some file, she has the ciphertext

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
and she has the key. Can she still recover n, even though she forgot the IV?

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
--the Initial Value--

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
So the answers are: "No," she can't recover any of them;

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
"Almost," that she can recover all of them except for the very first block;

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
"Almost," that she can recover all of them except for the first and the second block;

8
00:00:28,000 --> 99:59:59,999
or that she can only recover the very last block of n.
