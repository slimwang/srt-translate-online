00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:04,190
Here's a linked list which I
want to represent in an array pool.

2
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:05,720
I want you to fill in these boxes.

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:09,550
Now, the array pool is of size 14,

4
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:12,630
whereas we only have 12
nodes on our linked list.

5
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:15,490
So that means there are going to
be some unknown values.

6
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:19,880
If you have an unknown value in
the V array, enter a question mark.

7
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:24,110
And if you have an unknown value in
the n array, use the value zero.

8
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:26,940
Zero will also be our proxy for a nil.

9
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:29,940
So for this nil pointer here,
enter the value zero.
