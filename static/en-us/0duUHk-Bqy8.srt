1
00:00:00,178 --> 00:00:05,230
Inside my project.pi file I will create
a route and function called fbconnect.

2
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:08,470
Similarly to my Google login,
I will verify the value of state

3
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:11,240
to protect against cross-site
reference forgery attacks.

4
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:15,780
I will then exchange this short-lived
token for a long-lived token here.

5
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:18,520
Notice that I have to send my
app secret along to Facebook

6
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:20,450
to verify my server's identity.

7
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,810
This token includes an expires
field that indicates how long this

8
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:24,980
token is valid.

9
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:27,650
Long term tokens can
last up to two months.

10
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:30,590
I'm going to strip the expires
tag from my token since I don't

11
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:32,240
need it to make API calls.

12
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:36,670
If the token works, I should be able to
make API calls with my new token like so

13
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:38,650
and populate my login session.

14
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:42,170
Facebook uses a separate API call
to retrieve a profile picture.

15
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:43,690
So I will make that call separately and

16
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:47,580
populate the login session with the URL
for the user's profile picture here.

17
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:51,220
Now I can use the exact same code from
my Google login to retrieve a user or

18
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:52,300
create a new one.

19
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:54,810
And go ahead and send that welcome
splash screen that we had before.
