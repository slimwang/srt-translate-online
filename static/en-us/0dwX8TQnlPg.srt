00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
In lecture, we introduced a centrality algorithm

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
that measures centrality by taking the average

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
distance from a node to all the other nodes that it can reach.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
We want you to modify this algorithm

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
to return the maximum distance from a node to all the other nodes it can reach.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
This algorithm captures a different notion of centrality.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
A node is central if no other node is very far away from it.
