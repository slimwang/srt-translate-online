00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:03,230
Now that you know about
different types of ideas and

2
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:07,920
how to find some of your own, it's time
for your to brainstorm a lot of ideas.

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,590
You want to generate many ideas so

4
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:13,330
you can test them later to determine
which one will be the best to pursue.

5
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:14,810
To get in brainstorming mode,

6
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:17,610
check out some of the links
in the instructor notes.

7
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:21,200
This brainstorming activity will
take two minutes of your time

8
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:24,390
Remember that at this point in
the process there are no bad ideas and

9
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:26,050
you shouldn't edit yourself.

10
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:28,610
We'll get to refining your ideas next.

11
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:31,460
For the first minutes, write down as
many problems you personally want

12
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:35,400
a solution for or you think someone
else, or another company could use.

13
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:38,850
If you don't have a physical timer,
there are many timers available online.

14
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:42,000
Then for the next minute,
write down any ideas you have for

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,250
solving those problems.

16
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:46,600
Once you brainstorm,
check this box to continue.
