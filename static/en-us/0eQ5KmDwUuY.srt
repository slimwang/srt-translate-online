00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,393
Building a relationship with an investor
is just like building a relationship

2
00:00:03,393 --> 00:00:04,216
with a colleague.

3
00:00:04,216 --> 00:00:07,622
It's something that fosters
over a long period of time and

4
00:00:07,622 --> 00:00:10,887
you get out of it what you're
willing to put into it, and

5
00:00:10,887 --> 00:00:15,610
you can't think of investors as people
you go to when there's a crisis.

6
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:19,160
You have to think of them as people
you can go to on a regular basis and

7
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:22,920
share ideas and get feedback and
react to that feedback.

8
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:27,330
And you can't, you have to figure out
how to balance doing exactly what

9
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:33,520
the investor says verses taking your own
path and figure out where that fits.

10
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,050
If you always do exactly
what the investors say,

11
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:38,470
that's probably not a recipe for
success.

12
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:41,800
Likewise if you ignore all of
the advice that you're getting,

13
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,010
that's not going to work out very well.
