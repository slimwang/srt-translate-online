1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,218
All of these are down sides to surveys. We can't always be sure that respondents

2
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:10,361
are answering truthfully. Even if surveys are anonymous, people don't always

3
00:00:10,373 --> 00:00:15,164
give the truth for some reason. It's probably a psychological thing, and

4
00:00:15,176 --> 00:00:20,494
oftentimes, without realizing it, we give biased answers. Everyone has their own

5
00:00:20,506 --> 00:00:25,250
bias based on where they grew up, the experiences that they went through, their

6
00:00:25,262 --> 00:00:29,865
beliefs and values. When respondents don't understand the questions, we get

7
00:00:29,877 --> 00:00:34,637
what's called response bias. That's why it's very important for those who write

8
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:39,257
the survey to be very precise in their wording. And finally, some people just

9
00:00:39,269 --> 00:00:43,705
refuse to answer, they don't feel comfortable answering that or they're

10
00:00:43,717 --> 00:00:48,593
incapable of doing so. There might be a certain group of people who don't answer

11
00:00:48,605 --> 00:00:52,998
the questions, and therefore, the data that we get from the survey doesn't

12
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:57,879
accurately represent them. When certain people refuse to answer, this is called

13
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:03,530
non-response bias. Remember when we talked about contructs? Surveys are often

14
00:01:03,542 --> 00:01:08,907
used to analyze constructs. And like I told you, I analyzed the construct

15
00:01:08,919 --> 00:01:14,776
effort. As you've seen, there isn't just one definition of a construct, there

16
00:01:14,788 --> 00:01:19,785
are many. Therefore, it's crucial to use as subjective measurements as possible.

17
00:01:19,887 --> 00:01:23,310
Surveys really have to be carefully thought out and worded.
