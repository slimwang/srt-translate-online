1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,460
So when I'm advising companies
on what kind of, on pricing and

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:06,910
payment plans and how to think
about monetization strategies.

3
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:10,470
Again, asking them, hey is this

4
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:13,640
a big enough market that freemium will
sort of work, where a small percentage

5
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:18,310
conversion of a large pool will make
sense for this to be a large company and

6
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:20,950
so you can just work the math
backwards to make that work.

7
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:23,060
Most of them have easy
questions about pricing,

8
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:24,620
like, what do I start charging this on?

9
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:28,390
So the first comparison is like, do you
have competitors charging for this?

10
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:29,050
What do they charge?

11
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:29,870
How does this sort of work?

12
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:34,710
If you are thinking about
enterprise companies,

13
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:39,240
the way we usually do is try to
figure out like well, how much money

14
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:43,420
is the company already spending, on
whatever it is, to solve this problem?

15
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:46,250
Usually you're not solving
a problem that nobody's working on.

16
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:49,560
It's usually some problem that
already exists in the company and

17
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,090
you have a better way of doing it.

18
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:55,120
And so the companies that will do poorly
in an enterprise is when there's no

19
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,352
budget carved out for
solving a specific problem.

20
00:00:58,352 --> 00:00:59,740
So if there is no budget carved out,

21
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:03,920
it is almost impossible to figure out
how to generate money out of thin air.

22
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,510
People can only spend money that is
allocated to them by the division,

23
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:09,980
the company,
whatever the finances are at hand.

24
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:12,330
Then the next thing is just saying,

25
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:14,460
like how do you calculate how
much money you're spending on it?

26
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:17,150
So you just start off with like well
how many people was dedicated the task?

27
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:18,586
What's the average salary for
those people?

28
00:01:18,586 --> 00:01:20,624
How much time is spent, and
you can figure out there, and

29
00:01:20,624 --> 00:01:22,081
that's like your upper bound, right?

30
00:01:22,081 --> 00:01:23,965
And those people are already
working on the problem, so

31
00:01:23,965 --> 00:01:26,007
you can't just charge that upper
bound right to begin with,

32
00:01:26,007 --> 00:01:28,030
because basically you're saying
those people have a job.

33
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:29,910
And those people are probably going
to have to be your champions.

34
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:31,350
So you have to figure out some way,

35
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:34,260
it's like this somehow
eats a lot of their time.

36
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,420
They want to do other parts of
their job, or what have you,

37
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:38,300
and you figure out some
in between on that.

38
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:41,580
And usually I say like figure
out some kind of smart guess and

39
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:42,780
just start with your first customer.

40
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:45,040
And for enterprise pricing,
you can adjust.

41
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,710
Depending on how fast
they answer the question,

42
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:49,100
you're going to move the price up or
down.

43
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:51,620
The biggest thing is just
start with some kind of model.

44
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:53,290
One of the biggest mistakes,
I think, some companies do,

45
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:57,870
is they start people off on free pilots,
that's like oh, just try it.

46
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:00,660
The program, we won't charge you
anything, we'll try it for 60 or

47
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:02,280
90 days, and
we'll figure out where we go from there.

48
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,300
And I think that's a poor
way of thinking about stuff.

49
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:08,460
Again, you don't set yourself
up to figure out how to one, map

50
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:12,010
out the organization, to figure out what
is it going to take to actually close,

51
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:13,640
you don't beta test your pricing.

52
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,970
As all these questions come near that,

53
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:17,210
you just are kicking
the can down the road, and

54
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:22,220
so what I usually advise is say look, we
don't have free trials in our company.

55
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:24,920
We can provide a service
that is of value.

56
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,335
Here's what I can do for you.

57
00:02:26,335 --> 00:02:30,090
We start off with a the three month
plan, it's going to cost this much money

58
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:32,330
and if you are not satisfied
with the product or

59
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:34,910
service, 100% money back guarantee.

60
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:37,730
But that way you can play the safe.

61
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:40,670
But that way you have gone
through the actual process of

62
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:45,150
navigating enterprise pricing and
payment and accounting, and

63
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:47,900
legal and all that stuff
just to get to that process.

64
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:51,130
And if they're not even interested
in that, then that means that maybe

65
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:53,480
you don't have a product that
people actually want to begin with.

66
00:02:55,250 --> 00:03:00,440
The other one is to think about
incentives in terms of your sales force.

67
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,860
And also in terms of
people's reasons to buy.

68
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:07,470
And the best model I've ever heard
about this actually came from

69
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:10,100
Phil Libin from Evernote, and he
actually talked about a concept that he

70
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:12,900
learned from someone else, and
it was about the pricing thermometer.

71
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:17,630
And the idea is that there's three
numbers associated with, like, pricing.

72
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:20,710
And so you have like the cost
of the product here,

73
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:24,160
you have the price of the product, and
then you have the value of the product.

74
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:27,300
And those are three numbers
associated with a service or product.

75
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:32,000
And it says that gap between the cost
and the price of the product,

76
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,640
that is considered that gap in
distance is incentive to sell, right?

77
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,700
So because it's like oh, for

78
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:44,220
every one of these I sell I make
that much money as a company.

79
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:47,870
The gap between value to price,
that is incentive to buy for

80
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:49,550
the customer, right?

81
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:52,630
And so where you put the price
on the line controls

82
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:55,740
where are the pressures for
buying and selling.

83
00:03:55,740 --> 00:04:00,730
Right, and so, for example,
Evernote, they charge $30 a year,

84
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:03,746
and they've never changed that pricing.

85
00:04:03,746 --> 00:04:06,550
And the idea is like we want all

86
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:10,540
the energy around our software
service to be incentive to buy.

87
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:12,940
Right, because like wow.

88
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:16,290
This product all it sort of
offers has high value to me, so

89
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:17,180
it make me want to buy it.

90
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:20,399
And there's enough people and enough
pressure on there, makes it worth it.

91
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:23,290
And what's amazing about that,
is if you can make that work,

92
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:27,940
it grows by word of mouth and
organically.

93
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:31,800
They don't need a huge sales force to
sell this because the value in itself

94
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,270
automatically makes
the sell sort of happen.

95
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:36,470
Usually a lot of people want to do is,

96
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:41,410
like figure out like how do I get
the price as close to value as possible.

97
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:46,710
And then what you do is you destroy one
of those impulses for sort of people.

98
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:49,940
And also,
the feedback loop that you generate for

99
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:52,230
your salespeople is
usually pretty broken.

100
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:53,390
Right?
because they'll do anything

101
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:55,650
to sort of sell it, and

102
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:58,150
the reason why people want to talk
about is completely different.

103
00:04:58,150 --> 00:04:59,910
It's like yeah,
it's going to be really expensive.

104
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:03,360
You kind of get what you pay for,
but I'm not super excited about it.

105
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,370
And anyone that is willing to increase
that gap in the other direction

106
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:09,630
can undercut you as a result.

107
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:13,250
And they undercut you not because,
oh this is a better price or

108
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:16,700
better value but it's because now
there is two pressures in there

109
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:19,530
to make you want to consume or
upgrade what have you
