00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:04,587
The next property of logarithms has to do with exponents, or powers. When we

2
00:00:04,587 --> 00:00:09,867
have log base b of x to the a, we can really set that equal to a times log base

3
00:00:09,867 --> 00:00:15,570
b of x. In other words, we just take this exponent of a and we bring it down in

4
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:20,885
front of our logarithm as a coefficient. In other words, if I had log of base

5
00:00:20,885 --> 00:00:27,206
10 of a 100 to the 3rd power, we can rewrite this. We can bring this 3rd power

6
00:00:27,206 --> 00:00:32,198
down in front of our logarithm, so we'll have 3 times the logarithm of base 10,

7
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:37,710
of 100. Now I usually put this in parentheses, so I understand that it's 3

8
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:42,018
times this quantity. And let's carry out the map on both sides of the equation

9
00:00:42,018 --> 00:00:46,352
to make sure that this makes sense. On the left hand side we'll have log of

10
00:00:46,352 --> 00:00:51,985
base 10 and then 100 to the 3rd power. Well 100 to the 3rd power is the same

11
00:00:51,985 --> 00:00:58,508
thing as a million. That's 1 followed by 6 zeroes. On the left hand side we'll

12
00:00:58,508 --> 00:01:04,958
have 3 times the log base ten of 100. Log base 10 of 100 is 2. We know this,

13
00:01:04,958 --> 00:01:10,902
since 10 squared equals 100. We're looking for the exponent that we'd raise 10

14
00:01:10,902 --> 00:01:17,316
to, in order to get this number. So, we know 3 times 2 equals 6. And now let's

15
00:01:17,316 --> 00:01:22,080
check the left-hand side. We have log base 10 of a million. But we know a

16
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,615
million is 1 followed by 6 zeros. So, that means we have to raise 10 to the 6th

17
00:01:26,615 --> 00:01:33,600
power in order to get a million. So yes, 6 equals 6. This is just one example

18
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,022
of why this log property holds true. And finally, here's the last logarithm

19
00:01:38,022 --> 00:01:42,470
property we'll examine. If we subtract two logarithms that have the same base,

20
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:48,286
then we can just divide the two numbers. So the log with base b of x minus the

21
00:01:48,286 --> 00:01:57,292
log of base b of y equals the log of base b of x divided by y. For example, the

22
00:01:57,292 --> 00:02:02,779
log of base 3 of 81, minus the log of base 3 of 9 would equal the log of base 3

23
00:02:02,779 --> 00:02:09,336
of 81 divided by 9. We simply just divide these 2 numbers inside of our

24
00:02:09,336 --> 00:02:14,560
argument and take the log of it. And let's also be sure that this checks. We

25
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:20,546
know the log of base 3 of 81 equals 4 since 3 to the 4th equals 81. We also

26
00:02:20,546 --> 00:02:26,612
know the log of base 3 of 9 equals 2, since 3 squared equals 9. And, finally,

27
00:02:26,612 --> 00:02:31,404
on the right-hand side, we'll have the log of base 3 of 81 divided by 9. We

28
00:02:31,404 --> 00:02:39,246
know 81 divided by 9 really equals 9, so we have log of base 3 of 9. Now we can

29
00:02:39,246 --> 00:02:44,729
just subtract here, so we get 2 equal to 2. We know log of base 3 of 9 is

30
00:02:44,729 --> 00:02:50,950
really just 2, as before. Now, using those log properties, I want you to try

31
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:56,578
and write this expression with 1 logarithm. In other words, you should have the

32
00:02:56,578 --> 00:03:01,091
log with base b of 1 number here. Now it's okay if you're not entirely sure

33
00:03:01,091 --> 00:03:05,479
what to do, I just want to try your best. Think back to what it means when you

34
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:09,784
add logs together and when you subtract logs together. Do them one at a time

35
00:03:09,784 --> 00:03:14,975
and I think you might get the answer. And again it's totally okay if you don't

36
00:03:14,975 --> 00:03:18,961
get there. You can always see the solution.
