1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,630
Okay, so we're looking at, the newly added function,

2
00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:07,090
audioRecorderDidFinishRecording, and in here, I want to do two things.

3
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:09,870
The first thing to do, is to save the recorded audio, and

4
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:13,700
the next thing I want to do, is to move to the second scene of the app.

5
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:15,660
AKA perform a segue.

6
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:19,080
Let's begin with step one, which is to save the recorded audio.

7
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,360
Now, I'm looking to save two things about the recorded audio,

8
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:26,170
the title of that file and the path where it is stored on the phone.

9
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:29,660
I'll do that, by creating a new class called RecordedAudio.

10
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:32,430
By the way, in case you're wondering, this new class.

11
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:37,770
Will be the model for our app, and that will form the M of the acronym MVC.

12
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:38,990
Let's create this class next.
