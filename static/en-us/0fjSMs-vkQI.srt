1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The answer is right over here.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
To see take the equidistant line between C1 and C2,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
and you find that all data points are associated with C1 except for this one over here.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
So C2 will go straight to this point over here,

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
and C1 will move straight to the point as indicated over here.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Now this is a stable solution.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
If you do the same again, and wonder about the diagram between these two final points,

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
you will find that no correspondence changes,

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
and the C1 and C2 cluster centers won't move any more.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 99:59:59,999
C2 will be over here, and C1 over here.
