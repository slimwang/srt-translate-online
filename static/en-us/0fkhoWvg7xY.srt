1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,980
Let's multiply two polynomials
together with this process.

2
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:05,390
Start with the coefficient here.

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:08,580
Write the values of
the polynomials here.

4
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:11,800
Multiply them together and

5
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:15,390
I'll do the interpolation,
since that computation is a bit tedious.
