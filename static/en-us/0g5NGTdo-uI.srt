00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:03,360
So as far as the answer to the question's concerned, two and

00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:06,160
nine are completely expressed with the diagram.

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,700
But the others require some varying amounts of work ih, to,

4
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:16,650
to get precisely at what's intended by those requirements. And so to, begin our
