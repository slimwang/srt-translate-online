00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,316
In this lesson, we'll learned how a process is represented by operating systems.

2
00:00:04,316 --> 00:00:07,290
We learned how process is laid out in memory,

3
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:11,310
how operating systems use the process control block structure to

4
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:14,830
maintain information about a process during its lifetime.

5
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:19,240
We looked at some of the key mechanisms that operating systems support to

6
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:23,390
manage processes, like process creation and process scheduling.

7
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:28,350
And then finally, we reviewed some aspects of memory management that

8
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:31,740
are necessary for your understanding of some of the decisions and

9
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,950
overheads that are associated with process management.
