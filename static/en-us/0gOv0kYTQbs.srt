00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:05,760
Just like some of the earlier quizzes and due to the flexibility of both D3,

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:11,270
CSS selectors, and JavaScript, there's many right answers to this quiz.

3
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:15,680
To change the title of the course, all we need to do is figure out

4
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:19,640
what type of class or ID we can select the title with.

5
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:23,050
In this case, I'm going to right-click and Inspect Element.

6
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:27,455
As you can see here, it's in h1 with classes h-slim,

7
00:00:27,455 --> 00:00:32,380
left-hand-nav-title, and another one, ng-binding.

8
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:36,390
I'm going to assume that left-hand-nav-title is fairly unique,

9
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:38,550
if I call it on a header tag.

10
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:41,770
As you can see here, calling d3.select on

11
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:47,380
h1.left-hand-nav-title returns to me another d3 array.

12
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:51,780
And if we open it up, we see the element hovering just to be

13
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:54,240
absolutely sure that we've selected the right element.

14
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,770
Now when I just mentioned, we're looking for a header tag.

15
00:00:56,770 --> 00:01:01,980
There's a distinction between a header tag defined as so and

16
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:06,020
the h1, h2 all the way to h6 tags.

17
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:08,730
You may see and hear people talk about both, so

18
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:12,730
be sure that when someone is talking about a header tag, or an h1,

19
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:18,320
h2, and so forth you know exactly which one they're referring to.

20
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:24,140
To change the intertextual content of this h1 tag again,

21
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:28,160
going to find my selection, store it in a variable, and

22
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:32,760
try to auto complete any method defined in my selection.

23
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:33,900
As you can see here,

24
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:39,470
I'm going to scroll down and hopefully find something that I may think can help.

25
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:43,150
As you can see here, there is an HTML, which might work.

26
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:45,060
There's a property method.

27
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:47,010
Which is also a possibility.

28
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:49,880
And at the bottom here we have text.

29
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:52,090
Let's see what text actually does.

30
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:58,160
Again, if we run this or execute this statement here without parenthesis,

31
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:01,890
we can see the inner definition of the function.

32
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:07,110
As you can see here, this is actually somewhat complicated as d3

33
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:11,720
tries to be as general and applicable to any sort of value passed in.

34
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:15,690
As you can see here, on my title selection, calling text with

35
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:20,820
Jonathan's Pretty Pictures, changes the title to Jonathan's Pretty Pictures.

36
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:25,350
And if I open up what's returned from the .text method, I can see the DOM

37
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:30,770
node I called it on and hovering hovers over the correct title in the window.
