1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:03,660
The histogram from your quiz should look like this.

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:07,390
The range for both the histograms would be somewhere between zero and one.

3
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:13,040
The variable x here is shown in green, and the variable y for

4
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,800
California is shown in red.

5
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:20,480
Notice the two variables have somewhat different shapes in different regions.

6
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:25,703
You will also notice that we have 200 bins between zero and

7
00:00:25,703 --> 00:00:29,800
one with very jaggedy points for each bin.

8
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:34,970
In the next video we are going to learn about kernel density estimates.

9
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:37,680
You will see how using kernel densities.

10
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,750
We can smooth out this histogram into a probability density function.
