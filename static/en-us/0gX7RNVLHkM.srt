1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:03,460
Ready to validate some numeric inputs?

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:08,370
Well, here's a gradebook that
calculates, well, grades.

3
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:12,670
The way this gradebook works is that
you just enter four grades here and

4
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:13,990
then hit Calculate.

5
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:15,800
And you see the average
show up right here.

6
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:21,010
Each of these grades should be a
multiple of 10, which means they should

7
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:25,640
be either 0, 10, 20, 30, and so
on all the way up to a maximum of 100.

8
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:30,110
There are a few issues with these
inputs that I want you to fix.

9
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:33,440
As it is right now,
these inputs only take numbers, but

10
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,950
the controls here on the side
are less than useful.

11
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:39,340
For instance, you can click and
hold on this one and

12
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:43,210
it will go up well above 100 and
really, all the way up to infinity.

13
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:45,768
And it needs to stop at 100.

14
00:00:45,768 --> 00:00:48,630
For this input you can actually
go down into negative numbers,

15
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:50,790
and there's no such thing
as a negative grade.

16
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:57,150
In this one we'll go up by 1s,
which is fine, but we're expecting that

17
00:00:57,150 --> 00:01:01,900
all grades are multiples of 10, so
there's no reason to go up by only 1.

18
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:06,320
Now just so
you know with HTML attributes alone,

19
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,150
you won't be able to prevent people
from typing crazy numbers like this one.

20
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:13,520
But you can make these
controls more useful.

21
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,670
So for this quiz,
it's your job to make them more useful.

22
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:21,950
To do so apply the numeric validation
attributes that you just learned about.

23
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:24,340
You can see what each input
is missing right here.

24
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:29,460
And for bonus points,
which don't actually exist [LAUGH],

25
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:32,760
take a look at this text input for
a letter grade.

26
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:36,440
Try using the pattern attribute
with regular expressions

27
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,860
to validate possible letter grades.

28
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:42,630
I'm thinking you could use American
letter grades which go from A, B, C,

29
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:46,990
D and then skips E and then goes to F,
with subgrades of plus and minus.

30
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:50,080
But feel free to validate for
whatever grading system you're used to.

31
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:55,070
And lastly, it's worth noting that
these numeric inputs look and

32
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:58,000
behave slightly differently
in different browsers.

33
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,010
So test in different browsers
to see the differences.

34
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:03,790
As always, check the instructor
notes for more information.

35
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:04,290
Have fun.
