1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,630
As we discussed, the fact that the queries

2
00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:05,830
are sent over a connectionless channel and that there

3
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:09,970
is no way to authenticate the query responses, makes

4
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:13,550
the DNS vulnerable to various kinds of spoofing and

5
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:16,140
cache poisoning attacks. The fact that DNS names

6
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:18,680
are human readable does not make the DNS inherently

7
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:22,060
insecure. Nor does the fact that it's distributed. There

8
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:25,510
are certainly very well understood ways of securing distributed

9
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:29,620
systems and that does not inherently make DNS insecure.
