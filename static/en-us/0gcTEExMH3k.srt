00:00:00,156 --> 00:00:03,645
Here’s another quiz. You’re dropping a package

2
00:00:03,645 --> 00:00:06,931
out of an aircraft, and the package goes down

3
00:00:06,931 --> 00:00:10,329
and we happen to know it takes between 3 and

4
00:00:10,329 --> 00:00:13,808
3.5 minutes to reach the ground. And, let’s say,

5
00:00:13,808 --> 00:00:16,575
in between the probability density is uniform.

6
00:00:16,575 --> 00:00:19,527
Asking the same question again. There’s something

7
00:00:19,527 --> 00:00:24,708
to be learnt here. Here is 3. Here is 3.5. Obviously,

8
00:00:24,708 --> 00:00:28,592
the density outside is zero, is uniform, and there’s

9
00:00:28,592 --> 00:00:32,592
a value here A. And, I want you to tell me what is A.
