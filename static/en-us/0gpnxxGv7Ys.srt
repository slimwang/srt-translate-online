00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:04,070
Before I introduce the fundamental law,
I've got to define a few terms.

2
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:08,200
Let's start with information ratio.

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:12,940
So recall, the return on our portfolio
for a particular day is equal to

4
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:18,910
the market component of the return,
which is beta for that portfolio,

5
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:24,290
times the return on the market for
that day, plus this residual return.

6
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:28,150
Another way to look at that is to say
that this component of the return

7
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:33,360
is due to the market, and this component
is due to the skill of the fund manager.

8
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,920
Remember, alpha is about skill.

9
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,990
Now, we want to focus
on the skill component.

10
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:43,510
In other words, what is the fund
manager bringing to the table?

11
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:48,060
And we can calculate the Sharpe ratio,
essentially, of this component,

12
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:51,840
just like we can calculate the Sharpe
ratio of an entire portfolio.

13
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,960
But we can focus on this skill
component, and essentially the Sharpe

14
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:00,340
ratio of this skill component
is the information ratio.

15
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:01,970
It works like this.

16
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:07,510
So the information ratio is
the mean of all of the alpha

17
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:13,160
components divided by the standard
deviation of the alpha components.

18
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,820
So this is our reward component.

19
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:17,840
That's our risk component.

20
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,220
And by the way, this is calculated
by looking back historically

21
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:24,220
at the daily values of alpha.

22
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:27,800
And we take the mean and the standard
deviation of them over time.

23
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:31,540
You can find these by finding beta for

24
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:36,730
the portfolio, calculating what
the market return component was for

25
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:41,550
each day, and then the difference
is this residual or skill.

26
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:44,290
So that's how you can
compute historically

27
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:46,450
the value of this information ratio.

28
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:51,600
Now by the way, this information ration
applies in many different cases,

29
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,140
not just in this fundamental law case.

30
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:57,790
People use information
ratio as a measure

31
00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:00,830
of manager performance all the time.

32
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:05,400
It's fair to say that information
ratio is essentially a Sharpe ratio

33
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,580
of excess return,
this part that's due to skill.
