00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Okay, here's my solution. I hope you used the new % thing we learned.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Let's run it a few times.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I'm going to substitute the string 'running',

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
and we get, I think running is a perfectly normal thing to do in public.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Okay, great! That seems to work.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Let's move on to something a little bit more complicated.
