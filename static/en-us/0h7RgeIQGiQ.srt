1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:03,000
Free as in beer refers to money.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,110
If someone buys you a beer,
it costs you nothing.

3
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:09,350
Many versions of Linux are,
in fact, free for you to use.

4
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:12,060
But just because you get to use it for
free, doesn't mean you get to see

5
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:15,890
the underlying source code or
modify it for your own purposes.

6
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:20,190
Free as in speech refers to your
rights or liberties with the software.

7
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:23,270
You're free to run the software how
you like, see how the software works,

8
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:27,690
redistribute the software, and
improve upon or modify the software.

9
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:32,509
This latter definition, free as in
speech, is how Linux became so popular.

10
00:00:32,509 --> 00:00:36,490
There are literally hundreds of versions
or distributions of Linux available.

11
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:38,710
And it's because of this
latter definition of freedom,

12
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:40,750
that this became possible.

13
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:43,310
So with all these different
versions of Linux available,

14
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:44,290
how do you pick the right one?
