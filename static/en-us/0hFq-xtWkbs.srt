Here's a new quiz. The Great Grammar Fix-Up.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
It's a puzzle in which I've written a partial context-free grammar on the left with five holes,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and over here on the right, I have five strings that I want to be in the language of the grammar.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
What I'd like you to do is fill in each hole with the single word

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:23,000
like s, a, b, c, d lower case letter, that sort of thing, so that this grammar accepts these five strings.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Now, the real challenge here is this partial structure that I've provided.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
If I covered this up and said you could write anything you want, it'd be pretty easy,

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
but instead, you have to use this context that I've already given you and that's the challenge.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 99:59:59,999
The hint is that the naming is sometimes handy, but sometimes, it leads you astray. Be careful.
