00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:04,860
So right now our ShareText button
just shows a toast when we click it.

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:09,929
Lets fix that, we need to create
a couple of string variables.

3
00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:14,870
One each for the data's media type,
the chooser dialogue title, and

4
00:00:14,869 --> 00:00:16,689
the text we're sending.

5
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:20,970
IntentBuilder from ShareCompat
allows us to chain together

6
00:00:20,969 --> 00:00:24,349
a bunch of statements to
make our code more readable.

7
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:28,859
>From all the variables listed above I
can construct my chooser with the title

00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:30,550
Learning How to Share.

9
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:35,990
Specify what the type of data to share
will be, in this case plain text,

10
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:39,390
and indicate the text that will be
shared when I pick a destination.
