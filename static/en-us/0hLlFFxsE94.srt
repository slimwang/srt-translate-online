00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
This modification just replaces p by 1-p in the return function and when I run it I get 0.7.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
So the nice thing about our complimentary probability we can now plug in

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
a different value over here, say 0.1--with 0.1, I get as an output 0.9.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,000
So congratulations, you've implemented the very first example of probability where the event

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
probability is 0.1 and the complementary event and negation of it

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,838
is encapsulated in this function over here.
