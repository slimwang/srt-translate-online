Let's quadruple check that you fully understand the connection between Grant's

00:00:04,769 --> 00:00:09,079
situation that we're talking about, the graph that we've drawn, and the

00:00:09,079 --> 00:00:13,373
equations that we're going to use. If we want to know how many gallons of

00:00:13,373 --> 00:00:17,981
cleaning fluid Grant can get for $850, what should we look for? The value of y

5
00:00:17,981 --> 00:00:23,926
when x equals 850? The value of x when y equals 850? The slope when x equals

6
00:00:23,926 --> 00:00:31,805
850? Or points of intersection between y equals 850 and other lines?
