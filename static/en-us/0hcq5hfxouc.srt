1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Many of the differences between JavaScript and Python

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
are similar to the differences between American English and British English.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Sometimes the spelling changes a bit, or the pronunciation changes a bit,

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
but in general, they are mutually intelligible.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
It should look very similar, but with 1 or 2 extra letters.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
JavaScript is big on curly braces.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Python is big on tabbing.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
JavaScript is big on semi-colons.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Python not so much.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
JavaScript really loves parentheses.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Python could take them or leave them.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Python could have these, could have these, but doesn't have to.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
They're somewhat optional.

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
And in some sense, preferring one over the other is a bit like preferring

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Brutus to Caesar.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I've heard that Brutus is an honorable man, or at least so Mark Antony told me.

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
They're both entirely reasonable from our perspective.

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Is this a dagger I see before me?

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I guess this one must be Brutus, and this one must be Caesar,

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
and you know which one is which because of these convenient labels.

21
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Here I've written a new JavaScript function

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
called "ironcrutchli."

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
This one is not recursive, but it takes a formal argument x

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
and then does some reasoning based on x and returns values as a result.

25
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I want to make sure that you're following along with JavaScript,

26
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
so I'm going to have you tell me what this function evaluates to

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
based on a few different inputs.

28
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
In this fill-in-the-blank quiz, for each one of these inputs,

29
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
imagine we're calling ironcrutchli on 0,

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
so this 0 is bound to the value of x.

31
00:01:38,000 --> 99:59:59,999
What would the output be, similarly for 1, 2, and 9?
