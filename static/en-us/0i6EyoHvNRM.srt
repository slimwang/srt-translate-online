1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:04,631
It's now time to put together everything
you've learned thus far into a single

2
00:00:04,631 --> 00:00:06,810
Mashup web application.

3
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:09,130
Let's leave the puppy application
aside for a moment and

4
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:10,780
go back to the restaurant
menu application.

5
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:14,790
In this exercise you will
first have an endpoint

6
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:16,659
that takes in a city name and meal type.

7
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:19,490
Geo codes the location,

8
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:23,830
finds a nearby restaurant with that
meal type, stores it in a database, and

9
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:27,250
then returns a JSON object of
that restaurant to the user.

10
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:29,860
And this should happen
on a post request.

11
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:33,810
On this same route, handle a get request
that returns all of the restaurants in

12
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:38,310
your database, along with their name,
ID number, Address and

13
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:40,730
Image inside of a JSON object.

14
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:43,740
Then you will make another end
point that takes in a restaurant's

15
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:45,270
ID in the route.

16
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:49,690
A get request to this route should
return the name, ID number, address, and

17
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:51,250
image of a specific restaurant.

18
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:56,980
An update along with any or
all of the name, location and

19
00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:01,410
image parameters should update this
restaurant information in your database.

20
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:05,269
And a delete to this route will remove
this restaurant from your database.

21
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:06,500
In the instructor notes,

22
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,480
you will find a collection of Python
templates to help you get started.

23
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:14,000
FindARestaurant.py has the API
methods created in lesson two.

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,390
Be sure to update this file with
your client ID and client secret.

25
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:23,870
Inside views.py you will add all of the
routing and Python code, /restaurants

26
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:27,510
to view all the restaurant in your
database and post a new restaurant.

27
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:32,010
And /restaurant/id to get the specific
information about a restaurant,

28
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:36,200
update its name, address, or image or
delete it from the database.

29
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,290
When you are finished,
use the tester.py file

30
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:41,750
to test the functionality of
your web app's API endpoints.
