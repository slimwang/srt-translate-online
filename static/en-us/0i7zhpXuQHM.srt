00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,250
Let's imagine that your
product looks amazing.

2
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:04,650
Everything's working smoothly,

3
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:09,060
the colors are awesome, but
the revenue stream is low.

4
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:11,020
What could be the problem?

5
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:14,030
>> There could be a number of roadblocks
that prevent users from spending

6
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:15,590
money in your app.

7
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:19,520
A roadblock could be a design issue
that discourage users, for example,

8
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:25,420
a complex registration form, or
a user exceptions on particular devices.

9
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:29,040
You can use the reports we've talked
about in the previous lessons

10
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:33,190
to help you identify the road block, and
more effectively monetize your users.

11
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:36,490
Let's take a look at a few examples
that will help us investigate and

12
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:37,660
find the reasons.
