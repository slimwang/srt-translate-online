00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:06,850
We'll start off by introducing
mission and vision statements, and

3
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:08,985
then you'll get a chance
to write your own.

4
00:00:08,985 --> 00:00:10,310
This will give you the baseline for

making decisions about short term
goals you'll be setting later.
