00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:04,178
Here's all the data. This time, I'm going to provide the means and standard

2
00:00:04,178 --> 00:00:07,952
deviations. But go ahead and calculate these if you feel like you need

3
00:00:07,952 --> 00:00:13,196
additional practice. Again, we'll do a two-tailed test to see if the effects of

4
00:00:13,196 --> 00:00:17,750
these two drugs are significantly different. That means, that the null

5
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:21,170
hypothesis, is that the population of those who use drug A will not be

6
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:27,330
significantly different from the population that you use B. And the alternative

7
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:31,904
hypothesis is that they will be significantly different. First, calculate the

8
00:00:31,904 --> 00:00:32,870
t-statistic.
