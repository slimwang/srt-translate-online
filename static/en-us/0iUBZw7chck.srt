1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The answer is this would be an attacker who has limited computational power

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
but does have active capabilities.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Since they control the network, they can modify messages going through that router,

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
they could replay messages, they could act as a middle attacker.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
They have lots of things they can do other than just intercept

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
and try to analyze intercepted messages.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
For most of what we're going to do, we're going to assume this threat model.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
We're going to assume an attacker who does have limited computational power.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
That means we'll assume that encryption and hash functions

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
work the way they're supposed to.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Certainly that's not always true.

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
They could have weaknesses that an attacker could exploit.

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
But when we design protocols, we usually don't need to pick a particular encryption algorithm.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
We're going to assume that we have one

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
that either is a symmetric or an asymmetric encryption function

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
that has the properties it should have.

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
And we're going to assume the attacker is active--

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
that they can intercept messages, they can try to analyze what they hear,

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
but they can also modify messages and replay messages

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
and do anything they could do to disrupt the protocol by changing things on the network.

21
00:01:00,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So that's the main threat model that our protocols are designed to resist.
