1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:06,184
The goal of encryption is to transform
a plaintext into an intelligible form.

2
00:00:06,184 --> 00:00:10,487
That is, given that the attacker
can obtain the ciphertext,

3
00:00:10,487 --> 00:00:15,220
we don't want the attacker to be
able to learn about the plaintext.

4
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:19,280
In order to accomplish this,
we apply two principles.

5
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:21,700
The first is called confusion,

6
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:27,000
it is a way to obscure the relationship
between a key and a ciphertext.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,820
That is, although the attacker
can obtain the ciphertext,

8
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:34,660
the attacker will not be
able to find out the key.

9
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:38,230
This is typically achieved
with substitution.

10
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:41,756
For example, in the generalized
substitution ciphers that we

11
00:00:41,756 --> 00:00:46,210
have discussed, each letter can
be mapped to any other letter.

12
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:50,884
Confusion or
substitution alone is not sufficient.

13
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:56,579
For example, even when a letter can be
mapped to any other letter, the attacker

14
00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:01,694
can use statistical analysis of data
frequencies to break the scheme.

15
00:01:01,694 --> 00:01:05,300
Therefore, the second
principle is diffusion.

16
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:10,157
This means that the influence of one
plaintext bit is spread over many

17
00:01:10,157 --> 00:01:11,831
bits in a ciphertext and

18
00:01:11,831 --> 00:01:16,454
the goal is to hide the statistical
properties of the plaintext.

19
00:01:16,454 --> 00:01:21,354
For example, in stead of mapping
an English letter to another

20
00:01:21,354 --> 00:01:26,644
English letter, we can map a letter
to parts of many a bit letters.

21
00:01:26,644 --> 00:01:31,431
And if you do that, then the frequency
distribution of English letters will not

22
00:01:31,431 --> 00:01:34,120
be very useful in cryptanalysis.

23
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:37,420
We can achieve diffusion
with permutations.

24
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:42,261
Further, we need this combination to
effect every bit of the ciphertext.

25
00:01:42,261 --> 00:01:47,055
Therefore, typically,
a block cipher has multiple rounds

26
00:01:47,055 --> 00:01:51,764
where each round combines
substitution and permutation.

27
00:01:51,764 --> 00:01:56,751
That is, the first round affects some
parts of the ciphertext and the next

28
00:01:56,751 --> 00:02:02,020
round further propagates these effects
into other parts of the ciphertext.

29
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:05,340
Eventually, all bits of
ciphertext are affected.
