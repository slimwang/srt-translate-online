00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,500
Well the first problem is that this feature only

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:05,970
works in mobile, not in desktop. On desktop, you only

3
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:09,780
get the normal file open dialogue. Not access to

4
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:15,200
the webcam. Secondly, the interface is a file open button,

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,910
which is hard to style and make look the

6
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:20,390
way you might want it to. And finally, taking you

7
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:22,450
to a different application to take a picture or

8
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:25,470
record some audio, makes it kind of hard to keep

9
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:27,380
a consistent flow in your application.
