1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,199
And my question to you is, so this 1 + K over n-2k may look a bit strange,

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:08,932
but is this here actually a useful approximation factor? And I'm going to give you four choices here.

3
00:00:08,933 --> 00:00:12,499
So it might be that, because this is a very general question about general graphs,

4
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:18,966
and this also looks a bit complicated, that it's not possible to say at this moment if this is a useful approximation factor.

5
00:00:18,967 --> 00:00:24,966
It might also be that this is a useful approximation factor, but only if the independent set

6
00:00:24,967 --> 00:00:29,432
of the graph that we're given is very large. So it's a majority of the vertices.

7
00:00:29,433 --> 00:00:36,966
Or could it be that it is a useful approximation algorithm if N is very large, because N is in the denominator down here.

8
00:00:36,967 --> 00:00:42,866
Or is it just simply not a useful approximation factor? So please select the one here that you think is correct,

9
00:00:42,867 --> 00:00:44,267
and then let's discuss.
