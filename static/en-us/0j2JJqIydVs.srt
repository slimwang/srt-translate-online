00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,666
We replace x with negative 4 and y with positive 3. 2 times negative 4 is

2
00:00:04,666 --> 00:00:09,658
negative 8 and 5 times 3 is 15. Adding these two numbers together, we get 7 is

3
00:00:09,658 --> 00:00:14,488
equal to 7. This is true. For the second equation, we replace x and y, and we

4
00:00:14,488 --> 00:00:19,521
get negative 4 equal to negative 4. This is also true. Great, another way that

5
00:00:19,521 --> 00:00:22,794
we can check to make sure we have the right answer.
