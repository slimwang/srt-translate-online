00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Good job if you got that. Here is my implementation.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
We just iterate over the list of links for l in links,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
and if ID = 15, I return the number of votes.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Not too complicated.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Now, what if I were to ask something a little bit more complicated?
