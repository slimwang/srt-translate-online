00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,380
Couple of implementation issues.

2
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:03,990
In general, warping is not,

3
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:08,390
warping is one of those things that
in principle should be really easy.

4
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:12,790
In practice you always make mistakes,
I will say that MATLAB does a very fine

5
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:15,370
job of, of allowing you to do
warping in particular ways so

6
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:17,340
if you are using MATLAB or
Octave it's easy.

7
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:22,820
And I think within python nonpie
openCV accomplishes as well.

8
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:24,700
The other thing,
in order to make this work and

9
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:28,365
actually we'll get to this when
we do the whole multi-scale.

10
00:00:28,365 --> 00:00:31,560
Is its often useful to sort of
take a nice bit of a low-pass

11
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:32,680
filter of your images.

12
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,880
Smooth things out,
why do you want to do that?

13
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,250
To get sort of your smoother
derivatives as, as things work.

14
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:40,590
And we'll talk more
about that next time.
