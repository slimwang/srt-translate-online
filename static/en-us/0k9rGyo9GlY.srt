1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,100
So, a couple of tips. Number 1: The Business Model Canvas

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:07,420
is a scorecard; it's not the class.

3
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:10,050
The lectures are not the class.

4
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:14,620
We're not asking you, as facilitators or mentors, to lecture in the class

5
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:18,790
but to do short summaries just to make sure everybody's up to speed

6
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:21,720
and ask probing questions to spur conversation.

7
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:27,680
But the class itself is about critiques about each team's findings,

8
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,390
from their original hypotheses to what did they actually learn.

9
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:35,010
One of the things we do to make the teams feel great

10
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:39,080
is when someone actually gets physically thrown out of a customer,

11
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:42,290
just remind students that some of the most aggressive teams

12
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:45,910
seem to be actually spending their time trying to get customer data

13
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:51,190
sometimes have been known to get thrown out of buildings because they've been so aggressive

14
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:54,370
or threatened with arrest because they shouldn't be where they are.

15
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:58,240
We're not asking you to break any laws or do anything illegal.

16
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:03,160
But you know you're pushing hard when somebody physically grabs you by the arm

17
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:05,160
and escorts you out of a place.

18
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:09,000
Then you get in--then you get to show up at the class, tell us that story,

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,440
and the teaching team needs to stand up and applaud that activity.

20
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,770
That just means there was an aggressive team.

21
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:18,520
And just remind them that we do not provide bail

22
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:21,160
or political asylum, depending on your country.

23
00:01:21,160 --> 99:59:59,999
But being passive is not the way to actually proceed with this class.
