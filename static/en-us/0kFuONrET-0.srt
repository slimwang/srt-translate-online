1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,980
This notion of maximum
variance should strike

2
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:06,960
a little bit of recognition in your mind
about then notion of fitting a line.

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,210
You remember we did line fitting?

4
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:09,800
Okay.

5
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:12,850
In fact we came up with
this equation of saying

6
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:17,960
we're going to measure the error that's
essentially just the perpendicular error

7
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,450
of the points to this line.

8
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:22,040
And the, and the equation of
the line that we had there was

9
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:24,750
a x plus b y minus d equals 0.

10
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:27,130
Or it could be plus d, doesn't matter.

11
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:32,770
The idea is that a and b was
the normal with respect to the line and

12
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:34,710
in fact that's what
that says right there.

13
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:37,060
And if I take the dot product of x and
y on that,

14
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:41,270
it's supposed to be a distance d away
and that's what this equation says.

15
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:46,090
Alright, so that was when we were
trying to do a least squares fit.

16
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:47,880
So then we, we did this quick operation.

17
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:53,080
We took the derivative with respect to
the d, came up with this formula for

18
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:57,000
d in terms of the average x,
the average y.

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,590
We plug that in,
substitute d equals a x bar b y bar.

20
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:04,400
We get this new error function E.

21
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,360
Just having substituted.

22
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,840
And we wrote it, this way.

23
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,000
Okay?

24
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,680
And this is where b is this matrix here.

25
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:18,680
And you can see it's just the x's and
y's in a row with the means subtracted.

26
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,390
Okay?

27
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:21,890
So what we want to do is we
want to minimize that quantity,

28
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:23,780
the magnitude of B times n,

29
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:27,260
where n's going to be the normal AB
that we're going to solve for, and

30
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:32,460
we said last time that what we want to
do is we want to minimize Bn squared,

31
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:38,300
but remember, since the normal has to be
unit normal we say subject to n equal 1.

32
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:42,530
Now, what might be not so obvious
because we didn't mention exactly last

33
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:48,140
time is that this distance,
these square distances, this

34
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:51,752
is going to be the axis of least, let's
call this the axis of least inertia.

35
00:01:51,752 --> 00:01:54,000
Right?
[INAUDIBLE] From your physics.

36
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,960
If I've got an axis, then the inertia of
the whole thing is proportional of all

37
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:01,990
the points, the square distance from
those, of those points to the axis.

38
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:05,360
So the line fitting here in 2D
is an axis of least inertia.

39
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,570
And like I said,
this should sound familiar to you.

40
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:09,880
And we, remember we did this.

41
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,740
We, we looked at several
ways of doing this.

42
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:15,860
We had those in fact back when we
did calibration, we said well.

43
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:21,370
We have this A, M, because we're
doing M matrix for the calibration.

44
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:23,490
We said make,
let the norm of that, well,

45
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:26,610
we want to make it as small as
possible subject to M equal to one.

46
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:29,970
And remember we were doing this thing
with eigenvalues and eigenvectors, so

47
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:33,381
it shouldn't surprise you that we're
going to be revisiting eigenvalues and

48
00:02:33,381 --> 00:02:34,120
eigenvectors.
