1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:03,660
All right, I'll go ahead and
start with the first one.

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:08,109
It looks good, but it doesn't have
the slash inside the closing tag, so

3
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:10,200
that one is incorrect.

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:17,170
Next up, there is em element
nested inside a p element.

5
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:23,430
Now you haven't seen em before, stands for
emphasis, which just makes text italic.

6
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:26,585
As it turns out there's actually nothing
wrong with this except for the typo.

7
00:00:26,585 --> 00:00:31,390
However, typos don't count as
incorrectly formatted HTML, so

8
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:33,120
this one's actually good.

9
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:39,170
Then comes the third one, now notice
that it's all green and looks weird.

10
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:43,330
This is a very good indication
that this one is wrong.

11
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:47,750
I didn't include the greater than
sign here inside the opening tag,

12
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:50,320
which made this whole thing a mess.

13
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,070
Now one of the nice things about
code editors is that they will

14
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:57,830
change the formatting depending on
whether or not the syntax is right.

15
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:02,520
So because the syntax here is wrong,
this is not valid HTML,

16
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,860
this all looks weird in green and

17
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:09,410
it should be pretty obvious that
something needs to get fixed.

18
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:12,280
The last one looks really
similar to the second.

19
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,020
But there's a key difference.

20
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:16,690
I switched the closing tags here.

21
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:22,070
Now notice that the tag is being
closed outside of the p tag and

22
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:25,980
the p tag's being closed inside the em tag.

23
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:29,410
That is wrong, this is a mess.

24
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:34,180
The em element is the child of the p
element, and as such, you have to

25
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:38,740
open it and then close it inside the p,
like what's done right here.
