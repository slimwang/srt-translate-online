1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:02,290
It's gotta be the aggregated strategy.

2
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:03,990
Everything's-
>> Well certainly the knowledge is in

3
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:09,100
one place there, but with the mediated,

4
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:12,700
the knowledge of a particular
constraint is in one place as well.

5
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:16,810
>> Right, but they don't have to
have knowledge about each other, so

6
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:18,910
it's not central in that sense.

7
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:21,670
>> Right, so the set of invariance is

8
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:24,030
distributed into separate mediators,
okay?

9
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:27,210
But for any given invariant,
it's centralized in one mediator.

10
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:27,710
>> In one mediator.

11
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:28,210
>> Okay.
