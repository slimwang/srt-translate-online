00:00:00,003 --> 00:00:04,580
Negative 2 and 5 are correct. This equation doesn't need to be rearranged. We

2
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:09,274
just want to find factors of negative 10 at sum to negative 3. Negative 5 and 2

3
00:00:09,274 --> 00:00:14,014
are the factor pair we need. We write our factors, set each one equal to zero

4
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:19,025
and solve for m. So, m could equal 5 or m could equal negative 2. And remember,

5
00:00:19,025 --> 00:00:23,636
we can always check our answers. We can plug each answer into the original

6
00:00:23,636 --> 00:00:29,240
equation to check. I get true statements in the end, so yes, 5 and negative 2

7
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,333
are correct.
