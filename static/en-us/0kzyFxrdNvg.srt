1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,122
So we have 2 approaches here--thread per row and thread per element. Which is better?

2
00:00:05,122 --> 00:00:11,129
So we might have different performance on matrices that have a similar number of elements per row,

3
00:00:11,129 --> 00:00:14,921
and we might have differing performance if we have a varying

4
00:00:14,921 --> 00:00:17,795
or even a wildly varying number of elements per row.

5
00:00:17,795 --> 00:00:23,066
So which of these is comparatively better on each of these kinds of matrices?

6
00:00:23,066 --> 00:00:25,238
So I'd like you to put a couple checkboxes in.
