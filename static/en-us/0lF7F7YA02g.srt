1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So let's take a look at the value proposition in a little more detail

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
and expand on those three components.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The first one is your product, and as we said earlier,

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
"You need to understand which are part of your value proposition."

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Is it just hardware or software or books or are there really some manufacturing goods,

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
some commodities, are you going to have intangible products that are part,

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
copyrights and licenses that are part of your value proposition

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
or are your going to have any financial products that is guarantees or insurance policies

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
or maintenance contract or you're going to add some digital features to it as well.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 99:59:59,999
What we point here is that you realize that your product and service is not just the bits or hardware,
