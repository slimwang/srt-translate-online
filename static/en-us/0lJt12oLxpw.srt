1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:02,870
All right.
Now on to the best part.

2
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:05,539
We're going to make the app
look really good now.

3
00:00:05,539 --> 00:00:09,668
In every developer's workflow it's
important to set aside time for

4
00:00:09,668 --> 00:00:13,171
some visual polish before
launching the app to your user.

5
00:00:13,171 --> 00:00:16,975
So often, when you're building
a feature, you're less worried about how

6
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:20,854
everything looks and you just care that
it actually functions as you expect.

7
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:25,028
So in the visual polish stage,
you have time to take extra care on how

8
00:00:25,028 --> 00:00:29,659
everything looks making sure things
line up and are consistent for users.

9
00:00:29,659 --> 00:00:32,412
So now it's time to show great care for
your app.

10
00:00:32,412 --> 00:00:37,299
So our designer gave us these red lines
which have specific details for color,

11
00:00:37,299 --> 00:00:38,938
font size, and spacing.

12
00:00:38,938 --> 00:00:43,162
And these red lines are how the designer
communicates to us precisely how our app

13
00:00:43,162 --> 00:00:45,270
should look visually.

14
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:47,230
So for every detail that they provide,

15
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:49,870
be sure to implement
that into your app code.

16
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:54,420
So if the red lines say 16 DP spacing
from the left, then go ahead and

17
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,806
modify your layout to have
that 16 DP of spacing.

18
00:00:57,806 --> 00:01:01,538
The font color and
font size may also need to change.

19
00:01:01,538 --> 00:01:04,343
So note that each category of
words should have a different

20
00:01:04,343 --> 00:01:05,325
background color.

21
00:01:05,325 --> 00:01:11,191
So orange for numbers, green for family,
purple for colors, and blue for phrases.

22
00:01:11,191 --> 00:01:15,139
So it's going to take us multiple
quizzes to finish implementing all those

23
00:01:15,139 --> 00:01:15,793
red lines.

24
00:01:15,793 --> 00:01:20,282
So in this quiz assume that orange
is fine as the background color for

25
00:01:20,282 --> 00:01:21,716
all the activities.

26
00:01:21,716 --> 00:01:22,993
We'll correct it so

27
00:01:22,993 --> 00:01:27,058
that each activity has a corresponding
correct color later on.

28
00:01:27,058 --> 00:01:31,739
So in a way, orange is our placeholder
color until we can hook up the correct

29
00:01:31,739 --> 00:01:32,867
logic in our app.

30
00:01:32,867 --> 00:01:37,290
So to help you out, you may want to
check out a feature on Android devices

31
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:40,930
specifically for
developers called show layout bounds.

32
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:43,472
And you can turn it on under settings,

33
00:01:43,472 --> 00:01:47,855
developer options, and
then scroll down to show layout bounds.

34
00:01:47,855 --> 00:01:52,243
When you turn the switch,
you'll see all the bounds on the screen.

35
00:01:52,243 --> 00:01:56,770
So if we go back to Miwok app,
we can see where all the views are.

36
00:01:56,770 --> 00:02:00,702
So turning on this feature temporarily
may help you figure out how to fix your

37
00:02:00,702 --> 00:02:02,801
layouts, but note it's not required.

38
00:02:02,801 --> 00:02:06,617
All right, so
have fun implementing those red lines.

39
00:02:06,617 --> 00:02:10,002
We've included some hints below
the quiz if you need some help.

40
00:02:10,002 --> 00:02:12,670
And go ahead and
check this box once you're done.
