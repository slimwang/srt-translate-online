00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Here is my solution to the blanks problem.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
What I've decided is I'm going to represent blank tiles by the lowercase letter

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
as long as I can--keep it in there up to the moment when I place them on the board.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Here is the list of points that we had before, the points dictionary originally

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
had a value of 0 for the underscore character.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I've taken that out, because I'm not going to use the underscore character.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'm going to immediately translate the underscores into a lowercase letter.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I have to figure out what are my lowercase letters?

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I get them by lowercasing the letters I already had,

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
and then I went through the lowercase letters and I said the point value

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
of a lowercase letter of a blank used as that lowercase letter is zero,

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
updating the points dictionary.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Now, my plays are going to be words that include lowercase letters in them.

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
The best play might be something like this

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
where we have the score, the location, the direction, and the word includes a lowercase letter.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Because I've taken that approach and because I've defined the value of a to be zero,

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
it turns out I don't have to change calculate_score at all.

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I can leave that alone.

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
The only things I need to change are find_prefixes and add_suffixes.

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Let's look at find_prefixes.

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
A lot of it is the same, but there are two places where I make a change.

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
First, here before I was checking to see if the input pre was a member of WORDS

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
or a member of PREFIXES.

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Here I created the new variable capital PRE and ask is that in the WORDS,

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
because the thing I'm going to be passed in could look something like that.

26
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
It could have a lowercase a in it, and that's not going to be in my dictionary of words.

27
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
So I have to uppercase it before I can test.

28
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Like before, I test to see if I'm in the words.

29
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Then if I have a good prefix, then I go through my letters in the hand.

30
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Here's the second change.

31
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
If the letter is a blank, then I go through all the possible lowercase letters,

32
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:03,000
and try to find a prefix by replacing the letter, taking out the blank from the hand,

33
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
and adding on the letter C onto the prefix.

34
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Otherwise, I just do what I did before.

35
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
If it's not a blank, I remove the letter L and add it onto the prefix.

36
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
That's find_prefix--very simple change.

37
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Now for add_suffixes.

38
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Again, two very similar changes just like we saw before.

39
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
When we're looking up in the dictionary we have to look up an uppercase version

40
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
of the prefix rather than the original prefix.

41
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
While we're going through the hand, first we have to say is the letter one of the possibilities,

42
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
one of the allowable results for the anchor.

43
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
If that's the case, then go ahead and just use it.

44
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Otherwise, if we have a blank anywhere in the hand,

45
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
then it's possible to use that at this point.

46
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
We consider all the possible letters that might occur in this point.

47
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Before we iterated over the letters in the alphabet,

48
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
but here we're iterating over the possible acceptable letters

49
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,000
that the blank could stand for, and for each of them take away the blank,

50
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
add on the prefix, but make it be lowercase to indicate that this

51
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
is going to be represented by a blank.

52
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Let me just reformat that, because it's going off the page.
