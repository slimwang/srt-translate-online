1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,760
Now you get a chance to practice
doing your reductions on your own.

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:06,700
I have been using a python-like
syntax in these examples, so

3
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:08,860
they shouldn't feel terribly different.

4
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:11,880
I want you to reduce the language,
which I'll call loop,

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:16,110
which consists of descriptions of
machines that loop on the empty string.

6
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:21,280
And we want to reduce that to
the language L, which consists of Turing

7
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:26,300
machines that do not accept
the number 34 written out in binary.

8
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:28,770
As we'll see in a later lesson,
it's not possible for

9
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:31,620
me to perfectly verify your software.

10
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:33,070
But, if you do
a straightforward reduction,

11
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:34,730
then you should pass the test provided.
