1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Now things will become even more complicated.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm going to give you a list of numbers

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
slightly different than the one from before--

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
those are actually floating numbers. They have a decimal point.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
And I want you to implement the function variance.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
It takes our data and returns a single number,

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
which is the variance of the data.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
So for the data set I will be giving you,

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
it so turns out that the variance is 62.572.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Now some hints.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
First you're going to use the function mean,

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
that you have already programmed, so it's in your code. Just use it.

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
And then the trick that I want to play is:

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
We have our list here inside the function data.

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
We're going to transform this into a new list called "ndata."

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
It is the normalized data, which effectively is the data minus the mean,

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
which I'll call "mu."

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
So you compute the mean, called it "mu," perhaps,

19
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
and then subtract from the data--from each data item--the mu.

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
And this subtraction is not entirely trivial to make the new data set.

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
The commands I have been using is

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I iteratively construct with a for loop the data set.

23
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
First I set it to an empty list.

24
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Then there's this function called "append"--"dot-append,"

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
and whatever's inside the function--you've got to figure this out--

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
will be appended to this list over here.

27
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
So with an initial assignment of an empty list and a for loop,

28
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
we'll go through all the data items

29
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
and I'll append the appropriate thing to this new data.I get out this new data list.

30
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Then I can apply the same mean function to the new data list,

31
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
and that gives me the variance. You got it?

32
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
If not, listen to the video again.

33
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
So here's the coding environment.

34
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Our data set.

35
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I've given you the function mean that we've programmed before,

36
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
and now you are to program the function variance.

37
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
So if you print variance of data set,

38
00:01:35,000 --> 99:59:59,999
you get the desired 62.572884.
