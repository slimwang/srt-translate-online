1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,130
So the bad news is that it's hard to do.

2
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:03,920
The good news, no that's not right.

3
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:05,939
It's not hard to do.

4
00:00:05,939 --> 00:00:08,220
You're master students in computer science.

5
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:11,850
Hopefully, some of you have seen the Graph Cuts algorithm.

6
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:14,830
I'm not sure, we may do that later in this class when we do

7
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:16,750
an algorithm thing for segmentation.

8
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:17,400
Graph Cuts is a,

9
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:22,360
is a well know computer science algorithm where you've got two groups of graph,

10
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:25,290
you have a graph and you want to cut it in such a way that minimizes some value.

11
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:28,858
The cool thing was that Boykov, Veksler, and,

12
00:00:28,858 --> 00:00:33,990
and Ramin Zabih applied graph cuts to some computer vision problems and

13
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:38,760
in particular, they applied it to the stereo disparity problem.

14
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:42,800
And when you do that, you get a result that looks like this.

15
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,490
And this is pretty good.

16
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:48,820
So, on the right here we have the ground truth, all right?

17
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:54,140
And on the left you have a picture that looks pretty close to that ground truth.

18
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:55,770
There's still a little bit of issues.

19
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:56,960
I guess green's a bad choice here.

20
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:57,600
Pick red.

21
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,890
There's still some issues around here.

22
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:02,280
And of course a little bit where the, where the occlusion happens.

23
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,540
because remember, we've got occluded pixels near the edges.

24
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:08,200
But in general, compared to that correspondent solution that I

25
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:11,200
was showing you before, it's a much better solution.

26
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,580
I also point you to this Middlebury Stereo website.

27
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:16,770
There's a whole bunch of ground truth and

28
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:19,530
sort of standards in stereo that's available there.

29
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:24,350
I don't want to give you the impression that stereo is a totally solved problem,

30
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:26,920
there are still some challenges.

31
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,440
Textureless areas, it's very hard to know exactly where the match is, and

32
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,650
clearly the surface has to have more influence.

33
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:34,920
Occlusions are still a challenge.

34
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,810
Violations of the brightness constancy.

35
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:40,530
So, things like specularities whose value,

36
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:46,170
whose position on the surface move as I move that violates our stereo.

37
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:47,440
Really large baselines.

38
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,140
So I've got a camera way over there and a camera way over there.

39
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:51,950
Well now, I've foreshortened things, right?

40
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:54,030
So here I see the front of the camera and

41
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,990
over here, probably I'm out of the field.

42
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:58,050
Probably make can't, I'm totally gone.

43
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:00,720
But all I see over there is the side of camera.

44
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:04,600
So if I wanted to do stereo matching that's a very hard thing to do.

45
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,820
And then there's camera calibration errors, right?

46
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:10,770
So the, remember the camera calibration defines for me the epipolar lines.

47
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:14,010
What if they're wrong, by a little?

48
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:17,230
Well then my epipolar lines are wrong by a little.

49
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:18,650
So, how do I deal with that?

50
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:21,620
So these are challenges for ongoing stereo research.
