00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,120
In this exercise, you'll create
a bouncing ball screen saver,

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:06,910
just like the kind I'm sure
you spent hours staring at,

3
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:08,580
hoping the ball would hit
the corner of the screen.

4
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:13,200
Right now everything's in place for
you to finish up the screen saver.

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,190
But the ball doesn't actually move yet,
and it's doesn't bounce off the top or

6
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:20,110
bottom of the screen,
it'll just keep going forever.

7
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:21,674
So it's up for you to fix it.

8
00:00:21,674 --> 00:00:23,260
Check out the to-dos to get started.
