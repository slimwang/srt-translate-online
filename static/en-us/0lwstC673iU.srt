1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:04,470
Now, there's one more type of search for
plans that we can do with

2
00:00:04,469 --> 00:00:08,070
the classical planning language
that we couldn't do before.

3
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:11,400
And this is searching
through the space of plans

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,769
rather than searching
through the space of states.

5
00:00:14,769 --> 00:00:18,789
In forward search, we were searching
through concrete world states.

6
00:00:18,789 --> 00:00:22,496
In backward search, we were
searching through abstract states,

7
00:00:22,496 --> 00:00:25,289
in which some of the variables
were unspecified.

8
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:29,780
But in plan space search,
we search through the space of plans.

9
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:31,200
And here's how it works.

10
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,450
We start off with an empty plan.

11
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:36,891
We have the start state and
the goal state.

12
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:38,229
And that's all we know about the plan.

13
00:00:38,229 --> 00:00:40,899
So obviously, this plan is flawed.

14
00:00:40,899 --> 00:00:43,269
It doesn't lead us from
the start to the goal.

15
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:47,330
And then we say,
let's do an operation to edit or

16
00:00:47,329 --> 00:00:50,729
modify that plan by
adding something in new.

17
00:00:50,729 --> 00:00:54,029
And here, we're tackling the problem
of how to get dressed and

18
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:56,240
put on all the clothes
in the right order.

19
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:59,219
So we say at about
the operators we have,

20
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:01,589
we could add one of those
operators into the plan.

21
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:06,397
And so here we say, well what if we
added the put on right shoe operator,

22
00:01:06,397 --> 00:01:08,652
and then we end up with this plan.

23
00:01:08,652 --> 00:01:13,540
That still doesn't solve the problem,
so we need to keep refining that plan.

24
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:15,370
Then we come here and say,

25
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:20,490
well, maybe we could add in
the put on left shoe operator.

26
00:01:20,489 --> 00:01:24,539
And here I've shown the plan as
a parallel branching structure rather

27
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:26,430
than just as sequence.

28
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:31,360
And that's a useful thing to do because
it captures the fact these can be done

29
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:32,179
in either order.

30
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:37,360
And then we will keep refining like
that, adding on new branches or

31
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:41,569
new operators into the plan, until we
got a plan that was guaranteed to work.

32
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,890
Now this approach was popular in the
1980s, but it's faded from popularity.

33
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:52,930
Right now, the most popular approaches
have to do with forward search.

34
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:55,070
Now, we saw some of
the advantages of backward search.

35
00:01:55,069 --> 00:01:57,779
The advantage of forward
search seems to be

36
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,859
that we can come up with
very good heuristics.

37
00:01:59,859 --> 00:02:01,250
So we can do heuristic search.

38
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:06,090
And we saw how important it was to have
good heuristics, to do heuristic search.

39
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:09,979
And because the forward search
deals with concrete plan states,

40
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:12,430
it seems to be easier to
come up with good heuristics
