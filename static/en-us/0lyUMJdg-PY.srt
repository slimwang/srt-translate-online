00:00:00,146 --> 00:00:01,652
Great job so far.

2
00:00:01,653 --> 00:00:05,484
You now have all the tools you need to
build the first stage of the project.

3
00:00:05,485 --> 00:00:07,721
To get you started in
the right direction,

4
00:00:07,721 --> 00:00:11,884
we're going to show you step-by-step how
to use these tools to map out the lane

5
00:00:11,884 --> 00:00:13,143
on an image of the road.

6
00:00:13,143 --> 00:00:15,546
>> Let's review what steps you'll take.

7
00:00:15,545 --> 00:00:18,326
First, you need to calibrate the camera.

8
00:00:18,326 --> 00:00:21,314
Second, correct for image distortion.

9
00:00:21,314 --> 00:00:24,707
Third, implement a color and
gradient threshold.

10
00:00:24,707 --> 00:00:28,619
And fourth, warp the image
using perspective transform.

11
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:29,679
Is that it?

12
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:31,759
>> Well,
that gets us most of the way but

13
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,450
we still need to decide which
pixels are lane line pixels.

14
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:38,230
And then determine the line shape and
position.

15
00:00:38,229 --> 00:00:40,759
So next we're going to go
through an example of that so

16
00:00:40,759 --> 00:00:43,039
you have a clear picture of
how to approach the project.
