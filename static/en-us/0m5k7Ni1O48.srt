00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:04,724
Here's our data, and you'll see that the sample size is 25. It says 26 here

2
00:00:04,724 --> 00:00:11,535
because we have a header. So let's find the average of the QWERTY errors,

3
00:00:11,535 --> 00:00:20,323
equals average A2 to A26, and we get 5.08. And then if we find the average of

4
00:00:20,323 --> 00:00:26,410
the errors made on that alphabetical keyboard, we get 7.8. We want to see if

5
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:29,560
there's a significant difference between the number of errors made on each

6
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:35,454
keyboard. Our null hypothesis is that there is no significant difference. The

7
00:00:35,454 --> 00:00:39,282
population of errors from this keyboard, if it were extended to everybody, not

8
00:00:39,282 --> 00:00:44,598
just the sample, equals the population of errors using this keyboard. And our

9
00:00:44,598 --> 00:00:49,718
alternative hypothesis, is that they're not equal. Notice that this is

10
00:00:49,718 --> 00:00:56,968
equivalent to saying that mu sub Q minus mu sub A equals 0. If we just subtract

11
00:00:56,968 --> 00:01:00,559
mu sub A on both sides of this equation, which basically says that the

12
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:03,976
difference is equivalent to about 0.
