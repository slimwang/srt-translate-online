1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,240
Now that you know about polynomial time reductions, imagine that we had one problem in NP

2
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:11,790
such that every other problem that is also in NP could be reduced to it.

3
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:15,540
We would have vertex cover which could be reduced to that problem,

4
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:20,390
we would have independent set which could be reduced to that problem, and also clique, of course.

5
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:23,180
And any other problem in NP as well.

6
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:28,250
No matter how complicated that problem as long as it's NP that means

7
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:31,820
a non-deterministic RAM you can solve it in polynomial time--

8
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:36,510
there exist a polynomial time reduction to this ultimate problem.

9
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:40,950
And such a problem actually has a name, so if you could find a problem in NP

10
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:47,640
such that any other problem in NP is just as hard to solve or easier to solve,

11
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:54,810
then that problem is called NP complete because in a way it represents all of the problems in NP

12
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:59,110
because if it's a problem that any other problem can be reduced to, an NP complete problem

13
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:05,349
is basically capable of solving or representing all other problems that are contained in NP.

14
00:01:05,349 --> 00:01:10,410
An NP complete problem is contained in NP and the important part here is

15
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:14,020
that really any other problem in NP can be reduced to it.

16
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:17,440
Not just vertex cover, not just independent set, not just clique

17
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:21,460
but any problem that lies in NP can be reduced to that problem.

18
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:25,890
Let's have a little quiz to familiarize yourself with the concept of NP completeness.

19
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:28,920
I have three statements here about NP complete problems

20
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,290
and I would like you to tell me which one of these is true.

21
00:01:31,290 --> 99:59:59,999
There can be more than one.
