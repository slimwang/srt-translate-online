00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,000
Alright, so I have three and a half and I'm wondering how many times does

2
00:00:04,011 --> 00:00:07,806
four-fifths go into three and a half. I know that dividing by a fraction is the

3
00:00:07,818 --> 00:00:11,939
same thing as multiplying by a reciprocal, so I'm going to take three and a half

4
00:00:12,281 --> 00:00:16,390
and multiply it by the reciprocal of four-fifths. The reciprocal of four-fifths

5
00:00:16,402 --> 00:00:21,178
is five-fourths. Now I need to multiply these two fractions together. This three

6
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:26,114
and a half is a mixed number and doesn't help me. I'm going to change it to an

7
00:00:26,126 --> 00:00:29,833
improper fraction. 2 times 3 is 6 and 6 plus 1 is 7. So I have seven-halves

8
00:00:29,845 --> 00:00:32,569
times five-fourths or 35 divided by 8. 7 times 5 is 35, 2 times 4 is 8. Now I

9
00:00:32,581 --> 00:00:38,152
want to change this back into a mixed number to figure out how many batches of

10
00:00:38,164 --> 00:00:44,566
brownies I can make. 8 goes into 35, 4 times as 8 times 4 is 32. And I'm left

11
00:00:44,578 --> 00:00:48,943
with 3 extra pieces or three-eighths. So I can make 4 and three-eighths batches

12
00:00:48,955 --> 00:00:49,863
of brownies.
