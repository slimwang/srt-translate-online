00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:01,790
To answer the quiz questions,

2
00:00:01,790 --> 00:00:05,920
we've provided a link to
the AsyncTask documentation site.

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:10,060
One section called the four steps
is particularly relevant, and

4
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:12,608
discusses the purpose of
each call back method.

5
00:00:12,608 --> 00:00:15,460
All right, let's talk about
the answers for this quiz.

6
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:18,390
The important part is that
you understand immediately

7
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:22,830
after Async has started, onPreExecute
is called on the main thread.

8
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:27,072
Then, doinBackground will
happen on a background thread.

9
00:00:27,072 --> 00:00:31,600
While doinBackground is executing,
if you call publishProgress,

10
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:37,000
then the onProgressUpdate callback will
be triggered with a new progress value.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,190
This happens on the main thread, so

12
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:42,490
you can update the user on
the progress of the task.

13
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:45,700
Finally, after doinBackground finishes,

14
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:49,470
then the result is passed to
the onPostExecute method.

15
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:53,337
This method runs on the main thread so
that you can update your app UI.

16
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:55,428
Great work.

17
00:00:55,428 --> 00:00:58,340
You're well on your way to
understanding how to take advantage

18
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:01,260
of the background thread
with the AsyncTask class.
