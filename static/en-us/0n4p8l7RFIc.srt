00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,564
All right, here's what I did. I first of all computed the reduction 0 to 5 that

2
00:00:04,564 --> 00:00:09,215
you've seen just a few minutes ago and multiply that by 51 to get one of these

3
00:00:09,215 --> 00:00:17,041
six values. That's the job for red. It's the exact same for green, and for

4
00:00:17,041 --> 00:00:23,390
blue. Let's try it out. When I run the program, I can pick an image. I get to

5
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:28,440
see it before the change is applied. And when I click on OK, then the change is

6
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:32,529
applied. And when you look carefully, you'll now see that the image looks

7
00:00:32,529 --> 00:00:38,505
coarser. It has fewer colors, for example, in this range here. Now fortunately,

8
00:00:38,505 --> 00:00:42,882
my cat Eliza isn't on a distant planet. But if she was, then it would take far

9
00:00:42,882 --> 00:00:47,424
fewer pixels to send her image to me. The exact equations that we just used

10
00:00:47,424 --> 00:00:51,422
aren't really important to remember. But the point that I wanted to make is

11
00:00:51,422 --> 00:00:55,094
that even though integer division doesn't sound like the most interesting thing

12
00:00:55,094 --> 00:01:00,598
in the world. It can be put to good use and give you a fun application. Go

13
00:01:00,598 --> 00:01:02,943
ahead and practice that a bit more with Sarah.
