00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,840
Again there are a few options here, so if yours doesn't look exactly like mine

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:09,200
it might still be right. I chose to call the method unfriend, and name the

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,975
perimeter that comes in nonfriend. This would be the friend that you are

4
00:00:12,975 --> 00:00:17,910
unmaking. The method doesn't need to return anything. What we're interested in

5
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:21,460
is that it mutates the object to reflect the new social developments. It's

6
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:26,180
public because it's part of the public interface of the person class. If you

7
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:27,460
got this, good work.
