00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
In this question, I'm giving a set of data points--some positive, some negative--and a query point.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Given the following labeled data set, I'd like to find the minimum of "k"

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
for which the query point over here becomes negative.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Enter "0" if this is impossible.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Ties are broken at random, and I'd suggest trying to avoid them,

6
00:00:21,000 --> 99:59:59,999
because you might not be able to guarantee that the class is negative.
