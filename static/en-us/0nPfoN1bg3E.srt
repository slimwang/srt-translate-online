1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,175
So the first thing you want
to do is download this file,

2
00:00:03,175 --> 00:00:06,650
fresh_tomatoes.py from
the instructor notes.

3
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:11,670
Once you've downloaded it, make sure you
save this file in the exact same folder

4
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:15,500
as the Python file where we created
all of these movie instances.

5
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,970
Okay, so I'm going to begin to
use the fresh_tomatoes file.

6
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:22,485
And then call the function
open_movies_page.

7
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:28,120
Now I know that this function
open_movies_page takes in a list

8
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:29,800
on an array of movies.

9
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:32,570
I do have a bunch of movies that
I have created over here, but

10
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:35,670
I do need to put them all
in a list on an array.

11
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:37,320
Let me do that next.

12
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,380
So, I will define an empty array or
a list called movies.

13
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:42,660
There it is.

14
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:46,570
And to this list, I will add all of
the movies I had created previously.

15
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:52,078
So, the first movie to add is toy_story,
next one is avatar,

16
00:00:52,078 --> 00:00:54,960
next is school_of_rock,

17
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,440
the next one is ratatouille,
it's spelling is a little difficult.

18
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,650
I think I got it.

19
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:05,800
Next in line is midnight_in_paris and
the final one is hunger_games.

20
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:08,250
So there is our movies array.

21
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:11,440
By the way, in case you need
more information about lists or

22
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:14,960
arrays, you can find a helpful
link in the instructor notes.

23
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:15,730
All right.

24
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:17,930
Now that I have a list of movies,

25
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:22,570
I can give this list as input to
the open_movies_page function.

26
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:24,240
Let me do that next.

27
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:29,570
So I will provide movies as the argument
to open_movies_page function.

28
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:30,710
There it is.

29
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:33,920
Now before I save and
run this entire program,

30
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,820
I know that I still haven't imported
the file fresh_tomatoes in my program.

31
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:43,380
So I will scroll all the way up,
and import fresh_tomatoes.

32
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:48,110
Notice that this line of code will
work only if the fresh_tomatoes file

33
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:52,000
is in the exact same folder
as our current Python file.

34
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,590
Okay.

35
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:54,650
Time to save and run this program.

36
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:57,060
And there is our movies website.

37
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:01,055
If I click on any one of the links,
its trailer will play.

38
00:02:01,055 --> 00:02:08,216
