1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:04,070
We've been talking about labels and
their use in mandatory access control.

2
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:06,440
Now we're going to get
to a concrete model.

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:11,150
This is a model that deal
with confidentiality and

4
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:15,310
it was introduced earlier is
the Bell and La Padua model.

5
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:20,790
Project that developed this model was
funded by the Department of Defense,

6
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:23,650
so the kind of label we're going to
talk about are the type we've

7
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:26,940
been discussing, where you have
classification and clearance and

8
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:27,840
things like that.

9
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:33,262
Couple of things to keep in mind here is
that confidentiality is the issue here.

10
00:00:33,262 --> 00:00:35,584
We're concerned about
the disclosure of information.

11
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:39,974
So more sensitive information we don't
want that to be disclosed to someone who

12
00:00:39,974 --> 00:00:42,230
is not cleared at that level.

13
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:43,715
So that's going to be one.

14
00:00:43,715 --> 00:00:47,060
And since we're talking with DoD
the other thing to keep in mind is

15
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:49,260
the labels what they're
going to look like.

16
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:55,140
As I said, the DoD means it's going
to assume that information or

17
00:00:55,140 --> 00:01:00,780
data that's contained in files
is classified at levels like TS,

18
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:04,000
top secret, secret, and
classified and so on.

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,530
The second part of a label
is a compartment or

20
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:08,830
category that as we said before.

21
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:11,780
It depends, what is the document about.

22
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,160
So is it chemical or nuclear or

23
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:19,280
conventional or two kinds or
something like that.

24
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:24,540
And the rule for read says user with
label L1, top secret user, for example.

25
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:27,893
Who's working on, let's say,
nuclear and conventional.

26
00:01:27,893 --> 00:01:30,563
So that would be this
user's compartments.

27
00:01:30,563 --> 00:01:36,809
So user with label L1 can read document
with label L2 only when L1 dominates L2.

28
00:01:36,809 --> 00:01:41,096
So this domination that we defined
before when the label of the subject or

29
00:01:41,096 --> 00:01:46,120
the user dominates the label of the
document, then they're able to read it.

30
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,910
This is called the read-down rule.

31
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:53,270
You can read documents that
are classified at your or

32
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:55,710
a level that's below yours.

33
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:57,160
Or further down from your level.

34
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,700
So that's the read-down rule.

35
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:02,800
It's also called the simple
security property.

36
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,350
So how about writes?

37
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:07,130
Because you both need,
you need to address both read and write.

38
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:10,669
So user with label L1 can
write document with level

39
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:13,840
L2 when L1 is dominated by L2.

40
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,340
This is saying the user has to
be at a level that is lower than

41
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:21,260
the level at which
the document is classified.

42
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:25,727
Which means if the user is secret,
he can write a top-secret document,

43
00:02:25,727 --> 00:02:28,590
he cannot write
an unclassified document.

44
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:30,860
This is the write-up rule.

45
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:33,223
So you can read down, but
you have to write-up, and

46
00:02:33,223 --> 00:02:34,740
it's called the star property.

47
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:38,050
So let's just see what's the sort
of rationale for writing up.

48
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:40,140
Remember, our focus is
on confidentiality or

49
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:42,060
disclosure of information.

50
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:46,102
This model says more sensitive
information cannot flow.

51
00:02:46,102 --> 00:02:49,280
Well, the information flow
control requirement that we had.

52
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,860
So more sensitive information
should not flow to users

53
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:54,910
who are not cleared at that level.

54
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:57,035
It's basically focusing on disclosure.

55
00:02:57,035 --> 00:03:00,125
It doesn't say anything about
who can write information.

56
00:03:00,125 --> 00:03:05,595
That's sort of an integrity question and
we have to revisit that perhaps.

57
00:03:05,595 --> 00:03:08,710
But if I can write at my level or
at a higher level.

58
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:11,790
If I could write at the lower level,
then what could go wrong?

59
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:15,790
Well, I may have in my possession some
information that is more sensitive.

60
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:19,291
If I write it into a document that's
at the lower level, then someone who's

61
00:03:19,291 --> 00:03:22,645
cleared at the lower level can in
the future come and read that document.

62
00:03:22,645 --> 00:03:25,605
Which means we would have
information flow from a more

63
00:03:25,605 --> 00:03:29,704
sensitive level to a level and to a user
who should not have access to that.

64
00:03:29,704 --> 00:03:32,170
So, you can't allow write downs.

65
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:36,260
You can question why would
an unclassified user have information

66
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:37,280
that is top secret?

67
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,200
But if they did write a top secret
document, a top secret user would read

68
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,990
it, as information flow from
unclassified to top secret.

69
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:46,060
But that doesn't,

70
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:48,720
while with the confidentiality
requirement that we have.

71
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,240
So think about, a request comes.

72
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,410
User has the users label.

73
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:57,730
The target is a document that the user
wants to access, had its own label.

74
00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:00,140
We can do this comparison
if the read request is,

75
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,230
user is making a read request.

76
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:06,670
Then the user label better
dominates the documents label,

77
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:09,690
to satisfy the simple security
property of the read-down rule.
