00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,259
Alright so it's time for you to try flying solo with NSUserDefaults

2
00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:07,559
by implementing them on this recording app called PickYourPitch.

3
00:00:07,559 --> 00:00:11,189
we can see that the first page allows us to record a sound file.

4
00:00:11,189 --> 00:00:17,100
“Testing testing” And the second page allows us to play back that sound file

5
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,528
as well as adjust the pitch with a slider.

6
00:00:19,528 --> 00:00:24,809
“Testing testing” “Testing testing”

7
00:00:24,809 --> 00:00:28,618
But we can see that when we close the app and restart it the pitch information

8
00:00:28,618 --> 00:00:30,000
that we set is gone.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,250
Test again. Instead of the slider being off to the left where we left it,

10
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:39,238
it's now back in the middle in its default position. Your challenge is to

11
00:00:39,238 --> 00:00:41,789
make the position of the slider persistent.

12
00:00:41,789 --> 00:00:44,969
Think of it as a simple version of a user preference. If you're making an app

13
00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:48,000
for playing podcast, you might have a settings page where the user sets their

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,689
preferred playback speed. And users often expect apps to remember that kind of

15
00:00:51,689 --> 00:00:55,198
preference. So check out the following instructions and see if you can make

16
00:00:55,198 --> 00:00:56,549
this recording a persistent.
