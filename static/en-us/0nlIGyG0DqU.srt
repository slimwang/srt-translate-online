1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,150
And the answer, is all of them, expect the one that

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:06,820
is right before the critical block. This first one is in

3
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:10,060
the middle of the critical section, so he's running. This next

4
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:12,370
one is before the critical section, so he has some work to

5
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:15,000
do before he needs to stop. This third one is past

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,110
the critical section, so he's fine continuing on. Only this fourth

7
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:22,040
one, only for him would the next statement to execute be

8
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:25,760
in this critical section. So only he needs to pause and wait

9
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,290
for this first thread to finsih the critcal

10
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:29,640
seciton so that he can then enter it.
