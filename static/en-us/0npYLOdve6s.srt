1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:04,980
The answer for which column is relatively straightforward. U goes from 0 to 1

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:11,537
and there are 512 columns starting at 0. I multiply the U of 0.02 by 512 and

3
00:00:11,537 --> 00:00:15,930
get 102.4. I drop the fraction to get the texel column. As you'll recall from

4
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:19,850
an earlier exercise, we drop the fraction. For the row, if I were to make the

5
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:23,790
lower left corner to be texel 0,0, then we would simply multiply again and be

6
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:28,030
done. Row 358 would be the answer. However, counting from the upper left corner

7
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:32,299
is what we want. Think about the relationship. The lower corner's row 0 is the

8
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:36,080
upper corner's 511, and vice versa. To convert from one to the other, we

9
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:40,620
subtract the row from 511. For example, row number 1 at the bottom is indeed

10
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:45,520
row number 510 when counting from the top. Subtracting 358 from 511 gives us

11
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,679
row 153.
