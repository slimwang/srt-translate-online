1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I could take the results from all plays, so each play is a triple of position, direction, and a word,

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
and then I could add a score to those, but it seems like I'm just taking this lists apart

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
and putting them back together so many time. I've already done it three times.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I did a row play--took it apart, added it back in j for the horizontal plays, and took that apart,

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
added back in a direction for all_plays. I could do that one more time to insert the score.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Maybe that would've been the right choice.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Maybe I just got fatigued, and I made a mistake in my design sense,

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
but what I decided to do was modify my horizontal_plays and all_plays functions.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
There are two modifications.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Here in horizontal_plays, after I got the play, I calculate a score,

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
and then I insert that into my result.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Now my results are no longer just position, word play--they're score, position, word play.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Then I want to do the same thing in all_plays.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I want to make my play be a score, position, direction, word tuple,

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
and I'm just, as before, ripping these things apart and putting them back together.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Now, remember the board. It's got these double letters, triple word scores, and so on.

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
If you're old-school it looks like this.

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
This is on a piece of cardboard that's a physical material.

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
We've also written triple and double scores, so I need to come up with some ways

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
of representing these spots on the board and how they're special.

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Now, could I squeeze it into my existing representation of a row?

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Remember a row is a list, and it can have things like that border is a string.

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Then we have a letter. Then we can have anchors like ANY.

24
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Could I have room for putting information about bonus squares on the board--

25
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
the double and triple letters?

26
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Could I have, say, 3W to mean triple-word score as an element of this row?

27
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I guess my intuition is I don't think that's going to work very well.

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
The problem is one of these squares--say this one--

29
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
could be both an anchor and a triple-word score.

30
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
So we'd need some representation that allowed both of those.

31
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
That just doesn't seem to be easy to extend what I already have.

32
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Let's not override our row notation.

33
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Our rows, as we have it--I'm pretty happy with them.

34
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I'm not going to allow this. I'm going to keep row exactly as they are.

35
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I'm going to introduce another data structure--a parallel board, I'm going to have two boards.

36
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
One board that I play on and another board that holds the bonuses. Think of it as two layers.

37
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
One representation of a two-dimensional matrix just holds these double words

38
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
and triple letters scores and so on,

39
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
and then on top of that there's a second two-dimensional array

40
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:45,000
that holds the values of the letters and also holds the anchors. Oh, I got a good score.

41
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Now I'm going to have board[ j ][ i ] will hold the letter or anchor,

42
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
and then bonus[ j ][ i ] will hold corresponding bonus--

43
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
a double word, a triple letter, or just nothing.
