1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The answer is we should, and this is related to the homework problem on Unit 4

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
where we saw that you could forge an RSA signature by multiplying two signatures.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:17,000
In this case, the message that's being signed might be used to produce other messages.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
We need to be very careful when we output the result of RSA decryptions.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 99:59:59,999
We might be signing something different from what we think we're signing.
