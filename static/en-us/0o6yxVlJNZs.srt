1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:03,000
And finally, one more point regarding signal handling.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,350
We have two types of signals.

3
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:08,690
The first type are the so-called one-shot signals.

4
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:14,560
One property of these signals is that we know that if they're multiple instances

5
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:19,190
of the same signal that will occur, they will be handled at least once.

6
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:23,890
So it is possible that if we have a situation in which only one signal of

7
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:28,710
that kind occurred versus n signals of that same kind occurred,

8
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:33,210
that only one execution of the actual signal handler is performed.

9
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:37,784
The other thing about the one-shot signals is that the handling routine must be

10
00:00:37,784 --> 00:00:40,180
re-enabled every single time.

11
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:45,860
So, if the process wants to install some custom handler for a particular signal,

12
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:51,026
then invoking the operation will mean that once when the signal occurs,

13
00:00:51,026 --> 00:00:54,760
the process specific handling routine will be invoked.

14
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:59,450
However, any future instances of that signal will be handled by

15
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:01,640
the default operating system action.

16
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:05,379
Or, if the operating system chooses to ignore such signals then they

17
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:06,540
will be lost.

18
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:10,800
Another type of signals are so-called real time signals that are supported in

19
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,150
an operating system like Linux, for instance.

20
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:18,540
And their behavior is such that if a signal is raised n times,

21
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:22,340
then the handler is guaranteed to be called n times as well.

22
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:28,290
So, they have sort of a queuing behavior as opposed to an overriding behavior,

23
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:30,010
as is the case with the one-shot signals.
