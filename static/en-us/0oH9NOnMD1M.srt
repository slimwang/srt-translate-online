00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The answer is 2^n-1, and the way you can see that is here.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
With 12 characters, there are 11 spaces in between characters,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:17,000
and we can either place or not place a word segment in between each of the characters.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 99:59:59,999
And so 11 of them either occur or don't occur, so that's to the 11th.
