00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
This problem asks you to define a function

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,000
called "find_last" that takes in 2 parameters:

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
one string that we're searching in, another string that we're finding.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
The whole point of this function

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
is to find the position of the last occurrence of "t".

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
So let's use a variable called "last_pos".

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
The overall plan here

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
is while we keep finding occurrences of "t",

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
we're going to keep running the "find" function

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and updating our offset.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
So let's do that: "while True:"--

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
and since we don't know when we want to terminate yet,

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
we're going to update a position

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
using the "find" function,

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
where we're searching for "t",

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
but we're starting at the last position, plus 1.

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
The "+1" is important so that we

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
don't keep finding the same string over and over again.

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
If this returns "-1",

20
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
that means we didn't find another occurrence of "t".

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
So we want to return the previous refound occurrence,

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
which we stored in "last_pos".

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Otherwise, we want to update "last_pos"

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
with the position that we just found.

25
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
So the one thing left is: what do we initialize "last_pos" to?

26
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
If we never find any occurrence of "t" in "s",

27
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
the goal is to return "-1".

28
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
So if "position" equals negative 1

29
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
in the first iteration, we're just going to return "last_pos".

30
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
So it makes sense to initialize it to "-1".
