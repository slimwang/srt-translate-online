00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,790
Let's open up Unity and
go back to our course project.

2
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:08,225
First, create a new scene,
then create a cube primitive.

3
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:11,060
And let's move it
slightly out of the way.

4
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:14,970
Now, let's create another cube.

5
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:20,560
In the hierarchy, click on the first
cube and drag it on top of the second.

6
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:22,290
See it indent?

7
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:26,000
You've just established
a transform hierarchy.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,420
Easy, right?

9
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:30,080
Rotate the parent and
you'll see the child follow along.

10
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:32,940
Position and scale work the same way.

11
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,290
That's all there is to it.

12
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:38,830
Transform hierarchies
go as deep as you want.

13
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:41,320
You can have children of
children of children.

14
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:42,350
It's super powerful.
