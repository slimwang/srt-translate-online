00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,950
When using maps in your application
the map fragment provides a view

2
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:07,480
over the map, based on the
specifications defined on your camera.

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:11,410
If you don't define a camera you just
get a view of the entire world over

4
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:13,560
latitude zero and longitude zero.

5
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:17,020
Understanding the camera is
the key to understanding your app.

6
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:21,770
The camera is controlled using
a class called CameraPosition.

7
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:25,440
The properties that define
your camera are the targets.

8
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:29,650
And this is the latitude and longitude
that you want to point the camera at.

9
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:32,740
This lat long will define
the center of your map.

10
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:36,920
And how much of the map you
see is determined by the zoom.

11
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:42,140
This is a value from zero, the furthest
out effectively showing the whole world,

12
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:45,280
down to 21,
which is really close to street level.

13
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,860
You can get in even closer
by using Street View,

14
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:50,130
and you'll see that in a later lesson.

15
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:51,800
Bearing is a property, and

16
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:55,380
this determines the direction
that the camera is facing.

17
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:59,290
It's specified in degrees
clockwise from north.

18
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:04,160
So if you want the camera to be facing
east, the bearing would be 90 degrees.

19
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:09,210
If you wanted to face northwest,
the bearing would be 315 degrees.

20
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:12,380
Tilt is how much
the camera is tilted by.

21
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:13,210
By default,

22
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:17,410
this is zero which means the camera is
facing directly down towards the ground.

23
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:22,740
You can increase this with the upper
bound determined by how far zoomed

24
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:24,100
out you are.

25
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:27,070
So, for example,
if you're zoomed out really far

26
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:30,690
the maximum tilt that you
could do is 30 degrees.

27
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:34,410
As you get closer to the Earth,
the maximum tilt goes up.

28
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:37,630
With a maximum of 67.5 degrees.

29
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:41,560
You can just see tilt as how
the camera is tilted toward the ground,

30
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,650
you're looking straight
down at the ground, or

31
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:47,890
you're tilted at the ground so
you can get a 3D isometric style view.

32
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:49,680
Like you had with
the skyscrapers earlier on.
