1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,553
So student Lisa asks, what would be different in

2
00:00:02,553 --> 00:00:04,277
world where almost everyone was programming

3
00:00:04,277 --> 00:00:07,451
literate. So this is the core question and obviously

4
00:00:07,451 --> 00:00:09,577
I feel that it would be great to have such a world

5
00:00:09,577 --> 00:00:11,571
thatÃ¢ÂÂs why we are trying to encourage as many

6
00:00:11,571 --> 00:00:13,651
people as possible to take this class and hope

7
00:00:13,651 --> 00:00:16,364
youÃ¢ÂÂll encourage any non programming literate

8
00:00:16,364 --> 00:00:19,254
people that you know to take the next version in

9
00:00:19,254 --> 00:00:21,438
this class starting in April.

10
00:00:21,438 --> 00:00:23,272
There are lots of things that understanding

11
00:00:23,272 --> 00:00:27,087
programming even at just a basic level and I think

12
00:00:27,087 --> 00:00:29,522
many of you are beyond the basic level now if

13
00:00:29,522 --> 00:00:32,377
youÃ¢ÂÂve made it this far in CS101, but in terms of

14
00:00:32,377 --> 00:00:34,337
the things that you interact with and the things that

15
00:00:34,337 --> 00:00:36,438
you see in the world, almost all of them are

16
00:00:36,438 --> 00:00:38,608
controlled by programs these days and people

17
00:00:38,608 --> 00:00:41,309
who understand programming can relate to those

18
00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:43,635
things and have better way than people who donÃ¢ÂÂt.

19
00:00:43,635 --> 00:00:46,016
And some of this can be sort of fairly obvious

20
00:00:46,016 --> 00:00:48,172
things when you interact with a website and you

21
00:00:48,172 --> 00:00:50,472
can tell, well theyÃ¢ÂÂve got some bugging it because

22
00:00:50,472 --> 00:00:52,787
the programmer didnÃ¢ÂÂt think of that both branches

23
00:00:52,787 --> 00:00:56,279
of the NIFT test and if you are a programmer or

24
00:00:56,279 --> 00:00:59,486
you at least understand about programming that

25
00:00:59,486 --> 00:01:01,414
you maybe have a better sense of what is going

26
00:01:01,414 --> 00:01:03,957
on but you also can get a lot more familiar by it

27
00:01:03,957 --> 00:01:05,782
because you know well this is something any

28
00:01:05,782 --> 00:01:06,986
programmer who knows what they are doing

29
00:01:06,986 --> 00:01:08,599
should have test before and understand whatÃ¢ÂÂs

30
00:01:08,599 --> 00:01:10,975
going on and itÃ¢ÂÂs really annoying that you have to

31
00:01:10,975 --> 00:01:13,243
deal with their mistake.

32
00:01:13,243 --> 00:01:14,611
Other things you probably have a better

33
00:01:14,611 --> 00:01:16,363
understanding of how complicated it is and how

34
00:01:16,363 --> 00:01:19,567
hard it is to get things right that you might be a

35
00:01:19,567 --> 00:01:21,678
little more forgiving when things break and have

36
00:01:21,678 --> 00:01:24,122
better ideas about well this is probably why itÃ¢ÂÂs

37
00:01:24,122 --> 00:01:26,682
breaking, letÃ¢ÂÂs try to use this tool or use this

38
00:01:26,682 --> 00:01:29,000
product in some slightly different way. So thatÃ¢ÂÂs

39
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,151
one of the reasons. The other reason I think is

40
00:01:31,151 --> 00:01:33,179
there are lots of things that people encounter

41
00:01:33,179 --> 00:01:35,450
every day that if you know a little bit about

42
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:38,309
programming instead of doing a lot of tedious work

43
00:01:38,309 --> 00:01:41,399
as a human you can find a way to automate that

44
00:01:41,399 --> 00:01:42,822
and save yourself a lot ofÃ¢ÂÂ¦

45
00:01:42,822 --> 00:01:44,546
There is a good example of this right here in our

46
00:01:44,546 --> 00:01:46,775
office. So when recording these video we generate

47
00:01:46,775 --> 00:01:48,928
hundreds every week to get the classes out for all

48
00:01:48,928 --> 00:01:52,312
these courses and they are all named kind of

49
00:01:52,312 --> 00:01:55,741
default things by the video camera and video X, X,

50
00:01:55,741 --> 00:01:58,443
X, 1, 2, 4 and whatever but what we need to do

51
00:01:58,443 --> 00:02:00,389
that is that organize them like date and time and

52
00:02:00,389 --> 00:02:02,504
course and what not. And so whenever video

53
00:02:02,504 --> 00:02:04,437
editors wrote script, weÃ¢ÂÂd just kind of the

54
00:02:04,437 --> 00:02:06,232
programming that you got from here and a little bit

55
00:02:06,232 --> 00:02:08,512
previously to do this automatically. Whenever we

56
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:10,955
record videos we just give it to her and she sorts it

57
00:02:10,955 --> 00:02:13,171
automatically and saves the video editors hours of

58
00:02:13,171 --> 00:02:14,586
time.

59
00:02:14,586 --> 00:02:17,700
Okay, thatÃ¢ÂÂs great and I think people once you get

60
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,147
a little experience with programming youÃ¢ÂÂll see

61
00:02:19,147 --> 00:02:22,293
things like that every day that youÃ¢ÂÂre seeing people

62
00:02:22,293 --> 00:02:23,975
could be yourself but itÃ¢ÂÂll less often be yourself

63
00:02:23,975 --> 00:02:26,783
spending their time doing tedious things that are

64
00:02:26,783 --> 00:02:28,645
not fun for humans. That you could write a few

65
00:02:28,645 --> 00:02:32,647
lines of python code to solve and so I hope, at the

66
00:02:32,647 --> 00:02:34,053
end of this class and I think by this point in the

67
00:02:34,053 --> 00:02:35,872
class many of you really should be at a level

68
00:02:35,872 --> 00:02:37,788
where youÃ¢ÂÂre instead of just solving the problems

69
00:02:37,788 --> 00:02:39,688
that weÃ¢ÂÂre giving you in the homeworks, youÃ¢ÂÂre

70
00:02:39,688 --> 00:02:41,307
finding real problems in your life and in your

71
00:02:41,307 --> 00:02:43,750
friends lives that you can solve by writing a little bit

72
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:47,507
of code. So, I hope everyone will be doing that and

73
00:02:47,507 --> 00:02:50,918
spreading the value of programming literacy

74
00:02:50,918 --> 00:02:52,506
beyond that, beyond just yourself.
