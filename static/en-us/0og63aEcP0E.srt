00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,372
The furthest left region on the number line starts at negative infinity and goes

2
00:00:05,372 --> 00:00:09,979
up until 4. So in that region, all values of x are less than 4. The next

3
00:00:09,979 --> 00:00:14,967
important value we have is x equals 4. Then, we have the values of x that lie

4
00:00:14,967 --> 00:00:19,867
between 4 and 9. Next, we have x equal to 9. And lastly, the values of x that

5
00:00:19,867 --> 00:00:21,150
are greater than 9.
