1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,585
The correct steps for

2
00:00:01,585 --> 00:00:05,239
setting up a location services
application are as follows.

3
00:00:05,239 --> 00:00:11,420
First, you create a GoogleApiClient
that uses the location services API.

4
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:17,900
Then, you extend your activity with
the GoogleApiClientConnectionCallbacks.

5
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,545
The next step is to extend
your activity with the

6
00:00:21,545 --> 00:00:25,480
GoogleApiClient.OnConnectionFailedListe-
ner.

7
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,360
You use this in case
the connection fails.

8
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:33,450
Following that, you'll extend your
activity using a location listener, and

9
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:36,310
this listens for location updates.

10
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:39,940
After you've connected the Google API
clients, you'll wait for

11
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:41,210
the on connected callback.

12
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:46,000
And then finally, in this callback,
the onConnected callback,

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,810
you'll set up
the onLocationChanged call back.

14
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:53,280
And in this you can capture
your location information.

15
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,640
This sequence will be used in every app
that uses the location provider and

16
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:01,140
you'll want to be sure you know all of
these as you move on throughout the rest

17
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:02,530
of this class.

18
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:03,980
Since this sequence is so

19
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:08,550
important, take some time to think of
a good way to remember all these steps.

20
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:11,170
And then go ahead and
post in the forum about it.

21
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:13,410
Practice always makes perfect of course.

22
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:17,310
And do take some time to read in
the forums what other people have said,

23
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:22,840
and you might find a pneumonic
that works for you.

24
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:25,220
I just got it down after a little while.

25
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:26,430
I hope you could do something similar.
