00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:04,150
Now, it would be fair for you to
object and say, well, Professor Balch,

2
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:06,430
what do you mean by better?

3
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:10,230
I'll get onto that, but
I think it's pretty clear, actually,

4
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:14,500
that this is the best bet, and
we'll spend some time explaining why.

5
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:18,396
But the big picture is,
this bet is very, very risky.

6
00:00:18,396 --> 00:00:23,030
There's a 49% chance
you'll lose all your money

7
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:26,580
with a single flip of the coin,
whereas in this case,

8
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:30,850
your coins are distributed over
1,000 individual small bets, and

9
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:33,050
there's very little chance
you'll lose all your money.

10
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:38,410
And furthermore, the expected return for
each of these bets is the same.

11
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:40,950
It's just that this one
has much lower risk.
