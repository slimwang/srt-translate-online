00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,770
This hammer here is a fantastic
tool to build stuff.

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:06,990
But in order for it to work, it needs
my immediate attention of energy.

3
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:08,626
I can't just turn it on and
let it do its thing.

4
00:00:08,626 --> 00:00:10,294
In today's affordable tool shed,

5
00:00:10,294 --> 00:00:13,196
we've only recently got a few
additions that are different.

6
00:00:13,196 --> 00:00:15,479
These modern high end
tools like this 3D print-

7
00:00:15,479 --> 00:00:19,083
>> [COUGH] We don't have the budget

8
00:00:19,083 --> 00:00:20,167
for that.

9
00:00:20,167 --> 00:00:20,900
>> Right.

10
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:24,434
Modern tools like our 3D printer,
that's out for maintenance,

11
00:00:24,434 --> 00:00:28,300
can be given a task that it then
performs autonomously until it's done.

12
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:32,369
In today's life of a web developer,
we're seeing a similar trend,

13
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:35,700
a large collection of tools that you
feed tasks and that then automate and

14
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,150
improve many aspects of your workflow.

15
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:40,060
Let's dive into
the world of build tools.
