1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,621
Well, what do you think? Which of the
following could be a plausible explanation

2
00:00:04,633 --> 00:00:08,764
for Friedman's observation, and which
would lend for a different policy

3
00:00:08,776 --> 00:00:13,033
conclusion? One option is this is
completely plausible. McDonald's makes

4
00:00:13,045 --> 00:00:17,692
people happy and happy people don't go to
war, or maybe countries with McDonald's

5
00:00:17,704 --> 00:00:22,187
spent too much of their money in order to
open the McDonald's and now they can't

6
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:26,931
afford to go to war. Or maybe citizens of
countries with McDonald's are too

7
00:00:26,943 --> 00:00:31,460
unhealthy to go to war. Or maybe countries
with McDonald's are more open to

8
00:00:31,472 --> 00:00:36,567
globalization and foreign investments and
less inclined to go to war with other such

9
00:00:36,579 --> 00:00:37,488
open countries.
