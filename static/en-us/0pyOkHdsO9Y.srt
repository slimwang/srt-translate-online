1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:01,890
You're actually using HTTP right now.

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:05,390
If you take a look at your browser,
there's probably something in the web

3
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:10,380
address bar that looks
like https://udacity.com.

4
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:12,970
We're not going to worry
about the s right now, but

5
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:15,630
we'll focus on the http part.

6
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:17,650
So, what exactly is HTTP?

7
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:19,460
Or more importantly, what is a protocol?

8
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:22,500
A protocol is a way of communicating,

9
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:27,370
a standard operating procedure or
the rules for communication.

10
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:28,450
All these definitions work.

11
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:31,730
For instance, think about shaking hands.

12
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:33,030
In certain places around the world,

13
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:35,740
it's customary to shake hands
when you first meet someone.

14
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:39,070
We might call this a protocol or
following protocol.

15
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:42,430
But sometimes even when people
should shake hands, they don't.

16
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:46,970
When this happens, the protocol isn't
followed and for humans this is okay.

17
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:51,390
If I forgot to shake your hand, then our
conversation may start awkwardly but

18
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:53,270
will probably keep chatting.

19
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:55,860
This is very different from
how computers use protocol.

20
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:59,390
Computers must follow protocol,
in order to communicate.

21
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:02,050
If computers don't follow protocol,
then they don't know what's going on.

22
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:05,770
And this is where HTTP
comes into the picture.

23
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:08,140
HTTP is a protocol
built specifically for

24
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:11,450
communicating hypertext
data between computers.

25
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:15,650
This could consist of images,
text, video.

26
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:18,680
But for now,
we can just think of all this as data.

27
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,790
But how does HTTP work?

28
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:23,810
As developers we don't really need
to know the low-level details.

29
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:26,790
And instead we can just look
at a high-level abstraction.

30
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:28,040
And we'll show that to you next.
