1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,410
Okay, so what is what does
this diagram look like to you?

2
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:04,320
We've got this box in
the middle labeled RL.

3
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:05,702
I won't tell you what that stands for.

4
00:00:05,702 --> 00:00:09,279
And rewards and interaction with
the environment come in and

5
00:00:09,279 --> 00:00:10,870
behavior comes out.

6
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:12,100
>> So it looks like that.

7
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:12,980
>> What?

8
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:14,920
>> Yeah, that's what it'll look like,
it looks like that it looks like that.

9
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,800
>> But
what process does that remind you of?

10
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:17,358
I'll give you a hint.

11
00:00:17,358 --> 00:00:18,330
>> Reinforcement learning.

12
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:18,980
>> Yeah, okay.

13
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:19,855
So that's reinforcement.

14
00:00:19,855 --> 00:00:21,070
>> [LAUGH]
>> Well, I want to contrast it with

15
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:21,830
inverse reinforcement.

16
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:22,440
>> I see, okay.

17
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,530
>> All right, so this if this
is reinforcement learning in

18
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:26,220
a nutshell, then-
>> It is?

19
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:27,940
>> Is it?
>> Yeah, environment and

20
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:28,880
rewards come in.

21
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,400
>> Yeah.
>> And then behavior comes out.

22
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,040
>> Right so
now I'm going to invert that, right?

23
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:33,110
So see how I change things?

24
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:34,100
I added the word, inverse.

25
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:37,530
I put an I in front of the RL and
I flip these two arrows.

26
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:39,230
So now in inverse
reinforcement learning,

27
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:43,160
the learner is experiencing
the environment and

28
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:45,800
externally from an external
source is experiencing behavior.

29
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:49,415
So this is coming from those same kinds
of demonstrations that you were talking

30
00:00:49,415 --> 00:00:53,000
about and from that it has to
actually infer a reward function.

31
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,715
So let's do this as an exercise.

32
00:00:55,715 --> 00:00:56,405
>> Okay, that would be kind of.

33
00:00:56,405 --> 00:00:57,321
>> Not a quiz.

34
00:00:57,321 --> 00:00:58,343
>> No, no that would be wrong.

35
00:00:58,343 --> 00:00:58,945
>> That would be wrong.
