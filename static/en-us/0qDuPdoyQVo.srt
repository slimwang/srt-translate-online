00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,330
So let's look at the example of blurring and frequencies a little bit.

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:05,440
Remember our peppers image from a while ago?

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:06,890
This was my original image.

4
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:10,310
We can blur this by a five by five Gaussian kernel.

5
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:11,880
You can see a little bit of blurriness.

6
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,850
It's not very exaggerated because our kernel is very small.

7
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:16,530
Now, I can just take these two images.

8
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:20,270
And if I was to subtract this image from the original,

9
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:23,710
I should figure out where all the high frequency information was, right?

10
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:26,010
And this is shown here, a dark image.

11
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:27,900
I don't know if you can see all the details.

12
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,320
But you can see all of the edges.

13
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,759
Because, if you remember, when we do Gaussian blurs,

14
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:35,130
that's the one point that we preserve a lot.

15
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:37,040
Because we look at information out there.

16
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,720
So while everything is blurred, the sharp edges remain.

17
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:45,140
And now, if I was to just do subtraction of the smooth minus the original,

18
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:47,870
we figure out where all the sharp information is.

19
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:50,770
Now, of course, this is one way of being able to

20
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:54,760
extract information about where all the high frequency information is.

21
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:57,610
And of course, this allows us to start paying attention just to

22
00:00:57,610 --> 00:00:59,290
high frequency information.

23
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:00,809
And we can run different processes on it.

24
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:05,740
So basically, the bottom line is, by doing all of this kind of stuff, we can now

25
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:11,700
specifically channel our efforts to improve quality of images, either at the low

26
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:16,170
frequency or the high frequency, and similarly, not just improve processing.

27
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:19,480
We can actually start putting in more attention to the details that

28
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,900
are available at high frequencies and

29
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:23,350
low frequencies if you do analysis like this.

30
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:26,440
And that was one of the major parts of us trying to look at

31
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,310
the frequency domain.
