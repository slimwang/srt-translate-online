00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:04,860
In lesson one, you saw a relationship between Height and Hand Length. And you

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:10,150
used my Hand length, 6.75 inches, to guess my height. Based on this, you

3
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:15,934
probably guessed that I'm not more than six feet, or 72 inches tall. But what

4
00:00:15,934 --> 00:00:19,584
if the data looked like this instead? Could we make a good guess about how tall

5
00:00:19,584 --> 00:00:24,088
I am? Not really. What makes this data have a stronger relationship than the

6
00:00:24,088 --> 00:00:28,335
other one? And what's one way to measure it? First of all, we can see if

7
00:00:28,335 --> 00:00:33,096
there's a direction to this relationship. This is probably true in personal

8
00:00:33,096 --> 00:00:38,104
relationships, too. In statistics, the direction of a relationship refers to

9
00:00:38,104 --> 00:00:43,364
how the y variable changes as x gets larger. In the case of Height and Hand

10
00:00:43,364 --> 00:00:47,380
Length, what happens as x, or Hand length, increases?
