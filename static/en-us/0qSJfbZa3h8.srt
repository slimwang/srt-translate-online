1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,340
For our first quiz, what I would like you to figure out for this genetics network here

2
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:12,040
is the largest group of genes that you can select so that every selected gene

3
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:15,380
is connected to every other selected gene.

4
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:21,230
What is the largest group of genes where every gene is connected to every other gene.

5
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:24,230
You've already seen that we can find a group of three genes where every gene is connected

6
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:27,710
to every other gene, but may be you can find a larger one.

7
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:34,750
The way I want you to answer this quiz is just to check off the genes that belong to this group.

8
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:38,670
Which genes do we have to select so that we have the largest possible group of genes

9
00:00:38,670 --> 99:59:59,999
where every gene is connected to every other gene.
