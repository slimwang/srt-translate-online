AVAudioRecorder knows that it
can call the audio recorder did

00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:08,240
finish recording function in our
code because our class conforms

00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,140
to the AVAudioRecorderDelegate protocol.

4
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:14,780
We can take a closer look at this

in the class definition, right-clicking,
and selecting jump to definition.

00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:25,117
Here you can see some a declaration code
for the AVAudioRecorderDelegate protocol

00:00:25,117 --> 00:00:29,500
and that function that we're talking
about audioRecorderDidFinishRecording.

00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:33,650
To go back you can select any of your
