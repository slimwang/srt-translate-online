An example of a distance vector routing protocol is the

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:06,150
routing information protocol or RIP. The first version of RIP

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:09,410
was defined in 1982 where edges had unit cost and

4
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:13,030
infinity. Where the count to infinity problem was 16. Table

5
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:17,050
refreshes occur every 30 seconds and when an entry changes,

6
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:19,070
it sends a copy of that update to all of

7
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:22,060
it's neighbors except for the one that induced the update.

8
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:25,150
This rule is sometimes called the split horizon rule. The small

9
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:27,520
value for infinity ensures that the count to infinity

10
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:30,300
doesn't take very long and every round has a time

11
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:34,130
out limit of 180 seconds. Which is basically reached, when

12
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:36,580
a router hasn't received an update from a next hop

13
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:40,570
for six 30 second periods. In practice, when a router

14
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:43,540
or link fails in RIP, things can often take minutes

15
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:46,660
to stabilize. So because of problems such as slow convergence

16
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:51,220
and count to infinity, protocol designers, look to, other alternatives.
