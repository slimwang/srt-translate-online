1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,580
So i mean here's an example of
just showing a binary image.

2
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:08,690
Okay, where you've got a circuit with
some leads that are connecting it and

3
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:11,640
some of those leads have shown up well
and some of them show not so well.

4
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:14,650
Or maybe some of these things are noise
and you want to get rid of them, and

5
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:18,350
here of course this is a notional
version of a binary image where you've

6
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:20,030
got ones and zeros.

7
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:23,240
So binary image analysis is
used in all sorts of things.

8
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:26,280
We're just showing you sort of document
inspection, but parts inspection.

9
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:30,060
So you've got a part and it's supposed
to have particular property to it and

10
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:32,670
you don't want to make sure there
are any holes that shouldn't be there or

11
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:35,430
the holes that are supposed to be there,
are there.

12
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:38,890
Mostly for two dimensional stuff,
also manufacturing.

13
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:41,870
You have some idea of what the images
are supposed to look like, but

14
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:44,490
it's basically, where is there stuff and
where is there not stuff,

15
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:45,210
is what matters.

16
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:47,310
And so
you can think of those as binary images.

17
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:50,780
And of course, document processing,
where the where basically,

18
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:54,250
if you think of it as just black
ink on a white background,

19
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:58,170
it might be very fine, but there's,
there's not really supposed to be grey.

20
00:00:58,170 --> 00:00:59,810
Now those of you that
know about anti-aliasing,

21
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:01,590
that has to do with limited resolution.

22
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:02,650
We're not going to talk about that.

23
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:05,480
We're just going to talk
about sort of binary images.
