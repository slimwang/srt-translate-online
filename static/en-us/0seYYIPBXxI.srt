00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,033
>> So to recap what we did, we found the deviation of each value from the mean.

2
00:00:05,033 --> 00:00:10,637
Here's the deviaton. And then we squared each deviation, which is the same as

3
00:00:10,637 --> 00:00:16,337
the area of these squares. Then we found the average area of the squares. And

4
00:00:16,337 --> 00:00:21,607
then we took the square root of this area to just find the length of the side,

5
00:00:21,607 --> 00:00:26,889
which is the standard deviation. The standard deviation is the most common

6
00:00:26,889 --> 00:00:32,275
measure of spread, and the symbol is the lower case Greek sigma. Remember that

7
00:00:32,275 --> 00:00:37,126
the upper case sigma is the sigma sum sign. Recall that the variance is

8
00:00:37,126 --> 00:00:42,643
basically the area of this average square deviation. So when we take the square

9
00:00:42,643 --> 00:00:46,244
root of the variance, we get the standard deviation.
