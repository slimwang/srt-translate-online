1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
This next assignment deals with primitive roots.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Your task will be to implement a function, primitive_roots,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
that takes in a small prime number and outputs a list of all the primitive roots of that number.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
In the ide, in addition to primitive roots, we have provided a modular exponentiation function

5
00:00:18,000 --> 99:59:59,999
similar to what was used in lecture and two simple test cases to use.
