1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:05,594
Let's do another example. This is Santa Clara County in California. And let's

2
00:00:05,594 --> 00:00:11,853
say that the mean rent for apartments is 1,830 for all types of units. A

3
00:00:11,853 --> 00:00:15,633
certain rental company called Rental California owns and rents a lot of

4
00:00:15,633 --> 00:00:20,268
apartments. And they want to know if the amount they're renting it for is

5
00:00:20,268 --> 00:00:25,570
significantly different than this population mean. So they examine a random

6
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:31,806
sample of their own units of size 25. They find that on average, they rent each

7
00:00:31,806 --> 00:00:38,958
unit out for 1,700. And the sample standard deviation was $200. You're going to

8
00:00:38,958 --> 00:00:43,400
conduct a one sample t-test for them. Here are the null and alternative

9
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,990
hypothesis, and remember, they're concerned with whether or not it's

10
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:50,710
significantly different. Even though they found that it's less, this will still

11
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:57,385
be the alternative hypothesis. And they also want an alpha level of 0.05. First

12
00:00:57,385 --> 00:01:03,350
of all, find a t critical values for a two-tailed test at alpha equals 0.05.

13
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:05,300
Put them here and here.
