That's right. You should never far-future cache the manifest

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:06,610
file itself. Cat videos, of course, never go out

3
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:09,590
of style, so that's fine, but if you far-future

4
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:12,450
cache the manifest file, you're going to have a really

5
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:15,130
hard time getting the user's system to update the

6
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:18,310
cache. Your users will get locked into that set of

7
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:22,230
cache files. Unless the user specifically goes in, clears

8
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:26,721
out their cache, the manifest file will never be re-downloaded.
