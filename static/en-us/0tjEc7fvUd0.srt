1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:04,928
This would simplify to 10 times the square root of 2, or 10 root 2. The key

2
00:00:04,928 --> 00:00:08,479
ideal is to remember that multiplication is between the numbers and the radical

3
00:00:08,479 --> 00:00:13,769
sign. We can rewrite the square root 50 as the square root of 25 times 2. Then

4
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:18,480
we use our product rule to break this radical up into two separate radicals. We

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,410
know the square root of 25 is 5, so we have 2 times 5 which is 10, times the

6
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:28,628
square root of 2. We don't want to add these numbers together, since

7
00:00:28,628 --> 00:00:32,910
multiplication was really between the radicals and the numbers to begin with.

8
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:37,470
So that's why the answer wasn't 7 root 2. It might be easy to think that way.

9
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:41,143
But just remember what's actually going on between the numbers.
