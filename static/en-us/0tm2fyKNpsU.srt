1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
The answer is 5/6 for A and 1/6 for B.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
To see, let's call this property over here, X, and we can now solve for the equation

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:22,000
that in the stationary case, the property of A is 0.9 x the property of A before + 0.5,

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
x the property of B which is 1- X.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
If you solve this, this gives us 0.4X + 0.5

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
or put differently,

7
00:00:30,000 --> 99:59:59,999
0.6X = 0.5. That is the same as saying X = 5/6, which is what I wrote over here.
