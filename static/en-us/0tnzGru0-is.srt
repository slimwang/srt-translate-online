00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:04,437
Lets continue implementing the addChoice method. You've already done the first

2
00:00:04,437 --> 00:00:08,032
part, adding a new choice to the list of choices, now if this parameter here

3
00:00:08,032 --> 00:00:11,513
says that it was the correct choice then we should set the answer, and the

4
00:00:11,513 --> 00:00:15,167
answer should be a string 1, 2, 3 or 4 depending on whether this was the first,

5
00:00:15,167 --> 00:00:22,482
second, third or fourth choice. How do you know which choice it was? It's not

6
00:00:22,482 --> 00:00:25,898
passed as a parameter to add choice, but you can tell by looking at how many

7
00:00:25,898 --> 00:00:30,914
elements are already in the choices array. Of course, when you ask the choices

8
00:00:30,914 --> 00:00:34,610
array for it's size, that's an integer, answers are strings, just concatenate

9
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:39,834
with the empty string to change the integer to a string. And now you're

10
00:00:39,834 --> 00:00:43,575
going to have a bit of a challenge. When you have a choice question object, it

11
00:00:43,575 --> 00:00:48,127
has two instance variables. The correct answer, this instance variable is

12
00:00:48,127 --> 00:00:52,974
inherited from the question super class and the list of choices. You will want

13
00:00:52,974 --> 00:00:56,160
to set the answer to a string, such as this string 3, but how can you get at

14
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,982
it? The answer is an instance variable of the question class and it's private,

15
00:01:00,982 --> 00:01:04,622
no one can access anything private in the question class accept the methods of

16
00:01:04,622 --> 00:01:10,020
the question class themselves. Choice question extends question but that

17
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:14,537
doesn't give it any special privileges. It cannot access this instance field

18
00:01:14,537 --> 00:01:18,063
any more than anyone else. So that's the challenge you need to overcome. And

19
00:01:18,063 --> 00:01:21,327
the point is, of course, that just like everyone else, you will need to use the

20
00:01:21,327 --> 00:01:27,163
public interface off the question class. Go ahead, give it a try, and implement

21
00:01:27,163 --> 00:01:29,991
the add choice method.
