1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,230
This situation is reminiscent of
the network of specialized suppliers to

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:05,380
a manufacturing company.

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,260
One makes seats, but

4
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:13,450
not radiators, while another
makes dashboards, but not tires.

5
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:18,360
But somehow it all comes together
seamlessly to produce a great car,

6
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:22,510
those industries long ago recognized the
need for automation to help coordinate

7
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:28,030
their supplier network starting with
the automobile industry in the 1980s.

8
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:32,369
Until very recently, and this really
only started to change as a result of

9
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:35,510
the federal programs we'll
discuss in this lesson.

10
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:38,610
The healthcare industry
tried to operate its complex

11
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:41,850
care network using paper records and
fax machines.

12
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:46,686
Name an example of a specific,
non-healthcare,

13
00:00:46,686 --> 00:00:49,810
non-automotive corporate success story

14
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:54,620
in using information technology to
manage a complex logistics network.
