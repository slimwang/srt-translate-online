00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:03,640
You should have one goal, to make images look

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:06,490
as beautiful as they can on the user's device, while

3
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:09,660
using as little bandwidth as possible. Now this last

4
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:13,900
point is critical. Network bandwidth is most assuredly not free,

5
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:17,100
particularly on mobile devices. We'll learn more about that

6
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,490
in the next lesson on performance, and in our final

7
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:22,990
lesson on offline. If you didn't care about bandwidth,

8
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:26,710
you could just serve massively large images all the time.

9
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:29,510
But a full screen image for a ChromeBook Pixel

10
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:33,145
is 4.1 megapixels, whereas on a Nexus 4, it's only

11
00:00:33,145 --> 00:00:38,320
0.9 megapixels. IPhone 5 is only 0.7. The best size

12
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,290
for images is very different on each of these devices.
