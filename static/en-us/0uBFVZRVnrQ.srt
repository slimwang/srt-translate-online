Hi! Welcome to Office Hours for Unit 2.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Unfortunately, Steve couldn't be here this week.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
He is at a wedding rehearsal right now.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
So I'm going to handle your questions for him.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I already talked to him about them,

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
and let's just dive right in.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
We had a lot of great questions, and there was a lot of overlap with them.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
So the first one that I'm going to talk about is about html templates:

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
what they are, how to use them, when you should use them, and all of that.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
The html templates we're using are called "Jinja". That's a templating engine.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
It's included in AppEngine, which is nice because you don't have to install anything extra.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Django templating engine is also included if you'd like to try that out--

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
at least according to the docs it's included in the templating engine.

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
We haven't used that, and we're not going to be going over that.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
We weren't planning on going over templates a whole lot,

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
but it sounds like there is quite a bit of demand for that,

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
so we'll try to put something together.

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm going to link to the Jinja docs in the supplementary material under the videos.

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
So by the time you see this, they should be there.

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Templates are a way to organize your html in a way that's easier than string substitution.

21
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
String substitution can get a little hairy once you get very large html files,

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,000
and this helps you manage them--put them into separate files and folders--

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
and Jinja is basically glorified string substitution

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
except that it helps you handle separating those out into multiple files and folders

25
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
so that you don't have to worry about it as much.

26
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
But we're going to be going into that in more depth later on.

27
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
So to everyone who asked that, thank you. Apparently, there is a lot of interest.
