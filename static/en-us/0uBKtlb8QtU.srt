1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Let me take my example world

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
and apply value iteration in a quiz.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
As before, assume the value is initialized as

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
+100 and -100 for the absorbing states

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
and 0 everywhere else.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
And let me make the assumption that our transition probability is deterministic.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
That is, if I execute the east action of this state over here

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
with probability 1 item over here,

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
if I assume the north action over here, probability 1,

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I will find myself in the same state as before.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
There is no uncertainty anymore.

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
That's really important for now, just for this one quiz.

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'll also assume gamma equals 1,

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
just to make things a little bit simpler.

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
And the cost over here is -3 unless you reach an absorbing state.

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
What I'd like to know, after a single backup,

17
00:00:47,000 --> 99:59:59,999
what's the value of A3?
