00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,097
Here is a filled out version of our table. I simply plugged in each value of x,

2
00:00:04,097 --> 00:00:07,171
into either of our two functions over here, to fill out these first two

3
00:00:07,171 --> 00:00:13,104
columns. Then to fill out the last column pq of x. I just multiplied the two

4
00:00:13,104 --> 00:00:17,278
numbers in the cells adjacent to it together. Negative one times five is

5
00:00:17,278 --> 00:00:21,849
negative five. Zero times three is zero, and so on and so forth.
