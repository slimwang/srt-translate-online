00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,510
So Pete, I love the way breakpoints and

2
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:05,700
media queries are giving us
control over our CSS styles.

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:09,430
You know, you've had a lot of experience
in the past building responsive sites.

4
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:13,150
What patterns or general strategies
have you found to be the most useful?

5
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:13,720
>> You're right.

6
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:15,820
There are several great
patterns out there.

7
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:18,740
But I'll start with probably
the most simple and

8
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:20,510
one of the most important ones.

9
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:25,840
The grid fluid system,
with the grid fluid system columns end

10
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:30,520
up wrapping to the next line as the
browser width starts getting smaller.

11
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:34,060
There's a lot of good examples out there
that you can try like Bootstrap or

12
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:38,560
the 960 pixel grid layout system,
that are easy to use and

13
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:41,060
have everything done for you already.

14
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:43,650
>> Huh, well, that does sound like
a pretty nice, flexible strategy.

15
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:46,300
You know, I did a little searching,
and I found that

16
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:51,130
the HTML 5 Rocks page is an example
of a site that uses a fluid grid.

17
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:54,120
Notice how when I shrink the screen,
the articles that are three columns

18
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,840
across in this main section
shift down to a single column.

19
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,070
Also, if you're unfamiliar
with grid-based layouts, or

20
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:03,610
you think you'd have a hard
time designing one of your own,

21
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:07,320
in the Intro to HTML and
CSS course we cover grid-based layouts.

22
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,110
