00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:04,560
Okay, that's a good introduction to indexes, but there is more and

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:09,430
in the section we will cover composite indexes. Remember the single property

3
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:14,790
index we looked at, that had the city as to value. A single property index is

4
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:20,440
also called a built-in index. Data store can in many cases combine results

5
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:25,830
from different built in indexes to provide a response to a query, but there

6
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:30,580
are cases where this is not possible. That's when we need a composite index.

7
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:35,740
In fact we have already used composite indexes in conference central for

8
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:40,780
this query. Retrieve all conferences, filter by city and topic. And

9
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:46,690
sort by name. This is a composite index, because the built in indexes for city,

10
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:52,950
topic, and name, cannot be combined to generate the result. For this to work,

11
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:57,550
an index table consisting of multiple values and combination must be created.

12
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:02,810
This is exactly what a composite index is. So how are composite indexes built?

13
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:09,510
There are two different ways. The first way is to add an index to an index file.

14
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:12,440
[UNKNOWN] a little bit differently depending on which language you use, so

15
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:17,030
you will see how to do this in one of the exercises. The other way is to

16
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:21,800
actually run your application locally on your development server. In this case,

17
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:25,520
if App Engine encounters a query that requires the composite index,

18
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,870
it will automatically update the index file.

19
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:32,170
When you later deploy App Engine, this index file will be uploaded as well.

20
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:36,980
So it will also exist when executing on App Engine. All right, it's time for

21
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:39,530
an exercise where you will explore composite indexes
