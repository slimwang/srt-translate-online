00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,391
The answer is c, this red curve. To figure this out, we could plug a few values

2
00:00:04,391 --> 00:00:08,747
for c into our equation and find the corresponding values for p. Those c and p

3
00:00:08,747 --> 00:00:13,339
values will be the coordinates of points on this graph. So, this is interesting.

4
00:00:13,339 --> 00:00:17,692
As we could have guessed from our equation, since we have a c squared term, we

5
00:00:17,692 --> 00:00:21,792
have a parabola. This is going to give us a great opportunity to use some of the

6
00:00:21,792 --> 00:00:25,223
skills that we learned in the last few lessons, and also some new ones.
