Now, for a real quiz.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Why is simplifying test cases important in debugging.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Is this so because a simplified test case is easier to communicate?

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Or is this so because a simplified test case usually means smaller fixes?

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Or because it usually means smaller program states?

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Or because it usually means fewer program steps?

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Check all that apply. Over to you.
