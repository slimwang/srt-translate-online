Hi, I'm Matt Sonic.

2
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:03,760
And I'll be your instructor for
this course.

3
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:04,734
And this is.

4
00:00:04,734 --> 00:00:07,040
And he'll be your instructor later on.

5
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,710
&gt;&gt; Before we get started we'd like
to show you the final project,

6
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:11,280
which is called Modern Apartment.

7
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:14,770
&gt;&gt; Modern Apartment is
a virtual reality environment,

8
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:16,810
built using the Unity editor.

9
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:18,749
&gt;&gt; Along the way,
you'll learn how to place objects.

10
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:24,870
&gt;&gt; Yep, you'll also learn how to
rotate them and scale them, as well.

11
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:30,100
&gt;&gt; You'll also be able to change
their color by using materials,

12
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:30,780
just like this.

13
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:33,790
&gt;&gt; It's pretty cool, right?

14
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:37,700
At the very end, we'll learn how to set
the mood using some dramatic lighting,

15
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:38,410
something like this.

16
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:42,190
&gt;&gt; And then get to view that
within our cardboard VR viewers.

17
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:43,570
Cool, right?

18
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:44,170
&gt;&gt; Let's get started.
