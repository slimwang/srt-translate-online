1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,500
Let's do this exercise together.

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:05,140
Derrick, what labels
did you come up with?

3
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:08,890
>> So just like I tried to transfer
the vocabulary we used to describe

4
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:12,650
the relationships between shapes and
a figure, I decided to try and transfer

5
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:17,660
the vocabulary we used to describe
transformations between the two figures.

6
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:20,560
So just like X was
unchanged between A and

7
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,840
B, r is unchanged between C and five.

8
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,520
In this case, s is also unchanged.

9
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:27,570
It moved, but

10
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:30,910
that's captured in the relationship
between the shapes in figure five.

11
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:34,320
The shape itself hasn't changed,
so it's unchanged.

12
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,930
Just like dot z disappeared,
dot t also disappeared so

13
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:40,610
I marked it deleted like we did before.

14
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:42,210
>> Good, that seems like a good answer.
