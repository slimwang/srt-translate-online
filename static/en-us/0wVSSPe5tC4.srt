00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,398
We actually have a bunch of pairs of faces that have the same area. Each face

2
00:00:04,398 --> 00:00:08,887
has the same area as the one opposite it. So we have two faces whose area is 3x

3
00:00:08,887 --> 00:00:15,072
times 2x. Two that are 3x times x plus 10. And another two that are 2x times x

4
00:00:15,072 --> 00:00:20,504
plus 10x. Let's multiply all of this out. After a few steps of simplification,

5
00:00:20,504 --> 00:00:25,073
we end up with a surface area of 22x squared plus 100x.
