1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,660
So we're here again with Paul.

2
00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:04,740
Paul, why is it important to have
interactivity in your prototypes?

3
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:08,020
>> So it's important to have
interactivity in your prototypes because

4
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:10,020
one thing that I often see in demos or

5
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:13,820
in presentations is that I want
to say hey, here is my prototype.

6
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:17,080
And unfortunately,
this doesn't give you a really good

7
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:19,520
understanding of how somebody's
actually going to use your prototype.

8
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,980
I'm not the user,
you are not your user, right.

9
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:27,130
And so if I use this prototype,
I am an expert in it,

10
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:28,970
I know how to get good results.

11
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:30,910
If I do this.

12
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:32,460
>> I take this.
>> The person, right, and

13
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:35,510
you can actually use it and
play with it and interact with it.

14
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:37,590
You have never seen this before.

15
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:40,450
>> Right.
>> So you're going to be a much better

16
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:43,670
representation of how an end user
is actually going to use this.

17
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:44,360
>> Right.
>> Right.

18
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:48,390
The other thing, if there's really
nobody else around what you can do is

19
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:52,350
get really drunk and
then use your prototype and

20
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:55,890
that's going to be actually
a fairly good approximation about

21
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:59,670
some random person on the internet,
using your device or using your website.

22
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:01,260
>> Hm-mm.
>> There are actually a few different

23
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:05,459
services that you can go online and find
where you will have a usability expert

24
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:09,070
get drunk and review your usability and
send you a report on it.

25
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:09,930
>> Awesome.

26
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:10,620
Thank you Paul.
>> You're welcome.
