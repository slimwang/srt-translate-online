1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,680
To use Memcache using the Java native API, first

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:06,610
you get the Memcache service. You'll need to import the

3
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:09,710
Memcache service and the Memcache service factory into your

4
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:13,810
project and then you just use the getMemcacheService method on

5
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:16,570
the factory to get the Memcache service. Then to

6
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:19,700
put an entry into Memcache, you need a key. And

7
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:22,430
of course, a value to put and you just

8
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:25,420
call the put method. And to get the value out

9
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:27,800
of memcache, you need to know the key and

10
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:31,450
you just call the get method on memcacheService. If there

11
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:36,080
is no value in memcache with that key then null

12
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:39,710
is returned. Setting the announcement is something that we don't

13
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:42,670
want to expose through end points. We don't want other

14
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:44,970
people to be able to set the announcements for our

15
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:48,140
application. So we'll use a servlet in this case and

16
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:50,440
protect the URL for the servlet so that the app

17
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:54,770
itself can set the announcement but no one else can. Actually developers for the

18
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:58,330
application will be able to set the announcement but no one else will. So

19
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:02,990
you see here I implemented set announcement as a serve let.

20
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:09,435
Extends HttpServlet and I implements the doGet method. So here's

21
00:01:09,435 --> 00:01:15,350
where I imported the MemcacheService and the MemcacheServiceFactory.

22
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:18,100
Here's where I get the MemcacheService and here's where I

23
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:22,050
put the value into memcache. Notice that this method doesn't

24
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:26,120
set the response so we set the response status to

25
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:29,540
204 which means that no response is expected. So if

26
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:31,600
you come here in the browser just stay on the

27
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,540
same page where you are. All this method does is

28
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:37,140
generate the announcement and save it in the memcache, it

29
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:40,510
doesn't return it. When you use servlets in an app

30
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:45,170
engine application you need to configure them in web.xml.

31
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:47,540
So here's some mapping I added to web.xml for

32
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:51,080
the get announcement servlet. So here the servlet name

33
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:54,180
is set announcement servlet. And then here is the

34
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:58,020
class that implements the servlet and notice that I

35
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:00,410
put it in the servlet package. And then you

36
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:03,190
map the servlet name to the URL where it

37
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:05,640
gets called. So in this case, we're going to call

38
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:09,440
the servlet by going to crons/setannouncement. I also

39
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,550
defined a security constraint for my servlet because

40
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:14,130
I want to make sure that no body

41
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:17,210
except developers for this application can trigger the

42
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:20,500
servlet. How to find the resource name and

43
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:23,900
then the URL pattern that I'm protecting. Here

44
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:28,310
I've specifically protected /crons/setannouncement or I could just

45
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:31,420
protect everything under the slash crons path and

46
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:36,910
to specify the only admin that is developers of the application can trigger this

47
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:42,520
url. I set the role name to be admin. Right, wanted it so that any

48
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:45,910
logged in user could trigger it and all I would do is specify the

49
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:49,220
role name as asterisks but I don't.

50
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:51,270
I definitely want to restrict access to admins.
