1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:05,506
So now let's look at the whole schematic of a simple charge couple device.

2
00:00:08,376 --> 00:00:12,295
Here I'm basically showing an animation of each and

3
00:00:12,295 --> 00:00:15,390
every layer of a charge couple device.

4
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:19,680
We are going to basically now peel this back out as an onion, and

5
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,070
look at each one of them separately.

6
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:22,810
But of course,

7
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:28,310
point is, light is coming down this way and hitting a variety of layers.

8
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:30,480
And then, of course, it hits the bottom layer,

9
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,000
where actually the current is stored.

10
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:38,130
Let's again, look at this by peeling the onion layer by layer.

11
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:41,980
So the first layer basically has a little bit of an optical flavor.

12
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:44,930
It's what is referred to as a micro lens.

13
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:47,960
What in essence it does, it captures the light and

14
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:51,800
directs it towards the light sensitive areas beneath it.

15
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:54,846
So when light hits these types of things,

16
00:00:54,846 --> 00:00:59,960
it focuses it down to the next layer so then nothing is lost.

17
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,580
The next layer is referred to as the hot mirror.

18
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:05,140
This is where some of the simple filtering is done.

19
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:08,540
So in the case of the film, this saw the example of a UV filter.

20
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:10,070
Well this is somewhat similar.

21
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:13,440
Basically it lets visible light pass, but

22
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:16,430
reflects light in the invisible spectrum.

23
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,598
And basically doesn't pre, it prevents it from hitting the sensors below.

24
00:01:21,598 --> 00:01:26,740
So this simple sort of filtering and prevents the unnecessary light to hit.

25
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:29,650
Of course, different types of cameras would do different things.

26
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:32,790
So for example, if you wanted to build a UV camera,

27
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:34,450
this would not be filtering out the UV light.

28
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:36,830
In fact it would be amplifying it.

29
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:39,500
This is what's referred to as a color filter.

30
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,580
Remember light has lots of constituent colors.

31
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:44,650
Most of the time we try to represent them or

32
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:47,170
at least capture them in RGB format.

33
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:49,770
And that's what we're going to try to understand how to do here.

34
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:53,970
So in essence, the photo diodes that are below it are actually color blind.

35
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:56,550
They basically want to capture the intensity.

36
00:01:56,550 --> 00:02:01,670
So this is where we kind of start now looking at and separating out the colors.

37
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:04,910
This is usually referred to as a Bayer Array.

38
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:07,100
And we'll talk about Bayer Arrays in a bit.

39
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:12,270
Basically what it does, it takes a color and separates the light into red,

40
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:12,970
green, and blue.

41
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:17,420
And, once it's been ordered into red, green, and blue it hits

42
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:21,280
the photo diodes that are below which are then measured the intensity of it.

43
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:26,210
Of course, this pattern is unique and knowing this pattern is

44
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:29,656
essential because it'll tell us how to be able to convert the value from,

45
00:02:29,656 --> 00:02:31,730
in this case, two greens, red and

46
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:35,880
a blue to figure out what would the value at this point of the image.

47
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:38,300
So as noted, these are the photo diodes.

48
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:42,890
This is exactly where the light energy that now actually is hitting each one of

49
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:47,720
these, is converted to electrons and carries a strong negative charge.

50
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:52,930
The final layer is the Well, or sometimes referred to as the depletion layer.

51
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:56,700
This is where electrons are collected and usually there is a processor that

52
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:00,600
charges the photo diodes with a positive charge, and then of course all

53
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:04,270
the negative charges basically are stored and collected on this layer.

54
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:07,140
So in essence, when you're pressing a shutter,

55
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:12,210
what you're doing is of course opening the shutter.

56
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:14,690
And also giving a charge to this device so

57
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:16,940
that can it capture all of these stuff.

58
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:20,900
In case of a chemical film, all you need to do is open the shutter and

59
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:23,350
that's when exactly the storage happens.

60
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:26,280
And of course, when the storage happens, you move the film across.

61
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,150
In this one, all of the stored, captured off, and

62
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:30,370
we'll talk about that in a bit, too.

63
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:34,030
So in essence, we peeled this whole onion and

64
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:38,130
we saw all the details of how light goes all the way and then ends up

65
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:42,490
as a stored electrical set of values which are then converted to pixels.
