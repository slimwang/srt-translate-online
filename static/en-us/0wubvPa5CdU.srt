1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The answer is our initial constraint would touch this guy over here.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
The one to second motion touches these things over here.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
The second to third, these guys, and then the landmark observation over here

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
puts something between x0 and the landmark

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
that sits here, here, here, here again, and here.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
This observation over here puts something between x2 and the landmark--

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
these guys over here and the guys over here.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
That means we have only the following places that are still 0.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
This means there is no direct constraint between x2 and x0.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
That is, there is no direct motion information between these guys,

11
00:00:39,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and there is no direct constraint between x1 and L, which is this guy is missing over here.
