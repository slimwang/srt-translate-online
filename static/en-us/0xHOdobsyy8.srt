00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,848
One more practice finding the vertex of a parabola from its equation. Where is

2
00:00:04,848 --> 00:00:09,815
the vertex of y equals the quantity x minus 7 squared plus 5? Think about the

3
00:00:09,815 --> 00:00:14,423
form that this equation is in right now, and think about what it needs to be in,

4
00:00:14,423 --> 00:00:16,392
in order for us to find a vertex.
