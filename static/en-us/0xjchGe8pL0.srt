1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,102
So now that we have seen
what the cache line is and

2
00:00:03,102 --> 00:00:05,941
what its size does let's
do a quiz about that.

3
00:00:05,941 --> 00:00:10,888
So which of these are not good
line sizes in a 2 kB cache?

4
00:00:10,888 --> 00:00:17,860
1 byte, 32 bytes, 48 bytes,
64 bytes And 1 kB.

5
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:18,850
Again, we are looking for

6
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:23,410
those that are not good line
sizes in a cache of 2 kB size.
