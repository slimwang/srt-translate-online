00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:04,750
In this lesson, I want to introduce
you to the concept of video textures.

2
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:08,150
Video textures basically takes
the concept of what we have learned in

3
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:09,490
images, that is, looking for

4
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:12,970
textures in the spatial domain,
something repeating over an image.

5
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:18,730
For example, like a, a pattern of some
sort could be grass or could be water.

6
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:21,200
Now, in this instance,
we're going to take this concept and

7
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,410
apply it to the domain of video.

8
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:25,172
How does one process and

9
00:00:25,172 --> 00:00:29,810
analyze a sequence of images that
have flowing water, moving grass, and

10
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:33,490
other types of repeating phenomenon,
natural phenomenon like this?

11
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:36,660
And you learn actually how to
synthesize novel versions of this

12
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:40,800
by just doing a simple bit of
analysis on a small bit of video.

13
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,960
You're also going to have fun
experimenting with this in one of

14
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:43,700
the assignments.
