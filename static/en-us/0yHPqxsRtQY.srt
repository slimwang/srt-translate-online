1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Now we look at different harvest rates--2.0, 2.5, 3.0 times 10⁵ tons per year.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
The middle one happens to be the same 2.5 * 10⁵ tons per year.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
The question is will the amount of fish eventually decay to 0.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Do we have a strong issue with over fishing?

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
This is the quiz for you--what about the amount of fish for the blue harvest rate--

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:31,000
will it never shrink to 0, does it depend on our circumstances whether or not it shrinks to 0,

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
will it almost surely decrease to 0, or will it even surely decrease to 0.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
The same for the hour's rate of 2.5 * 10⁵ tons per year and the same

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
for the harvest rate of 2.0 * 10⁵ tons per year.

10
00:00:47,000 --> 99:59:59,999
This is going to lead us to the concept of maximum sustainable yield.
