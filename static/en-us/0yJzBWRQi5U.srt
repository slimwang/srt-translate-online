00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,290
Now, that we are armed with the knowledge of how d3 binds data and

2
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:09,450
how to work with enter selection, let us recreate the dimple JS chart in d3,

3
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:13,530
and then extend it to add further context.

4
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:16,200
Here we are back in the terminal.

5
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:22,010
And before we can see our chart, we have to run a HTTP server.

6
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:28,840
Again, I'm going to be using the python built in, simple HTTP server.

7
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:32,159
And we can see here, it's serving up our current folder.

8
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:35,044
Local host port 8000.

9
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:37,630
And as you can see here.

10
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:43,070
We have our world cup attendance scatter and line plot that we created in lesson

11
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:49,220
two where attendance is on the y-axis, and the year is on the x axis.

12
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:53,030
And each of these circles accurately represents the total attendance for

13
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:55,450
the World Cup held in that year.

14
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:58,720
Going back to our Sublime text window,

15
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:03,880
I want to step through the Dimple.js chart creation code here, and replace,

16
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:09,480
line by line, what Dimple.js does for us with native D3 itself.

17
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:15,250
One thing you'll notice is that even simple things, such as creating the chart

18
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:24,120
object or adding a y axis in D3, will end up being much more verbose.

19
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:29,380
Then there are in Dimple.js, but we'll have much more flexibility on what our

20
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:32,300
chart looks like and how to customize it.
