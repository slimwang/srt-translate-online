00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Okay, let's think through this a bit.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,500
So, first of all, at each single branch, we have four possible choices.

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:11,000
So we can take this branch, this branch, this branch, or this branch.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
So we have four choices, a total of n/3 times.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:24,000
So that's 4 * 4, times on and on, times 4, a total of n/3 times.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Now I had you pull out to the nth power here, so let's go ahead and do that.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So this is really 4^1/3 to the nth power, and that is approximately 1.587 to the nth power.
