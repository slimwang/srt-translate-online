Hi, and welcome to
Introduction to Data Analysis.

2
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:05,689
I'm Caroline and
I'll be your instructor for the course.

3
00:00:05,689 --> 00:00:09,160
Now a data analyst is someone who
uses data to answer questions, and

4
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:11,390
that's exactly what you'll
be doing in this course.

5
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:14,290
You'll tackle questions like what
makes students more likely to

6
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:18,500
submit their projects, or what countries
around the world have the highest and

7
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:22,220
lowest employment rates, and how does
the country you live in compare?

8
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:25,890
Or how the subway ridership varied
by location, time of day and

9
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:28,020
weather conditions, and many more.

10
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:30,780
For each data set you'll have the chance
to pose your own questions and

11
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:32,720
perform your own investigations.

12
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:35,950
Along the way you'll learn to use some
libraries that make data analysis

13
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:36,980
a lot easier.

14
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:40,710
Specifically, you'll work with NumPy,
Pandas and Matplotlib.

15
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:44,000
But you'll start off analyzing
data using pure Python.

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,720
Now you won't need any experience
with data analysis in order to

17
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:47,790
take this course.

18
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:49,830
But you will need to be
comfortable programming in Python.

19
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:54,670
You should be familiar with things like
loops, functions, lists, dictionaries,

20
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:56,600
objects, and things like that.

21
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,470
If you need to learn more
about any of those topics,

22
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:00,200
check out the links in
the instructor notes.

23
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:00,930
Now let's get started.
