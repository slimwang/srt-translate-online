1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,922
Now we're going to do
something really cool.

2
00:00:01,922 --> 00:00:06,780
I'm going to show you how to build
a parameterized model from data.

3
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:09,350
What do I mean by parameterized model?

4
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:13,593
This is an example of a parameterized
model that you're probably familiar with

5
00:00:13,593 --> 00:00:14,426
from algebra.

6
00:00:14,426 --> 00:00:21,556
It's a function of x and
it has these two parameters, m and b.

7
00:00:21,556 --> 00:00:26,490
In fact, as you're probably aware,
this is the equation of a line.

8
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:30,890
So m and
b are the parameters of that line.

9
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:36,554
Now for convenience in our
code instead of using m and

10
00:00:36,554 --> 00:00:42,490
b, I'm going to use C0 and
C1, just to be consistent.

11
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:45,870
Let me motivate this with an example.

12
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:48,680
Let's suppose we have some
data from an experiment.

13
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:52,190
Now this can work for
many sorts of experiments, but for now,

14
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:56,810
let's assume we've taken some
measurements of humidity, and we've

15
00:00:56,810 --> 00:01:01,650
observed on those particular days we
measured the humidity how much it rains.

16
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:06,130
So each dot here represents one day and
one sample of data.

17
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:11,325
So on this date, it was this humid,
and it rained that much.

18
00:01:11,325 --> 00:01:15,480
Now we probably have lots more data,
one for each day.

19
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:19,490
When we look at this data, we see
there's a kind of relationship here.

20
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:23,900
And our intuition is maybe that
it could be fitted by a line.

21
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:25,550
Just sort of by eyeballing it,

22
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:31,430
looks like the line might look about
like that, and so our parameters here

23
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:36,938
coefficient 0 is equivalent
to the slope here,

24
00:01:36,938 --> 00:01:42,100
and coefficient 1 is the y intercept.

25
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:48,040
So our task is to find C sub 0 and

26
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:53,650
C sub 1 that provide the equation for
this line that best fits the data.

27
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:58,646
The question here is,
how do we reframe this problem so

28
00:01:58,646 --> 00:02:02,239
that it makes sense for our minimizer?

29
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:06,464
What is it we're trying to minimize?

30
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:12,340
So restating the problem, suppose we
have our original data points here, and

31
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:18,140
we're trying to discover the equation
of a line that best fits those points.

32
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:23,170
Suppose this blue line is a candidate
line and we want to evaluate it.

33
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:25,230
Is this good or bad?

34
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:28,414
So the equation for that line is,

35
00:02:28,414 --> 00:02:34,260
our first coefficient times x
plus the second coefficient.

36
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:41,690
And what the minimizer is going to
do is it's going to vary this C0 and

37
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:47,250
C1 to try and minimize something.

38
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:50,350
And so
we have to come up with an equation that

39
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:56,539
gets lower in value as this
line better fits the data.

40
00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:00,420
What should we use for that equation?

41
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:03,990
So here's one step towards
solving this problem.

42
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:07,530
We can take a look at each one
of our original data points and

43
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:13,270
observe how far away it is from
this line that we're evaluating.

44
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:17,240
Let's call each of these distances e.

45
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:22,790
So e sub 0 is that one,
e sub 1 is that one.

46
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:26,980
Can we come up with
an equation in terms of e or

47
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:30,420
error that gets us to this solution?
