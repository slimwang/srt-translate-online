1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,240
That sums up the different things
wanted to talk about in triple C.

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:05,790
So we talked about
coordinating between agents.

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:08,550
We talked about communicating
between agents.

4
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:11,434
And we talked about coaching or
kind of teaching,

5
00:00:11,434 --> 00:00:15,357
instructing between agents to convey
an idea of a reward function.

6
00:00:15,357 --> 00:00:15,884
So what do you think?

7
00:00:15,884 --> 00:00:17,295
Are you ready to through and

8
00:00:17,295 --> 00:00:20,550
kind of fill in the topics that
we touched on in each of these?

9
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:25,625
>> I'm going to say no and-
>> I don't think that's on the script.

10
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:28,605
You're supposed to say yes, and
we're supposed to go through it.

11
00:00:28,605 --> 00:00:30,920
>> I'll tell you why because I
think this is really cool, and

12
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:32,490
I think we're giving it short shrift.

13
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:36,051
I think there are several more examples
that we could go through that would

14
00:00:36,051 --> 00:00:39,384
really kind of drive home this point,
particularly the coaching and

15
00:00:39,384 --> 00:00:40,740
communication point.

16
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:41,540
And I think we should do it.

17
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:42,769
So let's do some more of these.

18
00:00:42,769 --> 00:00:45,910
>> So what you're saying is you
didn't think I lectured enough, and

19
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:48,500
that I should now on the spot
make up more material.

20
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:49,660
That's kind of tough.

21
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:52,320
>> You don't have to
make up more material.

22
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,940
I mean, the material is out there,

23
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:56,858
you can just very easily describe
some stuff that we know about.

24
00:00:56,858 --> 00:00:59,367
How about doing that?

25
00:00:59,367 --> 00:01:00,543
No?

26
00:01:00,543 --> 00:01:04,075
>> [LAUGH] I'd rather not, I mean I
feel like we covered the topic and

27
00:01:04,075 --> 00:01:05,521
we should just go with it.

28
00:01:05,521 --> 00:01:08,361
>> Okay, I think I can prove to you
that we haven't covered the topic.

29
00:01:08,361 --> 00:01:12,430
And the way I could prove it to you is
simply by covering more of the topic.

30
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:13,010
>> Okay, that's fair.

31
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:14,630
>> All right, so let's do that.

32
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:17,010
So you know what, here,
I'll make it easy for you.

33
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:19,710
I have two or three things in mind that
I think that we could talk about that

34
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:22,340
would really kind of
drive the point home, and

35
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:25,020
I will talk about them happily.

36
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:26,040
>> All right, I appreciate that,

37
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,680
and I would be very interested to hear
what you have to say about these topics.

38
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,600
So why don't we stop for now, and

39
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,490
then you can go research those topics,
and we'll come back and talk about it.

40
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:35,866
>> Nope,
I'm ready to talk about them now.

41
00:01:35,866 --> 00:01:37,488
>> Wow, okay, that's impressive.

42
00:01:37,488 --> 00:01:39,340
>> Thank you.
>> So you just want to take over.

43
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:42,852
Okay, so the thing is I'm actually
in Rhode Island right now, and

44
00:01:42,852 --> 00:01:47,000
so it's not clear to me how we can just
kind of switch places and let you drive.

45
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,090
>> Well, why don't we use
the magic of technology?
