1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:01,630
First things first,

2
00:00:01,630 --> 00:00:05,200
inside the QRCodeManager
object I created the worker.

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:13,950
The worker points to the script
at scripts/jsqrcode/qrworker.js.

4
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:17,190
Next up, I went into qrworker.js and

5
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:19,160
took a look at the scripts
that were being imported.

6
00:00:20,275 --> 00:00:23,790
Index.html also has all those
scripts being included.

7
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:26,080
However, these are no longer needed,

8
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,400
as they're being imported
by the web worker.

9
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,250
So I'll just delete them.

10
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:34,260
Back inside the qrworker, it looks
like the image is being decoded, but

11
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:36,030
then nothing else happens.

12
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:38,660
All I have to do is use
the postMessage method to

13
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:40,960
send the result back to the main thread.

14
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,980
In the event that something
goes wrong up here,

15
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:46,100
the catch block will
post back undefined.

16
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:49,540
Back in the detectQRCode
function inside the main thread,

17
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:51,820
I'm posting the imageData to the Worker.

18
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:54,090
This is how the Worker
gets the image to work on.

19
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:59,050
This callback for detectQRCode is what
actually displays the URL on the screen.

20
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:02,620
So I moved all that logic
into the onmessage handler.

21
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:05,099
When the worker posts a message
back to the main thread,

22
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:08,790
the onmessage handler gets called and
this function runs.

23
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:11,420
And here's the bug that
I mentioned before.

24
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:15,240
Instead of just simply using result,
you have to use result.data.

25
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:19,160
This result is now a message object
which is the different than the object

26
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:22,910
that was received when all of the work
was being done by the main thread.

27
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:26,370
As a result,
simply grab the .data property.

28
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:29,290
And then just for the heck of it,
I added an onerror

29
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:32,620
handler just in case something
happens with the worker thread.

30
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:35,450
It'll display a WorkerException
if something goes wrong.

31
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:38,470
I'll run gulp serve to
see how the page looks.

32
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:42,800
And voila, it looks like
the QR code app is working.

33
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:45,670
I'll go ahead and open up a timeline,
and see how this looks.

34
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:48,410
Now the timeline's showing that
there are two threads running,

35
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:50,170
the main thread and a worker.

36
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:51,000
Looks like it worked.
