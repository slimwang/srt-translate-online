To help us with this module,
we have Sezan Camacho,

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:07,705
who is one of our resident computer
vision experts here at Udacity.

3
00:00:07,705 --> 00:00:11,259
So, Sezan, how should we get
started finding Lane Lines?

4
00:00:11,259 --> 00:00:14,919
>> Well, your ultimate goal in this
first section is to measure some of

5
00:00:14,919 --> 00:00:18,300
the quantities that need to be
known in order to control the car.

6
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,030
For example, to steer a car,

7
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:22,670
you'll need to measure how
much your lane is curving.

8
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:26,310
To do that, you need to map out
the lens in your camera images,

9
00:00:26,309 --> 00:00:28,959
after transforming them to
a different perspective.

10
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,600
One way, you're looking down
on the road from above.

11
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,500
But, in order to get this
perspective transformation right,

12
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:38,159
you first have to correct for
the effect of image distortion.

13
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:43,250
>> So, by image distortion,
do you mean something like this?

14
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:47,310
>> Well hopefully, the distortion we're
dealing with isn't quite that bad, but

15
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:48,800
yes, that's the idea.

16
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:50,899
Cameras don't create perfect images.

17
00:00:50,899 --> 00:00:54,609
Some of the objects in the images,
especially ones near the edges,

18
00:00:54,609 --> 00:00:59,219
can get stretched or skewed in various
ways and you need to correct for that.

19
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:01,759
>> Cool, let's jump into step one,

20
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:06,861
how to undistort your
distorted camera images.
