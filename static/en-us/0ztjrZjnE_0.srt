00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,000
Let's look at the answer to our quiz.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,210
We would ask which of these are true.

3
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:09,480
L1 capacity is less than L2 capacity.

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:14,400
This should be true because
the L2 cache needs to

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,060
have hits for
things that were L1 misses.

6
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:23,640
So if L2 has the same or
lower capacity than L1.

7
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:28,240
The not many things that miss in
L1 will actually be hit in L2, and

8
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:32,229
we want the L2 to still
have a lot of hits so

9
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:37,070
that things don't go to even
slower caches or even to memory.

10
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:41,320
The L1 latency,
should it be less than L2 latency?

11
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,140
And the answer is yes.

12
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:49,870
We look first in L1 cache not
because it has a better chance of

13
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:55,360
finding the data than the L2 cache, but
because it has a lower hit latency.

14
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,510
The number of accesses in L1 cache,

15
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:02,840
is it lower than the number
of accesses in L2 cache?

16
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,650
This is not true.

17
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:10,050
All of the accesses, load and
stores, go to L1 cache but

18
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:13,880
only those that miss in
L1 cache go to L2 cache.

19
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:18,050
So, the L2 cache usually has
a lot fewer accesses than L1 and

20
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:25,000
finally, L1 associativity needs
to be equal to L2 associativity.

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,480
This is potentially true,
but usually it isn't.

22
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:32,640
Why?
Well because the L1 cache needs to have

23
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:38,530
a low hit latency and need not
have the capacity of the L2 cache.

24
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:44,160
Similarly for associativity the L1
cache because it needs to be fast

25
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:49,320
can have a lower associativity where
as the L2 cache can be slower so

26
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,480
we can maybe afford
a higher associativities.

27
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:56,450
So typically that's what happens,
L1 has a lower associativity than L2.

28
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:57,900
So this is also not true.
