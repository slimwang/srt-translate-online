00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,548
This system of equation has exactly one solution and it is a point of

2
00:00:04,548 --> 00:00:09,539
intersection. This point satisfies both of the equations. If I plug in an x

3
00:00:09,539 --> 00:00:14,739
value of 4 and a y value of 45, both equations should be true. Let's see if that

4
00:00:14,739 --> 00:00:19,517
works. Sure enough, in the end, we get true statements. If we can understand

5
00:00:19,517 --> 00:00:23,612
that the solution to a system is a point of intersection, then we can use this

6
00:00:23,612 --> 00:00:27,761
to solve all sorts of other problems. But before we get into solving other

7
00:00:27,761 --> 00:00:31,909
problems we're going to see if a point is a intersection to a system, and look

8
00:00:31,909 --> 00:00:36,342
at other types of systems. The x and y values make both equations true. This is

9
00:00:36,342 --> 00:00:40,626
how we can check whether or not the point is actually a solution to our system

10
00:00:40,626 --> 00:00:41,469
of equations.
