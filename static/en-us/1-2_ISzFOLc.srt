1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
And the answer is 2, 3, 4, 6, and 9.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
On the ground, the static state without velocity is just X and Y.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
That's 2.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
If we add mid-air, we have height, which adds a third dimension, 3.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
If we add the dynamic state to the ground,

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
which is delta X and delta Y over time, that's 4 in total

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
plus the original X and Y.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Same for mid-air. Multiply 3 up to 6.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
And the last one is the tricky one.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Clearly, a helicopter in mid-air

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
that looks at rotational velocities would have 12 dimensions.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
But again, because I don't care about the absolute coordinates

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
of its yaw, roll and pitch.

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
The ball is variant.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
The spin variables are 3, delta roll, delta pitch and delta yaw.

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
If we add those to the dynamic state in mid-air,

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
we get 9 and not 12.

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Once again, these are X, Y and Z: delta X, delta Y, delta Z over time,

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
and the velocities in the different rotational directions,

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
which make a total of 9.
