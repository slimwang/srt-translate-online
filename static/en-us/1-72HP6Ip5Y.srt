00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,340
Your focus should be on
understanding and context.

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:06,190
When you approach problems that need
to be solved with code, pause for

3
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:08,109
a minute and think to yourself.

4
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:09,880
Why am I solving it this way?

5
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:12,620
There's rarely a right or a wrong
answer, but developing a habit of

6
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:15,580
questioning everything,
diving into unfamiliar concepts and

7
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:18,550
going out of your way to increase
your knowledge is a surefire way

8
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:22,300
to become a sharp rubyist, but
at the same time, you should

9
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:25,316
do your best to find a balance to make
sure you're constantly moving forward.

10
00:00:25,316 --> 00:00:28,071
So let's move forward.
