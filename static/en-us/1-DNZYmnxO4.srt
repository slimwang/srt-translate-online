00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,129
In this lesson, we will start looking
at the details of what you need to do

2
00:00:04,129 --> 00:00:07,150
in order to perform a cluster analysis.

3
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:10,800
The first thing we need to do is to make
sure that we have a good set of data

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,790
that provides the information needed
to be able to accomplish the analysis.

5
00:00:15,789 --> 00:00:19,140
Once we have that, we'll take
a look at the actual data format,

6
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:22,019
to make sure it fits with
how clustering works.

7
00:00:22,019 --> 00:00:25,489
I'll be showing you how to do this
process in a software platform called

8
00:00:25,489 --> 00:00:26,529
Ultrix.

9
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:30,130
However, the principles you'll learn
will help you become proficient in

10
00:00:30,129 --> 00:00:34,280
segmentation and clustering,
regardless of the tool you use.

11
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:37,890
If you need a refresher on how
to generally clean up a dataset,

12
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:41,390
check out the course linked
to it in the notes below.

13
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:41,929
Ready?

14
00:00:41,929 --> 00:00:42,659
Let's get started.
