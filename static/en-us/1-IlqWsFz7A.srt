00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,822
Here are the cars. Let's see how I did it? I simply added an ArrayList for

2
00:00:04,822 --> 00:00:10,990
cars. Put in the cars at the coordinates that the question asked for, and then

3
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:18,950
I added a third loop to draw all the cars. Now, this is not so pretty. And it

4
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:23,942
really would be nice if we could some how unify all of these various elements,

5
00:00:23,942 --> 00:00:30,580
put them in a single container and draw them in a single loop. That's what

6
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:32,390
we'll be able to do with Java interface types.
