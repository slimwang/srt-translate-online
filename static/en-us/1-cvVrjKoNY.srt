1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:01,260
The answers are.

2
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:03,629
The first sentence is valid.

3
00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:04,259
It's always true.

4
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:06,310
Why is that?

5
00:00:06,309 --> 00:00:11,179
Because every model has to have at least
one object and we can have both x and

6
00:00:11,179 --> 00:00:15,320
y refer to that same object, and so
that object must be equal to itself.

7
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:19,769
Second, the left hand side of
this implication has to be true,

8
00:00:19,769 --> 00:00:21,300
x is always equal to x.

9
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,310
and the right hand side says for

10
00:00:24,309 --> 00:00:27,599
every y does there exist
a z since that y equals z.

11
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,030
And we can say yes, there is.

12
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:35,329
We can always choose y itself for
the value of z and then y equals y.

13
00:00:35,329 --> 00:00:38,899
So true implies true,
that's always true.

14
00:00:38,899 --> 00:00:43,579
Now, third sentence for
all x P of x or not P of x, and

15
00:00:43,579 --> 00:00:47,140
that's always true, because everything
has to be either in the relation for

16
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:51,759
P, or out of the relation for
P, so that's valid.

17
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:54,719
And the fourth,
there exists in x P of x.

18
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,989
That's true for the models in which
there is some x that is a member of P,

19
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:03,609
but there doesn't necessarily
have to be any at all.

20
00:01:03,609 --> 00:01:05,629
P might be an empty relation.

21
00:01:05,629 --> 00:01:07,920
So this is satisfiable.

22
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,310
True in some models, but
not true in all models.
