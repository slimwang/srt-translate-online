1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,232
The interval we need here goes from 
negative 2 to 2 and includes both of

2
00:00:03,232 --> 00:00:06,802
these inputs. 
If we plug in any number outside of this

3
00:00:06,802 --> 00:00:09,884
interval into our function, the number 
that we'll get under the square root sign

4
00:00:09,884 --> 00:00:13,348
will be negative. 
We're looking for real numbers here, not

5
00:00:13,348 --> 00:00:16,129
imaginary ones, so that's not going to 
work for us.

6
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:18,620
None of those kinds of inputs will be 
allowed.

7
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:20,849
You can see we have a pretty restricted 
domain here.
