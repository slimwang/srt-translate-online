00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,304
For this last question, I want you to find the number line that represents the

2
00:00:04,316 --> 00:00:08,633
answer, or the answer might be all real numbers, or none of these number lines

3
00:00:08,645 --> 00:00:12,951
are the answer. Type the letter of the answer in the box here. For example, if

4
00:00:12,963 --> 00:00:16,168
you think this is the number line, you'd write d in the box.
