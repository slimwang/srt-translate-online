1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:05,474
For the cube root of 40, we have 2 times this cube root of 5. For the fourth

2
00:00:05,474 --> 00:00:08,837
root of 48, we have 2 times the fourth root of 3, and for the fourth root of

3
00:00:08,837 --> 00:00:13,846
64, we had 2 times the fourth root of 4. And finally, for our last answer,

4
00:00:13,846 --> 00:00:18,370
we'll have 5 times the cube root of 20. Fantastic work for getting at least of

5
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:22,962
those correct. These were pretty tough. For the first one, we can rewrite 40 as

6
00:00:22,962 --> 00:00:27,762
eight times five. Eight is the same thing as two cube so now we have a perfect

7
00:00:27,762 --> 00:00:32,700
cube or a factor that appears three times within our radical. We can use the

8
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:37,566
product rule to split this radical up into the product of two radicals. We know

9
00:00:37,566 --> 00:00:42,400
that a cubed root undoes a cubed power. So we're really left with just 2 here.

10
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:46,389
This also goes in line with our thinking, a power divided by root. 3 divided 3

11
00:00:46,389 --> 00:00:51,600
equals 1 so we just have 2 to the 1. We can't simplify the 5 so that stays

12
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,960
inside of its cubed root and we have that multiplied on the end with our

13
00:00:53,960 --> 00:01:00,250
answer. 2 times the cube root of 5. For the fourth root of 48, we split up 48

14
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:05,538
into 16 times 3. We rewrite 16 as 2 to the 4th and then we can take the fourth

15
00:01:05,538 --> 00:01:11,350
root up to the fourth. The root undoes the fourth power. We leave the 3 inside

16
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:14,583
of the fourth root since we don't have four factors of 3, we just have one of

17
00:01:14,583 --> 00:01:20,878
them. So our final answer is 2 times the fourth root of 3. We use a similar

18
00:01:20,878 --> 00:01:27,527
method for finding the fourth root of 64. We rewrite 64 as 16 times 4. Take the

19
00:01:27,527 --> 00:01:32,138
4th root of 2 to the 4th which leaves us with 2 times the 4th root of 4. For

20
00:01:32,138 --> 00:01:37,384
our last one we split up 2,500 into 25 times 100, 25 equals 5 squared and 100

21
00:01:37,384 --> 00:01:42,765
equals 5 times 20. We do this step so that way we can get three factors of 5

22
00:01:42,765 --> 00:01:48,598
together. We know that the cube root of phi cubed is just 5. 20 is not a

23
00:01:48,598 --> 00:01:54,880
prefect cube since the factors of 20 are 2, 2, and 5. There's not three factors

24
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,633
that repeat. This means 20 stays inside of our cubed root, and we are left with

25
00:01:58,633 --> 00:02:03,104
our final answer. 5 times the cube root of 20.
