00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:02,889
Welcome to week one of the program.

2
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:05,165
Next up you'll hear from Siraj.

3
00:00:05,165 --> 00:00:07,689
He'll provide a great overview
of regression models.

4
00:00:07,689 --> 00:00:11,179
Then in a classroom, we'll have a more
in-depth look into building regression

5
00:00:11,179 --> 00:00:13,349
models with Scikit-Learn.

6
00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:17,559
There'll be programming exercises so you
can get some practical experience and

7
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:19,589
also test your knowledge.

8
00:00:19,589 --> 00:00:22,390
You'll also see Siraj again
in his one hour live session

9
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:24,449
where he shows you how to
build regression models.
