1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The answer is the Handshake Protocol

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
That needs to use asymmetric cryptography to do authentication.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
If we want to do authentication without starting from a shared key--

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
which, if we’re talking about a web browser and a client, we don’t have--

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
that always require some kind of asymmetric cryptography.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
That’s what the Handshake Protocol uses.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
It uses a combination of asymmetric and symmetric crypto.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
The record protocol only uses symmetric encryption.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
The reason for that is that we’ve established a session key by the end of the handshake.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Now we can use symmetric encryption which is much faster for encrypting all the content of pages.
