1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,333
What I'm going to do first to deal with
this negative exponent factor is separate

2
00:00:05,345 --> 00:00:10,445
it out from the rest of the factors. So
I'm just going to multiply a little bit

3
00:00:10,457 --> 00:00:15,781
more explicitly. So you have 3m^2 times 1/n^-4.
However, we know that when we have a

4
00:00:15,793 --> 00:00:21,126
negative exponent, n^4 in our case, these
factors actually equal to 1/n^4.

5
00:00:21,128 --> 00:00:26,840
So I need to replace just the denominator
of this fraction right here with this

6
00:00:26,852 --> 00:00:30,836
number. So that's going to give us
3m^2 times 1/1/n^4.

7
00:00:30,837 --> 00:00:36,495
This is really not looking very pretty.
However, we know how to handle this.

8
00:00:36,617 --> 00:00:42,360
Dividing by a fraction is the same as
multiplying by its reciprocal. So, for

9
00:00:42,372 --> 00:00:46,691
example, we have 1 over a/b. That's just equal
to 1 times b/a.

10
00:00:46,692 --> 00:00:51,702
So we can continue modifying this
expression using that trick. This is going

11
00:00:51,714 --> 00:00:56,824
to equal, keeping the 3m^2, we keep the
numerator here, and we multiply by the

12
00:00:56,836 --> 00:01:01,633
reciprocal of the denominator. So the
reciprocal of 1/n^4 is just n^4/1.

13
00:01:01,639 --> 00:01:06,623
Well now this is easy. You know that
anything times 1 is just itself. And we

14
00:01:06,635 --> 00:01:12,272
know anything divided by 1 is just itself.
So this leaves us with 3m^2n^4.

15
00:01:12,272 --> 00:01:17,488
So again, we see that switching the sign
of an exponent, so switching from negative

16
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:22,517
4 to positive 4 here for the factor with
the n base. Just requires a flipping of

17
00:01:22,529 --> 00:01:27,191
the exponent sign and a flipping of the
side of the equation that factors on. We

18
00:01:27,203 --> 00:01:31,879
switch from having n^-4 in the denominator
to having n^4 in the numerator. If you

19
00:01:31,891 --> 00:01:36,503
found working with fractions like this a
little bit difficult, not a big deal at

20
00:01:36,515 --> 00:01:40,540
all. Just take some time to review
manipulation of fractions with the

21
00:01:40,552 --> 00:01:41,153
materials that we've directed you to.
