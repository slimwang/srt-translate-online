Thank you for sharing your responses on the forum. Now,

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:05,970
in writing all of this code, we've seen a lot of

3
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:09,380
new words. Let's review all of them. So here I

4
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:11,860
have both of my programming files on the screen at the

5
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:15,060
same time. Here's my first programming file where I'm making

6
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:18,660
the class movie. And the second one, when I'm defining instances

7
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:23,130
of that class, instances like Toy Story and Avatar. Now, you

8
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:25,450
may have to go into Full Screen mode to be able

9
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:28,080
to read all of the details on the screen.

10
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,950
Okay, let's start reviewing all of the new words.

11
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:33,980
So, we started out by defining a class. The

12
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:37,560
class Keyword allows us to make classes. You can think

13
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:40,160
of a class as a blueprint. And a class

14
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:44,420
can have both data and methods. Now, we can

15
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:47,630
create multiple instances of a class. In this case,

16
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:50,920
we created instances like Toy Story and Avatar. We could

17
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:53,830
have created many more. Now, when we create

18
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:56,159
an instance of a class, instance like Toy

19
00:00:56,159 --> 00:01:00,030
Story, the classes constructor gets called. This is

20
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:02,960
essentially the init method inside the class. It is

21
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,300
here that we initialize all of the data

22
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:09,500
associated with the instance. The constructor uses the keyword,

23
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:12,430
self. Now, you can think of self as

24
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:16,144
itself or the instance in question. So, when the

25
00:01:16,144 --> 00:01:19,904
instance Toy Story is getting created, self is

26
00:01:19,904 --> 00:01:23,460
Toy Story. All the variables associated with a specific

27
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:27,420
instance are called instance variables. Now, these are

28
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,860
unique to an object and can be accessed using

29
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:32,430
the self keyword inside the class and the

30
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:36,100
instance name outside the class. And, finally, all of

31
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:38,760
the functions inside the class that are associated

32
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:41,200
with an instance and have the first argument as

33
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,810
self are called instance methods. So there you have it. All of the

34
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:48,860
new words that we have learned thus far, right there on one screen.
