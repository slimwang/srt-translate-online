1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:05,300
Based on this data, they make
a preliminary diagnosis if possible, and

2
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:06,840
order laboratory imaging and

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:11,590
other tests to obtain as much
objective data as possible.

4
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:16,740
From this aggregated database of
subjective information from the patient

5
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:21,640
and objective data from their own
observations and their tests and images,

6
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:27,240
they assign the patient with one or
more diagnoses, and develop a plan for

7
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:31,160
managing them that usually
involves prescribing medications.

8
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:34,110
In subsequent visits,
they follow up and make adjustments.

9
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:39,490
The treatment plan may involve
referral to specialists,

10
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:43,830
requiring coordination with providers
working at different care venues, and

11
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:46,690
possibly in different communities and
health systems.
