00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,230
Let's now talk about data center networking

2
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:05,380
and how network operators perform traffic engineering

3
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:07,460
inside a data center. First of all,

4
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:11,100
what characterizes a data center? Data center network

5
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:15,061
has 3 important characteristics. One is multi-tenancy.

6
00:00:15,061 --> 00:00:19,350
Multi-tenancy allows a data center provider to

7
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:22,390
advertise the cost of shared infrastructure, but

8
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:25,430
because there are multiple independent users, the infrastructure

9
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:30,720
must also provide some level of security and resource isolation. Data Center

10
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,810
network resources are also elastic, meaning

11
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:37,060
that as demand for service fluctuates, the

12
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:42,880
operator can expand and contract these resources. It's also, can be pay per use,

13
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:50,530
meaning that as the need to use more resources arises or disappears,

14
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:57,080
a service provider can adjust how much resources are devoted to the particular

15
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:59,170
service running in the data center. Another

16
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:02,370
characteristic of data center networking is flexible

17
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:09,035
service management, or the ability to move work, or work loads to other

18
00:01:09,035 --> 00:01:12,970
locations inside the data center. For example,

19
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:15,990
as load changes for a particular service,

20
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:18,520
an operator may need to provision additional

21
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:21,990
virtual machines, or servers to handle the

22
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:25,970
load for that service or potentially move it to a completely different set of

23
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:31,220
servers inside the infrastructure. This workload movement and virtual machine

24
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:36,300
migration essentially creates the need for traffic engineering

25
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:42,050
solutions inside a data center. A key enabling technology in

26
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:47,340
data center networking is the ability to virtualize servers. This makes it

27
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:50,590
possible to quickly provision, move, and

28
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:54,220
migrate servers and services in response to

29
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:57,100
fluctuations in workload. But while provisioning

30
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:00,480
servers and moving them is relatively easy,

31
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:03,260
we must also develop traffic engineering

32
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:07,790
solutions that allow the network to reconfigure

33
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:12,030
in response to changing workloads and migrating services.
