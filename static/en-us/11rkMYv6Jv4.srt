1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
This object over here is interesting because we can change its shape.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
So you can take this thing over here

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
and move it around, and what you actually see of the object

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
depends on the angle of the rotors.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So what do you think? What type of invariance is this?
