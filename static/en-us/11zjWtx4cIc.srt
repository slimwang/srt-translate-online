1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,240
So, we just looked at two examples of Web sites who

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:07,180
use their own internal APIs to resolve new data for their users.

3
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:10,230
This is really cool, but unless you're already working for

4
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:14,200
a giant web app, you probably don't have a massive internal database of

5
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:17,250
cool information you can query asynchronously.

6
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:21,996
But luckily, there are tons of APIs available on the Web that readily serve up

7
00:00:21,996 --> 00:00:23,758
interesting information.

8
00:00:23,758 --> 00:00:25,275
And they're usually free to use so

9
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:28,310
long as you aren't making thousands of requests per hour.

10
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:30,770
For instance, Google offers a ton of APIs,

11
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:35,120
including Google Analytics, Google Maps, Google Fonts.

12
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,180
Looking around the Web, it isn't hard to find examples of Web sites that

13
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:41,990
use external APIs to create interesting interactions for users.

14
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:46,720
Reddit and the Reddit Enhancement Suite Chrome plugin interact with

15
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:50,150
a few different APIs to make Reddit feel more dynamic.

16
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:52,880
When a user clicks on a link that resolves to a YouTube video,

17
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:58,540
Reddit opens up an embedded YouTube player which interacts with the YouTube API.

18
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:02,840
Or when a user opens up a link to a Twitter feed,

19
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:07,230
the Reddit Enhancement Suite Chrome plugin fires off an AJAX request for Twitter

20
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:12,640
data, and uses the Twitter API to open up the tweet right here inside the page.

21
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,400
Check out the link in the instructor notes if you want to find some more APIs

22
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,230
that are available.
