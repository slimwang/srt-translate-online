>> So, I hope you can tell, that both point-slope form and slope-intercept form,

2
00:00:04,237 --> 00:00:08,462
are super useful for us, depending on what information we start out with in our

3
00:00:08,462 --> 00:00:12,784
problem. What if we know that a line goes through 2 points, 7, 4 and 3, 9? Let's

4
00:00:12,784 --> 00:00:16,811
see if we can come up with an equation for this. Instead of doing this all in

5
00:00:16,811 --> 00:00:21,161
one step though, let's break it down. First things first, let's find the slope.
