1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:03,180
By now, we've learned how to
connect our app to the Internet and

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:06,820
displayed data from that connection
in a simple Android layout.

3
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:08,640
This is a great start.

4
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:11,860
In this lesson, you're going to
learn how to effectively display and

5
00:00:11,859 --> 00:00:16,179
interact with scrolling lists of
information using a RecyclerView.

6
00:00:16,179 --> 00:00:17,769
So why are we doing a full
lesson on RecyclerView?

7
00:00:17,769 --> 00:00:19,570
Well simple.

8
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:23,440
RecyclerView and the design patterns
behind it are things that you see and

9
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,700
interact with many times a day.

10
00:00:25,699 --> 00:00:28,829
After working through the toy app,
you will update the way Sunshine is

11
00:00:28,829 --> 00:00:31,909
implemented to get it
closer to it's final state.

12
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:35,450
Instead of displaying all the weather
data in a single text view, by the end

13
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:38,870
of this lesson, Sunshine will load
weather data into individual views for

14
00:00:38,869 --> 00:00:42,589
each date and respond to clicks
on a view with a toast message.

15
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:43,420
So let's get started.
