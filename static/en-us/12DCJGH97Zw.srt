00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Now for a quick quiz.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
For a given string--say we have this string with 12 characters--

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
how many possible segmentations are there?

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
How many ways can we break this up into words?

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
And let's answer that not just for 12 characters, but for n characters in general.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
With n characters, how many ways of segmenting could there be?

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Could there be n-1 ways, n-1 squared, n-1 factorial, or 2^n-1?

8
00:00:32,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Tell me which of those you think is right.
