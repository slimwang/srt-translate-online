1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,950
Just to now start to comparing these technologies.

2
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:06,840
Look at SLRs, single lens reflex cameras to camera phones.

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,870
The DSLR advantages are,

4
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:12,780
they are because of the fact that they're much bigger can take in more light.

5
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:15,080
They can actually take in, actually capture depth of field.

6
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:17,710
All photographers know what that is, and love it.

7
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:20,960
Shutter lag is not an issue, because when you press the button,

8
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,550
that's when you get the picture.

9
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:25,620
Controlled field of view, we can actually control it by zooming in and

10
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:28,530
out, also changing the telephoto on the lens.

11
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:31,640
Of course we have really nice, optics and

12
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:34,430
glass in these cameras to capture light.

13
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:37,320
And there are other types of things which are available allowing you to do

14
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,370
manual control.

15
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:41,680
Again, DSLR remains as the choice for professionals, or

16
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,820
people really serious about photography.

17
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:47,130
But, of course, smartphone cameras, here are the advantages.

18
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:50,150
Well, they actually have computation right there.

19
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:53,400
In fact, more and more, that's the kind of stuff that we see,

20
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,420
where basic computation is happening when you take a picture.

21
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:58,690
So for example most of the time when you take a picture,

22
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:02,880
it's taking more than one picture and actually using a fusion of all of those.

23
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:06,680
Computed right there locally on the device to give you a better picture.

24
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,600
Data, it can actually capture a lot of data,

25
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,460
and do a lot of other types of computation right there.

26
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:16,430
Of course, there is a growth of, you know, programmers because of all them now

27
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:21,720
come with APIs and even, you know, high school kids are writing programs to

28
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:26,980
generate better computational frameworks of doing photography on these devices.

29
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:29,740
Of course, not to forget the pipeline is efficient.

30
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:33,320
I take a picture, I see it right there, I can do things with it right there.

31
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:36,600
As opposed to download it to a computer and do something with it later
