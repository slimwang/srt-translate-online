00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,042
Thinking back to what information we decided was important in the last quiz,

2
00:00:04,138 --> 00:00:07,948
we're going to use that to create a word equation for the cost to make 92

3
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:12,310
glasses wipers. So try to remember which quantities we decided were relevant for

4
00:00:12,322 --> 00:00:16,579
figuring out this problem, and then think about how those 2 quantities might be

5
00:00:16,591 --> 00:00:21,030
related to each other. Place the letter of each quantity that you'd like to be

6
00:00:21,042 --> 00:00:25,510
an equation in these teal boxes, one in each box of course. And then pick which

7
00:00:25,522 --> 00:00:29,850
of these four operators you think relates the two of them together. Should they

8
00:00:29,862 --> 00:00:34,645
be added, subtracted, divided or multiplied? Remember that what we're going for

9
00:00:34,657 --> 00:00:38,580
in the end, we want this side of the equation to equal is the cost of

10
00:00:38,592 --> 00:00:40,720
manufacturing 92 glasses wiper sets.
