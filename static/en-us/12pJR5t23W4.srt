00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:01,670
Hey congratulations.

2
00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:03,138
You finished lesson three.

3
00:00:03,138 --> 00:00:06,939
And in this lesson, we learned how
to add images to the word list.

4
00:00:06,939 --> 00:00:07,865
But more importantly,

5
00:00:07,865 --> 00:00:11,330
you learned about the thought process
that goes into adding a new app feature.

6
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:15,540
And then we rounded out the lesson
by adding visual polish to the app.

7
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:17,040
So it's really quite
beautiful to look at.

8
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:21,590
Now balancing all these challenges
was rather tricky because there were

9
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:23,580
a number of files to modify, but

10
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:26,790
by planning your steps
accordingly you did it.

11
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:27,980
Great job.

12
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:29,500
So now's that time again.

13
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,880
I'd like you to reflect on
what we just covered and

14
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:33,660
even the things that you struggled with.

15
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:36,310
How can you have apply these
learnings to your future projects?
