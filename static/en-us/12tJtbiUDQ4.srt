00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,310
Letâ€™s consider a visual metaphor in our discussion about metrics.

2
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:08,260
We will do this by comparing metrics that exist in a toy shop,

3
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:11,490
to metrics that exist in operating systems.

4
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:14,620
For instance, from the perspective of the toy shop manager,

5
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:18,040
a number of properties of how the workers operate,

6
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:20,980
how the toy shop is being run, may be relevant.

7
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:22,710
One example is throughput.

8
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:27,110
The toy shop manager would want to make sure that this is as high as possible.

9
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:30,880
Other things that may be important for the toy shop manager include

10
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:35,520
how long does it take to react to a new order on average?

11
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,120
Or what is the percentage of the workbenches that are used over

12
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,540
a period of time?

13
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:44,690
There can clearly be many more properties of the toy shop and

14
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:48,070
how it's run that are relevant to the toy shop manager.

15
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:51,630
Metrics such as throughput, response time, utilization and

16
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:55,970
others are also relevant from the operating systems perspective.

17
00:00:55,970 --> 00:01:00,070
For instance, it's important to understand how many processes can be

18
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:04,080
completed over a period of time on a particular platform.

19
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,500
It's important to know how responsive the system is.

20
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,240
So when we click the mouse, does something happen immediately or

21
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,940
we have to wait some noticeable amount of time?

22
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:19,140
Does the operating system design lead to a solution that utilizes the CPU,

23
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:24,300
devices, memory well, or does it leave a lot of unused resources?

24
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:27,280
So metrics exist in any type of system, and

25
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,210
it's important to have them well-defined when you're trying to

26
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:36,080
analyze how a system behaves and how it compares to other solutions.
