1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:05,590
With images like photos, the total
file size depends on the number

2
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:10,990
of pixels multiplied by the number of
bits it takes to store each pixel.

3
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:16,820
So, to improve performance, you need
to keep images as small as possible and

4
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:18,890
compression as high as possible.

5
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:23,070
It's a common mistake to save images
with dimensions too large, and

6
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:24,270
quality too high.

7
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:27,320
It might sound counter-intuitive,
but the first rule for

8
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:32,299
saving images to a range of
devices is to save images

9
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:37,200
with the lowest possible quality,
and the smallest size as possible.

10
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:42,120
But, how do you reduce file
size while maintaining quality?

11
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,010
Throughout this course,

12
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:46,150
you'll learn how to use responsive
techniques to do just that.
