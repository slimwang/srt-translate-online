00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:05,110
The fastest way to support touch
is to change the UI in respond

2
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:07,750
to a DOM elements change in state.

3
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:11,295
DOM elements can be in one of
the following states default,

4
00:00:11,295 --> 00:00:15,690
hover, focus or active.

5
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:19,080
To change our UI for
each of these states,

6
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:24,745
we need to apply styles to the following
pseudo classes active, focus and

7
00:00:24,745 --> 00:00:30,090
hover, as shown here and
here are the results.

8
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:32,140
On most mobile browsers hover and

9
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:37,310
focus states will apply to
an element after it's being tapped.

10
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:40,310
So, consider carefully
what size you set, and

11
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:44,780
how they will look to the user
after they finish their touch.

12
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:47,210
Bear in mind that anchor tags and

13
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:51,200
buttons may have different
behaviors in different browsers.

14
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:56,740
So assume in some cases the hover will
remain, and in others focus will remain.

15
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:02,050
Here you could see it in action, when
we're clicking on each of the buttons,

16
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:04,540
and it's left with a different style.

17
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:08,560
You could open dev tools and see what
are the pseudo states that we gave for

18
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,880
each of the buttons.

19
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:14,860
In iOS, in particular, we don't
have an active state by default.

20
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:17,529
So check the instructor notes for
a shim.
