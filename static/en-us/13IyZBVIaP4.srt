00:00:04,067 --> 00:00:05,920
Hey, kids, welcome back.

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:09,370
I thought we'd kick off this lesson in
one of my favorite spots in Atlanta,

3
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:10,548
Piedmont Park.

4
00:00:10,548 --> 00:00:12,910
This area used to be
a dilapidated fairground, but

5
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:16,450
then sometime in the early 1900s it
was transformed into the lovely and

6
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:18,450
public open space that you see today.

7
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:19,860
This transformation, by the way,

8
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:24,420
was done by the Brothers Olmsted, sons
of Frederick Law Olmsted whom you might

9
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:28,770
know as the lead landscape architect
of Central Park in New York City.

10
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:29,290
Okay.

11
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:31,340
But why are we here?

12
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:34,500
Well, this lesson is about parallelizing
computations on the heart and

13
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:38,220
soul of computer science
data structures, the tree.

14
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:41,570
You're going to learn
a bunch of tricks for

15
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:44,400
extracting parallelism
from tree computations.

16
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,960
These include, for example, taking
the tree, converting it into a line, and

17
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,720
then parallelizing
operations on the line.

18
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:52,580
Now at some point in this process,
you and

19
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:54,120
I are going to get a little bit stuck.

20
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:58,100
So instead of trying to figure out
what to do, we're going to reach for

21
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:01,830
a classic trick in the lazy
computer scientist's tool box.

22
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:04,810
It's called randomization or
more simply flipping coins.

23
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:07,906
Lucky me.

24
00:01:11,461 --> 00:01:13,940
In addition to the video,
there is also a reading.

25
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:17,173
So be sure that you do both, and
while you're busy doing that,

26
00:01:17,173 --> 00:01:20,415
I'm going to go off and feed
the ducks which is probably illegal.

27
00:01:20,415 --> 00:01:22,388
And then I'm going to take a nap.

28
00:01:22,388 --> 00:01:25,105
Good luck to you and
wake me when you are done.

29
00:01:25,105 --> 00:01:35,105
