1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,230
Next, we're going to learn about the statement syntax

2
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:05,170
in Jinja. The statement syntax is very simple, it just

3
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:08,100
looks like this. This is squiggle percent, and then

4
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:10,700
you have your statement, and then you have a close

5
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:14,435
squiggle percent. And then you'll often have an ending

6
00:00:14,435 --> 00:00:18,437
statement, which is surrounded by squiggles of course, and in

7
00:00:18,437 --> 00:00:21,290
the middle you have your output. For example, an if

8
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:25,740
statement might look something like this. So I'll say if

9
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:29,520
name equals, equals Steve, this is just a Python syntax

10
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:31,440
for an if statement. Notice there's no colon at the

11
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:36,950
end. Will print hello Steve. Else will print, who are

12
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:38,920
you? This whole thing is followed by the end statement

13
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:40,817
block. Which in this case just says end if. Now

14
00:00:40,817 --> 00:00:44,609
this whole thing is followed by the end statement block,

15
00:00:44,609 --> 00:00:48,064
which in this case just says end if. In Jinja

16
00:00:48,064 --> 00:00:51,140
we have to tell it when the if statement is over.

17
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:52,850
So what this will do when this is run, if

18
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:56,330
the variable name Steve or if the variable named name

19
00:00:56,330 --> 00:01:00,290
equals Steve, it'll say, hello Steve! Else, it will say

20
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:04,034
who are you? And this ends it. Let's go ahead and

21
00:01:04,034 --> 00:01:07,350
see this in practice. Okay, I'm going to get the

22
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:10,710
variable n from the request and n will be a

23
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:13,622
number, and we're going to change this to be n

24
00:01:13,622 --> 00:01:16,510
equals n. Then we're going to go into our template and we're

25
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:19,180
going to change this. We're just going to work on the same

26
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:21,360
template here if you don't mind. We're going to change this to

27
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:27,984
use a basic if statement. So if n equals one, say n equals

28
00:01:27,984 --> 00:01:34,238
one, else say n does not equal one.
