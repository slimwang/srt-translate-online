1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
If we had a solver of order 4, remember the forward Euler method is of order 1.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:13,000
If we had a solver of order 4, and if we wanted to shrink the error by a factor of 10,

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
we want to gain one decimal place in accuracy,

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
by which factor do we need to change the number of steps?

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Should we be using 50% more, 80% more, twice as many, 10 times as many steps?
