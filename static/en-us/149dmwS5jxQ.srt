00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,700
So, let me actually show you first, the set up that we use for this class.

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:06,550
So, of course, I'm not trying to get any sympathy points from you,

3
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:09,950
but in producing this class I spend a lot of time in a dark room like

4
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:15,900
this working with you know, a tablet that's attached to a computer.

5
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:18,980
And what's basically happening, there's a camera above.

6
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:22,150
Of course part of the content is on this computer.

7
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:24,300
Which is then displayed on this tablet.

8
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:28,620
And of course using a pen like this, I write on top of this tablet.

9
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:32,330
And then of course a camera is capturing the images of also what's going on.

10
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:34,880
So in essence, there are two different images being captured.

11
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:40,810
One from the camera, which basically has whatever I'm doing with my hands.

12
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:45,840
And then another one, which basically captures all of the writing I do here.

13
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:52,490
So in essence this screen, that's actually shown here, is also captured.

14
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:54,900
On this computer, and

15
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:59,030
then this camera captures everything from the top down of what's going on.

16
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:02,350
And the final artifact of course is the combination of these two images.
