00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,230
Let's take a look at how IP address

2
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:05,510
space is allocated to Internet service providers. At

3
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:08,109
the top of the hierarchy is an organization

4
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:11,450
called the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority, or IANA. IANA

5
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:14,800
has the authority to allocate address space to

6
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:18,280
what are called regional routing registries. For Africa, the

7
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:20,780
regional registry is called AFRINIC. For Asia and

8
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:24,520
Australia, the registry is called APNIC. For North America,

9
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:27,700
ARIN. For Latin America, it's LACNIC. And for

10
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:31,750
Europe, it's RIPE. ARIN in turn allocates address space

11
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:35,230
to individual networks, like Georgia Tech. The address space

12
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:38,700
across registries is far from even. Now, this graph

13
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,220
is from a journal article that's a little

14
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:43,180
bit dated now, but it gives you an idea

15
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:47,330
of how many /8 address allocations have been allocated

16
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:49,620
to each of the regional registries. So as of

17
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:53,540
2005, North America had 23/8s allocated to it,

18
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:56,020
but the entire continent of Africa had only one.

19
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:58,640
And the recent news is that IANA actually finished

20
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:04,209
allocating all remaining /8 Internet address blocks, essentially meaning

21
00:01:04,209 --> 00:01:07,060
that we're out of IPv4 address space. So

22
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:09,540
when you hear that we're out of IPv4 addresses,

23
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:12,250
it doesn't mean that you can no longer attach

24
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:14,780
a new device to the Internet. There are various

25
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:17,060
ways for coping with this pressure on address

26
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:20,340
space. What that means is that IANA no

27
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:23,080
longer has any more /8 blocks to give

28
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:27,320
to these regional registries. Querying an IP address

29
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:31,090
using Whois and a routing registry, such as

30
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:34,280
ra.net, will tell you the owner of that

31
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:37,630
particular prefix. For example, if we run a

32
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:39,890
Whois query on an IP address at Georgia Tech,

33
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:44,110
it will tell us that that IP address is from a /16 allocation. That

34
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:48,666
Georgia Tech is the owner of the prefix and it's associated with this autonomous

35
00:01:48,666 --> 00:01:51,470
system number. The routing registry entry also

36
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:54,280
gives us some additional information, such as

37
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:57,700
who to contact if we need to contact the owner of this address space.
