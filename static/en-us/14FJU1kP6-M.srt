1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,760
Now that you have been introduced to data types.

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:05,600
Let's look at the many options of visual encodings that we have.

3
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:13,000
Simply put, visual encodings are mapping from data to display elements.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,300
The visualization that we saw before shares the correlation between income per

5
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:21,900
person and life expectancy, in many different countries.

6
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:25,310
This graphic is rich with visual encodings.

7
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:27,420
Let's take a look at some of those visual encodings now.

8
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:33,180
Life expectancy is encoded visually along the y axis,

9
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:37,070
while spending per person is encoded along the x axis.

10
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:40,500
For our data visualization this means that countries that are located in

11
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:44,940
the top-right corner of the graph, like Qatar, had a high income per person and

12
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:48,540
high life expectancy, the opposite would be true for

13
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:50,150
the countries in the lower left of the graph.

14
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:55,520
Position is considered a planar variable because it locates points in space.

15
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,570
It's probably one of the most prominent visual encodings that you'll see in

16
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:01,160
data visualization.

17
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:05,319
And it's also a display element that we can perceive with great accuracy.

18
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:09,850
So we know that position can be good for encoding two variables, but what do we

19
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:14,560
do if we want to visualize higher dimensions of the data, say a third variable.

20
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:20,490
Well, we could visualize a third variable in the third dimension, so

21
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:22,680
along the z axis here.

22
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,530
However, 3D models are generally poorly perceived by our eyes,

23
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:30,590
as it's more difficult to make quantitative comparisons between points.

24
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,010
For example, I'm not so

25
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:35,690
sure which of these two points has a greater y value, or height.

26
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,310
So we need some other way of encoding some third variable for

27
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:42,140
our data visualization,

28
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:45,990
fortunately, we have some other display elements that we can use instead.

29
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:50,150
We can use what are called retinal variables to encode additional variables for

30
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:53,720
our data set, size is an example of a retinal variable, and

31
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,490
it's particularly good for ordered data.

32
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:59,200
Going back to our world health data visualization,

33
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,980
we can see that population is encoded by the size of each of the circles, or

34
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:06,650
more precisely by the area of each point.

35
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:09,750
In combination with color, the size attribute makes some

36
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:14,680
countries more recognizable such as India, China and the United States.

37
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:17,210
Size and color hue,

38
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:22,480
which we just saw in the visualization, are both examples of retinal variables.

39
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,470
And if we wanted to,

40
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:28,280
we can even encode additional variables and these other retinal variables.

41
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,670
Size, orientation, and

42
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:32,960
color saturation are particularly effective for order data.

43
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:39,040
However, it maybe difficult to perceive quantitative differences using these

44
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:39,940
visual encodings.

45
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:44,740
The perceived value difference between say light blue and

46
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:48,030
light light blue isn't so obvious.

47
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:51,520
These other retinal variables such as color hue, shape, and

48
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:55,360
texture, are great for encoding nominal variables.

49
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,260
For our gap minder visualization,

50
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:00,759
we can see that color hue encodes the geographical regions of the world.

51
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:05,640
This choice of color makes it easier to compare income and

52
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:09,830
life expectancy across developed and less developed countries of the world.

53
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:13,290
The last variable we need to address is time.

54
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:18,850
Now, time isn't a static display element like color, size or position.

55
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:23,900
Instead time is animated through individual frames in our visualization.

56
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,520
The quick succession of these frames shows change in life expectancy,

57
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:32,720
income per person, and population over time.

58
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:37,640
It is the remarkable and engaging aspect of this visualization, and we

59
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:41,790
will learn how to incorporate this type of dynamic visualization in lesson four.

60
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:46,083
Now that you've seen one example of how map data to display elements,

61
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:49,880
we`re going to see if you can do it for two more visualizations.
