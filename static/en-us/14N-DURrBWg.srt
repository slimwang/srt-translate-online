1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,484
Well, this distance would be 12 units, great thinking if you found it. Since to

2
00:00:05,484 --> 00:00:09,860
find this vertical distance, we figured out how far we climbed on the y axis.

3
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:16,171
We went from y equals 3, up 5 units to y equals 8. That's how we knew that this

4
00:00:16,171 --> 00:00:21,162
distance was 5. So to find the horizontal distance. We're going to start at x

5
00:00:21,162 --> 00:00:25,750
equals negative 7, this x value, and run all the way to the right, to x equals

6
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:32,409
positive 5, this x value. So, the horizontal distance between these two points

7
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:37,989
would be from negative 7 to positive 5. That would be a total distance of 12

8
00:00:37,989 --> 00:00:42,706
units. You can find this distance by counting the spaces from negative 7 to

9
00:00:42,706 --> 00:00:46,264
positive 5. Or you can subtract the 2 numbers, and make sure to take the

10
00:00:46,264 --> 00:00:51,264
absolute value, so you get a positive number in the end. Here I just did 5

11
00:00:51,264 --> 00:00:56,684
minus negative 7, which equals positive 12. If you would've subtracted 5 from

12
00:00:56,684 --> 00:01:01,000
negative 7, you would've gotten negative 12. So you would've had to take the

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,973
absolute value. So that way you get a positive distance, or just 12.
