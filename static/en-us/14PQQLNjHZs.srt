1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,483
So here's another thing that we know,
that is if we run value iteration,

2
00:00:04,483 --> 00:00:07,071
we get a series of value functions,
say Vt.

3
00:00:07,071 --> 00:00:10,416
If we compare the value function
we have at some time step,

4
00:00:10,416 --> 00:00:13,898
t to the same value function that
we have one time step later,

5
00:00:13,898 --> 00:00:17,131
Vt plus 1, that if it basically
has stopped changing.

6
00:00:17,131 --> 00:00:21,361
If the change,
if the amount of change from Vt, sorry,

7
00:00:21,361 --> 00:00:26,131
from t to t plus 1 is less than
epsilon for all states in the MDP,

8
00:00:26,131 --> 00:00:31,261
then the largest difference between
the optimal value function and

9
00:00:31,261 --> 00:00:34,951
the value function that we get,
sorry for this.

10
00:00:34,951 --> 00:00:39,524
But, by taking that value function,
taking the greedy policy with respect to

11
00:00:39,524 --> 00:00:44,307
that value function and taking the value
function of that greedy policy is small,

12
00:00:44,307 --> 00:00:48,141
right, so we're going to be doing
almost optimal from all states.

13
00:00:48,141 --> 00:00:52,120
And the smallest here ends up being
2 times that epsilon times gamma,

14
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,812
divided by 1, minus gamma.

15
00:00:53,812 --> 00:00:55,739
>> Are you sure that's
intuitively obvious?

16
00:00:55,739 --> 00:00:59,016
>> [LAUGH], well maybe not
intuitively obvious, but the Sing and

17
00:00:59,016 --> 00:01:01,096
Yi proof of this is not so complicated,

18
00:01:01,096 --> 00:01:04,068
not so different from the stuff
that we've been doing.

19
00:01:04,068 --> 00:01:07,538
And you get the 1 over 1 minus gamma
because this little bit of epsilon that

20
00:01:07,538 --> 00:01:11,065
we could be off, could get magnified
over every single step as we think about

21
00:01:11,065 --> 00:01:12,128
this into the future.

22
00:01:12,128 --> 00:01:15,018
That's why we get a 1 minus
gamma in the denominator.

23
00:01:15,018 --> 00:01:18,718
And then 2 epsilon, because I don't
know which side of the epsilon we're on,

24
00:01:18,718 --> 00:01:21,481
times gamma because it doesn't
take place right away,

25
00:01:21,481 --> 00:01:22,745
it's one step from now.

26
00:01:22,745 --> 00:01:24,860
So it does kind of make sense.

27
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:28,840
But the real important upshot
of this is the notion that

28
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:32,270
if you can get a good enough
approximation of the value function.

29
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:34,696
Then you're going to have a good enough,
well,

30
00:01:34,696 --> 00:01:38,484
then you can at least put a bound on how
far off you are in terms of following

31
00:01:38,484 --> 00:01:42,400
the resulting policy from how far
that's going to be from optimal.

32
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:46,110
And furthermore we don't even need
to know how close we are to V star,

33
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:49,460
all we need for
this result to hold is, we look at

34
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:53,050
two consecutive iterations of value
iteration, right, which that we have.

35
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:54,130
We're running value iteration.

36
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:56,690
We know what it was a step ago,
we know what it is now.

37
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:58,250
And so we can compute this epsilon and

38
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:02,350
that gives us a bound on what if we
just stop now and follow that policy.

39
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:03,480
So that's a really useful thing.

40
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:06,760
Otherwise, knowing that
valuation converges in the limit

41
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:10,110
is not super duper helpful, because
you're never going to get to the limit.

42
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:14,500
And knowing that value iteration
eventually is optimal, even if finite

43
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:17,290
is still not that helpful, because
you don't know when that takes place.

44
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:18,900
So what this is telling us is,

45
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:22,200
we can actually test on our own,
when is a decent time to stop.

46
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:22,910
>> So that's cool.

47
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:24,780
So here's something I just noticed.

48
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:27,000
If I look at both your 1 and 2,

49
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,775
I noticed that they both would
encourage you to pick small gammas.

50
00:02:31,775 --> 00:02:32,970
>> Mm.

51
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:33,630
>> Right.

52
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:36,730
>> Yes, it is certainly the case
that if gamma is really tiny,

53
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:40,600
like if gamma is 0 then
this bound stays small.

54
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,340
This bound stays small.

55
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:43,850
It's all good.

56
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:46,880
The closer gamma gets to 1,
the more things are problematic.

57
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,760
But what do you infer from that?

58
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,160
>> Well, mainly why is that?

59
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,030
Well, that's because gamma really
tells you what your horizon is.

60
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:58,295
And so the smaller gamma is, the sort of
further into the future you don't look.

61
00:02:58,295 --> 00:02:59,730
>> [LAUGH]
>> If that makes sense.

62
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:01,880
And so that makes sense then, right?

63
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:06,080
That if I'm not really worried about the
future, then it doesn't take much for

64
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,281
me to be doing what
appears to be optimal.

65
00:03:08,281 --> 00:03:09,767
>> Yes.
That's right.

66
00:03:09,767 --> 00:03:13,340
Right, it's easy to optimize
over a very short horizon.

67
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:14,115
And the horizon,

68
00:03:14,115 --> 00:03:17,280
the effective horizon is always
something like 1 over 1 minus gamma.

69
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,605
That's kind of how far into the future
do rewards actually matter.

70
00:03:21,605 --> 00:03:22,464
>> Right.

71
00:03:22,464 --> 00:03:28,036
>> And so right, so gamma closer to 1,
is really looking ahead a lot further.

72
00:03:28,036 --> 00:03:31,460
And that's why it's
a harder problem to do.

73
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:33,145
It's harder to get things exactly right.

74
00:03:33,145 --> 00:03:36,971
>> So then why, in practice,
don't we always set gamma to be really,

75
00:03:36,971 --> 00:03:37,858
really small?

76
00:03:37,858 --> 00:03:42,562
>> Yeah, that's where I thought you were
going to go, so it's a great question.

77
00:03:42,562 --> 00:03:47,011
I mean one of the things that happens
if you set gamma to be something very

78
00:03:47,011 --> 00:03:51,701
close to 0, is the agent who's acting
in the world acts very myopically.

79
00:03:51,701 --> 00:03:53,738
Very short term thinking.

80
00:03:53,738 --> 00:03:59,306
So, I feel like eating now instead
of finishing recording this lecture.

81
00:03:59,306 --> 00:04:01,999
So I might as well do that.

82
00:04:01,999 --> 00:04:03,741
Right, so you get shortsightedness.

83
00:04:03,741 --> 00:04:04,623
>> I am eating now.

84
00:04:04,623 --> 00:04:06,782
>> [LAUGH] Well that's good for you.

85
00:04:06,782 --> 00:04:08,730
I am not eating now.

86
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:11,590
I would like to eat now,
but I won't because I'm

87
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:15,110
sufficiently farsighted to know that
just getting something yummy to

88
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:18,019
eat right now is going to interfere
with my ability to finish this course.

89
00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:23,060
Because our wonderful and
talented video editor eventually

90
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:28,010
going to stop [LAUGH] processing
this stuff, and then we're hosed.

91
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:29,860
So, yes.

92
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:31,924
Gamma, smaller gamma
means easier problem, but

93
00:04:31,924 --> 00:04:33,860
more short sighted behavior.

94
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:37,319
Closer to one gamma is looking
ahead more into the distance, but

95
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:39,702
can make the computations
more difficult.

96
00:04:39,702 --> 00:04:43,987
>> So it's basically what these two
results are saying that there is a trade

97
00:04:43,987 --> 00:04:45,393
off between horizon and

98
00:04:45,393 --> 00:04:49,695
sort of feasibility of solving a problem
in a reasonable amount of time.

99
00:04:49,695 --> 00:04:50,252
>> Yeah.

100
00:04:50,252 --> 00:04:51,270
That's a good way to say it.
