1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:02,410
Remember, these
are homogeneous coordinates,

2
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:05,372
so here I wrote it instead of w but
with s's.

3
00:00:05,372 --> 00:00:08,119
So it's full homogeneous
coordinate system,

4
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:12,570
which will go from
the homogeneous through a linear

5
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:16,530
operation to a scaled version
of the new x prime, y prime.

6
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:20,880
So, the full transformation

7
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,970
is referred to as a general projective
transformation, or a homography.

8
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:27,900
And a homography still
maps lines to lines,

9
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,800
because remember we talked about
prospective transforms always maintain

10
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,620
lines, and things that are inside of
each other stay inside of each other.

11
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:38,640
But this is what's typically sometimes
referred to as perspective transform.

12
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,070
So the idea is if I had a plane and

13
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:42,530
I was very close to you and
I tilted it this way.

14
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:44,040
And we'll do more of this later.

15
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:47,460
The edge that's near you will
seem longer than the edge that's

16
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:48,800
farther away from you.

17
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,539
And we'll prove later that
the transformation of a plane

18
00:00:53,539 --> 00:00:56,013
can be represented this way.

19
00:00:56,013 --> 00:01:00,136
Now of course,
because this is a homogeneous transform,

20
00:01:00,136 --> 00:01:04,101
I can scale everything by constant and
it has no impact.

21
00:01:04,101 --> 00:01:06,898
So I can make this last
degree of freedom be a 1, and

22
00:01:06,898 --> 00:01:10,152
I'll get a slightly different w,
but it doesn't matter,

23
00:01:10,152 --> 00:01:13,888
because I'm going to divide
everything through by w anyway.

24
00:01:13,888 --> 00:01:16,760
So that 8 degrees of freedom,
that's the full,

25
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,230
it's referred to as the homography.
