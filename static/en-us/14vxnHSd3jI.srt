00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:03,880
You know that the FirebaseArray
class uses ChildEventListeners.

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:07,930
And it does that by implementing the
ChildEventListener callback interface.

3
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:11,490
The point of the FirebaseArray class
is to keep a collection of items

4
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:14,270
that are in the Firebase database,
in sync with a bunch of matching

5
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:18,000
database snapshot objects that
are in the fire base array class.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,050
Specifically the snapshots are stored in
an instance variable called m snapshots.

7
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:25,830
So Firebase array uses these child event
listeners to see when things are added,

8
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:28,900
removed, changed, or
moved in the Firebase database and

9
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:32,369
then make the changes in its
own internal array list.

10
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:34,700
And then it triggers the Firebase
list adapter which makes all

11
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:35,470
the visual changes.

12
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:39,425
I was actually messing around with the
Firebase array code a bit earlier and

13
00:00:39,425 --> 00:00:41,750
created a little mini project.

14
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,810
And you can use this mini project to get
practice using some of the child even

15
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:46,070
listener code.

16
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:49,455
This is all optional, but if you'd like
to get some practice writing code with

17
00:00:49,455 --> 00:00:52,739
some ChildEventListeners, I'd suggest
taking a deep dive into the code of

18
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:55,880
the Firebase Array and
Firebase listed after classes.

19
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:58,400
It'll also make it a bit more clear
about how the internals of these

20
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,570
classes work.

21
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:01,590
I'll send over my code now and
you can take a look.
