1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,900
Starting with the top red box, it looks like it takes up the entire row and

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:05,630
contains a few elements inside of it.

3
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:07,010
So, this one's going to be row.

4
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:08,430
Let's look at the top blue box.

5
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:09,800
It contains a name and

6
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:12,940
title, and it looks like it's taking up about half of this whole row.

7
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:15,150
As a result, I'm going to put column 6.

8
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:17,670
However, this box could be larger than 6 wide.

9
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:21,140
Because the text is right aligned, if this box were over here, or

10
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:23,620
if it expanded over here, it'd still look the same.

11
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:25,950
So your answer could be larger than column 6, but

12
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:27,450
it's definitely no larger than column 10.

13
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:30,340
For the bottom red box, it's taking up the entire row and

14
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:33,050
it contains some columns inside of it, so, once again we have a row.

15
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:36,950
And then for the bottom blue box here, it's taking up a third of this row.

16
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:40,205
A third of twelve is four, so this is going to be column 4.
