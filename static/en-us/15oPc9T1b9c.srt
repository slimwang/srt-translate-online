1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:04,920
Okay Michael whats the answer? Let's start with resigner resigner.

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:07,900
>> Alright, resigner resigner. Resign resigner diner.

3
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:12,200
Alright, E, so resigner vs resigner. So resinger,

4
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:18,910
if A is a resigner that means whenever A gets a red card A resigns. Yes.

5
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:21,065
>> And that would be a negative 20.

6
00:00:21,065 --> 00:00:21,460
>> Yep.

7
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:25,400
>> But that's not going to be the answer is it. Because A

8
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,460
doesn't always, A doesn't always get a red card A

9
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:30,490
sometimes gets a black card if A gets a black

10
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:33,740
card [CROSSTALK] than a resigner, resigner that means B is

11
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:36,582
going to resign and, and a plus 10 will happen.

12
00:00:36,582 --> 00:00:37,140
>> Mm-hm.

13
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:42,362
>> So those are the two possibilities and they're equally likely, so it's a

14
00:00:42,362 --> 00:00:46,290
minus 10 divided by 2 which is minus 5. Right. You were correct, sir.

15
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:47,860
>> Whew. Alright.

16
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:49,830
>> Which one do you want to do next?

17
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:50,600
>> Resigner seer.

18
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,110
>> Okay.

19
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:55,330
>> So again, oh, so the, yeah, good. This is a good choice, because

20
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:58,860
now it's the same as argument as before, except for when we end up in

21
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:02,960
that far right node, and that means minus 20 in half the cases, plus 30

22
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,720
in half the cases Which is a plus 10 divided by 2, or plus 5.

23
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:10,380
>> That's exactly right. Well done Michael.

24
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:11,550
>> Thanks.

25
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:13,340
>> Okay which one next?

26
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:15,470
>> So holder resigner. So holder reigner.

27
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:20,260
That means when A, gets a card. A is going to hold the card.

28
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:20,561
>> Mm-hm.

29
00:01:20,561 --> 00:01:22,610
>> And that's true, red or black.

30
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:22,910
>> Yep.

31
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:25,910
>> And then, then, it's going to be B's turn, and B is

32
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:29,120
going to, oh, we're doing holder resigner. So, it's going to resign.

33
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:29,535
>> Mm-hm.

34
00:01:29,535 --> 00:01:32,750
>> So, oh, well, interestingly, I think that takes us

35
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:34,490
to those two leaves, both of which are plus ten.

36
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:34,810
>> Yep.

37
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:37,210
>> Because, why does that make sense?

38
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:39,810
Because B, oh, 'cause B doesn't get any,

39
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:43,230
no. Right, right, right, because it's independent of the

40
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:44,900
card. You actually said that when you explained the rules.

41
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:45,795
>> Mm-hm.

42
00:01:45,795 --> 00:01:48,800
>> So its, its average of plus 10 and plus 10, which ought to be plus 10.

43
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:53,011
>> It is in fact plus 10. Well done. Okay what about holder's here?

44
00:01:53,011 --> 00:01:58,126
>> Whew, alright, so that's a case where A holds so we go down those

45
00:01:58,126 --> 00:02:03,940
branches and we end up, we always end up in one of the blue circled states.

46
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:05,720
>> Yep. And

47
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:09,889
B sees half the time that leads to minus 40, half the time that leads

48
00:02:09,889 --> 00:02:15,050
to plus 30. So that's minus 10 divided by 2, which is minus 5 again?

49
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:17,790
>> Yeah, that's exactly right. So that's

50
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:20,330
correct, Michael. And that's pretty cool, isn't it?

51
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:22,950
>> Yeah, I really like this game. I didn't think you could

52
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:26,450
have anything that had sort of poker essence and be this tiny.

53
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:27,970
>> So yeah, so we live in this really nice

54
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:31,410
little structure here. So I have a question for you.

55
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:32,140
You ready for the question?

56
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:34,130
>> I'm trying to guess what it is, but sure.

57
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:38,330
>> Okay, here's my question. What is the value of this game?

58
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:40,830
>> I was thinking that you might ask that. So,

59
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:42,520
can I, can I step through it, is that okay?

60
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:46,300
>> Yeah, sure, go ahead. So a's choosing the first row or

61
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,750
the second row. So if a chooses the first row, and then

62
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:53,150
b chooses the column, then if it's the first row, then b

63
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:56,620
is going to choose the first column. So a's going to get minus 5.

64
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:58,133
>> Mm-hm.

65
00:02:58,133 --> 00:03:01,260
>> The same story's going to go through on the bottom row. If a chooses

66
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:03,300
the bottom row, then b's going to choose

67
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,640
the seer position which gets the minus 5.

68
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:09,170
>> Right. So from this so, it seems that the value of the

69
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:12,030
games minus 5. But now let's do the same thing on the b column.

70
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:17,250
So if V, resigns, now a gets to choose resign or holder. And

71
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:21,830
it gets a plus 10. And if B is a sire. Then A chooses

72
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:24,253
between re signer and holder and gets plus 5.

73
00:03:24,253 --> 00:03:24,570
>> Yes.

74
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:26,470
>> So then from this perspective, the value

75
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:29,050
of the game is plus 5. So, so here's

76
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:31,400
a case where it better not be that

77
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,730
we could take a perfect information game and put

78
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:35,610
it into a matrix and get this out,

79
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:38,090
because this is something that can't, like, it doesn't,

80
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:39,860
it doesn't fit your theorem, right? We can't get

81
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:42,220
the value of it by doing minimax or maximin.

82
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:43,870
>> Exactly, the problem here is that once

83
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:46,900
you move the hidden information. Minimax is not

84
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,600
necessarily, and in this case, definitely is

85
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,130
not equal to maximin. So von Neumann.

86
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:52,150
>> Fails.

87
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:52,690
>> As we all see.

88
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:53,290
>> Idiot.

89
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:54,410
>> Yeah, what has, what has he ever

90
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:57,460
done for us, anyway? His theorems and his computer

91
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:00,400
architecture that rules the world. Anyway, so we

92
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,290
seem to have a problem here. And the problem

93
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:04,320
is that once we go to this hidden

94
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:07,750
information, as I promise complexity enters in Michael, and

95
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,680
now we can't do something very simple with

96
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,990
the matrix, find a pure strategy that's going to work.

97
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:16,470
It really is the case that A strategy depends upon what B will do and

98
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:18,410
B strategy depends upon what A will do.

99
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:19,579
And if you don't already know what that's

100
00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:22,980
going to be, you don't actually have a value for the game. And in some sense

101
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:24,880
you can get every single one of these

102
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,269
values. So, there's got to be some [INAUDIBLE].

103
00:04:27,269 --> 00:04:29,200
>> I feel like, that's sort of what you'd

104
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,390
expect in a game like this. Right. So, if, because

105
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:32,950
of the way that it is. If you know that

106
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:37,330
I'm always a resigner. That I'm always going to, what?

107
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:39,560
[LAUGH] Oh, that when ever I have a

108
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:43,170
red card, I'm going to resign, then. You know

109
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:46,370
that if I don't resign, I have a black card, so you know that you should resign.

110
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:47,301
>> Mm-hm.

111
00:04:47,301 --> 00:04:50,580
>> Yeah, so it's, it's, it's one of these things where if I

112
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:55,930
am really consistent and never bluff, say, then you can take advantage of

113
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:58,620
me, and vice versa. Like, if you always respond the same way to

114
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:02,490
when I act a certain way, then I can manipulate that. So it's kind

115
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:06,390
of like this game of this sort of mind game like I want you to

116
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:08,920
not know that I know the thing that you don't know that I don't know.

117
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:11,370
>> Right but the problem is that I know what you

118
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:13,870
know and I know that you know what I know. And that

119
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:15,520
I know that you know that I know that you know

120
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,530
that I know that you know that you know what I know.

121
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:20,360
>> Did you really think that I didn't know that?

122
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:24,870
>> [LAUGH] And so you end up in this terrible situation. But. There

123
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:27,670
was a key word that you used there, Michael, and it was consistent.

124
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:31,680
And everything we've talked about so far, pure strategies, is

125
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,480
exactly the same thing as talking about consistency. So, the way

126
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,590
we're going to get around this is, we're going to stop

127
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:40,440
being consistent, or at least, consistent in the same way. Okay?

128
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,930
>> Yeah.

129
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:43,520
>> And to cheat here, is that we are now going

130
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,770
to introduce, instead of pure strategies. Let's see the opposite of pure.

131
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:48,800
>> Is?

132
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,120
>> Impure.

133
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,630
>> Mixed, that's exactly right.

134
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:53,820
>> Contaminated.

135
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:56,220
>> No, so, rather than sticking with pure

136
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:58,850
strategies, we're going to start using mixed strategies.
