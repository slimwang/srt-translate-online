1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,060
The trickiest part of this
problem is setting it up.

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:05,510
We need to figure out the correct
placement of the values

3
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:08,600
on the left-hand side on
the butterfly network.

4
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:13,610
Even though as we go forward here,
omega is going to be negative

5
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:18,345
i instead of i because we're
doing the inverse transform.

6
00:00:18,345 --> 00:00:21,850
We need to order the values according

7
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:26,846
to the omega that was used
in the forward transform.

8
00:00:26,846 --> 00:00:34,490
So thus, omega to the 1 is i, and omega
to the third power is negative i here.

9
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:38,820
Carrying the calculation forward
a level we obtain these results here.

10
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:43,370
Then for this last level we have
4 plus 8 which is 12, good.

11
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:48,730
Then for this next one we want
omega to the first power times

12
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:54,450
this and because we're doing the inverse
transform that omega is negative i.

13
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:57,170
And that gives us this result here of 4.

14
00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:01,890
For the next one,
we multiply the odd term by negative 1.

15
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:04,420
So that gives us negative 4 here.

16
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:09,530
And for the last one we multiply
by our omega cubed which is i.

17
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:13,218
We multiply that by the odd term, and

18
00:01:13,218 --> 00:01:16,890
combining that with this
gives us a total of 8.

19
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:22,110
To get the original polynomial,
we divide by n, 4 in this case.

20
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:26,870
Thus we have that the original
polynomial was 3 plus x

21
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:30,360
minus x squared plus two X cubed.

22
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:33,280
And you can check that
that all works out.

23
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,710
Note that there is a sense in which
the ordering over here was arbitrary.

24
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:42,220
We could have done the forward
transform with omega equal to -i,

25
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:45,172
in which case I would've
flipped these and

26
00:01:45,172 --> 00:01:49,525
then the inverse transform
would've used i here and -i here.

27
00:01:49,525 --> 00:01:52,690
And that would have given
us the same result.
