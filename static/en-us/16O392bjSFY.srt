00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,820
The last question is,
what happens when you want to update?

2
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:07,750
Say Heartbleed comes out or you got
a new version of your app, what then?

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,260
Obviously, we want to update our
containers to protect our data or

4
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:14,700
to get new code out in front of users,
but

5
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:17,029
it would be risky to roll
those changes out all at once.

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,780
So instead we use queued CTO rollout.

7
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:23,160
Let's walk through an example.

8
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:28,320
In this example we're going to be
updating our Pods to a new version.

9
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,780
So we have a service with three
replicated pods, after issuing

10
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:37,980
the queued CTO roll out command for
v2 of our app, one comes online.

11
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:40,820
Then our server starts
routing traffic to it.

12
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:45,510
So we have both v1 and
v2 getting traffic at the same time.

13
00:00:46,608 --> 00:00:51,610
Next we stop routing traffic
to one of the old pods, and

14
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:52,710
then we get rid of it entirely.

15
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:58,060
At this point the cycle continues, all
the way through till we get our desired

16
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:03,540
three replicas back, at which point we
have three versions of app v2 running.

17
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:04,910
That's pretty cool.

18
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:06,770
Let's have Kelsey show
us this in practice.
