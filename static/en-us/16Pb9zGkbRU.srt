00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:03,110
Let's get animating, putting something in the render method to at last make our

2
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:08,340
drinking bird move. I've gotten things ready by structuring the geometry a bit.

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:11,298
The bird has two parts, the support, which is the legs and feet, and the

4
00:00:11,298 --> 00:00:15,998
animated part, which is the body and head. I've put the body and head into a

5
00:00:15,998 --> 00:00:21,379
new Object3D called bodyhead. Next I do a thing that javascript allows. I

6
00:00:21,379 --> 00:00:26,080
create a new parameter for the bird called animated, which I set to bodyhead.

7
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,853
In this case, I want to access the animated part of the bird in the render

8
00:00:28,853 --> 00:00:33,266
function, so for convenience I give it a separate parameter. Adding parameters

9
00:00:33,266 --> 00:00:36,940
at any time to an object is a feature of javascript. That said, it can also be

10
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:40,490
a bit annoying at times. For example, if I try to set a parameter and make a

11
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:45,510
small spelling error, I'm not told that the parameter didn't previously exist.

12
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:47,811
I could also create what I think is a new name, only to find later that I'm

13
00:00:47,811 --> 00:00:52,131
actually using an existing parameter. Long and short, be careful. Usually

14
00:00:52,131 --> 00:00:56,106
you'll find the error eventually, but the word there is eventually. Here's

15
00:00:56,106 --> 00:00:59,319
where the animation happens, we want to rotate the body around its z axis, the

16
00:00:59,319 --> 00:01:03,650
axis of the crossbar. There's a variable called tiltDirection that's either one

17
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:07,090
or negative one. If It's one, then the rotation will increase by a small

18
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:11,584
increment, half a degree per render. When the angle reaches a maximum of 103

19
00:01:11,584 --> 00:01:14,733
degrees, the object swings back the other direction by changing tilt direction

20
00:01:14,733 --> 00:01:19,872
to negative one. Whatever amount the bird has moved past 103 degrees is used to

21
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:24,208
move it the other way. Now the rotation angle is decremented by half a degree,

22
00:01:24,208 --> 00:01:27,184
until a limit of negative 22 degrees is reached, which causes it to reverse

23
00:01:27,184 --> 00:01:31,426
again. What we'd like to see is this result, with the drinking bird rotating

24
00:01:31,426 --> 00:01:35,924
around its crossbar, forward and back. We get this instead, with the drinking

25
00:01:35,924 --> 00:01:39,359
bird rotating around the origin. The problem is that we haven't set the body of

26
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:43,089
the bird to have a pivot point that is where the crossbar is located.
