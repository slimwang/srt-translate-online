1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:03,800
You don't necessarily need to have a
Computer Science degree to be successful

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:05,400
as a Ruby developer.

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,830
I went to art school, which doesn't seem
to have anything to do with code, but

4
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:11,550
it was still an extremely valuable
set of experiences that I was able to

5
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:12,800
bring with me.

6
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,860
For example, one of the most important
parts of art school is critique,

7
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:18,280
where we give each other
feedback on our work.

8
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:21,240
Through this process, I learned how
to accept and internalize criticism

9
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,110
in a way that helps me work
well with others on a team.

10
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:27,148
Think about some of your own experiences
that you're bringing with you into this

11
00:00:27,148 --> 00:00:28,560
nano degree program.

12
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,260
Whether you're coming from sales,
have worked for a family business, or

13
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:32,540
are still a student,

14
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:36,210
everyone comes to code with some sort
of transferable skill or knowledge.

15
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:38,790
Take a moment to reflect on some
of your own transferable skills.
