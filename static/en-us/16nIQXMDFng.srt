1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,807
So in this case actually,

2
00:00:01,807 --> 00:00:06,282
they violated privacy because
they didn't protect users' data.

3
00:00:06,282 --> 00:00:09,061
Didn't use encryption in
certain situation where

4
00:00:09,061 --> 00:00:11,588
they should have used it and
things like that.

5
00:00:11,588 --> 00:00:15,757
So remember one of the information
security of information you collect,

6
00:00:15,757 --> 00:00:19,052
the security of information
you collect from your users,

7
00:00:19,052 --> 00:00:20,544
you need to address that.

8
00:00:20,544 --> 00:00:24,110
And they were not doing a good
job with people's information.
