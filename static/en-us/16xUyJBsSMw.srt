00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:04,250
So here is a snapshot of our code. Now, we know that when we

2
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:07,420
downloaded Twilio, we got, among other things,

3
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:10,720
a folder called twilio. And inside that folder

4
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:16,129
is a folder called rest. Inside rest, is a python file, which has a

5
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:20,645
class called TwilioRestClient. Now, when we say

6
00:00:20,645 --> 00:00:26,030
rest.TwilioRestClient, with those parentheses after the class name,

7
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:28,330
what we are really doing is calling the

8
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:31,860
init function defined inside the class. And that creates

9
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:35,090
an instance. We call that instance client, and

10
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:36,480
then we do a bunch of stuff with that

11
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,875
instance, like send SMSes. Now, we know that

12
00:00:39,875 --> 00:00:43,390
TwilioRestClient is a class. And we've seen another class

13
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:47,200
before which is class Turtle. Let's figure out

14
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,660
if there are any similarities between these two classes.
