1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,380
All right, let's find out which of
these functions print, and which don't.

2
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:05,820
Let's start with the function double 1.

3
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:08,220
If you look at the code for
this function,

4
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:10,770
you don't even see a print statement.

5
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:14,296
All we do is return two times
the variable x that's passed in, so

6
00:00:14,296 --> 00:00:16,439
double1 clearly doesn't print.

7
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,410
Taking a look at the function double2,
we see only one line of code,

8
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:24,490
which prints two times
whatever the variable x is.

9
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:27,780
So we can check double two off
as a function that prints.

10
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:30,640
The function double3 is a bit trickier.

11
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,800
Although the second line prints
two times the variable x,

12
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:38,010
this line of code will never be executed
no matter what's passed in for x.

13
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:40,090
The reason is because of
the order we have our print and

14
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:41,800
our term statements in.

15
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:45,310
And Python and a fair amount of other
programming languages you may encounter,

16
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:47,850
once their return statement is executed,

17
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:50,560
no other lines of code
after it will be run.

18
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,790
So, the function double3 does not print.

19
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,980
Our final function,
double4, will print though.

20
00:00:58,130 --> 00:00:59,020
The order of the print and

21
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:03,300
return statements is switched,
which makes all the difference.

22
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,940
The first line of code
prints two times x,

23
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:08,010
and the second line returns two times x.

24
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:10,090
So, the function double4 prints.
