00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,540
I'm going to walk you through
my thought process on how I

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:06,950
built this responsive
weather forecast page.

3
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:10,650
Typically, when I'm trying to pick
my breakpoints, I'll start in

4
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:16,379
my desktop browser with my viewport
set as small as I can get it.

5
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:20,060
I also like to have the Chrome DevTools
open because it shows me

6
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:25,290
the screen width in the upper right-hand
corner as I resize the window.

7
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:28,880
Next, I'll slowly start
resizing the window,

8
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:33,570
looking to see when the content
tells me that it wants a breakpoint.

9
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:35,850
And probably somewhere here,

10
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:40,280
at about the 550 pixel mark,
looks like a good place.

11
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,510
Anything wider and

12
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:45,730
the spaces between these columns
are going to become too big.

13
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:49,389
In my code,
I've already got my viewport set and

14
00:00:49,389 --> 00:00:54,221
a default set of styles that
are applied for any viewport width.

15
00:00:54,221 --> 00:01:01,410
I'll add weather-medium.css to the head
with a media query that checks for

16
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:07,501
a screen and if the viewport
width is greater than 550 pixels.

17
00:01:07,501 --> 00:01:08,169
Great.

18
00:01:08,169 --> 00:01:14,341
I'll switch back to the browser,
hit Refresh, and start to resize.

19
00:01:14,341 --> 00:01:15,176
Perfect.

20
00:01:15,176 --> 00:01:19,380
At 550 pixels,
things look exactly like I expect.

21
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:23,250
Because that breakpoint
was only at 550 pixels,

22
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,920
I think I probably
want to add another one.

23
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,930
Otherwise, we'll run into
the same problem with too much

24
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:30,850
space between columns.

25
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:34,590
I easily have a room for
another one since most desktops and

26
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:37,390
laptops are significantly
wider than 550 pixels.

27
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:42,720
I'll go through the same process, and
I'll continue to expand the viewport

28
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,480
until it looks like I
need another breakpoint.

29
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,200
Again, I'm looking for

30
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:52,450
a place where the content tells
me that it wants a breakpoint.

31
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:55,880
700 pixels looks to be right
about the right place.

32
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:59,360
So, I'm going to go ahead and
add one here.

33
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,760
Again, I'll add a new style sheet,
but this time,

34
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,590
point it at weather-large.css.

35
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:08,120
It'll check for screen and

36
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:12,525
check to see if the viewport
width is at least 700 pixels.

37
00:02:12,525 --> 00:02:17,540
A quick refresh in the browser and
resize.

38
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:19,260
And we've got it.

39
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:21,080
Things are looking good.

40
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,783
I could keep adding breakpoints, but

41
00:02:23,783 --> 00:02:29,021
in this case, I think having two
breakpoints is enough, essentially one

42
00:02:29,021 --> 00:02:35,360
at a small viewport, one at a medium
viewport, and one at a large viewport.

43
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,730
Okay, that's enough of me talking.

44
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:39,520
Now it's your turn to give it a try.
