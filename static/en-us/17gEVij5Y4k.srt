We're getting pretty close to the end of this class, so congratulations on making it this far.

2
00:00:03,852 --> 00:00:07,309
Now one of the most challenging skills in all of GPU computing.

3
00:00:07,309 --> 00:00:10,445
is trying to parallelize a problem that you've never seen before,

4
00:00:10,445 --> 00:00:15,016
so what we're going to do today is look at several examples of interesting applications where we've done that.

5
00:00:15,016 --> 00:00:19,379
Hopefully this is going to give you a few more tools in your GPU computing toolbox.

6
00:00:19,379 --> 00:00:21,899
So let's get started.
