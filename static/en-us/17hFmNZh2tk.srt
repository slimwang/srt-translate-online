1
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:04,130
Add preference status to the summary
of the location preference in

2
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:05,520
SettingsActivity.

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,090
First of all, add strings for
the different statuses.

4
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:13,560
Secondly, add code to
onPreferenceChange to show the status.

5
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:15,030
To make it a bit easier,

6
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:18,050
I've included the strings I
used in the instructor notes.

7
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:22,070
Note that I only handle the invalid
location, and the validating location

8
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:25,370
statuses, because any other
state should be transient.
