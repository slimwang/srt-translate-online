00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,868
We have been talking a lot of about interfaces and how useful they are, now I

2
00:00:03,868 --> 00:00:07,467
would like to bring up a related topic called inheritance, and interface

3
00:00:07,467 --> 00:00:13,249
specifies behavior that the class that implements it should exhibit.

4
00:00:13,249 --> 00:00:16,849
Inheritance can do a little better than that, when a class inherits from

5
00:00:16,849 --> 00:00:21,631
another class it picks up behavior and data. Here is an example of a set of

6
00:00:21,631 --> 00:00:27,093
classes, where one would probably use inheritance, to model them. We have a

7
00:00:27,093 --> 00:00:32,331
class vehicle, it's a very general class. A car is a special kind of a vehicle,

8
00:00:32,331 --> 00:00:37,663
a motorcycle is another kind of a vehicle, a truck is a kind of vehicle. And an

9
00:00:37,663 --> 00:00:42,532
SUV is a kind of car. Now you would use inheritance not interfaces in this

10
00:00:42,532 --> 00:00:48,058
situation because you could put common data into the vehicle class. Such as the

11
00:00:48,058 --> 00:00:53,297
weight of the vehicle, the number of wheels, things like that. Now you might

12
00:00:53,297 --> 00:00:57,270
say why not always use inheritance? It seems better. But there are two issues

13
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:01,016
with it. One is, it is complex, and also a class can only inherit from one

14
00:01:01,016 --> 00:01:07,410
class, whereas a class can implement as many interfaces as it likes. A bit of

15
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:12,030
terminology, the class from which one inherits is called the super-class, and

16
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:18,265
the class that does the inheriting is called the sub-class. We would say truck

17
00:01:18,265 --> 00:01:24,947
is a sub-class of vehicle. Vehicle, has a super-class, of truck. Just to see

18
00:01:24,947 --> 00:01:27,700
that you're paying attention, let me ask you, what are the sub-classes of car?

19
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:29,735
What are the super-classes of car, the sub-classes of SUV, and the

20
00:01:29,735 --> 00:01:34,595
super-classes of SUV, in our inheritance hierarchy over here? Just put your

21
00:01:34,595 --> 00:01:40,070
answers into these boxes.
