1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:05,980
In addition to the three main features, there's some other relatively lesser,

2
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:10,640
less used features of OCL that I just wanted to mention.

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:14,450
There's the concept of tuples. This is similar to what you would do in

4
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:17,179
a programming language where you would have structs or records.

5
00:00:18,225 --> 00:00:24,070
There are frenzy enumerations that you see in, in Java and other languages.

6
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:29,275
There's the ability to express messages. We haven't gone into this as much but

7
00:00:29,275 --> 00:00:34,330
in UML diagrams, you can express messages. There's access to the UML meta model.

8
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:40,070
And there's the concept little word concept of automatic flattening.

9
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:47,160
Say, we did our navigation, and along the way we came upon two situations,

10
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:51,750
two associations which were have many participants in them.

11
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:56,040
So we might end up with a set of sets, or a set of bags, or

12
00:00:56,040 --> 00:01:00,960
something like that. OCL has made the decision to do automatic flattening,

13
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,048
that says if you have a set of sets, you just get one set.

14
00:01:04,048 --> 00:01:08,640
You don't in your syntax have to express two levels of access in order to get at

15
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,650
the contents. This can make it a little bit easier to write your expressions.
