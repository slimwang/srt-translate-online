00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,778
Now, we're going to move away from the distance formula and the Pythagorean

2
00:00:03,778 --> 00:00:08,180
theorem. We'll still use the Pythagorean theorem in this upcoming lesson, but

3
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:12,617
we'll use it for circles. We're almost to the end of the course, but before we

4
00:00:12,617 --> 00:00:18,415
get to that end, let's talk about the end of a string. Here's a string of

5
00:00:18,415 --> 00:00:22,648
unknown length. Now, I'm not going to tell you what length it is yet. You're

6
00:00:22,648 --> 00:00:25,934
actually going to calculate that yourself, we're going to take this string and

7
00:00:25,934 --> 00:00:31,509
place it on a coordinate grid. Notice that I have one end of the string at the

8
00:00:31,509 --> 00:00:36,778
origin 0, 0. The horizontal distance from the center which is the origin to the

9
00:00:36,778 --> 00:00:43,518
end of the string is 40 centimeters, that's this distance. And the vertical

10
00:00:43,518 --> 00:00:49,633
distance from the origin to the end of the string is 30 centimeters. So,

11
00:00:49,633 --> 00:00:53,354
knowing this horizontal distance, and this vertical distance, what x, y

12
00:00:53,354 --> 00:00:59,244
coordinate can describe the position of the end of this string? Write that

13
00:00:59,244 --> 00:01:03,307
answer here. Once you've done that, I want you to try and figure out the length

14
00:01:03,307 --> 00:01:07,610
of the string. How long is this? Write that answer here.
