1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:04,810
At this point you should know what
monetization method you want to use, and

2
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:06,300
how you'll implement it.

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:08,670
You might also have a plan
B in the back of your head,

4
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:11,210
in case that first one doesn't work out.

5
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:13,610
And you should also have a plan for
tracking and

6
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:15,110
measuring the success of your model.

7
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:20,630
>> Keep in mind, you can apply the user
segment to creating the previous unit

8
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:22,370
to any of these reports.

9
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:26,410
This will help you get insights per
group, which is much more accurate.

10
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:29,670
As Yogi Berra said,
you can observe a lot just by watching.

11
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:32,110
In our world, keep watching your users.

12
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:34,080
>> In the next lesson,

13
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:37,250
you'll learn how to iterate on your
monetization model, changing your

14
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:39,920
approach when you're not making
the amount of money that you need to.
