00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
With the help of this analogy between gravity and water

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:10,000
analyse this case -- a huge spherical object of constant density

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
in which we drill a hole that's half the radius deep.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Now we put a test mass on the surface, blue position,

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
and in that hole, red position.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
What's the ratio of the force of gravity in the blue position

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
to the force of gravity in the red position.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Are these two forces equal?

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Do we have twice the force at the surface or do we have twice the force at the inner point?

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Or is it four times on the outside or four times at this inner position?
