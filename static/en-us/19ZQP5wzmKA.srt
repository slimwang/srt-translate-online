1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,155
154 is one standard diviation below the mean. So we're trying to find out what

2
00:00:05,155 --> 00:00:10,358
proportion of people are in this green region. Well, let's start with what we

3
00:00:10,358 --> 00:00:15,518
know. We know that 34% is between one standard devaition below the mean and the

4
00:00:15,518 --> 00:00:21,116
mean. And 34% is between the mean and one standard deviation above the mean. The

5
00:00:21,116 --> 00:00:27,610
mean because that makes 68% here. And we also know that 95% is between two

6
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:34,306
center deviations below the mean and two above the mean, 95 minus 68 is 27 so

7
00:00:34,306 --> 00:00:41,423
27% is distributed between this area and this area meaning that 13.5% is here.

8
00:00:41,424 --> 00:00:47,377
And 13.5% is here, And you already found that, that leaves 5% to be distributed

9
00:00:47,377 --> 00:00:53,383
between the two tails, below two center deviations below the mean and above two

10
00:00:53,383 --> 00:00:59,180
center deviations above the mean. So we know here, this is 2.5% and this is

11
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:07,450
2.5%. Now, we pretty much have our answer. 13.5% plus 2.5% is 16%, so that's a

12
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:10,400
proportion of 0.16.
