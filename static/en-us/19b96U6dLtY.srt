00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:04,950
Why don't you try operating on our Sochi medal count data in a vectorized way?

2
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:09,480
Using pandas, numpy, and the dataframe's apply method, create a new dataframe

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:13,740
called avg_medal_count that indicates the average number of gold, silver and

4
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:16,530
bronze medals that were earned amongst countries who earned at

5
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:20,480
least one medal at the 2014 Sochi olympics.

00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,560
Your code should go here.
