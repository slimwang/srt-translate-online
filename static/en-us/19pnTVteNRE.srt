1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,972
Now at certain points in the course you may need to enter coordinate pairs using

2
00:00:03,972 --> 00:00:07,932
of course typical coordinate notation with parenthesis around the outside of

3
00:00:07,932 --> 00:00:12,242
them that contain fractions for the coordinate values. This is actually a little

4
00:00:12,242 --> 00:00:16,495
bit tricky to do in mathquill so we are going to talk about who you do this. I'm

5
00:00:16,495 --> 00:00:20,290
going to tell you exactly how to type this out. So let's say that we wanted to

6
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:23,988
type. So, let's say that this is the order pair that we want to type. 3 over 4,

7
00:00:23,988 --> 00:00:27,527
negative 1 and a half. I'm going to tell you exactly what keys to press. And

8
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:31,266
then what will appear as you type each one of them. So, the first thing we have

9
00:00:31,266 --> 00:00:35,355
is this open parentheses. But when you type that, both parentheses appear. The

10
00:00:35,355 --> 00:00:39,184
next step is to type a forward slash. At which point, the space inside the two

11
00:00:39,184 --> 00:00:43,056
parentheses, will turn into the input for a fraction. So there will be a line,

12
00:00:43,056 --> 00:00:46,970
and a space for you to enter the numerator and the denominator. Your cursor at

13
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:50,867
this point will be in the numerator. And as unintuitive as it might seem, what

14
00:00:50,867 --> 00:00:54,222
we want to do, is to get the cursor to be right here, inside the first

15
00:00:54,222 --> 00:00:58,398
parentheses. But before we have the option to type inside the fraction. So you

16
00:00:58,398 --> 00:01:02,325
just need to type a left arrow key to move the cursor over here. Then you can

17
00:01:02,325 --> 00:01:06,518
type a comma, which will be the comma between our two coordinates. At this point

18
00:01:06,518 --> 00:01:10,642
your cursor will be right here, between the comma and the fraction spot. So you

19
00:01:10,642 --> 00:01:14,678
need to type the left arrow key to move it back here. Now we just need to create

20
00:01:14,678 --> 00:01:18,853
the first coordinate. Then you need to type a forward slash again. Which will

21
00:01:18,853 --> 00:01:22,558
create another spot for a fraction to be input. And then you can use the arrow

22
00:01:22,558 --> 00:01:26,038
keys as you normally would between fractions to go to each numerator and

23
00:01:26,038 --> 00:01:29,833
denominator and enter the values that you want to. So you can see that whats

24
00:01:29,833 --> 00:01:33,314
happening here, in terms of the order that things appeared in over here

25
00:01:33,314 --> 00:01:37,090
depending on what I told you to type, that you have to actually create the spot

26
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:41,006
for the Second coordinate as a fraction before you create the first one. If you

27
00:01:41,006 --> 00:01:44,803
try to create one fraction and then put a comma, it's not going to work. Another

28
00:01:44,803 --> 00:01:48,451
option would be for you to create two separate fraction spots and then move to

29
00:01:48,451 --> 00:01:51,987
the spot between the two of them and then put a comma. This is just a way that

30
00:01:51,987 --> 00:01:55,614
works really easily for me. But of course, as always, you can experiment and

31
00:01:55,614 --> 00:01:59,592
figure out what works best for you. So, thinking about how you create 2

32
00:01:59,592 --> 00:02:04,007
coordinates that are each fractions. I'd like you to try out typing each of

33
00:02:04,007 --> 00:02:08,303
these coordinate pairs. First one we have is 3 4ths, negative 1 half. Then we

34
00:02:08,303 --> 00:02:12,707
have 1, 2 over 7. And then we have negative 1 8th, 3. So just play around with

35
00:02:12,707 --> 00:02:16,210
these, and see if you can get comfortable with this format.
