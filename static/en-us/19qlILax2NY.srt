00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,643
So, the first thing we need to know about the Nervous System is that it's

2
00:00:03,643 --> 00:00:09,008
divided into two main parts. We have the Central Nervous System, also known as

3
00:00:09,008 --> 00:00:16,680
the CNS for short. And we have the Peripheral Nervous System, or PNS for short.

4
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:20,759
The Central Nervous System is comprised of the brain and the spinal cord. And

5
00:00:20,759 --> 00:00:24,854
the Peripheral Nervous System is comprised of the nerve cells in the body that

6
00:00:24,854 --> 00:00:29,729
are outside of the central nervous system. Here, let's take closer look at the

7
00:00:29,729 --> 00:00:33,363
Peripheral Nervous System. It's further divided into the Somatic Nervous

8
00:00:33,363 --> 00:00:38,230
System. And this is responsible for transmitting sensory information, such as

9
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:43,980
sight, smell or even touch to the brain and the spinal cord. Or from the brain

10
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:48,788
and the spinal cord to the skeletal muscles. The second half of the Peripheral

11
00:00:48,788 --> 00:00:53,080
Nervous System is the autonomic nervous system, as we see here. This system is

12
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:57,277
in charge of our involuntary systems. Such as our internal organs, like our

13
00:00:57,277 --> 00:01:01,260
heart or lungs. Or the glands, like our adrenal gland.
