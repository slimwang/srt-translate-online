1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,751
So for Step 2,
create a local GoogleApiClient, and

2
00:00:03,751 --> 00:00:06,643
a helper function that's
used to build it.

3
00:00:06,643 --> 00:00:09,338
Make sure that you add
the connection callbacks,

4
00:00:09,338 --> 00:00:11,520
the onConnectionFailedListener, and

5
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:15,254
make sure that you're using
the PLUS.API in the Google API client.

6
00:00:15,254 --> 00:00:17,722
To set the scope for Scopes.PROFILE,

7
00:00:17,722 --> 00:00:22,002
you use .addScope(new
Scope(Scopes.PROFILE)) like this.

8
00:00:22,002 --> 00:00:26,010
Also make sure that you set the onClick
Listeners for the three buttons.

9
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:27,850
When you're done with all of this,
check this box.
