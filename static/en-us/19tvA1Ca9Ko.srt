1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
For this problem, we've calculated a sequence of numbers.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
There's a pattern in this sequence, and your job is to find

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
the next entry in the sequence.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
As with the challenge problem in Unit 1,

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
if you get the answer, please don't share it so that other people

6
00:00:12,000 --> 99:59:59,999
can have the chance to find it for themselves.
