00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,110
In this lesson, we discussed if conversion, where

2
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:06,939
we convert difficult-to-predict branches into code that is

3
00:00:06,939 --> 00:00:10,490
longer but has no branches. We also learned

4
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:13,560
about special instructions that we need for if conversion

5
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:19,220
to work. Now that we are up to speed with how control hazards are handled, we

6
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:22,030
need to learn how to handle data hazards

7
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:24,860
while keeping a good instruction flow in our pipeline.
