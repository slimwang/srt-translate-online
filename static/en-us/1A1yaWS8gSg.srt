00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Maybe somewhat surprisingly, the left model that of Ptolemy has so many knobs to turn

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
that it allows more flexible calibration and that it even allows

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
more accurate prediction of the apparent motion.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Footnote--in a modern perspective, this stack of epicycles actually is a Fourier series.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Historically, it turned out that circles around the sun are not good enough.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Kepler noticed that you have to use ellipses to make this really work and then we get a high accuracy.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The lesson to be learned from that is you may want to replace a sophisticated model

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
with accurate predictions by a far simpler model, less accurate predictions,

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
just for the sake of understanding.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 99:59:59,999
This is Occam's Razor in action, trying to find the most simple explanation that does the job.
