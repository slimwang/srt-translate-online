00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:04,830
You may have noticed code snippets using
set large icon for a notification.

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:08,390
Android Wear automatically uses
these as the background image.

3
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:13,310
However, the android framework only
uses a 64x64 pixel version of the image,

4
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:18,210
since it is normally shown quite small
in the notification shade on a handheld.

5
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:22,124
The wearable extender provides
a method called setBackground.

6
00:00:22,124 --> 00:00:26,014
This method can handle high resolution
images, such as mBitmap here, and

7
00:00:26,014 --> 00:00:29,670
send them directly to the wearable so
they'll appear nice and sharp.

8
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:31,980
However, make sure that the image
you provide is not too large.

9
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:36,520
If it is too big, you can overwhelm
the memory in the small wearable device.

10
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:39,660
Instead, we recommend
that you provide 400 x

11
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:41,848
400 sized images if you
want a static background.

12
00:00:41,848 --> 00:00:46,890
And 640 x 400 if you want to have image
parallax added, where the left and

13
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:50,170
right edges are used to
simulate background movement.

14
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:54,560
Make sure that you store these resources
in the drawable-nodpi directory to

15
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:57,410
insure the framework does
not try to resize them.
