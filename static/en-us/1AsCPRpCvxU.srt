1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:01,819
What else can we do?

2
00:00:01,819 --> 00:00:08,130
Well, if I can warp between planes, arbitrary planes,

3
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:13,070
that means that I can take planes that, say, are in some particular orientation,

4
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:16,500
and think about what would they look like turned in a different orientation.

5
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:20,290
So here we have a si, a situation where we've got a plane,

6
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:23,185
that's the side of this building, I'm assuming the building is more or

7
00:00:23,185 --> 00:00:26,150
less planar, and I'd like to rectify that.

8
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:27,880
That is, I want to remove the slant.

9
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:29,890
So you see this window here.

10
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:34,260
All right, you see how if I were to extend out, these are vanishing point lines.

11
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:37,960
All right, so these are not parallel, they're going to converge,

12
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:38,610
you can see that here.

13
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:40,300
They'll converge all the way out there.

14
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:42,140
All right, but if they were,

15
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:46,290
if it was frontal parallel, then they would remain as parallel lines.

16
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:50,060
Well, if we could compute the relationship between this quadrilateral,

17
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:52,430
which is essentially like a trapezoid, between that and

18
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:57,290
a rectangle, we would be able to rectify the entire building.

19
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:59,430
And in fact that would look like this.

20
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:02,370
At which point you're supposed to say, ooh, that's cool.

21
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:04,280
>> Ooh, that's cool.

22
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,040
>> Very good.

23
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,220
So here's the corrected image where now everything is rectilinear.

24
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:11,060
And in fact, if you take a look at these windows.

25
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:13,980
In fact notice that these are sort of narrow windows here, and

26
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:16,490
wide windows here, and narrow windows there.

27
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:19,190
If you want to think about that from a measurement perspective,

28
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:22,330
you can see that the, the windows that are sort of

29
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:26,210
two panes wide were narrower than the ones that are three panes wide.

30
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:30,100
Even though clearly this is wider than this in the image, but

31
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:33,940
when I rectified it I was able to measure the whole thing.

32
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:35,850
Show you another example of that.

33
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:37,370
So here's a picture.

34
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:40,145
Suppose you want to measure something, let's say you start with on the floor,

35
00:01:40,145 --> 00:01:43,890
okay, so something about across what's on the floor.

36
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:48,730
Well, so they have tiles, and those tiles are actually rectangles.

37
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:55,820
So I could unwarp this picture so that those tiles are now squares.

38
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:56,360
Because they're,

39
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:00,180
let's say nine by nine inch squares, which is some number of centimeters.

40
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:05,290
9 times 2.54, it's 18 to 4 and a-half, I don't know, 23, 24 centimeters?

41
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:09,190
Anyway, I can rectify that image and then I can go ahead and

42
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:14,860
I can measure in that new image directly about the tiles.

43
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:18,350
likewise, if I wanted to measure something on the side of this wall, and

44
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:19,880
that's a planar surface also.

45
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:22,470
It happens to be very skewed.

46
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:23,660
I could rectify that.

47
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:25,360
And here, I've taken that wall, and

48
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,450
I've spread it back out to being rectangular.

49
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:29,630
Actually, I didn't, the person I stole the slide from did.

50
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:32,240
And I can now measure on that.

51
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,840
And what kind of warp is this?

52
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,340
What kind of transformation?

53
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:36,510
Plane to a plane.

54
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:39,390
That's right, it's your friend, the homography.

55
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:43,200
Just to show you what I was talking about from not from quadrilaterals to

56
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:49,830
rectangles, here on the left hand side I've identified four points.

57
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:54,250
And you can see those four points are the four corners of a two by

58
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:55,940
two tile matrix.

59
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:58,120
But of course, the points aren't rectangular because of

60
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,020
perspective foreshortening, right?

61
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:06,620
But I can warp that to being a regular square or rectangle.

62
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:09,700
And the rest of the image will come along for the ride.
