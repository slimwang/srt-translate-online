00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:01,010
Hey Charles.

2
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:02,220
>> Hey Michael, how's it going?

3
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:03,680
>> It's not going too badly.

4
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:04,630
I'm kind of excited.

5
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:06,710
because what we're going to
do in this section,

6
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:09,470
is take the previous two sections and
kind of mash them up.

7
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:11,460
>> Oh, I like that.
I always liked mashed sections.

8
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:14,120
>> So, in particular, we're going to
use some of the ideas from convergence

9
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:17,280
to better understand value iteration,
linear programming, and

10
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,310
policy iteration,
three algorithms for solving MVPs.

11
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:24,560
So I decided we could call it
Advanced Algorithmic Analysis, or AAA.

12
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:25,110
>> Oh, I like that.

13
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:27,370
And I like that you have a scarlet A.

14
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:29,340
>> Yes.

15
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:30,800
>> That's a nice allusion.

16
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,259
>> That's another A.

17
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:32,759
>> Yes.
