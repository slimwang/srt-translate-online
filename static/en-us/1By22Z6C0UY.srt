1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
This exercise describes a game played between

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
the federal reserve board and politicians.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Now the politicians have a choice whether they want to contract fiscal policy,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
expand it, or do nothing, and the Fed has the same three choices.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Each party has preference for what outcome they would like to see.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Here we've ranked them for each party from 1 being the worst outcome

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
to 9 being the best outcome.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
What I want you is find the equilibrium point for this game.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
There will be one equilibrium point. I want you to find it.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
The equilibrium point defines a pure strategy for each player.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Tell me the pure strategy for the Fed.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
It is contract, do nothing, or expand?

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Click on the right box here.

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Similarly, for the politicians, click on the right box for their strategy,

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
which leads to the equilibrium point.

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Then tell me the outcome for the game for each player for that equilibrium point.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Then tell me if the equilibrium is Pareto optimal.
