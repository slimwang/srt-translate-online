00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:06,590
If your app lets people buy things, you
can use analytics to track how well your

2
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:12,220
app is doing at getting them to view
products, put things in the shopping

3
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:18,420
cart, go through the checkout process,
and close the deal with a purchase.

4
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:21,930
The first step in tracking how users
navigate to the shopping steps

5
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:25,140
is to enable Enhanced Ecommerce
in the Admin tab.

6
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:33,110
So, in the Admin tab >
View > Ecommerce Settings.

7
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:36,298
You enable Ecommerce,
just switch the status to on and

8
00:00:36,298 --> 00:00:37,766
then go to the Next step.

9
00:00:37,766 --> 00:00:42,248
And then you enable Enhanced Ecommerce,
switch it on.

10
00:00:42,248 --> 00:00:45,336
For now don't worry about the Checkout
Labeling or the FUNNEL STEPS,

11
00:00:45,336 --> 00:00:46,811
we'll come back to those later.

12
00:00:46,811 --> 00:00:47,720
And then you Submit.

13
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,310
Oh look, it says Success.

14
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:51,600
That's nice.

15
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,720
So now it's your turn.

16
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:58,260
In the Admin tab > Ecommerce settings.

17
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:02,390
First, you enable Ecommerce, and
then you enable Enhanced Ecommerce.

18
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:10,211
And when you're done,
check here and here.
