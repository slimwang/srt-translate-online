1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:03,902
So, we've got the target and the bridge and the water command comes off the,

2
00:00:03,902 --> 00:00:11,866
the target command by just moving the target into the water. I can also ask

3
00:00:11,866 --> 00:00:17,112
Callie to go target at a distance from me, that's something I call a remote

4
00:00:17,112 --> 00:00:25,334
target. And it works just like my hand target does. Callie. Target. Hold. Where

5
00:00:25,334 --> 00:00:30,305
Callie will touch her nose to that spot. And part of the shaping of that

6
00:00:30,305 --> 00:00:35,487
behavior, good. Is that we extend the target behavior out for longer and longer

7
00:00:35,487 --> 00:00:41,924
durations of time as Callie has had a chance to master the behavior. Good. Now,

8
00:00:41,924 --> 00:00:47,336
we can add, to create more complicated behaviors, we can add more target points

9
00:00:47,336 --> 00:00:53,114
onto the animal's body. So, this is the flipper target, and I can use this

10
00:00:53,114 --> 00:00:57,470
flipper target to examine Callie's flippers and her under surface to make sure

11
00:00:57,470 --> 00:01:01,628
that there's no cuts or abrasions, or anything developing that we wouldn't

12
00:01:01,628 --> 00:01:08,405
want to see. Good. We can create a target on any place of the animal's body

13
00:01:08,405 --> 00:01:16,738
that we want. Good. And we have created even more complicated targets. Callie

14
00:01:16,738 --> 00:01:18,675
has a head target. Head.

15
00:01:18,675 --> 00:01:19,445
[LAUGH]

16
00:01:19,445 --> 00:01:23,852
Good. That I've used to create other behaviors such as this one for example,

17
00:01:23,852 --> 00:01:29,852
which is called flexible. Good. So, this is the head target that I use and I

18
00:01:29,852 --> 00:01:35,700
moved closer and closer back. Good! To create this behavior which is now on

19
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:41,037
cue. Okay, this is a new behavior for Callie, she's just learning this

20
00:01:41,037 --> 00:01:48,628
behavior, and because of that, the target pole prop is still in there. Some of

21
00:01:48,628 --> 00:01:51,702
these other behaviors no longer has the target that used to create the

22
00:01:51,702 --> 00:02:00,587
behavior. So, just like my hand target, the target pole. The end of the target

23
00:02:00,587 --> 00:02:05,134
pole is where Callie is going to put her nose. Wherever I put my target, Callie

24
00:02:05,134 --> 00:02:10,380
will put her nose. And with some practice and practicing the antecedent of the

25
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:14,604
cue, or the command, prior to the behavioral sequence that I'm forming through

26
00:02:14,604 --> 00:02:20,378
operand conditioning. I can eventually take the target pullout and she will do

27
00:02:20,378 --> 00:02:26,333
the behavior just on command because of the rehearsal history. In this case,

28
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:30,176
the behavior is not ready for the target pull to be removed yet .This is the

29
00:02:30,176 --> 00:02:37,337
back flip behavior for, which my program is famous. That is our logo. And this

30
00:02:37,337 --> 00:02:40,871
behavior is initially formed in the lower portions of the water, where the

31
00:02:40,871 --> 00:02:46,369
animal has full control. And they learn to first do the back flip here. Good.

32
00:02:46,369 --> 00:02:51,577
Then I use the target pole to lift the back flip up and hold it in position out

33
00:02:51,577 --> 00:02:59,961
of the air like so after being preceded by the antecedent cue. Flip, good,

34
00:02:59,961 --> 00:03:13,430
flip! Flip, good! And that's how you get a back flip. Good job. Way to go you!

35
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:16,959
Yeah! Good job!

36
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:17,743
[NOISE]

37
00:03:17,743 --> 00:03:27,081
Good. The benefits of animal training and husbandry, demonstrated live and in

38
00:03:27,081 --> 00:03:32,928
person by Callie the sea lion.
