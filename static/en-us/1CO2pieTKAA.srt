1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:00,901
Okay.

2
00:00:00,901 --> 00:00:02,900
So let's take a look at the big picture.

3
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:05,810
First, your app gets a reference to the ContentResolver,

4
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:09,050
which handles any provider communication that you need.

5
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:13,170
You tell the ContentResolver what content provider you're trying to access and

6
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:16,960
what data in that content provider that you're trying to manipulate.

7
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,400
I'm going to show what happens with a query example.

8
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:22,289
So first off, your app requests a ContentResolver.

9
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:25,444
It then uses the Contentresolver to start communications with your

10
00:00:25,444 --> 00:00:26,395
content provider.

11
00:00:26,395 --> 00:00:30,113
Remember, to say what content provider that you're trying to access, and

12
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:33,910
what data that you're trying to modify, you need to pass a URI.

13
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:37,290
What you're going to do to that data is designated by whatever method you

14
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:38,330
choose to call.

15
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:42,020
Since we're doing a query example, let's assume that I'm using the query method.

16
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:44,940
There's also some additional parameters that you pass with a query,

17
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:47,070
which designate what exact rows and

18
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:49,862
columns in the data source that you're interested in.

19
00:00:49,862 --> 00:00:52,530
The ContentResolver takes the URI from your app, and

20
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:55,460
just passes it on to the right content provider.

21
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:59,009
It also calls the same method that your app called on the ContentResolver onto

22
00:00:59,009 --> 00:01:00,770
the ContentProvider.

23
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:03,750
With the information from this URI, the ContentProvider and

24
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,640
the data source have a little exchange.

25
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,630
And the content provider does whatever manipulations that you told it to.

26
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:11,770
At that point we have a cursor.

27
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:14,830
And remember, that cursor gets all the way back to your app, and

28
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:17,580
it contains some of the data in the data source.

29
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:20,170
And lucky for you, this data is really easy to iterate through.

30
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:22,083
So you could do what you want with it.

31
00:01:22,083 --> 00:01:24,618
So the question is, what do you want to do do with it?

32
00:01:24,618 --> 00:01:26,483
So, as we've already discussed,

33
00:01:26,483 --> 00:01:30,525
one of the most powerful features of content providers is that they allow us to

34
00:01:30,525 --> 00:01:33,527
hook into a lot of standard Android classes seamlessly.

35
00:01:33,527 --> 00:01:37,031
I don't mean to be mean, but our UI right now is pretty ugly.

36
00:01:37,031 --> 00:01:40,506
It's also highly inefficient if we had a table with say thousands of rows and

37
00:01:40,506 --> 00:01:42,203
we're trying to scroll through it.

38
00:01:42,203 --> 00:01:42,750
All right.

39
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:44,030
So let's change all of that and

40
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:46,820
add a new list view, which is going to look a lot like this.

41
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:48,943
Of course, it's going to have your own words in it.

42
00:01:48,943 --> 00:01:53,013
This will involve adding something to your program called a cursor adapter.

43
00:01:53,013 --> 00:01:55,716
A cursor adapter is a lot like an arrayadapter.

44
00:01:55,716 --> 00:01:58,596
But instead of taking an array to populate a listview,

45
00:01:58,596 --> 00:02:01,700
we're going to use a cursor to populate that same listview.

46
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:04,940
So, after getting the cursor back from our content provider,

47
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:08,600
we can simply pass it off to an instance of simple cursor adapter,

48
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:11,320
which in turn is linked to a listview.

49
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,262
The cursor will then populate the listview.

50
00:02:13,262 --> 00:02:15,870
And all this can be done with only a few lines of code.

51
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:16,560
So let's get started.
