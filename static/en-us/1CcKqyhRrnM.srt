1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:06,800
So now we set the stage for discussing the spin and the exokernel approaches

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:11,660
to achieving extensibility of the operating system without losing out on

3
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:15,400
protection or performance. Both these approaches

4
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:19,260
start with two premises. The first premise,

5
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:22,220
is that micro-kernel based design compromises

6
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:25,670
on performance due to frequent border crossings.

7
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:30,500
And the second premise is that, monolithic design does not lend itself to

8
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:37,020
extensibility. Because of the starting premises of spin and exokernal.

9
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:41,810
Both these approaches have certain commonality in what they strive to

10
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:46,750
do, although the path taken by these two approaches are very different.
