1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,890
Applications rely on
the operating system.

2
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:04,820
So what does it really do for you?

3
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:06,320
First of all like I said before,

4
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:10,820
the hardware is actually not very easy
to use if you had to use it directly.

5
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:14,020
If you wanted to program your
applications, and had to work

6
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:17,260
with the hardware directly it's
going to be infinitely more complex.

7
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:19,790
It may be already be hard, but
it's going to be much harder.

8
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:25,210
So what the operating system does is
that it creates easier to use and high

9
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:30,600
level abstractions for the resources
that we have that the hardware provides.

10
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:34,520
For example, we know that
data that must be persistent,

11
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:37,280
it's stored on the disk in disk blocks.

12
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,380
Well we actually don't directly
work with disk blocks and

13
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:44,400
keep track of where on disk a certain
piece of information may be.

14
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,690
We have things called files.

15
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:48,300
Think of file as a high level,

16
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:52,280
where we're going to talk about
virtual resources that are created or

17
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:55,890
supported by the operating system and
made available to you.

18
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:00,520
So these high level abstractions
that we can use to access

19
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:03,270
more user-friendly
resources in some way.

20
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:06,910
Make it easier for
us to write our applications, or

21
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:09,940
build our applications that are going
to run on this computer system.

22
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:13,450
Now the resources that
we're going to provide.

23
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:14,600
The high level resources,

24
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:18,110
the operating system makes
available to the applications.

25
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:22,170
Well, they going to be implemented using
the real physical resources that we have

26
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:24,500
that the hardware provides to us.

27
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:27,340
The resources, the physical resources

28
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:30,510
are going to be shared across
these different applications.

29
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:32,990
Obviously when you have
that kind of sharing,

30
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:37,040
we need to access those resources
in a controlled fashion.

31
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:41,400
So the hardware resources are actually
managed by the operating system, and

32
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,950
access to those is going to
be controlled via it as well.

33
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:48,740
And that actually is one
of the fundamental reasons

34
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:52,520
why operating systems have such
an important role to play,

35
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:56,830
when it comes to protecting resources
and securing access to them.

36
00:01:56,830 --> 00:02:00,980
The last thing that is really
interesting and we're going to spend

37
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:05,260
a good bit of time on that, is all
the different applications or different

38
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:11,615
processes going to run on the same
system and share the resources we have.

39
00:02:11,615 --> 00:02:14,845
The physical resources that
we have between them, but

40
00:02:14,845 --> 00:02:20,515
the operating system makes each process
believe as if it's the only one running.

41
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:23,465
And it's able to do that
by providing what we call

42
00:02:23,465 --> 00:02:26,645
isolation between these
different processes.

43
00:02:26,645 --> 00:02:31,800
In some sense one process or one
application does not need to be aware of

44
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:36,840
another application, unless it
explicitly decides to interact with it.

45
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:41,050
It's sharing these physical resources,
but think about the operating system

46
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:46,020
making sure that what is being used
by one application doesn't get

47
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:50,540
used by somebody else, or
another process or another application.

48
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:54,250
So, having this isolation,
sort of giving each application,

49
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:57,060
sort of the feeling that
it is the only one running.

50
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:01,070
We should say that if they share,
of course, not each process has all

51
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:04,410
the resources, so there may be
some performance implications.

52
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:07,980
But, if you don't worry about
performance, basically each process can

53
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:12,020
believe as if it has the resources,
and the computer to itself.

54
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:15,560
So, the operating system
is actually going to create

55
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:19,840
this isolation between these different
applications, which is really important.

56
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,370
Because applications may
not trust each other, and

57
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:26,390
if they don't trust each other, they
don't want any sort of interference from

58
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:28,770
other processes that
are not trusted by them.

59
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:32,190
So this isolation that the operating
system provided isolation is actually

60
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:35,170
going to guarantee to us that
the process doesn't have to worry about

61
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:38,450
other processes, or other applications
that may be there in the system.
