1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:04,688
All right, let's start off with media only screen in max-width 500.

2
00:00:04,688 --> 00:00:09,480
In my main.css file I've added media only screen and max-width 500.

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:12,900
Okay, I've refreshed the page and let's make it smaller.

4
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:13,630
Oh, there we go.

5
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:16,260
As soon as we got below 500 pixels it disappeared.

6
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:17,840
So that one looks like it's working.

7
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,620
Next up we've got media only screen with max-width 500 and

8
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:23,710
this orientation landscape.

9
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:26,544
Now orientation here is referring to phone orientations,

10
00:00:26,544 --> 00:00:29,610
whether it's turned in landscape mode or portrait mode.

11
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:31,530
We'll save main.css.

12
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:32,740
We'll refresh Chrome.

13
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:33,970
And let's see.

14
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:34,570
Aha!

15
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:36,490
And that one's also working.

16
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:39,440
Now we've got media only screen, and min-width 500.

17
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,610
Okay, let's see.

18
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:44,620
Oh, and as soon as I refresh the page, it disappeared.

19
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:47,600
That's because this screen is bigger than 500 pixels,

20
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,090
which means that that media query got hit in paragraphs are being hidden.

21
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:55,110
Last but not least, we have media only print and with a max-width of 500.

22
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:58,240
Now print here means that these styles are only going to be

23
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,329
used if it's being printed.

24
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,240
So we'll save the page.

25
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,680
We'll refresh.

26
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:04,510
And here it is.

27
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:06,750
Let's make the screen smaller to see if it disappears.

28
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,460
And it does not.

29
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:10,340
We're not printing so

30
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:14,540
this paragraph's going to stay even if the screen is smaller than 500 pixels.

31
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:16,660
So looking at the question.

32
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:21,120
The first one made paragraphs disappear for screens smaller than 500 pixels.

33
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,800
As do the second, but the third and fourth didn't.
