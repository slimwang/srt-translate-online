1
00:00:00,044 --> 00:00:03,740
So here's a little, tiny POMDP that I've
thought about in the past that I think

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:05,461
makes makes for good illustration.

3
00:00:05,461 --> 00:00:09,265
So we've got four underlying states,
these four here,

4
00:00:09,265 --> 00:00:12,444
the four circles, and
we've got two actions.

5
00:00:12,444 --> 00:00:15,492
The actions essentially
move the agent left and

6
00:00:15,492 --> 00:00:19,923
right along this kind of hallway
type thing, with some exceptions.

7
00:00:19,923 --> 00:00:21,593
So from the green state,

8
00:00:21,593 --> 00:00:25,734
any action just resets you randomly
to one of the blue states.

9
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:29,060
And otherwise,
things move left and right.

10
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:33,350
At the end of the hallways here, these
two end states, if you try to go right

11
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:36,400
when there's no more space to go,
you just stick where you were.

12
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,090
And if you try to go left when
there's no more space to go,

13
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:39,800
you stick where you were.

14
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:43,440
And just to ground it
the rest of the way out,

15
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:48,120
actions that take you to the green
state give you a reward of one.

16
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,540
So does that makes some sense to you?

17
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:51,810
Do you do follow how this would go?

18
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:56,370
>> I do, and I just realize,
if I don't know which blue state I'm in,

19
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:58,900
this is a scary,
scary little problem to try to solve.

20
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:01,470
>> Good, so that was the thing I
guess I neglected to point out.

21
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:04,280
I'm showing the observations in
this diagram with the colors.

22
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:08,720
So let me just number the states
just for ease of referring to them.

23
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,911
We've got three states, 1, 2, 3, and 4.

24
00:01:12,911 --> 00:01:16,740
State 1 is blue, state 2 is blue,
state 4 is blue.

25
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:19,470
Based on the immediate
observation alone,

26
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:21,230
we don't know really where we are.

27
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:24,050
And we could be a place that's
to the right of the goal, so

28
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:25,930
we should go left to get reward.

29
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:28,150
Or we could be a place that's
to the left of the goal,

30
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:30,650
which means we're going to
go right to get reward.

31
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:32,710
And so we're kind of in a tricky spot.

32
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:35,570
>> Yeah, this is unfortunate.

33
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:37,830
You're trapped like a rat in a maze.

34
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:38,965
>> I see, I see.

35
00:01:38,965 --> 00:01:43,640
Yeah, you're pointing out that, [LAUGH]
to you, this looks like a rat drawing,

36
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,170
but it really is not
supposed to be a rat.

37
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:46,140
This is not the nose.

38
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:47,570
This is not the tail.

39
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:49,400
It really is just transitions.

40
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,745
>> I think you doth protest too much.

41
00:01:50,745 --> 00:01:52,304
