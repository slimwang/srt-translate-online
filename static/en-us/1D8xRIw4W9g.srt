1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,900
So now actually, lets start thinking
about how we can build a pinhole camera.

2
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:08,560
Let me do this by a simple exercise.

3
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:11,690
Lets imagine I have a scene
with an object like this.

4
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:15,480
So now the reason I chose
a simple object, four corners and

5
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,940
we can actually now trace
rays of light through it.

6
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:21,683
Let me build a small pinhole camera,
which is right here.

7
00:00:21,683 --> 00:00:25,337
Rays of light coming from the three
corners go through the pinhole and

8
00:00:25,337 --> 00:00:27,361
of course, hit the image plane here.

9
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:32,470
And I can of course now recreate
the image of this thing on my camera.

10
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:34,610
So this would be a single pinhole.

11
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:38,910
What happens if I can actually now
play around with multiple pin holes.

12
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:40,860
Remember, we talked about stereo?

13
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:42,885
Well, this is equivalent to that,

14
00:00:42,885 --> 00:00:47,344
but in essence also trying to now give
me more information at the camera level.

15
00:00:47,344 --> 00:00:50,084
Remember, this would be two
different images forming.

16
00:00:50,084 --> 00:00:55,002
And now if I could save both of them,
I can actually create more information,

17
00:00:55,002 --> 00:00:59,650
perhaps geometry, and
then use that to create pixels later.

18
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:02,550
So in this case, of course,
two images would be formed.

19
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:06,530
And of course I can use that to create
geometry of the scene or a depth map.

20
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:09,090
This would be an example
of double pinhole.

21
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:11,790
Another example, again,
to look at the same scene.

22
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:13,850
I have one pinhole camera.

23
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:16,110
All the rays are coming in this way.

24
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:20,870
But, of course what I also do
is move this camera by a bit.

25
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:25,020
Another pinhole camera,
same aspect here except that I have

26
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:28,410
basically moved the camera
to be able to do this.

27
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:31,740
This allows us to capture
things like motion parallax.

28
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:33,600
Depth parallax is what we've got here.

29
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,690
Motion parallax is what we get here.

30
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:40,020
Again, recall what we had looked at
when we looked at, stereo imagery.

31
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:42,776
Final example, it would be at
this instance here, right?

32
00:01:42,776 --> 00:01:47,730
In place of pinholes, we can replace
it with the lens, and of course, if

33
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:51,710
the lens does the right kinds of things
we would be able to create an image, and

34
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:54,110
be able to catch a variety
of things with that image.

35
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:56,820
But, of course, remember,
now we can actually play around with

36
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,980
control of the lens to get
different types of things too.
