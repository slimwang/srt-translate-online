00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:05,400
Okay, so now that we have seen how ILP and IPC differ, let's do a little IPC and

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:12,440
ILP quiz. Let's say that we have a 3 issue in-order processor, that has 3 ALUs.

3
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:15,750
Meaning that for everything that we can issue, it can always executed, and

4
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:18,890
these are general purpose ALUs that can just execute any type of instruction.

5
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:22,460
So, we probably won't have any issues with the limited number of units.

6
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:25,300
The program we are going to execute is- So for

7
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:31,640
this program what we want to know is what is the ILP and what is the IPC.
