00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,966
So now, we have our problem state. We know what the inputs are, and we know what

2
00:00:02,966 --> 00:00:05,988
the outputs are. What we want to do is make sure that we understand the

3
00:00:05,988 --> 00:00:09,705
relationship between the two by working out some examples. So, what should we do

4
00:00:09,705 --> 00:00:13,783
next? We could start coding, we could panic, or we could work out some examples.
