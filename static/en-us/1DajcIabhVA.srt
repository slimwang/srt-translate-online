1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,070
So remember,
I did say that something has to be read.

2
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:09,230
So the input may be through
a form where the user types in.

3
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:13,740
And then we're going to use these
three variables that we have.

4
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:19,420
So these login, password and
PIN the values that are input,

5
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:23,420
those are going to be added to this
query that we are producing here.

6
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:27,970
So, this query to run properly,
one thing to notice here is that

7
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:32,080
there's an AND, so,
the login value has to match.

8
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:34,220
The password value has to match.

9
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:36,730
And the pin value has to match, okay?

10
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:40,330
We're sort of doing three-factor
authentication here, if you like.

11
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:45,330
So for the query to execute correctly,
because of this conjunction we have,

12
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:48,020
all three of the values
have to be correct.

13
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:48,580
Okay?
So

14
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:53,360
we have to have the correct login name,
we have to have the correct password,

15
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:57,370
and we also have to have the matching
PIN for that login name.

16
00:00:57,370 --> 00:01:00,010
So all three are necessary.

17
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:03,300
All three must be provided
correctly because of this AND

18
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,629
operator that we have.

19
00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:09,130
So for each each tuple that
we have in the table, and

20
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:14,180
the table here is users, we have to
see that these three values match

21
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:16,000
the values that are there in the tuple.

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,810
And when they do,
that tuple is going to be selected, and

23
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:22,910
we're going to return
the account's attribute from that.

24
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:26,110
This is how the script is
going to generate a query that

25
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:28,770
is going to produce the result
that I just talked about.
