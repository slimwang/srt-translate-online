1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So, if you want to draw Bayes rule graphically,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
we have a situation where we have an internal variable A,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
like whether I'm going to die of cancer, but we can't sense A.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Instead, we have a second variable, called B,

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
which is our test, and B is observable, but A isn't.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
This is a classical example of a Bayes network.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
The Bayes network is composed of 2 variables, A and B.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
We know the prior probability for A,

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
and we know the conditional.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
A causes B--whether or not we have cancer,

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
causes the test result to be positive or not,

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
although there was some randomness involved.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
So, we know what the probability of B given the different values for A,

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
and what we care about in this specific instance is called diagnostic reasoning,

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
which is the inverse of the causal reasoning,

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:06,000
the probability of A given B or similarly, probability of A given not B.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
This is our very first Bayes network, and the graphical representation

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
of drawing 2 variables, A and B, connected with an arc

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:22,000
that goes from A to B is the graphical representation of a distribution

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
of 2 variables that are specified in the structure over here,

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
which has a prior probability and has a conditional probability as shown over here.

22
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Now, I do have a quick quiz for you.

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
How many parameters does it take to specify

24
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,000
the entire joint probability within A and B, or differently, the entire Bayes network?

25
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm not looking for structural parameters that relate to the graph over here.

26
00:01:48,000 --> 99:59:59,999
I'm just looking for the numerical parameters of the underlying probabilities.
