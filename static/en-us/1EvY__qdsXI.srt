1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:02,600
So, to review everybody,

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:07,610
we have a server that wants
to communicate with a device.

3
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:09,670
Now, you already know how
to create an Android app.

4
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:11,910
You're learning that now, obviously.

5
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:13,630
And, we just covered
downstream messaging,

6
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:17,640
where the server sends messages to
the device, so we're good there.

7
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:20,440
But you probably want to look in to
how to build a server at some point,

8
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:22,610
because I didn't teach you that.

9
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:25,530
You also might be wondering about when
the device wants to send a message

10
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:26,790
to the server.

11
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:30,850
Although I didn't cover it, Google
Cloud Messaging does support this and

12
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:32,650
you can learn more
from the documentation.

13
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:33,470
So check out the links and

14
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:35,750
the instruction notes everybody and
good work.
