Let's wrap up this lesson by looking at adding and subtracting complex numbers.

2
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:08,196
Any number that is the sum of a real number and an imaginary number is an

3
00:00:08,196 --> 00:00:13,832
example of a complex number. Complex numbers are in the form a plus bi or a

4
00:00:13,832 --> 00:00:18,819
minus bi. A and b are any real numbers and the second term is an imaginary

5
00:00:18,819 --> 00:00:25,600
number. It's imaginary because it has i or the square root of negative 1.

6
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,196
Instead of writing the square root of negative 1 all the time, we usually just

7
00:00:28,196 --> 00:00:32,633
write i. So if we want to add or subtract any complex numbers together, we

8
00:00:32,633 --> 00:00:37,463
treat i just like a radical. We can combine any terms that both contain an i,

9
00:00:37,463 --> 00:00:41,657
since they both have a square root of negative 1. So what do you think these

10
00:00:41,657 --> 00:00:45,644
would be. If we added this complex number to this complex number, what would be

11
00:00:45,644 --> 00:00:50,890
the answer? And if we subtracted this complex number from this one, what would

12
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:56,100
be the result? Keep in mind that you really need to just combine like terms.

13
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,428
You're also need to remember what to do when subtracting a quantity. Good luck

14
00:01:00,428 --> 00:01:02,233
on this one.
