1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,240
Now out of the five boxes her the GPU
can do three of these things.

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:07,890
It can respond to CPU requests for
sends and receives.

3
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:10,540
But it cannot initiate
requests on its own.

4
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:13,010
Again, the CPU is the boss
in this relationship.

5
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:16,470
It can also compute a kernel
that is launched by the CPU.

6
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:19,200
Note, I have a box next to this final
one because this is something that's

7
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,340
currently changing.

8
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:23,851
So the issue is,
can a GPU launch its own work?

9
00:00:23,851 --> 00:00:27,596
Now, later on in the course, we'll cover
some advanced code of topics that go

10
00:00:27,596 --> 00:00:29,311
beyond this basic CPU, GPU model.

11
00:00:29,311 --> 00:00:33,027
Among the other things, you'll learn how
newer GPU's can launch their own kernels

12
00:00:33,027 --> 00:00:35,360
and pull directly from the CPU's memory.

13
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,370
But for now, we're going to stick
with this basic CPU, GPU model.

14
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:42,150
Now let's move on and
see what a typical program looks like.
