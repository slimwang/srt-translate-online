1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
My second question is, how many large eigenvalues

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
will PCA find?

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Now I understand this doesn't have a unique answer,

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
but in the best possible case

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
where spectral clustering works well,

6
00:00:15,000 --> 99:59:59,999
how many large eigenvalues do you find?
