1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,969
So, that's just a little bit on some
initial video processing where you have

2
00:00:02,969 --> 00:00:04,460
a static camera moving object.

3
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:07,350
I'll show you something
else that's kind of cool.

4
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:09,410
What if you have a static scene?

5
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:10,570
So, the right?

6
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:13,490
But your video is generated
by a moving camera.

7
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:14,410
Right?
What sort of

8
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:16,420
interesting analysis might you do there?

9
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:18,020
Remember, we talked about
when we talked about stereo,

10
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:20,010
we talked about motion parallax and
disparity.

11
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:22,980
The disparity is inversely
proportional to depth.

12
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:26,984
So, the farther something is, the less
disparity it has, the closer it is,

13
00:00:26,984 --> 00:00:29,070
the more it moves as I move.

14
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:33,000
So, and you probably thought of that
as motion parallax in other contexts.

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,800
So, if I have cameras that are moving,
looking at a scene,

16
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:42,440
I could pull out the separate objects
by just looking at the relative motion.

17
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:46,540
So, faster relative motion
means objects are closer to me.

18
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:47,040
All right?

19
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:50,697
This was first done in what
was called epipolar plane,

20
00:00:50,697 --> 00:00:52,940
epipolar plane image analysis, or

21
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:57,740
just EPI image analysis, that was done
by actually Bolles, Baker and Marimont.

22
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:00,435
Bob Bolles who his,
his friend and some, by the way,

23
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:02,091
it's the same Bolles from RANSAC.

24
00:01:02,091 --> 00:01:05,160
So, he's got his name against
couple of pretty cool algorithms.

25
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:07,320
So, here's a cute image that was taken.

26
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:10,390
This was back in the days when you used
to draw images because we couldn't

27
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:12,510
actually get computers to make them.

28
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:16,490
So, the idea was,
what if you have a camera that's

29
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:20,600
looking sideways and you can extend
this to looking arbitrary ways but

30
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,790
it's easy to think
about looking sideways.

31
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:25,326
And here is some point on
what it looks to me to be, I,

32
00:01:25,326 --> 00:01:28,340
I don't know if it's a taxi cab or
a police car.

33
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:32,020
And the idea is that this point, of
course, as this camera moves this way,

34
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:34,110
this point will move across the image.

35
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,030
The rate at which that point
will move across the image is,

36
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:40,220
depends upon how far away it is, right?

37
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:43,170
So, a point that's here
will move faster, and

38
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:46,090
a point that's out here in infinity,
will move slower.

39
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:48,980
So, if you go to their original paper,
you'll see pictures that look like this.

40
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:50,640
This is an indoor scene, and

41
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,630
what you can see is that the camera
is moving just a little bit this way.

42
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:56,250
Right?
because here,

43
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,900
you can see this thing is
occluding that thing there.

44
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:01,822
But then, as the camera moves,
I can now see through there.

45
00:02:01,822 --> 00:02:02,880
All right?

46
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,190
So as the camera's moving to the left,

47
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:09,750
this object is essentially
moving to the right.

48
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:12,830
So, you can take all of those images and
you can stack them up and

49
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:13,630
here they stack them.

50
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:14,290
This is x.

51
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:14,890
This is y.

52
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:17,530
So, this is the first image that we saw.

53
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:19,305
And this is time.

54
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:19,980
Okay?

55
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:22,050
Now, this little edge here.

56
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:23,700
You know what that is?

57
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:27,961
That's the right most column
at each of the times.

58
00:02:27,961 --> 00:02:31,004
Now, this might just look
like another picture to you,

59
00:02:31,004 --> 00:02:33,851
and it is, because if you
look over here, this right

60
00:02:33,851 --> 00:02:37,970
most column is just as the camera moves,
it's just sweeping across here.

61
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:41,840
So, we just pull out each of those
columns, you'll get another picture.

62
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,890
And so, that's what you're seeing here,
that's what this side is,

63
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:46,930
it's the right most column.

64
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:49,750
But what's really cool about
this volume, remember,

65
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,890
we took videos of volume of data?

66
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:54,940
Is I can slice that volume of data,
right?

67
00:02:54,940 --> 00:03:00,190
And so, suppose, we just take
a look at a cut through there.

68
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:02,180
So, that would be,
that's what this would be here.

69
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:06,180
And you see that image there, okay?

70
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:08,980
And you'll notice, and we're going to
do this more specifically in a minute,

71
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:12,790
that I get these streaks and
these streaks are at different slopes.
