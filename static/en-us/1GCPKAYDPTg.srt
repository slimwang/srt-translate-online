1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:06,610
I would argue it's roughly 4 in my very deficient drawing here,

2
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:10,380
because it separates the blue circles and the red x's.

3
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:12,930
And again, when I ask the question, is y smaller than 4,

4
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:15,330
there are 2 outcomes, yes and no.

5
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:21,195
For the yes branch, which one do you pick, the red x or the blue circle?

6
00:00:21,195 --> 00:00:24,035
And you picked wisely, it's actually the red x.

7
00:00:24,035 --> 00:00:28,360
And that means for the no outcome, where the value is larger or

8
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:31,575
equal to 4, we get blue circles.

9
00:00:31,575 --> 00:00:34,320
So this thing here is the decision tree or

10
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,750
one of the main decision trees that characterize this data.

11
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:40,790
The algorithm decision tree learning,

12
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:44,490
is to use a computer algorithm to find the decision boundaries

13
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:48,700
automatically based on data, and Katie's going to tell you all about that
