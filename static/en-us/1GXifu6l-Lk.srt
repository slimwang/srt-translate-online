00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,850
>> To start, I'd like a feature
where I can say I bought eggs

2
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:05,440
from one of my shopping lists.

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:08,590
And then, everyone that shared on
that shopping list sees that I have,

4
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:11,590
in fact, bought the eggs,
wherever they happen to be.

5
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:14,339
I'm imagining a style that would
have a strike-through like this and

6
00:00:14,339 --> 00:00:15,750
that would say who bought the item.

7
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:18,170
I've been thinking about the best
way to break this one down.

8
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:19,100
And here's what I came up with.

9
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:19,930
To start,

10
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:23,220
you can update the items to track
whether they are bought or un-bought.

11
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:26,250
And then, you can also add
an attribute to see who bought them.

12
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:29,180
You can then add a click listener to
the adapter that would allow items to

13
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:30,980
be toggled between bought and un-bought.

14
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:32,960
So, all you need to do
is press on an item and

15
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,640
then it would be
considered bought by you.

16
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,830
And if you pressed again,
it would be un-bought by you.

17
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:40,410
Finally, we should probably change
how the item looks in the adapter

18
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:41,710
if it is bought or un-bought.

19
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:44,330
That's what I was talking about when I
mentioned having a strike-through if

20
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:45,150
the item was bought.

21
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:47,140
And maybe even having some
text to show who bought it.

22
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:48,990
Now, these three steps
relate to different things.

23
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:51,310
The first one involves
changing around a POJO.

24
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:53,910
The second one involves writing
something to the database

25
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:54,930
about the status of the item.

26
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:58,530
And then, the third one is reading the
status of the item from the database and

27
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:00,640
then changing the UI accordingly.

28
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,780
So, this is really not too
different than the stuff that we've

29
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:03,750
already been doing.

30
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:04,300
Okay.
So,

31
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:06,980
why don't you talk me through this
one and what you're going to do.

32
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:11,060
Given what you know about Firebase,
what POJO should we be changing?

33
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:12,000
Answer that here.

34
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,270
Then, in the on click
listener of the adaptor,

35
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:15,790
what write method will you call?

36
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:18,850
Finally, in what method will
you change how the item looks

37
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:20,110
when it's bought or unbought?
