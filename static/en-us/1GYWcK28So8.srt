[Thrun] The mathematics of the structure from motion problem are involved,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
and I don't want to go into detail here.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Here is our perspective projection model with our well-known equation on the right.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Under the assumption that the camera itself might be at a random location

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and a random orientation, this equation becomes a really complicated composition

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
of original image points in 3D, 3 rotation matrices as shown over here,

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
and an offset over here that relates to the camera coordinates.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
You do this for X divided by Z over here.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
This will be the projected camera input coordinates.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
This is the generative math that specifies how cameras work under arbitrary orientations

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
and arbitrary translations.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,000
If you now want to solve it, you can look at the observed measurements

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
minus the predicted measurements, minimize all this,

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:10,000
and solve for the translations, the point locations, and the orientations simultaneously.

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
This is entirely nontrivial, and nonlinear optimization techniques

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
have been used extensively to solve this problem.

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
They go by names like gradient descent, conjugate gradient,

18
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Gauss-Newton, Levenberg Marquardt, and other things like singular value decomposition.

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I won't go into detail--just to give you a flavor of the problem.

20
00:01:35,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Instead I'd like to ask you a question.
