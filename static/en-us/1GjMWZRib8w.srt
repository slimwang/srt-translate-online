00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,102
So, here's a different ellipse. What do you think would be the center for this

2
00:00:04,102 --> 00:00:09,010
ellipse? What do you think the a value is and what do you think the b value is?

3
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:13,036
Keep in mind that for an ellipse, the easiest way to find these values is to

4
00:00:13,036 --> 00:00:16,152
set this equation equal to one.
