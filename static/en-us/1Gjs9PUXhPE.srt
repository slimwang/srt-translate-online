1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,903
>> Well for one possibility 2 d plus one can be at negative 7, or equal to

2
00:00:03,903 --> 00:00:07,949
negative 7, and for the other case 2 d plus one can equal positive 7. >> You

3
00:00:07,949 --> 00:00:12,106
might have thought about this in your head, or maybe you did some equation

4
00:00:12,106 --> 00:00:16,276
solving. >> We can subtract 1 from both sides to get 2 d is equal to negative 8

5
00:00:16,276 --> 00:00:21,005
then divide both sides by 2, >> So d would equal negative 4. >> For this

6
00:00:21,005 --> 00:00:26,621
equation, we subtract 1 from both side to get 2d equals 6, then we divide both

7
00:00:26,621 --> 00:00:31,952
sides by 2, so d would equal 3. >> If I think about plugging 3 in for d, I get 6

8
00:00:31,952 --> 00:00:36,937
plus 1 which is 7. >> And if I think about plugging in negative 4 in for d, I

9
00:00:36,937 --> 00:00:41,410
would get negative 8 ... >> Plus 1, which is negative 7. >> So there are two

10
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:44,458
possible values of d that make this equation true.
