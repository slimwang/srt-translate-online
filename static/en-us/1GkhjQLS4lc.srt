1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,680
Do you have any idea how you plan to
start taking action towards the ideas

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:05,200
you have for your business?

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:06,850
Let's start by breaking
down your mission and

4
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:09,218
vision statements into
a set of 12 month goals.

5
00:00:09,218 --> 00:00:12,830
For your 12 month goals,
try to answer questions like.

6
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:15,150
How many customers do you want to have?

7
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:17,180
How much revenue do you hope to make?

8
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:20,590
And what metrics are you looking
at to help you get there?

9
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:22,410
There are plenty of other
questions you can ask.

10
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:25,220
And this really depends on the type of
impact you're hoping to have with your

11
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:26,110
business.

12
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:28,630
Here's a strategy you can
use to help get started.

13
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:31,720
Try thinking about a core objective
that's fundamental to the success

14
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:32,920
of your business.

15
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:36,150
For example,
maybe your app needs lots of users.

16
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:39,890
Can you imagine making any progress
at all and gaining these users?

17
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:41,316
How many do you think you could get?

18
00:00:41,316 --> 00:00:43,190
Write that number down.

19
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:47,320
Now in what timeframe do you think
it would take to reach that goal?

20
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:50,280
Once you have that number,
you can adjust it relative to what

21
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:53,600
portion of the goal could be
achieved within the next year.

22
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,980
Let's look at an example of how
you might be able to use this

23
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:57,170
for your business.

24
00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:00,260
I feel pretty confident that I
could get ten customers in a month.

25
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:04,700
So maybe 120 customers is
a good goal for my first year.

26
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:08,260
Or, if 5,000 customers in my first
five years seems reasonable,

27
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:11,790
then maybe I could reach a 1,000
customers by the end of year one.

28
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:14,270
Start where you're comfortable and
work from there.

29
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:17,060
Another idea you can try is to
look into similar businesses.

30
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:18,550
Seeing where they started, and

31
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:20,390
finding out how they were
able to grow over time.

32
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:23,400
And remember these goals can change.

33
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,910
The idea right now is to really just
get something to work from later on.

34
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:30,530
So take some time to think about
where you hope to be in one year, and

35
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:32,810
when you're ready write
out your 12 month goals.
