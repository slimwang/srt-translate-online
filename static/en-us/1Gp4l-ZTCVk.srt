00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:01,630
In this lesson,

2
00:00:01,630 --> 00:00:04,630
you've learned a lot of concepts that
we'll be applying in this course.

3
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:08,920
Concepts about structuring data into
tables, extracting data that we want,

4
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:11,030
counting rows with aggregations and

5
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:14,470
linking tables together using
primary keys and joins.

6
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:17,740
In the next lesson,
you'll apply these concepts using SQL,

7
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:21,170
sending queries to a live database
server and interpreting the results.

8
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:21,670
See you then.
