A denial of service attack is an

2
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:06,490
attack on availability. Denial of service attacks typically

3
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:12,480
are an attempt to overwhelm the network or a network host in some way by

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,309
consuming its resources. A common way of

5
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:18,840
launching a denial of service attack is to

6
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,960
send a lot of traffic at a victim,

7
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:25,670
often from many distributed locations. If the attacker

8
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:29,360
is in fact distributed, this is called not just a

9
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:33,000
denial of service attack, but a distributed denial of service attack.
