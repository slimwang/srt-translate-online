1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,060
Inside a ForecastFragment,

2
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:05,120
we're going to replace 
the mForecastAdapter

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:06,660
with a simple CursorAdapter

4
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:08,960
that will work the new 
database code we just added.

5
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:10,676
This is another one 
we want to make sure

6
00:00:10,676 --> 00:00:12,462
we're using the V4 version.

7
00:00:12,462 --> 00:00:13,772
There we are.

8
00:00:13,772 --> 00:00:15,952
Make sure to select 
that in your list.

9
00:00:15,952 --> 00:00:19,246
So you can see we have a bunch
of code that doesn't compile.

10
00:00:19,246 --> 00:00:20,727
Since it's ArrayAdapter,

11
00:00:20,727 --> 00:00:24,171
let's switch our ForecastAdapter out
with new simple CursorAdapter.

12
00:00:24,695 --> 00:00:28,190
Now simple CursorAdapter 
is pretty cool.

13
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:30,350
It allows us to map columns 
within our database,

14
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:32,450
which are in our WeatherContract,

15
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:34,993
directly to widgets
that are in our list items.

16
00:00:34,993 --> 00:00:38,666
So, all looks pretty good, 
except that it won't quite compile.

17
00:00:38,666 --> 00:00:42,460
Because, this stuff we're doing
to start the DetailActivity

18
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:43,860
isn't going to work.

19
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:47,070
So for now, let's just put this away.

20
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,146
We'll get back to that later.

21
00:00:49,146 --> 00:00:51,572
We have something that compiles.

22
00:00:51,572 --> 00:00:54,000
But we need to do something first.

23
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:57,060
If we ran it now, 
we would still get nothing.

24
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:58,890
The reason why we
would still get nothing

25
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:01,840
is we aren't doing anything
in onLoadFinish.

26
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,626
In onLoaderReset we might 
as well complete this

27
00:01:04,626 --> 00:01:07,412
by doing swapCursor with null.

28
00:01:07,412 --> 00:01:09,240
Our code should actually
do something now.

29
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,777
Let's try running it.

30
00:01:10,777 --> 00:01:12,564
And it looks terrible.

31
00:01:13,224 --> 00:01:15,163
What's in the database 
doesn't look anything

32
00:01:15,163 --> 00:01:17,116
like what's supposed 
to be on the screen.

33
00:01:17,366 --> 00:01:19,710
We need some formatting 
and settings help.

34
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:22,054
More functions for our utility class.

35
00:01:22,054 --> 00:01:25,640
Get preferred location
did look a bit lonely there, right?

36
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:28,060
To help us out, we'll add 
another function to utility

37
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:30,090
that tells us if metric 
is the current setting.

38
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,930
We'll add a simple function 
to format the temperature,

39
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:35,010
and we'll add a function 
to format the date.

40
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:37,613
Now interestingly enough, 
what kind of date is this?

41
00:01:37,616 --> 00:01:41,520
Well, we've got two options, 
java.<i>util</i> or java.<i>sql</i>.

42
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,030
In this case we actually want java.<i>util</i>,

43
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:46,210
but we're missing another helper function.

44
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:47,920
We'll add a function 
into WeatherContract

45
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,650
that converts the db date text 
into an actual date object,

46
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:53,010
opposite to the other contract function.

47
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:54,383
So there we have it.

48
00:01:54,383 --> 00:01:55,992
How we store the data 
in the database

49
00:01:55,992 --> 00:01:58,871
is entirely encapsulated
in the contract.

50
00:01:58,871 --> 00:02:01,470
So, now we've got 
all that cool stuff,

51
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:04,140
but how do we actually use it?

52
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,427
Let's go back to
our ForecastFragment.

53
00:02:06,427 --> 00:02:08,187
It turns out there's 
a special callback

54
00:02:08,187 --> 00:02:10,955
for SimpleCursorAdapter 
called viewBinder.

55
00:02:15,372 --> 00:02:18,700
Set viewBinder with 
a single function, SetViewValue.

56
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:22,640
So inside of SetViewValue, 
we're actually going to make

57
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,740
really good use of those 
utility functions we just saw.

58
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:28,470
First of all, we'll save off as metric.

59
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:30,376
If we're using the 
temperature columns,

60
00:02:30,376 --> 00:02:32,472
then we just conform out 
the temperature.

61
00:02:32,472 --> 00:02:34,280
Now that we've got 
setViewValue,

62
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,740
let's put some cool stuff inside of it.

63
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,710
You see that we use isMetric
when we're populating

64
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:41,140
the temperature in our views,
and we pass that into our new

65
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:43,530
Utility.formatTemperature function.

66
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:45,770
So you can see that having 
these column indices here

67
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:48,150
allowed us to make 
this function more efficient,

68
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:50,380
and it will also help 
when we move into Lesson 5.

69
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:52,640
One of the things you notice, 
is that the layout height

70
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,993
was really, really small.

71
00:02:53,993 --> 00:02:56,456
That's because it was
just wrapping content.

72
00:02:56,456 --> 00:02:59,220
We can fix this by telling it 
to center our content,

73
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:02,590
and by setting the minimum height 
to the least preferred item height.

74
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:04,680
This will make things look 
a little better as well,

75
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,590
a lot more like our original layout.

76
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:10,052
So let's take a quick look to see
what all of this work has done for us.

77
00:03:11,527 --> 00:03:13,551
That's a little bit more like it.

78
00:03:13,551 --> 00:03:15,675
Now as you can see, 
we're seeing our forecast

79
00:03:15,675 --> 00:03:18,080
in the original way we anticipated.

80
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,020
We can go to our settings 
and we can switch things on demand

81
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:23,960
but now we're in that
same problem I had before,

82
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,640
we can't do anything 
to get to the DetailActivity.

83
00:03:26,655 --> 00:03:29,385
Well, I'm going to have you fix that.
