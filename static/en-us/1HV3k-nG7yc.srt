00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
We had a planar graph. >>About the planar graphs. >>Yup.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:14,000
And then--so you said draw yourself a planar graph but we know the relation n-m+r=2.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I did actually draw a graph as well, in fact two. So it comes out to be 9.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Well we can draw a graph. We can basically make a grid of sorts.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
>> And I just moved the grid width. >> Yeah. I think it's fine to use the formula. >>Yeah.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
You know, it gives you confidence that it's going to work

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
for all possible arrangements of graphs, so--

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Part of the amusement is when it works for every graph.
