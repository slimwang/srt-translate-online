1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,540
Really the only thing that you
absolutely need to keep track of

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:04,220
is the score.

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,550
You might be wondering why.

4
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:11,470
Well, between button clicks we want
some way to save the value that's been

5
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:13,670
accumulating for
how much Team A has scored.

6
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:16,520
Well, we don't really care
about the number of fouls.

7
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:19,150
There's nothing on the screen
that represents that, or

8
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:21,590
does a calculation with that number.

9
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:23,560
Nor do we care about
the number of shots attempted.

10
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:26,610
Now, the other three
possibilities are for

11
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:28,490
the amount of points that you get for
each shot.

12
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:31,380
These numbers won't vary.

13
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:33,890
A user isn't inputting
a different value.

14
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:36,930
And the three point shot isn't suddenly
going to become worth five points in

15
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:38,480
the middle of a game.

16
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,920
This means there isn't a huge amount
of necessity in making these guys

17
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,370
variables.

18
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:47,130
Now, that said, it is perfectly
reasonable for you to say,

19
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:50,670
I want a number in my app that
doesn't change, but that has a name.

20
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:52,090
like a variable.

21
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:55,510
Now what I've just described
is called a constant, and

22
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:57,300
a constant is kind of like a variable.

23
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:58,850
It has a name and a value.

24
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:02,270
The thing that's different though
is the value is, for sure,

25
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:03,990
never going to change.

26
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:06,600
Now we won't be using
constants in this app, but

27
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,930
I've provided some documentation in the
instructor notes if you're interested in

28
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:10,810
learning more about them.
