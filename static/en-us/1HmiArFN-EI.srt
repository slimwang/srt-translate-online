00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,092
>> Here's another way to look at it. Let's say you have a bag of jellybeans.

2
00:00:05,092 --> 00:00:10,789
There's only one licorice, but there are four strawberries and four blueberries.

3
00:00:10,789 --> 00:00:16,320
There's also only one cherry and two lime, or lemon, I don't know, you decide.

4
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:21,656
If we take a sample of, say, four Jelly Bellies, most likely, we're not going to

5
00:00:21,656 --> 00:00:26,926
get the licorice one. Say we just get these in our sample. This sample doesn't

6
00:00:26,926 --> 00:00:32,125
show the whole range of Jelly Belly flavors that we have, including cherry and

7
00:00:32,125 --> 00:00:37,117
licorice. So our sample underestimates the variability in our Jelly Belly

8
00:00:37,117 --> 00:00:42,200
population. Hopefully, this example lends a little more insight into why we

9
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:47,005
divide by n minus 1 when calculating the standard deviation of a sample. But

10
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:51,936
please let's discuss it in the forums. There, we could go into a lot more depth.

11
00:00:51,936 --> 00:00:56,344
For the purposes of this class though, as long as you have a basic intuitive

12
00:00:56,344 --> 00:01:01,385
understanding of the difference between sample standard deviation and population

13
00:01:01,385 --> 00:01:03,930
standard deviation, then you'll be fine.
