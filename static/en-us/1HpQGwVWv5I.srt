1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
[Norvig] And the answer is all we have to do is check to see if Englishman

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
and red have been assigned the same house number.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
And we just do that with saying if (Englishman == red).

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
And I should note just as an aside

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
if you wanted to be sort of clever and make it look more like English,

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
in this case it would be okay to say if (Englishman is red)

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
because is is checking for whether 2 objects are identically the same object.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Equals checks to see if they have the same value.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
And it turns out that Python handles small integers like 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
as a single identical object.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So the is check would work as well as the equals check here.
