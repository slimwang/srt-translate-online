00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,865
If you drew out a diagram, it probably looked like this. But, the distance from

2
00:00:03,877 --> 00:00:07,455
zero was negative 4, and that can't be right. The absolute value of any

3
00:00:07,467 --> 00:00:11,240
expression, or number, is always greater than or equal to zero. So, there's no

4
00:00:11,252 --> 00:00:15,265
value of m that can make this true, there's no solution. If you were solving the

5
00:00:15,277 --> 00:00:19,135
equations like before, you might have thought it was negative 2 and negative 6.

6
00:00:20,217 --> 00:00:24,596
But, let's check negative 2 to see the result. I can plug negative 2 in for m. 2

7
00:00:24,685 --> 00:00:29,244
times negative 2 is negative 4, and negative 4 plus 8 is positive 4. We know the

8
00:00:29,256 --> 00:00:33,573
absolute value of this 4 is positive 4. It's the distance from zero. And it

9
00:00:33,585 --> 00:00:38,158
can't be negative 4. It's not true. And that's why none of these solutions work.
