1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:04,839
Now let's add to our code to create
a unique responsive tablet layout for

2
00:00:04,839 --> 00:00:06,750
this sample article display.

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:10,879
Right now, this layout looks pretty good
on a phone screen, but the image and

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,700
text get pretty stretched
out on a tablet.

5
00:00:13,699 --> 00:00:16,269
Here's that same view on a tablet.

6
00:00:16,269 --> 00:00:20,850
So I want to create a new tablet layout
that moves this image to the left of

7
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:24,970
the text and adds some padding
between the image and text views.

8
00:00:24,969 --> 00:00:26,109
To create a layout for

9
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:30,519
a tablet, the first thing I'll need
to do is create a new layout folder.

10
00:00:30,519 --> 00:00:33,670
So to do that, I'll right-click
on our res directory and

11
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:37,149
select New, Android resource directory.

12
00:00:37,149 --> 00:00:41,109
Then a window will pop up prompting for
the type of directory.

13
00:00:41,109 --> 00:00:45,119
Since we're creating a new layout
directory, we'll select layout and

14
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:48,250
I'll add a smallest
screen width qualifier.

15
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:52,570
I want the smallest screen width to be
600dp, which is the usual cutoff for

16
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:55,829
seven inch tablet screens, so
type this in and click OK.

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,450
Now, you should see this
new layout-sw600dp folder.

18
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:02,960
Then in this layout folder,

19
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,737
I am going to overwrite the responsive
activity layout for tablets.

20
00:01:06,737 --> 00:01:11,719
To start, I'll copy and paste this base
layout file into the new layout folder,

21
00:01:11,719 --> 00:01:13,679
then I'll modify it for tablet.

22
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,880
So now I just copy and

23
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:19,609
pasted our base responsive activity
layout in this new layout folder.

24
00:01:19,609 --> 00:01:22,939
The most important thing here is
that you have the same named layout

25
00:01:22,939 --> 00:01:24,620
in both of these folders.

26
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:29,310
This way, Android will know to override
the base responsive activity layout file

27
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:34,180
with the same name when it sees devices
with the smallest width of 600 dp.

28
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:37,790
Okay great, now let's open this file and
modify it for tablet.

29
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:43,680
So this is the responsive activity
XML In the layout-sw600dip folder.

30
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,390
In the first to do's in here,
we've already accomplished.

31
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:48,709
We created a new layout folder for
devices,

32
00:01:48,709 --> 00:01:51,849
with the smallest width
equal to 600 dip, and

33
00:01:51,849 --> 00:01:56,129
we copied over the responsive activity
XML from the base layout folder.

34
00:01:56,129 --> 00:02:00,049
Our next to do's will be to change the
image view so that it's to the left of

35
00:02:00,049 --> 00:02:04,709
our text, and also add a little padding
between the text and the image.

36
00:02:04,709 --> 00:02:08,459
There are a few ways to do this and I'll
just be creating a horizontal linear

37
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:12,760
layout that contains the imagery on the
left and our already existing vertical

38
00:02:12,759 --> 00:02:16,949
linear layout that holds the headline,
date and body text on the right.

39
00:02:16,949 --> 00:02:19,689
So I'll make our main layout
a horizontal layout, and

40
00:02:19,689 --> 00:02:21,740
this will surround all our views.

41
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:25,850
Then, I'll add another linear layout
that just surrounds our text views.

42
00:02:25,849 --> 00:02:29,519
So here's a vertical linear
layout that holds our text views.

43
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,640
I'll also need to modify the layout
width and height a little bit

44
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:36,250
of each of these so that it fits
our horizontal linear layout.

45
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:39,822
The image view will have
a height of 200dp, and

46
00:02:39,822 --> 00:02:44,753
I'll define the width so that it
takes up about a third of the screen,

47
00:02:44,753 --> 00:02:49,026
by giving it a weight equal to 1 and
a width equal to zero dp.

48
00:02:49,026 --> 00:02:51,116
Similarly, I'll have to
give our linear layout for

49
00:02:51,116 --> 00:02:52,979
our text a layout weight of 2 and
a width of 0.

50
00:02:52,979 --> 00:02:56,463
This way, it will take up twice
as much space as our image.

51
00:02:56,463 --> 00:03:00,260
Now, our image view will
be to the left of our text.

52
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:02,825
Next I'll add a little more
padding to the right and

53
00:03:02,825 --> 00:03:04,742
left of this vertical linear layout.

54
00:03:04,742 --> 00:03:09,139
I'll add 8dp on both sides to space this
out a little bit from our image view.

55
00:03:09,139 --> 00:03:12,989
Now, let's save this and see what it's
look like on a phone and on a tablet.

56
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:16,439
So here's our responsive sample
article layout on our phone.

57
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:20,599
The image placeholder is above the
sample article headline and body text,

58
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:25,799
and I'll be using a Nexus 6 Emulator for
the phone and a Nexus 9 for the tablet.

59
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,670
Now, here's our layout on our tablet.

60
00:03:27,669 --> 00:03:30,629
The image is to the left of
the sample article text and

61
00:03:30,629 --> 00:03:34,579
uses the space a little more naturally
on this wider tablet screen.

62
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:37,030
So by using the smallest
width qualifier,

63
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:39,870
you can create unique layouts for
larger screens.

64
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:43,870
This way, your layouts look great
across these differently sized devices.
