1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,650
At this point it's tempting to
be satisfied with the result.

2
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:06,850
After all we've found a relatively
low order polynomial solution

3
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:07,430
for our problem.

4
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:11,680
On the other hand the sort of flow
networks we're dealing with here

5
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:13,340
are very specialized.

6
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:17,320
They have all unit capacities and
this bipartite structure.

7
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:18,900
Our algorithm doesn't
exploit this at all.

8
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:22,960
In the remainder of the lecture,
we'll look at the special structure more

9
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,030
closely, gain some additional
insights about bipartite matchings.

10
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:29,190
And finally these will lead
us to a faster algorithm.
