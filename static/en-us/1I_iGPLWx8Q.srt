1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:00,880
All right.

2
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:02,290
This is a pretty large quiz.

3
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:08,280
We're going to convert Sunshine from
using Listview to using Recyclerview.

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:12,130
And the goal here is not to get
Sunshine completely functioning again.

5
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:15,520
It is just to get
the list in the forecast

6
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:18,450
displaying something with Recyclerview.

7
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:21,260
So, you're going to grab
the initial code drop.

8
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:24,070
And then you're going to add
the RecyclerView library as a project

9
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:24,640
dependency.

10
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:30,470
You'll then swap the android.support.v7
widget.RecyclerVIew for

11
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:32,890
ListView in fragment_main_base.

12
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:36,880
And then in ForecastFragment,
swap RecyclerView for ListView.

13
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,720
In the Forecast Fragment then your
going to set the layout manager

14
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:42,090
to being a linear layout manager.

15
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:44,960
In the forecast adapter you're
going to convert the viewholder

16
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,520
to a recylerview.viewholder.

17
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,940
Finally in forecast adapter you're
going to add a cursor class member

18
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:54,220
along with getCursor and
swapCursor functions.

19
00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:00,000
And swapCursor should call notify
data set change it's very important.

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,400
So essentially in this section you're
going to build a little miniature

21
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,840
cursor adaptor.

22
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:07,670
Again, make sure to look at
the instructor notes to see if there's

23
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:09,230
anything we have to help with this one.
