1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,690
The answer I was looking for
is n over 4.

2
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:05,830
Remember, from
the perspective of each node,

3
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:09,890
there are four equally likely
possibilities after the initial flip.

4
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:13,460
You then apply a correction for
the case of double heads.

5
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:17,120
That leaves just one out
of four options with heads.

6
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:20,550
Now you might be asking yourself,
self, what about those other heads?

7
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:21,590
Hmm, good question.

8
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,810
What are you waiting for me to tell you?

9
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:27,130
Do I really have to tell you everything?
