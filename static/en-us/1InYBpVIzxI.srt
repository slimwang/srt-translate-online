00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:04,270
As a startup, and learning all this
great data within Google Analytics,

2
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:06,620
I think the best advice I
would say is stick with it.

3
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:09,690
It's a lot of information, and I think
a lot of people think it's a little

4
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:11,740
daunting because they don't
know where to get started.

5
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:14,590
What's really great is that we have
a lot of amazing tutorials online.

6
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:17,030
There's actually a video overview
that kind of walks them through

7
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:18,300
the different steps.

8
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:21,388
Talks about someone who's a bit more,
you know, has implemented and

9
00:00:21,388 --> 00:00:24,474
maybe used it a little bit more further
than like a brand new start up can

10
00:00:24,474 --> 00:00:26,752
give them all the tips and
tricks to be successful.

11
00:00:26,752 --> 00:00:30,022
So I think the best advice is
to keep at it and don't give up.

12
00:00:30,022 --> 00:00:32,540
And make sure that you can
get help along the way.
