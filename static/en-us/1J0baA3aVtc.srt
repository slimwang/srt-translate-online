00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,120
Hey, Ian, so it's not a big deal, but

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,590
you know how we want Sunshine to
just be the best it can be and

3
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:08,560
we've been working really hard to
personalize it and polish it up?

4
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:12,760
The thing is, it just doesn't
really make me feel amazing.

5
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:16,297
>> I don't know, when I get a weather
notification from Sunshine,

6
00:00:16,297 --> 00:00:20,240
it really makes me feel like Sunshine's
helping me see into the future.

7
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,791
Right, but that's not really taking it
far enough because think of it with like

8
00:00:23,791 --> 00:00:24,590
notifications.

9
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:27,095
Sometimes, a daily notification
isn't really enough, but

10
00:00:27,095 --> 00:00:30,437
then other times you've just have this
same sunny, gorgeous weather every day.

11
00:00:30,437 --> 00:00:31,970
>> Yeah, good times.

12
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:33,304
>> Right, so I was talking to Dan,

13
00:00:33,304 --> 00:00:36,428
and I have some changes that I want to
make that I think will be really useful.

14
00:00:36,428 --> 00:00:41,745
Something that's a little more now,
and a little less into the future.

15
00:00:41,745 --> 00:00:43,417
>> Okay, you do that.

16
00:00:43,417 --> 00:00:47,326
Dan wanted to show me this crazy
redesign of Sunshine he's working on, so

17
00:00:47,326 --> 00:00:50,312
I'm going to go down there now,
and then go enjoy the sun.

18
00:00:50,312 --> 00:00:52,004
>> [SOUND]
