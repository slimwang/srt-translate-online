00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,640
Responsive design goes a long way in making the website usable.

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:06,950
Let's take a look at Gizmodo which has a pretty awesome responsive design.

3
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:09,150
Let's see what happens as we change the size of the screen?

4
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:11,210
Let's make it smaller and smaller.

5
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:11,990
Oh. And there we go.

6
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:16,379
Now the ads disappears on the left and we have the stories expand downward.

7
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:17,450
Keep going.

8
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:18,090
And look at that.

9
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:20,330
The stories on the left side of the screen disappeared and

10
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:21,750
we're just left with the list.

11
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:24,130
This would be great on tablet, this is perfect for tablet.

12
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:26,950
Let's make it even smaller, and now we've got our mobile view.

13
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:30,310
You can see that it's nicely laid out to fit within a nice thin screen.

14
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:33,080
This is an awesome example of responsive design because it changes to

15
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:35,060
fit the sized window that its got.

16
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:37,390
The way this is accomplished is with media queries.

17
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:41,170
Gizmodo used media queries to change the CSS of their page as

18
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:42,670
the screen got re-sized.

19
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:46,770
Using media queries, you can change your page's CSS depending on what type of

20
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:51,120
device somebody's using, whether it's a mobile screen or it's a desktop screen,

21
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,280
how big it is, its height and width, or even the color of screens, go figure.

22
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,760
Let's take a look at a media query.

23
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:00,730
Inside the site's CSS file, I've added this media query.

24
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:03,280
We know it's a media query because it starts with @media.

25
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,990
We start off every media query with @media.

26
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:09,420
Then we have the keyword, only, which is going to help us with older browsers.

27
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:11,080
Then we have this keyword, screen.

28
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:15,260
This media type here, screen, is telling us that this media query applies to any

29
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:19,090
kind of screen, whether that's the tablet that I've got here, your desktop

30
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:22,950
computer, your laptop computer, or your phone, the all kind of screens.

31
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:24,520
You might see print here.

32
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:27,420
It's fairly common for websites to style themselves differently if they know

33
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,050
that somebody's going to print something out.

34
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:33,010
Then we have the logical operator and a condition within parenthesis.

35
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:37,220
In this case, our condition is max-width 300 pixels which is telling us that

36
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:40,050
this media query should apply only if the width of

37
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:43,070
the screen is smaller than 300 pixels.

38
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:44,570
If these two conditions match,

39
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:47,930
when the web page opens, we apply these styles which in this case is

40
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:51,860
the changing the background color of all the paragraph tags to blue.

41
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:55,690
So if we open our website and resize the screen to make it smaller than

42
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:59,790
300 pixels, we should see a blue background behind all of our paragraphs.

43
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:01,200
Let's see if it worked.

44
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,150
I will save it and open up Chrome and let me refresh the page just to make sure.

45
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:08,229
This is a little different than what we had before.

46
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:09,720
I've simplified it quite a bit.

47
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,980
We only have one paragraph and it's right here.

48
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:13,350
Let's make the screen smaller.

49
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:16,900
I'll grab right here and shrink it, shrink it, shrink it, shrink it.

50
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:19,500
And there we go, we hit the media query and the background turned blue.

51
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,470
For this quiz, I want you to experiment a little bit.

52
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:25,650
Which of these media queries will make paragraphs disappear when

53
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:27,050
screens are smaller than 500 pixels?

54
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:29,040
In the Instructor notes,

55
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,480
you'll find a sample HTML file, which should look pretty familiar.

56
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,470
Try adding these styles to main dot CSS and see what happens.
