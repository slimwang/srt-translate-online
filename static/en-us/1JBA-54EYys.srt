00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:04,916
Genes provide the instructions and thus, the raw materials to make up your

2
00:00:04,916 --> 00:00:11,382
cells, tissues and ultimately your whole body. That process of creation, called

3
00:00:11,382 --> 00:00:16,117
development, is highly variable from person to person and especially in the

4
00:00:16,117 --> 00:00:21,585
brain. Even small differences in how those cells and tissues are made can be

5
00:00:21,585 --> 00:00:25,810
responsible for differences in personality, intelligence, moods, and even

6
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:32,090
vulnerability to mental illness. With that in mind, what do you think is the

7
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:36,944
most accurate statement about the connection between genes and behavior? Is it

8
00:00:36,944 --> 00:00:42,648
that a few genes regulate most behaviors? A single gene controls a single

9
00:00:42,648 --> 00:00:47,322
behavior. Many genes are behind any given behavior. Or, genes have no

10
00:00:47,322 --> 00:00:51,535
connection with behavior at all? Go ahead and select the statement that you

11
00:00:51,535 --> 00:00:53,930
think is most likely to be true.
