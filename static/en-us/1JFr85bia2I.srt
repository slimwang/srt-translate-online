00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,242
Hopefully, these first two were pretty easy for you because I told you what to

2
00:00:03,254 --> 00:00:06,484
type. But for these last two, which probably were a bit more complicated than

3
00:00:06,496 --> 00:00:09,798
earlier ones, you can now see exactly which key you should type to get these

4
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:13,206
expressions. If you had trouble with this, just go back and practice it again.

5
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:16,423
We're going to keep using this throughout the entire course, so it's super

6
00:00:16,435 --> 00:00:19,925
important that you feel comfortable with this. I know it might feel a little bit

7
00:00:19,937 --> 00:00:23,336
funny at first, but I'm sure as you play around with it more, it'll become a lot

8
00:00:23,348 --> 00:00:24,517
more natural and intuitive.
