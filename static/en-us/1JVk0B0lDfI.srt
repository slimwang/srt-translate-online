1
00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:05,150
So users, we talked before
about how important they are.

2
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:08,380
So what can we be looking at to
gauge their interest in our product?

3
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:10,070
>> There are two reports
that could help us.

4
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:14,330
The Loyalty and
Recency reports can show users interest

5
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:18,440
in your app based on the frequency and
recently that they used it.

6
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:21,480
It's a great way to recognize
the users that love your app,

7
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,510
over the ones that just like it.

8
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:26,990
As Paul Graham said you want
100 people to love your app

9
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:28,480
over 1,000 that just like it.
