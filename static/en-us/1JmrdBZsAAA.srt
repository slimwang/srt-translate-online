00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:02,882
So we demonstrated how you can condition a fear response with a little Albert

2
00:00:02,882 --> 00:00:06,340
study. But there are some fear responses that can be conditioned after a single

3
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:11,385
pairing. Phobias can be conditioned after a single pairing. Say you were stung

4
00:00:11,385 --> 00:00:13,950
by a bee once and you were allergic, so every time you saw a bee you were

5
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:18,528
scared of it. Or if you had a near drowning experience when swimming, you might

6
00:00:18,528 --> 00:00:22,640
always be scared of the water after that. But we're going to talk about phobias

7
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,394
more later in the course when we talk about psychological disorders. But there

8
00:00:26,394 --> 00:00:29,592
is one thing I want to talk about here. Condition taste aversion. That can

9
00:00:29,592 --> 00:00:32,985
happen after just a single pairing. Let me go grab Susan so I can demonstrate

10
00:00:32,985 --> 00:00:34,170
this to you guys.
