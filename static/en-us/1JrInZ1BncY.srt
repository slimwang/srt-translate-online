For those of you who speak more
than one language, think about this:

2
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:07,480
are there ideas or concepts
that you know in one language,

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:11,335
but that have no equivalent
in another language? Yes or no?

4
00:00:11,335 --> 00:00:14,090
And for those of you
who speak only one language,

5
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:18,980
are there ideas and thoughts that you have
trouble putting into words? Yes or no?

6
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:21,820
Choose the answer,
to whichever question applies to you.
