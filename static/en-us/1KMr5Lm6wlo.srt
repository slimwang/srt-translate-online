00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,238
Let's continue with this extension of the t test. Now that we have gone a

2
00:00:04,238 --> 00:00:09,012
little in depth in the numerator, now let's focus on the denominator. Just like

3
00:00:09,012 --> 00:00:13,236
we analyzed the variability of the sample or samples, which we used in creating

4
00:00:13,236 --> 00:00:17,268
the standard error, we need to consider the variability of each individual

5
00:00:17,268 --> 00:00:23,616
sample when we are comparing three or more. Let's ease our way into this idea,

6
00:00:23,616 --> 00:00:27,712
starting with reflecting back on how the variability of individual samples

7
00:00:27,712 --> 00:00:34,117
impacts the difference in means. In both of these situations, these two samples

8
00:00:34,117 --> 00:00:39,625
have the same means and therefore, they have the same distance between means.

9
00:00:39,625 --> 00:00:43,285
Nonetheless in only one of these situations are the means significantly

10
00:00:43,285 --> 00:00:46,780
different from each other. Which one?
