00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:04,410
As you were moving around between apps,
you probably noticed that from a user

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:07,970
perspective, Android doesn't
announce changes in app state.

3
00:00:07,969 --> 00:00:09,759
It doesn't announce that
it's low on memory or

4
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:12,849
ask users to close apps
to free up resources.

5
00:00:12,849 --> 00:00:16,019
In fact, it does everything it can
to make the resource limitations of

6
00:00:16,019 --> 00:00:19,009
the device invisible to the user.

7
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:22,432
That means keeping the foreground
app running smoothly and

8
00:00:22,431 --> 00:00:24,491
switching between apps seamless.

9
00:00:24,492 --> 00:00:25,650
And that means killing
apps in the background.

10
00:00:25,649 --> 00:00:29,783
[BLANK_AUDIO]

11
00:00:29,783 --> 00:00:32,115
And it does that if it needs
their resources to make sure that

12
00:00:32,115 --> 00:00:34,700
the foreground apps can continue to run.

13
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:36,990
So we know that as soon as
your app isn't visible,

14
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:40,500
its lifetime is as perilous as that
of a Stark at the Red Wedding.

15
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,520
Likely to die without notice but
ready to return from the dead.

16
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:47,550
That tells us some very important
things about how our apps

17
00:00:47,549 --> 00:00:51,539
should behave to be good citizens and
provide a great user experience.

18
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:53,359
>From a system perspective, on pause and

19
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:56,390
on stop are signals that our
app may be killed imminently.

20
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:59,280
So we need to clean up any resources
that need an orderly tear down,

21
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,759
such as closing an open connections or
sockets.
