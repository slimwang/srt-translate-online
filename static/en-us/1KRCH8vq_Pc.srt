1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,630
Your goals need to be really specific,
with numbers and deadlines.

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:08,254
For example, increasing app
downloads by 5% in 30 days.

3
00:00:08,254 --> 00:00:11,634
You can use these goals as your KPIs or
key performance indicators for

4
00:00:11,634 --> 00:00:13,160
the next few months.

5
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:16,059
This will help you evaluate
the success of your business.

6
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:18,530
Remember, a KPI is a business metric

7
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:22,230
that you'll use to evaluate factors
that are important to your success.

8
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,560
Each business will have different KPIs.

9
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,918
For example, a clothing store's
KPI may be net revenue.

10
00:00:27,918 --> 00:00:31,940
The government's KPI
may be employment rate.

11
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:35,650
Or as for Embarkment, our KPI could be
the number of sitters we have on our

12
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:39,230
site, or the traffic we get to the site.

13
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:42,420
So to choose these goals, you'll want
to start thinking about the stage in

14
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:44,500
the funnel you want to improve on.

15
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,398
Is your goal to try and
bring in more visitors?

16
00:00:46,398 --> 00:00:48,997
Here you're going to
want to consider traffic.

17
00:00:48,997 --> 00:00:54,020
So your goal could be to increase
traffic by 5% in the next 60 days.

18
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:57,430
Maybe your goal is to
convert customers to leads.

19
00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:59,370
You can consider sign ups here.

20
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:02,180
So your aim could be to obtain 15,000

21
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:06,140
sign ups to receive launch
notifications over the next 90 days.

22
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:09,480
Or maybe your goal is to
convert leads to customers.

23
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,690
We could consider enrollment here.

24
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:17,140
Our goal could be to enroll 5% of our
leads into our premium subscription,

25
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:19,710
or just to turn them
into paying customers.

26
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:20,770
Goals like these are trackable,

27
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:25,270
and we can easily tie them into our
Google Analytics account to track.

28
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:27,510
We'll discuss that later in the course.

29
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:30,280
Okay, so taking in what you've learned
so far about setting your marketing

30
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:34,420
goals, I want you to revisit the two
goals you created earlier and

31
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:36,710
change them to reflect
what you've learned.

32
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:39,450
Now challenge yourself with this,
but be realistic.

33
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:41,440
You don't have all the money
in the world, yet,

34
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:44,400
and your team is probably understaffed.

35
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,430
