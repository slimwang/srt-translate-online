1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
It turns out that all positive values for the time step are okay no matter how high.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This is how similar to the backward Euler method

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
and now we're going to look into why that is the case.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
The trapezoidal weir turns this differential equation into the following.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
The next value of x equals the current value of x plus the time step

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,000
times the average of two rates of change, the current rate of change (-kx₁)

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and the next rate of change (-kx₂).

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I bring the x₂ to the left-hand side and combined this x₁ with that x₁

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:48,000
and get (1+hk/2) * x2 = (1-hk/2) * x1.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Let's check that, 1x₂, it's here. (hk/2)x₂ appears on the right-hand side with a - sign.

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:05,000
1x₁ appears here minus (hk/2)x₁ - (hk/2)x₁ appears here.

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Correct. And that's easy to solve for x₂. x₂ = (1-hk/2)/(1+hk/2)*x₁.

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
If you look at what happens with the next step. We of course, get a second factor of that sort.

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
The next next step, another factor of that sort. So what happens is that we get powers of this factor.

15
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The question is what's going to happen about powers of that factor.

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
So we see that to get it from x₁ to x₂, we have to multiple by this factor

17
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
and this is going to occur every step if we want to go from x₂ to x₃,

18
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
we again multiply by that factor and so on.

19
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
So in the end, we get the powers of this factor.

20
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
So the question is as the nth power of this expression converts to 0,

21
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
as it intends to infinity to check that, one can analyze three different cases.

22
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Let's first check what happens if the step size is moderate.

23
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:09,000
For instance, if this expression hk/2 equals 0.1 and we get (1-0.1)/(1+0.1)

24
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
meaning (0.9)/(1.1), this is a positive number, <1.

25
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
If you take higher and higher powers of that, this number is going to become 0.

26
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
The numerator becomes 0.9. The denominator becomes 1.1.

27
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:31,000
The fraction is a number between 0 and 1 and if we take higher and higher powers of such a number,

28
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
the results converge to 0, so this is stable.

29
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
So in this case, we have stability.

30
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:43,000
If hk/2 happens to be equal to 1, we get a fraction with a 0 in the numerator,

31
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
that's always 0, no problem with that, so we have stability in that case.

32
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:55,000
And if you use a really high value of h, for instance, such that hk/2=9,

33
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:02,000
we get something like 1-9=-8 divided by 1+9=10.

34
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
This is a negative number with absolute value less than 1.

35
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:11,000
So, if we take higher and higher powers, the result converges to 0,

36
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
we also have stability in this case but you see that this convergence comes along with an oscillation

37
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:23,000
that's time changes from minus to plus to minus to plus as we form even powers and odd powers.

38
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
The result has a positive sign. For odd powers, the result has a negative sign.

39
00:03:28,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So we see some kind of decaying oscillation here.
