1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,380
So in our case of eye color, where we have a brown allele and a bue allele, it

2
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:08,308
turns out that our brown allele is dominant over our blue allele. And what this

3
00:00:08,308 --> 00:00:13,580
means is that it masks the effect of the blue allele so that you can't see it.

4
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:17,252
Alternatively, the blue allele is referred to as recessive, because it's effect

5
00:00:17,252 --> 00:00:22,050
is masked when there is a dominant allele present. And we can show that here by

6
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:26,328
putting the blue allele inside the brown allele. Whereas the end product is we

7
00:00:26,328 --> 00:00:30,592
can only see the result of the dominant allele. So, in this case, what color

8
00:00:30,592 --> 00:00:33,240
eyes do you think the offspring would have?

9
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,600
>> Brown, since brown is the dominant allele.

10
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,464
>> Exactly.
