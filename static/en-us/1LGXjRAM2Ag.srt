1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:04,210
And the answer is, the first and the third. Mowing the lawn

2
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:07,570
is easily parallelizable. I can take one part, you another, and we'll get

3
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:10,120
it done in half the time. Playing the piano, I would say,

4
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:13,240
is not parallelizable. Sure, I might be able to play the right hand

5
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:16,329
and you the left, but the song isn't going to finish any faster.

6
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:19,430
Cooking dinner is clearly parallelizable. We don't wait for the rice to cook

7
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:23,080
before putting the chicken in the oven. Lastly, reading a novel in parallel

8
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:25,650
would be pretty difficult. You might be able to read one part and

9
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:27,410
I another, and then we could explain it

10
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:29,290
to each other, but I don`t think that counts
