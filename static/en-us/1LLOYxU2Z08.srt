1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,400
So this was the third and
final lecture on camera calibration.

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:07,190
The series of three lectures
that Aaron Bovick talked about.

3
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:10,760
Camera calibration starting from
extrinsic parameter calibration,

4
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:14,860
then intrinsic parameter calibration,
all the way to a practical guide on how

5
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:18,280
to use checkerboard patterns
to calibrate in a real world.

6
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:21,687
This is an important part of what we
need to know about cameras in general.

7
00:00:21,687 --> 00:00:25,232
While it may not be directly relevant to
the kinds of stuff we have talked about

8
00:00:25,232 --> 00:00:28,558
so far, it's an important foundational
principle of what we can do with

9
00:00:28,558 --> 00:00:29,992
computational photography.

10
00:00:29,992 --> 00:00:33,694
Especially when we want to get into
knowing more about the structure,

11
00:00:33,694 --> 00:00:36,290
the range, and the depth of a scene.

12
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:38,129
And hopefully that's what you
found interesting about it.

13
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:43,200
More on this topic, we'll follow up
when you get to topics like video.

14
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,860
We won't be talking much more about
calibration anymore in this context.

15
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:49,580
But again, as I said, its a foundational
thing, I want you all to know about.
