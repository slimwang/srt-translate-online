00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:04,780
Let's look at the answer to our DRAM
technology quiz which was asking us,

2
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:08,400
why not use a normal transistor and
a capacitor when making DRAM?

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,590
Is it because trench
cell is easier to make?

4
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:13,220
This is not true.

5
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:15,360
The trench cell is not easier to make.

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,660
It requires us to bury
something into the silicon.

7
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:23,040
So this one is actually incorrect.

8
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:27,940
Trench cells are more difficult to
make than capacitors, technologically.

9
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:30,170
Trench cell is more reliable.

10
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:31,810
This is also not true.

11
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:35,350
Trench cell lets us make
cheaper DRAM chips.

12
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:38,830
It looks like trench cells
are more difficult to make, so

13
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:40,619
the chips will be more expensive.

14
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:46,380
But remember that the cost
of a chip grows quickly

15
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:51,100
when the area is increased and decreases
quickly when the area is decreased.

16
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:56,610
The trench cell occupies a lot less
area on the chip than the transistor and

17
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:58,830
the capacitor normally would.

18
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:02,590
So, if we want to build a chip that has
the same number of bit with the trench

19
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:08,480
cell, or this way, the trench
cell results in much smaller and

20
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:11,230
thus way, way less expensive chips.

21
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:13,140
So this really is the correct answer.
