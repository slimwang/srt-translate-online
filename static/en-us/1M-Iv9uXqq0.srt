00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,640
Okay, here's the answer. Determines which process should

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:06,652
receive a packet. Well that's the job of the

3
00:00:06,652 --> 00:00:10,550
port, so I'll write one here. Determines the

4
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:14,550
last step on an Internet route. IP addresses are

5
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:17,710
made for Internet routing. So the destination will

6
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:20,810
indeed be the last stop. So I can write

7
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:23,040
two here and then for the last one it

8
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,630
is indeed the MAC address that determines which node

9
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:27,700
should listen to data sent on a shared link.
