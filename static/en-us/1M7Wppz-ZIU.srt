1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,910
Alright, let's start with this one.

2
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:07,895
One of these models was created
with k=N, and it's this one.

3
00:00:07,895 --> 00:00:13,960
If we use all of the neighbors and all
the data points, and take their average,

4
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:17,300
the value of our model will be
the same at every single point.

5
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:21,020
Namely the mean of all the Y's
of all the data points.

6
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:24,740
So this one is b, as in bravo.

7
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:26,510
Let's do this one next, K=1.

8
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:32,430
We know that this model is going
to tag each point exactly,

9
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:36,330
because, when we're at that data point,
we'll have exactly that value.

10
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:42,800
So this model steps up and down and
tags each individual point exactly.

11
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:48,200
So that's a C, and this is, this one
is K=3, which we already looked at, A.

12
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:54,850
Okay this next question, as we increase
k we are more likely to overfit,

13
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:57,060
that is false.

14
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:01,780
In K and N, if K is equal to one,
will have the most overfit model.

15
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:06,520
And as we increase K, we're less and
less likely to overfit as we go forward.
