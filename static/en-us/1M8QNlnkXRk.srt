1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,540
But who's going to do these two things?

2
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:04,490
Should it be the operating system?

3
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:08,050
So when we have a TLB miss,
we go back into the operating system and

4
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:12,400
let it figure out what the page tables
have, using some sort of software?

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:17,190
Or, should the processor automatically
read the page table, or page tables, and

6
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:20,900
then update the TLB, without any
operating system intervention?

7
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:23,170
Which one of these two
do you think is correct?
