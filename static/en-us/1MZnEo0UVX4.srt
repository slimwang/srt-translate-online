00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,876
The location of particular values on the X axis is often described in terms of

2
00:00:04,876 --> 00:00:09,699
standard deviations. Here you can see this is the mean, this is the mean plus

3
00:00:09,699 --> 00:00:14,487
one standard deviation, this is the mean plus two standard deviations, and

4
00:00:14,487 --> 00:00:19,503
likewise, this is the mean minus one standard deviation and minus two standard

5
00:00:19,503 --> 00:00:24,677
deviations. Whatever score we might have, we can convert it to a value equal to

6
00:00:24,677 --> 00:00:29,762
the number of standard deviations away from the mean. Let's call it z. By

7
00:00:29,762 --> 00:00:35,290
converting scores in a normal distribution to this special number z. We can know

8
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:40,662
the percent less than or greater than that value. For example, if we find that a

9
00:00:40,662 --> 00:00:45,977
value is one standard deviation away from the mean. Then no matter what normal

10
00:00:45,977 --> 00:00:51,409
distribution we have. We know that approximately 84 percent are less than that

11
00:00:51,409 --> 00:00:56,213
value. In the next lesson, you'll learn how to calculate the proportions less

12
00:00:56,213 --> 00:01:00,881
than or greater than certain values in a normal distribution. What's an example

13
00:01:00,881 --> 00:01:04,952
in which we might want to know the proportion less than or greater than a

14
00:01:04,952 --> 00:01:08,662
particular number? Let's illustrate this with another story.
