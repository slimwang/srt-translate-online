00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:03,330
Previously you've seen
the view did load gets called,

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:06,710
when the view controller
class is loaded into memory.

3
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:10,930
This diagram illustrates the view and
view controller life cycle.

4
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:14,130
When the view in view controller
are changing states, these functions,

5
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:15,800
if you have implemented them,
will get called.

6
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:21,972
In iOS, the will functions always
get called before the did functions.

7
00:00:21,972 --> 00:00:22,940
If YouWill appear,

8
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:26,500
gets called before the view
controller in its view are onscreen.

9
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:30,621
If YouDid appear,
gets called right after the view and

10
00:00:30,621 --> 00:00:33,430
view controller are on screen.

11
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:36,510
This is really useful if you want
something to happen right before or

12
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:39,970
right after a view
controller's view appears.

13
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:43,430
If you override these functions in your
view controller, they will get called.

14
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:46,680
Otherwise, their default
in empty implementations

15
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,570
in the UI view controller class,
will get called instead.

16
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:55,780
The last point bears repeating, as it
is a common error I've seen many times.

17
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:59,210
If you mistyped the function
name it's not the same function.

18
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:02,400
For example,
view will appear as you see here.

19
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,160
Has an extra P,

20
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:08,710
into IOS it is a completely different
function than the one it's looking for.

21
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:11,900
So I would never call this function,
even though, our code would compile.

22
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:18,050
Remember, programming is an exercise
in trying to be as precise as possible.

23
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:21,300
Don't worry too much though,
Xcode autocomplete will help you

24
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:22,960
in filling out the names
of these functions.
