00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,407
So far, we've looked at the state
space of cities in Romania,

2
00:00:03,407 --> 00:00:05,780
a two-dimensional physical space.

3
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:06,794
But the technology for

4
00:00:06,794 --> 00:00:10,830
problem-solving through search can
deal with many types of state spaces.

5
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:14,879
Dealing with abstract properties,
not just x-y position in a plane.

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,109
Here I introduce another state space,
the vacuum world.

7
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:23,448
It's a very simple world in which
there are only two positions,

8
00:00:23,448 --> 00:00:27,560
as opposed to the many positions
in the Romania state space.

9
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:30,050
But there are additional
properties to deal with as well.

10
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:34,609
So the robot vacuum cleaner can be
in either of the two conditions.

11
00:00:34,609 --> 00:00:39,369
But as well as that, each of the
positions can either have dirt in it or

12
00:00:39,369 --> 00:00:41,049
not have dirt in it.

13
00:00:41,049 --> 00:00:42,709
And now the question is,

14
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:47,429
to represent this as a state space,
how many states do we need?

15
00:00:47,429 --> 00:00:50,237
The number of states,
can fill in this box here.

16
00:00:50,237 --> 00:00:59,019
