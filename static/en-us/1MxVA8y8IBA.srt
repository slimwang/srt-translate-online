00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:04,120
Welcome to the class where you get serious about web development.

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:07,180
By the end of this course, your code will be professional, and

3
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:09,340
professional code is what will get you your next job.

4
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:14,160
You'll be able to build an organized application, both with or

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,730
without an organizational JavaScript library or framework.

6
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:21,360
You'll also be able to look at those libraries and figure out how to use them.

7
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,950
And you'll understand why using libraries can be a good idea.

8
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:27,460
So, what's the progression of this course?

9
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:31,570
First, we'll build an application together the way we already know how.

10
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:34,320
Then we'll look at some of the problems with what we know, and

11
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,060
learn some techniques to solve those problems.

12
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,150
Next, we'll move on to learning frameworks.

13
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:42,580
And finally, we'll learn to pick up some code we've never seen before and

14
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:45,040
how to tackle that otherwise scary process.

15
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:48,030
The final project will be a neighborhood map.

16
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:51,730
It'll be completely self-led and good enough to put in your portfolio for

17
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:53,280
job interviews.

18
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,560
Now, I want you to take your time with this course and projects.

19
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:57,630
Don't rush.

20
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:01,130
Together we'll be fundamentally changing the way you think about application

21
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:05,920
development, so give yourself the space and time to learn it properly.

22
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,020
And take some time also to embark on projects of your own outside of the class.

23
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:11,374
Find some time to play.

24
00:01:11,374 --> 00:01:13,820
Now, this course will be challenging at points.

25
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:17,090
So, if you're having a rough time at any point, it's not you.

26
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:18,590
This is by design.

27
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:21,720
You might feel scared, like I did when I first learned this, and

28
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,800
it's normal to feel that way when you learn anything new.

29
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:25,670
But you will get there.

30
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:29,850
And your successes, well, your successes will be thrilling.

31
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:30,890
Bask in them.
