00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
[Narrator] While histogram filters tend to be approximate

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
because the world tends not to be discrete.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
So localization, for example, it's clearly an approximate filter.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
It turns out kalman filters are also approximate,

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and it's a much more subtle observation.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
It turns out kalman filters only are exact for linear systems,

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
whereas the world happens to be nonlinear.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Now this goes into a lot of deep math, which I don't want to get into here,

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
but you should understand that both of these filters are not exact.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Both of them tend to be just approximations of the correct posterior distribution.
