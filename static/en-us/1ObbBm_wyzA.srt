1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,100
You've already seen a lot
of semantic elements.

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:07,560
These are elements where the tag name
reflects the purpose of the element.

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:09,480
It starts with paragraphs and spans, but

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:13,840
it goes all the way to elements like
footer, and article, and section.

5
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:17,890
There are many of these, and most of
them have predefined styles, shapes,

6
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:19,860
sizes, and purposes.

7
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:24,100
The nice thing about them is that they
make HTML really easy to read and

8
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:25,410
understand.

9
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:29,600
For instance, a div at the bottom
of an HTML document could serve

10
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,270
any purpose and look like anything.

11
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:35,460
But a footer element must take up
the full width of the screen, and

12
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:39,480
it's probably going to contain
information about whoever made the page.

13
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,930
So, with that in mind
let's see how this looks.

14
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:50,500
I will start off by drawing a big
ole rectangle to represent the page.

15
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:54,800
Those lines look straight enough, okay.

16
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,890
And let's see,
the top of the page has a header.

17
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:58,305
So that's going to be helpful and

18
00:00:58,305 --> 00:01:00,598
it looks like there are two
main components to it.

19
00:01:00,598 --> 00:01:05,327
So I'll go ahead and draw a big line for
the header because there is a logo.

20
00:01:05,327 --> 00:01:06,592
And it says Udacity logo so

21
00:01:06,592 --> 00:01:10,490
I'm just going to draw a U because
I can't really do that 3D thing.

22
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:13,800
And then there is a nav.

23
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:14,230
Now, that nav is really helpful.

24
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:19,550
That tells me that these are basically
buttons at the top of the page that

25
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:22,663
explain and give you an idea
of what you can click on.

26
00:01:22,663 --> 00:01:25,700
Okay, so that's good, now let's see.

27
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:28,240
After the header there's a main section.

28
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,220
I'm not actually going to mark that
off because it sounds like that's

29
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:35,289
basically going to be the rest of
the page unless there's a footer.

30
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:38,668
And then right underneath the main,
there's an article.

31
00:01:38,668 --> 00:01:40,694
So an article is supposed
to be standalone.

32
00:01:40,694 --> 00:01:45,700
So I'm going to draw that as
a big standalone rectangle.

33
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:47,309
Oop, not really centered.

34
00:01:47,309 --> 00:01:50,840
That's okay, doesn't have to be perfect.

35
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,920
And let's see, there is a title.

36
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,220
It's a header, h2.

37
00:01:56,220 --> 00:02:00,418
So I'm going to just draw
Title in big letters.

38
00:02:00,418 --> 00:02:04,743
And then there's an address that looks
like it's saying who wrote this.

39
00:02:04,743 --> 00:02:07,839
We'll just put that there,
and there's a figure.

40
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:15,600
Now, a figure has usually something
like an image plus a caption.

41
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,510
And that's what I'm seeing here.

42
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:19,790
I'm seeing an image of cats.

43
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,280
This is a cat, I promise this is a cat,
take my word for it.

44
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:26,690
And there's a caption, a figcaption
underneath it, there's my figcaption.

45
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:30,350
And then it looks like there's
a div called a teaser, and

46
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:31,359
it's got a lot of text in it.

47
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,460
So I assume that this is going to
be the rest of the article.

48
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:36,430
Okay, that looks pretty good.

49
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,750
Let's see, and
then there's some more buttons.

50
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,900
I didn't leave myself any space.

51
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:44,450
Let's just put those over here.

52
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:47,339
These are the social media buttons.

53
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,700
Okay, not great,
that should probably be here.

54
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:51,320
That's okay.

55
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:54,680
Next up, there's an hr,
which is a horizontal rule.

56
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,310
Now that actually would
show up on the page.

57
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:57,490
You would actually see this.

58
00:02:57,490 --> 00:03:00,263
It's not just me separating and
assuming there's one.

59
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:02,400
We know this has to be here.

60
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,690
Then there's another article.

61
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:07,200
And I am completely out of space, so
I'm just going to draw the top of it.

62
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,470
Okay, and it looks like it has
basically the same structure.

63
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:17,180
So there is a title with
some address underneath it.

64
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:19,693
Let us know where it's from,
and a figure.

65
00:03:19,693 --> 00:03:22,695
And there I'm just going to draw
the very top of the figure and

66
00:03:22,695 --> 00:03:24,239
leave it at that.

67
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:24,890
I'm going to go ahead and

68
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:29,109
guess that the page that James
gave me looks something like this.
