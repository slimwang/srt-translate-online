1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:03,910
In this lesson you'll learn
how to define entity classes.

2
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:08,109
We'll use an entity class called
Profile to save user profiles.

3
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:11,290
You'll learn how to get a user ID for
the logged in user so

4
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:14,730
you can use it as the unique ID for
the entity's key.

5
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:17,520
We'll explore the entities in the data
store by using the data store

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,400
viewer in the Admin Console.

7
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:22,220
And it's not much good putting data
into the data store if we can't get

8
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:23,430
it back out.

9
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:27,040
So you'll learn how to get the profile
entities back out of the datastore.

10
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:27,810
So let's get into that.
