1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:04,049
Notifications are seriously awesome,
so let's set them up.

2
00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:07,689
First you'll need to make sure that you
have the Firebase messaging dependency

3
00:00:07,689 --> 00:00:09,419
in the build.gradle file.

4
00:00:09,419 --> 00:00:12,710
So here I'll grab that dependency and

5
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:16,500
I will add it over here and
of course, you should sync.

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,309
Now what this dependency does
is it allows our app to receive

7
00:00:19,309 --> 00:00:22,629
Firebase notifications
from the Firebase console,

8
00:00:22,629 --> 00:00:25,210
as well as messages from
Firebase Cloud messaging.

9
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:29,719
And after syncing with Gradle,
that's it, that is literally it.

10
00:00:29,719 --> 00:00:32,298
Having this one line
dependency in our project

11
00:00:32,298 --> 00:00:35,659
means firebase is now set up
to receive notifications.

12
00:00:35,659 --> 00:00:36,969
So let's try it out.

13
00:00:36,969 --> 00:00:40,869
I'm here in the console and
I'm going to go ahead over here and

14
00:00:40,869 --> 00:00:45,469
under the grow header you'll
see the notifications tab.

15
00:00:45,469 --> 00:00:50,649
We'll click SEND YOUR FIRST MESSAGE
to well, send your first message.

16
00:00:50,649 --> 00:00:53,199
This brings us to the message
composer section.

17
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:57,280
As you could see, it's pretty simple to
use, but also has a lot of options for

18
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:57,450
you.

19
00:00:58,671 --> 00:01:01,349
We're going to just send
the simplest notification which will

20
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:03,789
only require us to
edit two of the fields.

21
00:01:03,789 --> 00:01:06,810
First, we'll add some message
text to the notification.

22
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:10,269
This gets displayed in the notification
received on the device.

23
00:01:10,269 --> 00:01:12,890
We'll leave the optional
message label part blank

24
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:16,269
which is only displayed internally for
our eyes in the console anyway.

25
00:01:16,269 --> 00:01:19,069
Scrolling down, we'll also leave
the default delivery date for

26
00:01:19,069 --> 00:01:21,979
the notification date so
it's sent immediately.

27
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:25,650
Next, we'll choose how much of our
apps audience to actually target.

28
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:29,540
We could target a user by their segment,
by topic, or

29
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:31,480
even just target a single device.

30
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:34,420
For now, we'll just simply
target all of our apps users.

31
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:35,939
So I'll go ahead and
select friendly chat.

32
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,650
If I scroll down I'll see that the send
message button is now highlighted blue,

33
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:44,140
meaning that we're ready
to send our notification.

34
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:47,700
But before we do that, let's make sure
that the newest version of our app

35
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:51,930
is running, and that our app is
in the background on our device.

36
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:54,310
Our notification as it setup right now,

37
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:57,109
won't actually be received if
our app is in the fourth run.

38
00:01:57,109 --> 00:02:00,579
With a little bit of coding, you could
get around this but if this example with

39
00:02:00,579 --> 00:02:04,730
no code running on the client side we're
restricted to background notifications.

40
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:08,810
Okay, let's go back to the console,
and I'm going to click send message.

41
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:12,990
This lets us review and
looks good so I'm going to send.

42
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:17,254
Now back on our device we should see
the notification instantly show up.

43
00:02:17,254 --> 00:02:18,384
And there it is.

44
00:02:18,384 --> 00:02:21,125
Also bonus feature tapping
on the notification

45
00:02:21,125 --> 00:02:22,784
takes us straight into the app.

46
00:02:22,784 --> 00:02:26,325
And you did all of this with just
one line in your build.gradle file.

47
00:02:26,325 --> 00:02:27,510
Pretty amazing.
