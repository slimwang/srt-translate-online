00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:04,600
The notion of axiomatic concepts is the classical view in cognitive systems.

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:08,400
Here's an alternative view. This is called Prototypical concepts.

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,940
Prototypical concept is a base concepts defined by some typical

4
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:18,080
properties that can sometimes be overridden. So, an example is a chair. You and

5
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:22,330
I have a notion of a prototypical chair. Our notion of a prototypical chair may

6
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:25,370
have, for example, there is a back, there is four legs and so

7
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:30,500
on. So, here might be your and my notion of a prototypical chair. It has a back,

8
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:34,710
it has a seat, it has four legs and so on. Now I can represent this notion of

9
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:38,780
the prototypical chair in the language of frames. This is something we have come

10
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:43,740
across earlier in the class. A frame has slots and fillers, as you may recall,

11
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:47,490
and we use frames to represent stereotypes. Here we're talking about prototypes,

12
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:52,710
so very closely related. So concept is the a content you can represent.

13
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:55,940
Frame is the form in which we can represent it. So a notion for

14
00:00:55,940 --> 00:01:00,860
the prototypical chair might be, it has four legs, it, the material is metal,

15
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:04,750
it has a back, it does not have arms, and it's not cushioned.

16
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,530
Note that these are the typical properties of a chair. Of course, some chairs

17
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:14,830
need not necessarily satisfy all of these properties. That is why there are no,

18
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:18,500
no necessary and sufficient conditions here. For example, we may come across

19
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:23,150
a chair. Which is made of wood. While you would still consider it a chair,

20
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:25,940
even if you're not strictly satisfied with this particular definition.

21
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:33,040
Thus, these properties can be overridden in case of specific instances.

22
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,470
But we'll still have the basic notion of a prototypical chair so

23
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:41,520
that we can in fact communicate with each other about what a chair is.

24
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,090
Despite the fact that we can override these properties we do still have

25
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:49,250
a notion of prototypical chair. So the relationships between concepts and

26
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:53,740
frames actually is quite close. Recall that when we were talking about frames,

27
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:58,270
we were also talking about inheritance and default. The notion of default in

28
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:03,510
frames is closely connected to the notion of typical properties and concepts. So

29
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:08,250
chair has this prototypical notion with some of these typical properties, and

30
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:12,560
we can think of this as having a default values. By default, we assume

31
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:18,240
the number of legs is four, the material is metal and so on. Here is a stool and

32
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:24,140
this stool is a kind of chair which means that it inherits all the values and

33
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:27,560
all the slots that are there in the chair directly except for

34
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:32,290
those that happen to be different from the one in the chair. So then an example

35
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:36,710
here it over writes a notion that the chair necessarily has to have a back.

36
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:39,260
In the case of a stool, the stool does not have a back.
