1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,800
Decision trees are directed graphs.

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:06,010
There is no recursion.

3
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:07,080
You can't loop back.

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:11,708
You only go one way one time,
and time is not represented.

5
00:00:11,708 --> 00:00:15,680
Here's a classic generic
clinical decision strategy

6
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:18,460
where different treatment choices
yield different outcomes.
