1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,780
And at first, I want you and me to derive this

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:07,316
mathematically and it is challenging if you don’t

3
00:00:07,316 --> 00:00:10,501
like calculus, you can skip over it. So feel free to

4
00:00:10,501 --> 00:00:13,038
skip. If you skip, no one is ever going to know

5
00:00:13,038 --> 00:00:16,420
and I promise you derivation is not essential for

6
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:18,643
using this formula over here. You can use

7
00:00:18,643 --> 00:00:21,907
entirely without understanding why it’s correct.

8
00:00:21,907 --> 00:00:25,321
But if you stick with me, you get a sense of how

9
00:00:25,321 --> 00:00:28,916
statistics really works as a scientific discipline.

10
00:00:28,916 --> 00:00:31,199
So it’s a glimpse into the beauty of more

11
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,995
advanced statistics. So last chance, you’re going

12
00:00:33,995 --> 00:00:36,796
to skip? Hey, thanks for staying on.

13
00:00:36,796 --> 00:00:39,147
So here’s my quiz and it looks complicated but

14
00:00:39,147 --> 00:00:41,672
let me explain it to you. I better derive for you

15
00:00:41,672 --> 00:00:44,090
the desired equation on here which is the

16
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:46,327
maximum likelihood estimator all the way from

17
00:00:46,327 --> 00:00:49,142
the definition of the probability of the data. You

18
00:00:49,142 --> 00:00:52,329
might remember data is comprised of XIs where

19
00:00:52,329 --> 00:00:57,028
each XI is 1 one for heads and zero for tails.

20
00:00:57,028 --> 00:00:58,987
And of course, P is the desired probability of

21
00:00:58,987 --> 00:01:01,973
heads. I left open the derivation, however, nine

22
00:01:01,973 --> 00:01:04,799
steps or where these nine bars that will turn into

23
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,424
boxes very soon, and what you have to do is

24
00:01:06,424 --> 00:01:09,474
you have to pick from the 13 choices over here,

25
00:01:09,474 --> 00:01:11,475
the ones that fit best. There is always a unique

26
00:01:11,475 --> 00:01:14,024
answer and you can only use each of the things

27
00:01:14,024 --> 00:01:16,373
on the right side once. So there will be four

28
00:01:16,373 --> 00:01:19,454
things left, 13 minus 9, that you’ve never used.

29
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:21,200
So for example, if you believe that the right

30
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,372
answer over here is PN, then you’re going to

31
00:01:24,372 --> 00:01:27,356
type 6 into the box over here and PN is now

32
00:01:27,356 --> 00:01:30,604
used, you can't write 6 anywhere else. So good

33
00:01:30,604 --> 00:01:34,170
luck with this. The way the proof works is by first

34
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:36,641
taking the logarithm of this expression over here,

35
00:01:36,641 --> 00:01:39,388
this ends up over here and we said the first

36
00:01:39,388 --> 00:01:41,038
derivative is zero. So you have to complete the

37
00:01:41,038 --> 00:01:43,236
first derivative and plug in here and then you

38
00:01:43,236 --> 00:01:45,427
have to transform it all the way until you achieve

39
00:01:45,427 --> 00:01:49,427
the final result. Good luck.
