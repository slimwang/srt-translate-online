1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,410
Okay, I hope you're enjoying the case study so far. What

2
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:06,180
I'd like to do here, is set us up for the

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:08,109
portion of the case study where you're going to be cleaning

4
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:11,920
your data. Now, before we dive into the code, what I'd

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:15,560
like to do is just remind you where the documentation is

6
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:18,470
for the OpenStreetMap data set. The easiest place to find it

7
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:21,230
is through the wiki and I purposely kept this page a

8
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:25,210
little small so positionally you'll remember where to find the documentation.

9
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:29,380
So what we are looking for here is the OSM XML link. Okay, and I'll just make

10
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:31,550
the page big enough so you can actually read

11
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:34,965
the documentation. Now what I am interested in, you

12
00:00:34,965 --> 00:00:37,595
see, is the way in which the XML file

13
00:00:37,595 --> 00:00:43,740
was organized into nodes and ways. And also, relations.

14
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:45,500
Now the thing to note here is that our

15
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:50,010
data, is setup so that nodes can be tagged.

16
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:56,560
As can ways, alright? And the semantics of this type of structure here,

17
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:03,180
is that these tags, because they're nested within this node Actually tag this

18
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:08,720
particular node here and the same is true with way tags that we find.

19
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:15,360
So here we're seeing tags that are actually describing this particular way

20
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,040
here. Okay? So it's actually pretty straight forward,

21
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,020
but in terms of parsing it, we have to

22
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:24,870
remember that in order to understand exactly what a

23
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:29,360
given tag, tag describes. Okay, so what I'd like

24
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,080
to do in this example, is talk a little

25
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:35,520
bit about cleaning street names. Now back in Lesson

26
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,080
Three, we actually looked quickly at an example of

27
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,840
auditing street names. We're going to take that example

28
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:45,440
a little bit further. And here we're actually going to apply it to ways. Now

29
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:48,660
ways in this data set are streets. They're

30
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:51,290
essentially paths through a city of one kind

31
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:57,630
or another. So avenues, squares, commons, other sorts of areas that are a way of

32
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:00,240
getting from one place to another is essentially

33
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,420
how way is defined in this data set.
