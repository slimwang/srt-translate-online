00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,613
To recap,

2
00:00:00,613 --> 00:00:04,503
you learned how to use multiple
tools to diagnose memory problems.

3
00:00:04,503 --> 00:00:08,140
Now we started with our familiar
friend Trace You, but you also

4
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:12,328
learned about some memory-specific
tools including Memory Monitor,

5
00:00:12,328 --> 00:00:14,340
Heat Viewer Allocation Tracker.

6
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:15,430
But most importantly,

7
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:18,870
you want to evaluate your problematic
code against several tools and

8
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:23,010
seek multiple perspectives as to what is
actually happening underneath the hood.

9
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:25,560
Finally, it's important to
understand each tool has a strength.

10
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:29,930
Memory Monitor's a great way to get
a dynamic view of your memory over time

11
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:33,740
and Heap Viewer's great for
showing what exactly is on your heap.

12
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:35,930
And lastly,

13
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:39,070
Allocation Tracker shows you where a
particular location came from your code.
