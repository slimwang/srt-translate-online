00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,350
Hello, and welcome to Computability,
Complexity, and

2
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:06,960
Algorithms, the introductory
theoretical computer science course for

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,660
the Georgia Tech Masters and
PhD programs.

4
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:12,780
I'm Lance Fortnow, professor in
the School of Computer Science

5
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:15,310
at the Georgia Institute of Technology.

6
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:18,530
>> And I'm Charles Brubaker,
a PhD graduate from Georgia Tech, and

7
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:20,200
Udacity course developer.

8
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,780
>> In this course,
we'll ask the big questions.

9
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:24,020
What is a computer?

10
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:25,840
What are the limits of computation?

11
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,560
Are there problems that no
computer will ever solve?

12
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:30,170
Are there problems that
can't be solved quickly?

13
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:32,619
What kinds of problems
can we solve efficiently?

14
00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:34,639
And how do we go about
developing these algorithms?

15
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,980
Understanding the power and limitations
of algorithms helps us develop the tools

16
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:44,370
to make real world computers smarter,
faster, and safer.

17
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:47,340
We step away from the particulars
of programming languages and

18
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:51,210
computer architectures and instead
take an abstract view of computing.

19
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:54,573
This viewpoint allows us to understand
where the computation problem is

20
00:00:54,573 --> 00:00:56,580
inherently easy or hard to solve.

21
00:00:56,580 --> 00:01:00,540
Independent of the specific limitation
of a machine we plan to use.

22
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:04,410
These results have stood the test of
time, being as valuable to us today

23
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:06,870
as they were when they
were developed in the 70s.

24
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:08,830
While the topic of the course is theory,

25
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:11,430
understanding the material can
have very practical benefits.

26
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:14,798
You will learn a wealth of tools that
will help you recognize when problems

27
00:01:14,798 --> 00:01:17,136
you encounter in the real
world are intractable and

28
00:01:17,136 --> 00:01:18,892
when there is an efficient solution.

29
00:01:18,892 --> 00:01:22,222
This can save you countless hours that
would otherwise have been spent on

30
00:01:22,222 --> 00:01:24,580
a fruitless endeavor or
in reinventing the wheel.

31
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:29,230
Certainly by having followed the
rigorous arguments made in this course,

32
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:31,810
you'll have given yourself
a kind of training.

33
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:33,740
The athlete doesn't just
practice on the field or

34
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:37,150
the court where the competition is held,
he goes to the gym.

35
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:39,910
And when he returns, he finds he
is better prepared for the game.

36
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:44,480
In a similar way, by taking this course,
you'll improve your thinking,

37
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,840
as you make engineering, or
even business decisions.

38
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,700
You will find that you have better
reasons to prefer one strategy

39
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:50,850
over another, and

40
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:54,810
will be able to articulate more rigorous
arguments in support of your ideas.

41
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:55,810
Shall we get started?

42
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:56,660
>> Let's hit that gym!
