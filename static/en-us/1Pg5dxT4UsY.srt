00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,228
I hope you've been cruising along through the course so far. Now, I'm going to

2
00:00:03,228 --> 00:00:07,650
throw you a little roadblock. Let's say your car breaks down at mile marker 210

3
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:12,883
while driving down Interstate I-80. I-80 runs from west to east in the state of

4
00:00:12,883 --> 00:00:18,254
Nevada, and the interstate cuts across the entire state. Since your car's

5
00:00:18,254 --> 00:00:23,398
broken down, you need to walk to the nearest town. Using the map in the car you

6
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:29,734
determine that there's a gas station 21 miles south of mile marker 190. So, you

7
00:00:29,734 --> 00:00:36,033
know you're here and you're wondering what's the distance to mile marker 190?
