00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:04,589
Here's a way to group the houses which
doesn't require us to specify the number

2
00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:05,790
of clusters beforehand.

3
00:00:07,139 --> 00:00:10,009
Let's say the houses
are arranged like this.

4
00:00:10,009 --> 00:00:12,000
It would make sense
to say the following,

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,179
if two houses are close they should
be served by the same pizza parlor.

6
00:00:17,179 --> 00:00:21,000
So going by this philosophy
let's try to group the houses.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,519
Let's look at which houses
are the closest to each other.

8
00:00:24,519 --> 00:00:27,160
It's these two over here,
so we group those two.

9
00:00:28,449 --> 00:00:31,730
Now, which are the next
two closest houses?

10
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:35,170
It's these two over here,
so we group them.

11
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:40,419
The next two closest houses are these
two, so we group them and we keep going.

12
00:00:40,418 --> 00:00:42,969
The next two closest houses are here and

13
00:00:42,969 --> 00:00:47,329
now something funny happens because
one house is already grouped.

14
00:00:47,329 --> 00:00:51,899
What we do, is we join the clusters
containing each of the houses.

15
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:55,030
The next two clusters are here,
so we join the respective groups.

16
00:00:56,219 --> 00:00:59,280
The next two are here,
so we joined our groups.

17
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,550
And now the next two closest
houses are these two over here.

18
00:01:02,549 --> 00:01:03,799
But that's already too far.

19
00:01:03,799 --> 00:01:05,140
So let's stop there.

20
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:08,920
What we did here is we picked
a distance to begin with and said,

21
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:15,049
whenever the two closest houses are this
distance apart we'll stop the algorithm.

22
00:01:15,049 --> 00:01:19,159
That will control how far we
want the clusters to be apart.

23
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:22,629
This algorithm is known as
hierarchical clustering.

24
00:01:22,629 --> 00:01:25,599
So we can see that hierarchical
clustering is useful

25
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:27,789
when we may not know
the number of clusters, but

26
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:30,490
we have an idea about how
far we want them to be.
