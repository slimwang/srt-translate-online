1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:01,110
We talked about that,

2
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:05,900
there were different ways of transforming images one to another.

3
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:07,830
And you know, so

4
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:11,290
I might have two images that are related by some transformation.

5
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:13,330
And we talked about how if I know the transformation, and

6
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:15,120
I know it go from one image to the next.

7
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,490
But suppose I have two images.

8
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:21,940
And I'd like to figure out the transformation that takes image 1 to image 2.

9
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:24,020
How would I go about doing that?

10
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:27,240
Well, to do this, I need matching or corresponding points.

11
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:31,250
So, the way we're going to go about finding corresponding points is,

12
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:33,990
using something that we're going to call Local Features.

13
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:35,610
You know, this is a little 1 and a little 2 there.

14
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:38,970
We're going to put some meat behind defining what we mean to be Local, and

15
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:40,860
what we mean to be Features.

16
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:43,880
By the way, some of you have taken machine learning courses and

17
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:44,830
things like that.

18
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:48,330
And then and, you've seen feature vectors.

19
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:49,660
That's not what we mean here.

20
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:51,690
We're actually going to mean that later in the course,

21
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:55,510
here features are going to be things that we compute about some little

22
00:00:55,510 --> 00:01:00,300
local spot, they're related to feature vectors but, but we were here first.

23
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:01,100
All right.

24
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:06,720
Our goal is to find points in an image, that can be found in other images.

25
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:11,160
And by the way, not just found in other images, but found precisely.

26
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:13,800
And what that means is, you know, you, you tell me about,

27
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:17,530
I should be able to precisely determine where that point is.

28
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:21,010
So just saying it's the middle of this gray panel, not so great.

29
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:23,500
But if you told me it's this tip of this spear,

30
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,300
that would be better in terms of being localized.

31
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:29,070
Also I want to reliably do the matching, right?

32
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:30,080
So if I find this point,

33
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:33,850
if I find a bunch of other points, I want to be really sure that they say no,

34
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:36,530
it's not this one, it's not, it's definitely that one, right?

35
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:39,890
So this is this idea of well matched points.

36
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:42,440
All right? So why do I want to do this?

37
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:46,000
Well, we talked about things like I might want to recover the fundamental matrix

38
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,030
to recover geometry,

39
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:49,380
remember we said that if you give if you give it enough correspondences.

40
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:53,750
In robotics and other computer vision things, we might want to see how a bunch

41
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:57,480
of points have moved from one frame to the next, and in order to do that.

42
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:00,180
I have to figure out which points were, were which.

43
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,550
Or, I might want to build a panorama.

44
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:04,620
Now, we've talked about this is general.

45
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:06,700
But here's really a beautiful example.

46
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:10,650
This comes from a paper by Brown and Lowe in CV, in ICCV in 2003.

47
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:14,512
Let me just play that again, because it's so cool.

48
00:02:14,512 --> 00:02:15,440
All right, and

49
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,200
here what they've done is they've figured out what matching points.

50
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,200
How to place each one of the pictures on top of a another?

51
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,530
In order to do that they had to find these matching points.
