1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:04,100
Here is the project you're going
to help complete and get working.

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:07,970
It's a little quiz app that reads
a phrase to you in a random language and

3
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:09,740
displays three choices.

4
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:11,540
One of these is the correct one.

5
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:13,960
You can make a choice or
hear another phrase.

6
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:18,160
The app you know if what you
choose is correct or not.

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,730
We built this app with two purposes.

8
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:24,920
First, we think can be a fun little
app to show your family and friends.

9
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:28,430
Here and your hands after
a few minutes on the Udacity

10
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:33,830
iOS developer nanodegree you have an app
that can speak in multiple languages.

11
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:37,200
The second purpose is in my
mind the most important one.

12
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,130
With this app you can get
a glimpse of the power of iOS.

13
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:46,030
We did not use pre recorded audio iOS is
speaking in these different languages

14
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:47,450
on the fly.

15
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:52,610
Let me stress that point again iOS is
able to speak any text that you have

16
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:56,280
in a variety of languages with
just a few lines of code.

17
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,010
Okay let's get you
started in the structure

18
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:01,000
notes you will find to start a project.

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,500
Wrap this project and open it in
Xcode I'll guide you from there.

20
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:08,540
We will cover Xcode in depth
in the next lesson, but

21
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:12,420
if you want an overview now, feel
free to go through our Xcode tutorial
