1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The first thing you have to do is figure out that this is actually a product.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
It's #5. Because you have multiple data points, the probabilities multiply.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Going to the logarithm, we replace it with a sum that is #6.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
And the logarithm of the expression in the exponent is just its argument

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
which means #3 is the solution here.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
You simply just copy those argument over.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
The first derivative loses all of these terms over here. They don't depend on µ.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
But it would change this one over here.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:40,000
The answer ends up being 4, Xi-µ/σ² and the reason is the way the derivative works.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
We take the derivative of this expression.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
There's a 2 over here that gets multipled left and a minus sign in front of the µ.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Those get multiplied in and then canceled out with -1/2.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Now from here to here, I just multiplied with σ²and now I bring the µ out

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
and import this and the resulting expression is Nµ.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The N comes in because we have N additions of µ in the formula over here.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 99:59:59,999
That completes the entire proof.
