00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:03,120
We all love images on the web.

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,700
Images can be beautiful,
fun, and informative.

3
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:09,990
Now the web started life as a,
a text only medium.

4
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:13,285
Check out these early versions
of well known websites.

5
00:00:13,285 --> 00:00:15,710
Thefacebook.com looks pretty cool, huh?

6
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:19,310
But the ability to embed
images was the innovation that

7
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:21,460
really made the web take off.

8
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:24,980
And now we have an incredible
wealth of images on the web.

9
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:28,700
Here's one of millions of pictures
from the Google Art Project.

10
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:31,550
You can probably get
closer to the picture here

11
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:33,050
than you can in the actual museum.

12
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:39,240
Now, given the huge and increasing
variety of devices and contexts for

13
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:44,370
consuming web content now, we need to
think again about how we use images.

14
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:49,070
I'm Sam Dutton,
a developer advocate at Google.

15
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:52,000
>> And I'm Cameron Pittman,
a course developer at Udacity.

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,130
>> And we'll be teaching you how
to use images responsively so

17
00:00:55,130 --> 00:01:00,010
they work really well across a variety
of devices, display sizes, and

18
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:01,790
connectivity scenarios.

19
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:04,690
>> Throughout this class you'll
be building a webpage design for

20
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:07,740
a blog site that uses
several kinds of images.

21
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:10,300
>> And by the end you'll be
confident that you can incorporate

22
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:12,820
images responsively in your own work.

23
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:13,600
>> Let's get started.

24
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,190
>> Yeah, let's do it.
