1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:05,714
This ellipse would be centered at 2, negative 1. Good thinking if you found

2
00:00:05,714 --> 00:00:10,216
this point. This would be the basic ellipse centered at the origin. So, first

3
00:00:10,216 --> 00:00:16,206
we want to subtract 2 from x. And remember, subtracting 2 moves the ellipse to

4
00:00:16,206 --> 00:00:21,970
the right 2 units. Now, we just want to add 1 to y. And when we add 1 to y, our

5
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:27,550
ellipse really shifts down one unit. So, again, here was our original ellipse,

6
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:32,064
centered at the origin. That would be this equation. And then, we shifted it

7
00:00:32,064 --> 00:00:36,160
two units to the right, since we subtracted 2, and then we shifted it one unit

8
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:42,260
down, since we added 1 to y. Remember that these numbers are the opposite in

9
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:46,958
the direction. So, you might think negative 2 would shift our ellipse two units

10
00:00:46,958 --> 00:00:52,424
to the left. But in fact it shifts our ellipse two units to right. Likewise

11
00:00:52,424 --> 00:00:56,393
with y, we might think our ellipse would move up one unit, but it turns out our

12
00:00:56,393 --> 00:01:01,510
ellipse moves down one unit. This is the same idea that we saw for circles, and

13
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:05,220
it goes against our intuition. You want to be careful about it.
