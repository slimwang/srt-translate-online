1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:05,060
In this architecture for a cognitive system, we have drawn these boxes as if

2
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:08,500
metacognition was completely separate from deliberation and

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:11,800
deliberation was completely separate from reaction. In fact,

4
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:15,450
there might be considerable overlap between metacognition and deliberation.

5
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:18,980
Some processes in deliberation might be viewed as metacognitive processes.

6
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:22,890
Some processes are metacognitive might be viewed as deliberative processes.

7
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:26,540
To see where the lines between metacognition and deliberation are blurry.

8
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:30,320
Let us return to this example from explanation based learning. When we talked

9
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,520
about explanation based learning, we did not talk about metacognition at all.

10
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:37,790
We can view the agent as saying, well, I do not know how to build a connection

11
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:41,000
between this part of the explanation and this part of the explanation.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,590
Therefore, I'll set up a reasoning goal which pulls at some other knowledge, and

13
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:48,180
so on. Now that we know the vocabulary of megacognition,

14
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:52,790
it is easy to view all of that in terms of this new vocabulary. So, instead of

15
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:57,190
thinking of deliberation and metacognition as two separate independent boxes,.

16
00:00:57,190 --> 00:01:01,790
A better way might be, to think in terms of boxes that partially overlap,

17
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:06,340
as a meta space and as a deliberation space. We should not be overly concerned,

18
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:09,630
whether something should go into the deliberation space into the metacognition

19
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:13,340
space. The more important thing is, what is the content of knowledge that we

20
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:16,510
need to carry out a process and what is the process that we need to carry out.
