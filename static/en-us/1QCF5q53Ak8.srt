1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:03,969
So, in order to learn about
supported vector machines,

2
00:00:03,969 --> 00:00:07,070
we have to talk about what
are called linear classifiers.

3
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:09,760
And linear classifiers
are exactly what you might think.

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,750
So here I have some data points.

5
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:14,750
I got blue ones and, and pink ones.

6
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:16,110
And the idea would be,

7
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:20,650
what if we just wanted to find a linear
separator that separated things.

8
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:22,900
Well, in this particular case,
we could do that, no problem.

9
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:24,365
So it would be something like that.

10
00:00:24,365 --> 00:00:26,291
Ta-da, there's our,
our linear classifier.

11
00:00:26,291 --> 00:00:30,783
And you know, what we'd like to do is to
talk about finding these kinds of things

12
00:00:30,783 --> 00:00:34,584
automatically, and then the whole
point of support vector machines,

13
00:00:34,584 --> 00:00:39,141
is to do these in well, what you'll see
are some higher dimensional spaces which

14
00:00:39,141 --> 00:00:41,928
will give us some very
effective classifications,

15
00:00:41,928 --> 00:00:44,330
some powerful classification machinery.

16
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:47,470
So, let's talk a little bit about lines.

17
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:50,570
So here's just lines in,
in regular 2D space.

18
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:54,746
So here's an equation of our line, and
this is the normalized equation, and

19
00:00:54,746 --> 00:00:58,332
we used to write ax plus by plus c
equals 0 when we did a bunch of things.

20
00:00:58,332 --> 00:01:02,210
And I'm not doing that here because in
SVM land, where it's derived, b has

21
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:06,470
a particular value, it talks about, it,
it, it's written in a particular way.

22
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:11,930
So I wrote it as px + qy + b equals 0.

23
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:15,789
And really, what I mean to say is that
we're going to let some w, here it's,

24
00:01:15,789 --> 00:01:19,430
be pq, and pretty soon those will go
away and we'll only talk about w.

25
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:21,460
Let w be pq, and

26
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:26,600
if we have some point, x, which
will be sort of little x, little y.

27
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:30,400
Then the line, px plus qy plus b,

28
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,650
that's the same thing as this
line w dot x plus b equals 0.

29
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:35,640
All right?

30
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:41,200
And w here, this vector here, that's
going to be in this direction there.

31
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:41,700
Okay?

32
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:44,810
One thing that should be
clear from this, right?

33
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:47,860
I could scale w and b and
it'll still be 0, right?

34
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:50,740
Multiply both of them by 3 and
I get the same value.

35
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:52,290
All right.

36
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:55,412
Now, if I have some point, x0, y0,

37
00:01:55,412 --> 00:02:01,040
I might want to talk about the distance
cap D of that point to the line.

38
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,320
Okay?
So here we have our,

39
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:06,770
our point and then there's this question
of what that distance D is, all right?

40
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:09,600
Well, given the equation of the line,

41
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:13,510
we can express that distance in
just the, the following way.

42
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:18,670
It's just essentially,
find the dot product of that on w,

43
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:21,570
subtract off or, or
think of that as being connected to b.

44
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:25,050
Whatever that value is,
that's how far off the line it is, and

45
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:30,190
you then have to normalize because from
a distance, by the magnitude of p and

46
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:34,350
q, so that's why it's divided by the
square root of p squared plus q squared.

47
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:36,390
And that can be just written like this.

48
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:40,530
Okay, so it's just w transposed,
x plus b,

49
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:45,230
the line equation up there,
divided by the magnitude of w.

50
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:46,690
Okay, so that's the distance D.
