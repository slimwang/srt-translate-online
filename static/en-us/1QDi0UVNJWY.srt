00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:04,660
The solution for this is that when we commit the ROB2 instruction we're going to

2
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:10,380
take the value of 8 and put it in R1. So the correct answer here is R1 and

3
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:16,560
the value is 8. And then we're going to check whether R1 mapping maps to ROB2.

4
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:21,010
It doesn't. It still points to ROB6. So we just freed this reservation station.
