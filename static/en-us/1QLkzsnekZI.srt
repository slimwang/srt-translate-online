00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,340
So let us look at the result of the kind of learning technique we

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:07,280
are discussing here. Here might be the old concept of a cup.

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:10,015
In this particular case, this particular concept definition has been put

4
00:00:10,015 --> 00:00:14,430
in the form of a production rule. Here is the new, concept definition for

5
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:17,790
a cup. This is almost identical to the previous definition,

6
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:21,540
except that now the object not only has a handle, but also the handle is fixed.

7
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:26,070
This is similar in many ways to incremental concept learning.

8
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:29,380
You may recall that in incremental concept learning that any particular stage of

9
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:33,830
processing there was a concept definition. As new examples came,

10
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:37,560
then the concept definition changed depending on the new example and

11
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:42,040
the current concept definition. Note that in this matter of concept revision,

12
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:46,060
the number of features in this if clause may become very, very large,

13
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:49,620
very quickly. Here we have object has a handle and handle is fixed.

14
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:52,840
We could keep on adding additional features, with the interior is blue,

15
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:57,090
that cover all the positive experiences. The difficulty is,

16
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:02,220
at the present time there is no understanding for why the fact that handle is

17
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:07,300
fixed is an important part of the cup definition. This requires an explanation.

18
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:11,140
Why is it that the handle being fixed is an important part of the definition of

19
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:15,890
a cup? This is one of the key differences between knowledge-based AI and

20
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:20,010
other schools of AI. Classification is ubiquitous in many schools of

21
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:24,645
AI as we have discussed earlier. Explanation however is a key characteristic of

22
00:01:24,645 --> 00:01:29,520
knowledge-based AI. Explanation leads to deeper learning. It not only says here

23
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,710
are the features that result in a concept definition, it also says and

24
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:36,509
here is why these features are important for a concept definition.

25
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,140
This brings us to the second question on learning from failures. Now we want

26
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:46,240
the agent to explain why a particular fault in its knowledge led to its failure.
