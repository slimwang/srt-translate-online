00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:04,218
Consciousness is truly an amazing phenomenon. Now think about it, you, as this

2
00:00:04,218 --> 00:00:08,695
collection of atoms, obeying the laws of physics, can be aware. You're aware of

3
00:00:08,695 --> 00:00:11,885
your mental activity, of your emotional state, even of your external

4
00:00:11,885 --> 00:00:13,425
environment.

5
00:00:13,425 --> 00:00:17,656
>> That's right. Have you ever been so involved in a task, such as writing a paper

6
00:00:17,656 --> 00:00:21,849
or playing a game, that you've lost track of time? Or perhaps you've been

7
00:00:21,849 --> 00:00:25,846
daydreaming at work when you should really be working. Or have you ever

8
00:00:25,846 --> 00:00:29,803
wondered what happens when people take mind altering drugs? These are all

9
00:00:29,803 --> 00:00:33,642
examples of questions related to the study of consciousness.

10
00:00:33,642 --> 00:00:36,666
>> Now as you're going to see, consciousness can be measured on a continuum, from

11
00:00:36,666 --> 00:00:38,148
fully conscious.

12
00:00:38,148 --> 00:00:40,822
>> For example when you're awake and aware of your surroundings.

13
00:00:40,822 --> 00:00:42,215
>> To not conscious at all.

14
00:00:42,215 --> 00:00:45,880
>> For example if you were in a coma and unaware of your surroundings. In fact

15
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:48,900
Grey has a personal example that he's going to share with us.
