00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,068
[BLANK_AUDIO]

2
00:00:03,068 --> 00:00:07,410
Something significant to
Miwoks would be acorns.

3
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:13,860
What I've learned is that going to
these annual celebrations the big time.

4
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:14,980
Acorns are life.

5
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:17,130
That's where food comes from.

6
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:21,070
And just the celebration around it.

7
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:22,610
It's a gathering of people.

8
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:24,780
It's grinding them, it's leaching them.

9
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:26,520
The baskets, the basket weaving.

10
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:28,360
There are baskets that are made for
leaching.

11
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:32,750
There are baskets made for
gathering, storing.

12
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:37,070
So to me I would say acorns
would be a big significant

13
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,280
item to the Miwok people.

14
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:44,762
So around the region where Miwok are,

15
00:00:44,762 --> 00:00:49,180
there are the black oak acorns.

16
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:55,775
And they just have a sweeter taste when
you leech out the tannins, soak them.

17
00:00:55,775 --> 00:01:01,050
They're, they have a sweeter taste than
I don't want to say a regular oak tree,

18
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:06,560
but a different type of tree that is
more bitter, it's a bitter taste.

19
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:11,670
You can make soups, bread,
one of the interviews

20
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:15,780
that I did with my grandmother,
and I had no idea about this.

21
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:19,010
We had a whole plot of land up in Iowa,
and

22
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:22,430
my great grandmother would go out into
the backyard, and she would dig a hole

23
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:27,026
and line it with cheesecloth, and
she would leach acorns in our backyard.

24
00:01:27,026 --> 00:01:31,510
She would make soups,
she would make bread.

25
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:33,700
I think she would even make
tortillas out of them.

26
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,170
And acorn mush.

27
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:40,033
But yeah,
that was something that I never knew and

28
00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:44,970
my grandma shared with you one day,
and it's like,

29
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:49,315
I would never have known that just
in the backyard where I grew up.

30
00:01:49,315 --> 00:01:51,380
[LAUGH] There were leaching of acorns.
