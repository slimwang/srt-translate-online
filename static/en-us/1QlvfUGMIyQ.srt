00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Let's talk about localization of a car like our DARPA Urban Challenge car Junior.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
This car uses a map of the environment--

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
it knows it advance where the lay markers are--

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
and uses probabilistic localization to keep track of where it is.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
The reason for that is it could use GPS, the global positioning system,

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
but that has enormous errors, sometimes in order of 5 or more meters,

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
which is very unsafe for driving.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
By localizing utilizing particle filters or histogram filters,

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
our car can do the same with about 10 cm error,

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
which means it can really understand where to stay in the lane

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
just by known where the lane is in advance and using localization techniques

12
00:00:44,000 --> 99:59:59,999
like the ones we'll discuss right now.
