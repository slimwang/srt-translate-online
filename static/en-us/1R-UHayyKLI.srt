00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,476
This problem is a little bit tricky, because you have to completely rethink the

2
00:00:02,476 --> 00:00:08,210
approach. Previously, we looked at a picture,and the one to the left. But when

3
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:11,750
we use an enhance photo, we only get to look at one picture at a time, so we

4
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:17,115
have to remember something from the past. The way I've done it is, I would

5
00:00:17,115 --> 00:00:22,829
remember the rightmost position of the previous picture. Let me show you. I

6
00:00:22,829 --> 00:00:26,310
have an enhanced for loop, and when I'm done positioning the picture, I

7
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:33,016
remember its rightmostX value. So when I reenter the loop with the next

8
00:00:33,016 --> 00:00:38,312
picture, then I can position it 10 further than the rightmostX value. And

9
00:00:38,312 --> 00:00:42,635
they're always spaced apart nicely. What about he first picture? If I start the

10
00:00:42,635 --> 00:00:48,028
rightmostX at 0, then the first picture ends up at offset 10. So that's the

11
00:00:48,028 --> 00:00:51,062
answer. And now when you look at these two loops, you can see that we can

12
00:00:51,062 --> 00:00:56,750
actually merge them. So we do the positioning and drawing in a single loop.

13
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:59,694
That's enough about pictures for right now. Sarah will show you another

14
00:00:59,694 --> 00:01:03,989
application of array lists. She'll revisit a class that you've seen in lesson

15
00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:08,112
three. The person class that collected friends, at that time we did it in

16
00:01:08,112 --> 00:01:13,343
lesson than perfect way by just having one long string of friend names. Now

17
00:01:13,343 --> 00:01:17,186
that you know how to collect objects, she'll collect the friends in an array

18
00:01:17,186 --> 00:01:20,039
list. Alright, over to you Sarah.
