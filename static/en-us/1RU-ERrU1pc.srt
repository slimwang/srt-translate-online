1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Actually Cal images have 2 dimensions--not just 1.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Here's an X and a Y,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
and the perspective laws apply to both dimensions.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
The projection of the X-coordinate into the camera plane

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
is governed by the perspective law over here.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
And the same is true for Y.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
In both cases, the appearance of an object, of size X and Y,

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
is scaled inversely with the distance of the object to the camera plane.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
One of the interesting consequences of perspective projection is

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:45,000
that parallel lines in the world seem to result in vanishing points over here

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
so that these lines are parallel in the physical world.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Because things shrink in inverse proportion to the distance, you'd find it far away.

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
The perceived distance is much smaller,

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
resulting all the way in a vanishing point that sits somewhere over here.

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
So sometimes there's more than 1 vanishing point.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
In this specific instance, there's a vanishing point over here,

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
and a vanishing point over here--and those correspond to parallel lines,

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
like the curb over here or the house facades

19
00:01:16,000 --> 99:59:59,999
that all shrink, with distance, in their visual appearance.
