1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:03,100
Okay, so we'll start with an example.

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:05,310
We are the apps store or Google Play.

3
00:00:05,309 --> 00:00:08,687
And our goal is to
recommend apps to users.

4
00:00:08,688 --> 00:00:10,089
So to each user,

5
00:00:10,089 --> 00:00:14,669
we're going to try to recommend them the
app they are most likely to download.

6
00:00:14,669 --> 00:00:17,890
So here we have a table of data that
we're going to use to make the rules.

7
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:19,980
And the table contains six people.

8
00:00:21,059 --> 00:00:25,689
And for each one of these six people,
we have recorded their gender, and

9
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:28,460
their age, and the app they downloaded.

10
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:34,027
So for example, the first person
is a 15 year old female, and

11
00:00:34,027 --> 00:00:35,979
she downloaded Pokemon Go.

12
00:00:37,149 --> 00:00:37,966
So here's a quiz.

13
00:00:37,966 --> 00:00:42,939
Between gender and age, which

14
00:00:42,939 --> 00:00:47,789
one seems more decisive for predicting
what app will the users download?

15
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:49,179
