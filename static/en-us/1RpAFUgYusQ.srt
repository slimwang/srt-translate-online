00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,749
Now that we know that m, n, p, q is a parallelogram, and that its opposite sides

2
00:00:04,761 --> 00:00:09,439
are parallel to one another, what do you think that the term parallel refers to?

3
00:00:09,542 --> 00:00:14,088
Are two things that are parallel of equal length? Do they have the same slope?

4
00:00:14,191 --> 00:00:18,482
Is the way that they relate change in y to change in x the same? Or do they

5
00:00:18,494 --> 00:00:20,166
intersect the same segments?
