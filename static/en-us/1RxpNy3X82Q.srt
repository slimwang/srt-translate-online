1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:04,969
And the answer is we have an unbounded
solution, if every leaf in the plan,

2
00:00:04,969 --> 00:00:06,169
ends up in a goal.

3
00:00:06,169 --> 00:00:09,500
So if we follow through the plan
no matter what path we execute

4
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,240
based on the observations.

5
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:15,589
And remember, we don't get to pick the
observations, the observations come into

6
00:00:15,589 --> 00:00:18,489
us and we follow one path or
another based on what we observe.

7
00:00:18,489 --> 00:00:21,909
So we can't guide it in one direction or
another, and so

8
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:24,609
we need every possible leaf node.

9
00:00:24,609 --> 00:00:25,879
This one only had one, but

10
00:00:25,879 --> 00:00:29,779
if a plan had multiple leaf nodes every
one of them would have to be a goal.

11
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:34,079
Now, in terms of a bounded solution,
it's okay to have branches but

12
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:35,369
not to have loops.

13
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:40,129
If we had branches, and we ended up
with one goal here, and one goal here

14
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:45,270
in one-two-three steps, one-two-three
steps, that would be a bounded solution.

15
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:49,630
But if we have a loop,
rate might be one, two, three,

16
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:53,260
four, five, you don't know how
many steps it's going to take.
