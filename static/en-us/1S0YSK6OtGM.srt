1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,410
But let's be more general. We can do this for any 2 points in the Cornet plane.

2
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:09,658
So if this point is x1 y1 and this point is x2 y2, lets see if we can create a

3
00:00:09,658 --> 00:00:15,525
formula for the distance between them. Before we get to write an equation, I

4
00:00:15,525 --> 00:00:20,435
want you to write an two expressions. What's an expression for this horizontal

5
00:00:20,435 --> 00:00:26,410
distance? Write that here. And what's an expression for the vertical distance?

6
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:27,980
Write that one here.
