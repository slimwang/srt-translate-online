00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,225
>> First you need to take the average of these, which is 19.4. Remember that the

2
00:00:05,225 --> 00:00:10,418
sample average is denoted by x bar. Let's round to two decimal places. Now we

3
00:00:10,418 --> 00:00:16,068
subtract the mean from each value in our data. Then we square this deviation and

4
00:00:16,068 --> 00:00:21,614
then add them up. This sum of squares is 54.22. After that, we divide by the

5
00:00:21,614 --> 00:00:27,303
sample size, which is 9, and then we take the square root. We get then that the

6
00:00:27,303 --> 00:00:33,262
standard deviation of this sample is 2.45. Whoa, that's a lot smaller than what

7
00:00:33,262 --> 00:00:37,855
we got for the population standard deviation, which is 5.99.
