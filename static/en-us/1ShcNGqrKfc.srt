00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,040
We've all got busy schedules.

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:05,440
And sometimes we need a little
help managing our daily tasks.

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,860
So we decided to make your next project,
a to do list.

4
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:12,070
You will use your new knowledge
about object oriented principles.

5
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:15,184
To create a command line to
do list called Udacitask.

6
00:00:15,184 --> 00:00:19,150
Using Udacitask you will be
able to create a to do list.

7
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:22,890
Add items, delete items,
and mark items as complete.

8
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:26,930
However, we also want to give you
a chance to personalize this project and

9
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:30,605
create three new features that improve
the functionality of Udacitask.
