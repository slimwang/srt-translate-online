1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:04,010
Sure, so just relying back on kind of

2
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:07,420
experiences I've had with web
development and also some other GUI

3
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:12,720
programs we could probably use a model
view controller type of architecture?

4
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:16,950
>> Sure, so model view controller is
a typical, it came out of originally,

5
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:22,950
the small talk world and is provided
as a set of classes in Java Swing for

6
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:24,890
example, very commonly used for GUI.

7
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:25,810
What else do you have?

8
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:29,590
>> Maybe something where we have,
I guess

9
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:32,549
what were using right now is kind of
like registering events and callback.

10
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:34,230
Does that?
>> Yeah sure.

11
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:39,140
>> So, I don't know, I think that
what we've described here and

12
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:42,870
then kind of in NBC are my first two,
the ones that I gravitate towards.

13
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:45,760
>> Okay, you can always find a way in

14
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,700
these situations thinking things
in terms of client server.

15
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:52,590
That is, we have the file
manager serving the file.

16
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:59,460
We have the GUI components serving
what the user is seeing and so on.

17
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:02,680
So client server's always a possibility.

18
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:05,720
Later on we'll talk about some
other architectural styles,

19
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:09,220
one that might be applied here
is shared memory where all of

20
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:12,630
the components are accessing
the data out of a single place.

21
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:18,420
Or another style, if you've ever been
involved with Microsoft Windows Com

22
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:22,340
architecture, component based
architecture, we can try that as well.

23
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:23,610
But for this exercise,

24
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:26,790
we're going to stick with this layered
implicit invocation architectural style.
