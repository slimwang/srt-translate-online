00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:02,090
Here's the clique.

2
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:03,630
Now I had a hard time
finding the clique,

3
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:05,650
the first time that I looked for it.

4
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:06,740
But once it was pointed out to me,

5
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:09,940
it was easy to confirm that
it was indeed a clique.

6
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:14,040
I just had to check that there was an
edge between every pair of it's members.

7
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:15,920
And this is precisely the point.

8
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:19,790
Some problems, like matching for
the dating service, are easy to solve.

9
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:23,470
Others, like this clique problem,
are hard to solve, but easy to check.
