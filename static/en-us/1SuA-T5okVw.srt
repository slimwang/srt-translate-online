00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:04,080
The first step in coding Gaussian
elimination will be to code the three

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,610
basic operations we've been using
in the elimination procedure.

3
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:12,230
Swapping two equations, multiplying
an equation by a non-zero number, and

4
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:15,140
adding a multiple of one
equation to another.

5
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:19,730
In the Linear System class, I've defined
three functions to correspond to these

6
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:22,730
operations, but have left them blank.

7
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:26,400
For this quiz, go ahead and
fill in those three functions,

8
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,470
either in the module I've provided or
in your own program.

9
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:32,049
Make sure to test your
code before moving on.

10
00:00:32,049 --> 00:00:34,830
You'll find some test cases in
the instructor notes to run your

11
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:35,880
code against.

12
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:40,130
They will be in Python and will use the
notation from the Linear System Module.

13
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:43,660
But please feel free to modify
the syntax as needed to run them

14
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:45,470
in your own code.

15
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:48,670
