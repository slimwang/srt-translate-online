1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,280
So here are the quantities
that make up a POMDP.

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:07,230
We have a set of quantities
that are actually just an MDP.

3
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:11,820
There's a set of actions and
states and transitions and rewards.

4
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:15,470
But the thing is that that
MDP that is inside the POMDP

5
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:17,720
isn't directly observable to the agent.

6
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:18,554
And instead,

7
00:00:18,554 --> 00:00:23,010
the agent has to make its decisions
based on the observations that it makes.

8
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:29,950
So this Z stands for surveysions
>> Or observables.

9
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:31,440
>> So it's a set, like S and A.

10
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:37,900
And then we need some kind of function
that connects the states and the actions

11
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:40,400
and the observables, or actually,
just the states and the observables, and

12
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:43,970
we're going to write that as O,
which is the observation function.

13
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:48,040
What O consists of is
a mapping from state and

14
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:51,370
observation to the probability of
actually seeing that observation,

15
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:54,600
given that the agent's
currently in that state S.

16
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,431
>> Okay, that makes sense.

17
00:00:55,431 --> 00:00:59,847
So there's a true MDP, and
what makes the MDP really,

18
00:00:59,847 --> 00:01:03,695
I don't know, an MDP or,
is really the state.

19
00:01:03,695 --> 00:01:07,627
The key thing has always been what state
are we in right now, and what you're

20
00:01:07,627 --> 00:01:11,579
saying is that with a POMDP, you never
actually know what state you're in.

21
00:01:11,579 --> 00:01:15,034
And so you get these observables or
these observations, and

22
00:01:15,034 --> 00:01:19,046
that's what you see that gives you
a hint about what state you're in.

23
00:01:19,046 --> 00:01:21,056
But doesn't necessarily
tell you everything, so

24
00:01:21,056 --> 00:01:23,300
what's a concrete example
of that in the real world?

25
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:24,550
>> Well, in the real world, I mean,

26
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:26,790
in the real world,
the real world is like this, right?

27
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:30,330
So when I'm talking to you and

28
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:34,390
some aspects of the state of the world
in Atlanta are actually relevant and

29
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:37,040
important to me, like whether or
not you have ice cream.

30
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,340
But I can't directly observe that.

31
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:41,519
I have to infer the presence of ice
cream indirectly from whether or

32
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:42,785
not you're taunting me.

33
00:01:42,785 --> 00:01:43,865
>> [LAUGH] But I'm always taunting you.

34
00:01:43,865 --> 00:01:45,020
But I think I get your point.

35
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:46,408
Okay, that's fair, that makes sense.

36
00:01:46,408 --> 00:01:48,520
>> Yeah, I mean,
you could taunt me about ice cream, and

37
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,935
that's not a perfect indicator
that you actually have ice cream.

38
00:01:50,935 --> 00:01:53,150
>> That's true, sometimes I just
taunt you for the fun of it.

39
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:55,740
>> Exactly, so what I need is some
kind of observation function.

40
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,970
I need to be able to predict, given
whether or not you have ice cream, so

41
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:01,810
that's given you have ice cream,
what's the probability you taunt me?

42
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:03,490
It's very close to 1.

43
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:05,840
And given that you don't have ice cream,

44
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,495
what's the probability that you taunt
me, and that's much lower, but not 0.

45
00:02:09,495 --> 00:02:11,877
>> But still close to 1.

46
00:02:11,877 --> 00:02:13,510
[LAUGH]
>> Well,

47
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:16,320
you won't taunt me about ice cream
when you don't have ice cream so much.

48
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:19,040
>> That's true, also, when I have
ice cream, you can hear me smacking.

49
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:20,735
>> Smacking?

50
00:02:20,735 --> 00:02:23,380
>> [SOUND]
>> And making mouth sounds.

51
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:27,070
Well, again,
that's a [LAUGH] kind of observation.

52
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:31,720
So smacking is a kind of observation
that, again, is indicative of, but

53
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:36,748
not a perfect indicator of, whether or
not you've got ice cream in your mouth.

54
00:02:36,748 --> 00:02:37,742
>> Okay, fair enough, fair enough.

55
00:02:37,742 --> 00:02:39,000
All right, so I think I get that, okay.

56
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,340
So, POMDP basically has an MDP inside
of it, and you can't see all of it.

57
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:48,143
And in particular,
the part you can't see is S and maybe T.

58
00:02:48,143 --> 00:02:50,010
>> The T relates S and A, right?

59
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:53,540
The T says how given that you're in
a state and you take some action,

60
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:54,930
what state you go to next.

61
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:56,970
But of course, you don't really
know what state you were in.

62
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:58,650
And you may not know what
state you ended up in.

63
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:00,380
Because, again, you, as the agent,

64
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,890
have to make decisions
based on what you can see.

65
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:03,650
>> Okay, fair enough.

66
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:04,200
>> Great.

67
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,400
Now would be a good time for
a transition to the next slide,

68
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,380
if we knew what it was.

69
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:09,359
>> Well,
do we even know what slide we're in?

70
00:03:09,359 --> 00:03:13,089
>> [LAUGH]
>> [LAUGH]
