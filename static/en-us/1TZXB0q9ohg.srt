00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,176
So you've seen functions written in the form f of x or g of u, or any other

2
00:00:04,176 --> 00:00:08,674
number of things like this, h of y, so on and so forth. You can pick any letter

3
00:00:08,674 --> 00:00:12,943
you want for the function name, and pretty much any letter you want for the

4
00:00:12,943 --> 00:00:17,398
independent variable name too, as long as you're consistent. So taking all of

5
00:00:17,398 --> 00:00:22,924
that into account, what do you think this means? F of u comma v. Does this

6
00:00:22,924 --> 00:00:28,212
represent two separate functions? Two outputs for one input? A function with two

7
00:00:28,212 --> 00:00:32,573
independent variables? Or a function with two dependent variables?
