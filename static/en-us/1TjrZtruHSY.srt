1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,930
So, let's look at the app that
we will build in this lesson.

2
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:04,360
It will have three activities.

3
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:07,610
The main launcher activity you see here,
which has two buttons,

4
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:10,810
the banner ad and
the interstitial ad buttons.

5
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:13,380
Each of these buttons will bring
you to a separate activity,

6
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:16,590
showing a banner ad and
an interstitial ad.

7
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:18,570
So when I press on the banner ad button,

8
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:21,590
you will see a banner ad
being displayed onscreen.

9
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:25,430
And we have this entire area above
to display your app contents.

10
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:26,470
I can also click on the ad.

11
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:31,460
And you see that we navigate off our app
to see more information about the ad.

12
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:34,489
And we can also go back and
continue to interact with our app.

13
00:00:34,489 --> 00:00:36,282
And when we are clicking around here,

14
00:00:36,282 --> 00:00:38,587
you can see toast messages
appear on the screen.

15
00:00:38,587 --> 00:00:41,816
These are messages that
our app will generate so

16
00:00:41,816 --> 00:00:45,044
you can see how the app
interacts with the add and

17
00:00:45,044 --> 00:00:50,310
also note that the banner acts as text
banner because this is a test ad.

18
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:53,570
And what I will tell you now is
very important, so pay attention.

19
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:58,450
When we are developing our app, we will
use test ads because advertisers do

20
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:03,190
not and should not have to pay for
real ads while you are developing.

21
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:06,860
Using real ads during development is
a violation against the terms and

22
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:09,980
conditions and it can result
in your accounts being banned.

23
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:13,780
So this is really, really important.

24
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:15,790
Now, let's go back and
look at the other parts of the app.

25
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,510
We can also click on
the interstitial app button.

26
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:23,600
And that brings us to another
activity with two buttons here.

27
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,860
So we talked about, interstitial
ads use the entire screen when they

28
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:30,320
are displayed and
they also support video content.

29
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,400
Therefore, we first load
the interstitial ads and

30
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,380
after they've been loaded,
we can display them.

31
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:39,410
So this button here will
load an interstitial ad.

32
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:42,490
You can see that it's loaded and
now we have the option to show the ad.

33
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:46,920
So we press on this show button and
here, you can see the ad come up.

34
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:51,640
And again, when developing our app,
we use test ads.

35
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:56,700
And that's what you see here,
a test interstitial ad.

36
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,620
And as with banner ads, we can click
on the ad which will bring us to

37
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,160
the content and then we can go back.

38
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,110
All right, so
that's the app we're going to build.

39
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:07,230
So let's get right to it and
do some coding.

40
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:12,020
So let's get you started building
an app that can show ads.

41
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:14,950
Some of these steps we assume you
are familiar with since you should

42
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:17,280
have taken the location
lesson before this one.

43
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,640
So in Android Studio, I want you to do
the following things, create a project

44
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:27,170
with a blank activity, add the metadata
com.google.android.gms.version

45
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:31,260
to the manifest, add the dependencies
to your build.gradle file.

46
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:34,868
And also add the following
permissions to the manifest,

47
00:02:34,868 --> 00:02:37,275
android.permission.INTERNET and

48
00:02:37,275 --> 00:02:40,830
android.permission.access_network_st-
ate".

49
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:43,340
The Internet permission is required
since we're going to fetch

50
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:44,800
ads from the Internet.

51
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,400
And the access network state allows
Admob to check if an Internet connection

52
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,890
is available before trying to fetch
the ad and check here when you're done.
