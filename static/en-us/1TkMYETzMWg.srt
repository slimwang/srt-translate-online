00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:06,450
Once again lets look at our two graphs. This one shows y equals log base 10 of

2
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:11,620
x. And this one shows y equals log base 2 of x. Which we just saw is about

3
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:16,930
equal to 3.3 times log base 10 of x. The only difference between these

4
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:22,520
functions now is just the coefficient out in front of log base 10 of x here. So

5
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:27,620
what does multiplying a function by a positive constant do to its graph? Does

6
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:32,210
it stretch or shrink it in the y-direction? Does it move it in some direction,

7
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:36,515
either horizontally or vertically? Does it reflect the graph in the x or y

8
00:00:36,515 --> 00:00:40,464
axis? Or does it find the graph's inverse?
