1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Close to the surface of the earth, every object

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
experiences an acceleration of 9.81 m/sÂ².

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
This is independent of that mass of the object because

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
assume that you have two objects of the same mass.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Each one is accelerated at the same rate.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
So they stay on the same height as they fall,

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
which means you can combine these two objects, add a little glue.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
and this larger object is going to fall,

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
but the same acceleration.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
But now it has twice the mass.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Based on this, you should be

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
able to answer the following question.

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
What's the gravitational force of a mass on 1 kg --

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
0.1 N, 1 N, 10 N or even 100 N?
