00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,890
In looking through
the UI View Controller record category,

2
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:08,090
you may have noticed a method
called convert video to GIF.

3
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:10,500
This is where the magic happens.

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:11,400
Let's see here.

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,950
It's using a class called regift.

6
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:15,210
What's that?

7
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:18,710
Regift was written as
a Cocoapod by Matthew Palmer.

8
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:20,360
And it does exactly what we need.

9
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:23,130
It converts a video into a GIF.

10
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:26,190
If you look into the GIF
maker objective C folder,

11
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:29,020
you'll see a folder
called third party code.

12
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:33,180
If you open up that folder,
you'll see another folder called Regift,

13
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:36,370
that's where we've included
the files directly in the project.

14
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:40,050
We've also added these files
to the swift project template.

15
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:43,290
Here's Matthew Palmer's read me for
regift on GitHub.

16
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:46,980
And in the Quick Start guidelines, we
can see that to initialize an instance

17
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:51,090
of the regift class,
we need to pass in four parameters.

18
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:56,430
The video URL, the frame count,
delay time, and loop count.

19
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:00,520
Go back into your swift project and
add frame count, delay time, and

20
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:05,150
loop count at the top of the UI View
Controller extension file as constants.

21
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:07,220
We'll start with these defaults for
now but

22
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:10,650
you can experiment with different
values to suit your liking.

23
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:13,640
Next we'll add a method
called convertVideoToGIF

24
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,800
which uses the regift class.

25
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:19,370
In this method will create
an instance of the class regift.

26
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:20,000
In the read me,

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,380
we can see that this line of code
initializes an instance of regift.

28
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:28,910
The method that creates the GIF
is named appropriately createGIF

29
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:31,660
if we open up the regift.swiftFile.

30
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:36,990
We can see they create gift returns
in NSURL to the newly created GIF.

31
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:42,610
So go ahead and create a variable called
GIFURL to store the return value and

32
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:45,570
now that in theory we
have a URL to a GIF.

33
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:47,960
Let's test it out by displaying
it in the GIF editor.
