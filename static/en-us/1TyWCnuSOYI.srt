00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:04,430
The Android plugin can reduce
the size of your app by stripping out

2
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:06,530
unused code and resources.

3
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:09,357
It does this with the help
of a tool called Proguard.

4
00:00:09,357 --> 00:00:13,080
Proguard can do a lot of interesting
stuff including obfuscating your code by

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,840
giving all your classes and
methods meaningless names.

6
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,622
Though that's mostly of interest if
you're really worried about your code

7
00:00:18,622 --> 00:00:20,450
being reverse engineered.

8
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,450
For our purposes, the properties we
want to configure on our build type

9
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:27,310
are minifyEnabled and shrinkResources.

10
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:28,540
In this project,

11
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:32,100
we have declared a dependency on
Google's mobile services library.

12
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:34,830
But we're not actually using
anything from that library.

13
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:37,130
Proguard is smart enough
to figure that out and

14
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:39,160
will strip out the unused
code from our APK.

15
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:43,800
The mobile services library also
includes many resources like drawables

16
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,290
for sign in buttons.

17
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:48,701
Turning on shrinkResources will
strip out any unused resources.

18
00:00:48,701 --> 00:00:51,260
We've configured two new build types.

19
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:54,360
One of which has turned on magnification
and resource shrinking and

20
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,930
one of which has not.

21
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:59,960
Let's check out the relative sizes of
the APK's generated by each filed type.

22
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:03,560
Let's run the assemble task
to generate both APKs.

23
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:07,760
If we then go find out APKs in App,
build, outputs, APK.

24
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:12,920
We see that our big APK is 2.9
megabytes, whereas our shrunk APK,

25
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:17,480
that was using minification and resource
shrinking, is only 1.2 megabytes.

26
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:20,910
There's a lot more you can do to
optimize your APK using Proguard.

27
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:23,580
We've included some resources in the
course code, where you can learn more.
