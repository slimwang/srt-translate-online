00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,044
Listing out the prime factorizations, we can see that our greatest common factor

2
00:00:05,044 --> 00:00:09,801
is 8ab squared. So this is what I list on the outside of a parenthesis to start

3
00:00:09,801 --> 00:00:14,341
the factor. We're left with 5ab for the first term. If I factor 8 times ab

4
00:00:14,341 --> 00:00:18,818
squared out of the first term, I'm left with 5 times ab. That goes here.

5
00:00:18,818 --> 00:00:23,632
Negative 2b squared would be remaining from the second term. And negative 3

6
00:00:23,632 --> 00:00:28,039
would be remaining for this last term. Essentially, we're just dividing this

7
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:32,442
term by 8ab squared. We know ab squared divided by ab squared would equal one,

8
00:00:32,442 --> 00:00:36,674
so we're just left with negative 24 divided by 8, which is negative 3. As

9
00:00:36,674 --> 00:00:41,076
always, you can check your result by multiplying or distributing this 8ab

10
00:00:41,076 --> 00:00:47,075
squared to each of the terms. You should wind up with your original expression.
