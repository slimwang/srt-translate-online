00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:02,930
This lesson is about
portfolio optimization.

2
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:05,400
What is portfolio optimization?

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,960
Portfolio optimization is
an algorithmic approach to determining

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,980
allocations to assets in a portfolio.

5
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:16,845
So with portfolio optimization,
we're given a set of equities and

6
00:00:16,845 --> 00:00:18,855
a target return.

7
00:00:18,855 --> 00:00:24,368
We want to find a percentage
allocation to each of our assets.

00:00:24,368 --> 00:00:26,209
