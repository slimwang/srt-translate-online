1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
And the answer is infinitely many.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:10,000
If you thought it's 3, then yes--cubes might have 3 vanishing points,

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
like this one over here, which is a cube under perspective projection.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
It actually has 3 vanishing points:

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
No. 1, No. 2, and No. 3 over here.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
But that's because the cube has 3 faces.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
You've had different faces whose Z-distance to the camera varied.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
And those enclosing lines that might be parallel in the physical space

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
would result in their own vanishing point.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So you can theoretically make an object with infinitely many vanishing points.
