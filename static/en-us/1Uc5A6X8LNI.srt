1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:01,755
In addition to RSA and

2
00:00:01,755 --> 00:00:05,780
Diffie-Hellman which are the most
widely used algorithms.

3
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:08,280
There are other public key algorithms.

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:11,550
First, the National Institute
of Standards and

5
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:16,610
Technology on list, has published
the digital signature standard

6
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:20,160
It is based on the secure
hash function SHA1.

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,400
Note that this algorithm is only for
signature.

8
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,950
Is not for encryption or key exchange.

9
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:29,990
RSA is the most widely used public
key cartography algorithm for

10
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:32,810
encryption and digital signatures.

11
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:37,420
Recently a competing system called
elliptic curve cryptography

12
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:39,450
has begun to challenge RSA.

13
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:42,640
The main advantage of ECC over RSA

14
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:47,540
is that if offers the same security
with a far smaller bit size.

15
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:52,920
That is, for the same security strength,
it can be much more efficient than RSA.

16
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,020
On the other hand,

17
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:59,350
RSA has been subject to a lot of
cryptanalysis work over the years.

18
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:03,860
whereas for ECC, the cryptanalysis
work is still at a beginning,

19
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:09,780
therefore we are not as confident
in the ECC as we are in RSA.

20
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:12,230
ECC is more difficult explained

21
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:16,500
in the form that medical description
is beyond the scope of this course.

22
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:21,090
But briefly, the technique is based on
the use of a mathematical construct

23
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:23,360
known as the elliptic curve.

24
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,940
Roughly speaking, two points, p and

25
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:30,360
t on the elliptic curve are known or
made public.

26
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:35,640
And p and t have the following
relations, t times p equal t,

27
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:41,440
under the so called point multiplication
and the fact that d is the private key.

28
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,140
Mathematically, even p and

29
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:47,910
t, which are public, it is very
hard to find t, which is private.
