Second problem area is sometimes called object schizophrenia. And this is,

2
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:08,225
an example of this was the visitor pattern, where we split off

3
00:00:08,225 --> 00:00:13,140
the functionality having to do with the elements into a separate place where all

4
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:17,550
the operations were contained. In a sense, this beaks delegation.

5
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:20,890
It has also been called the self problem. When you delegate responsibility to

6
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:25,430
perform part of a computation to methods in your attributes, as opposed to

7
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:28,640
handling them yourself. This can lead to additional complexity, particularly

8
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,230
when you're trying to debug and find out where something went wrong.
