You've made it to the end of this
course on implementing OAuth 2 for

00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:04,471
web applications.

00:00:04,471 --> 00:00:07,600
Hopefully this class has provided you
with the tools and resources necessary

00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:11,020
for going out and implementing
logins on your own web applications.

00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:13,870
However we have only discussed
the tip of the ice burg.

00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:17,090
If you're interested in learning more
about OAuth or web security in general.

00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:27,335

always make sure you play it safe.
