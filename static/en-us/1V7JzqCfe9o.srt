1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,290
So we have to find the mean and standard deviation of the sampling

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:07,188
distribution. Sorry I'm making you calculate this again even though you did it

3
00:00:07,188 --> 00:00:11,131
in the previous lesson. I just want to make sure that you continue to get

4
00:00:11,131 --> 00:00:16,129
enough practice doing this. So for the sampling distribution, where we take all

5
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:22,500
samples of size 20, because in this case our sample consisted of 20 students.

6
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,410
We have that the mean is the same as the population mean, and the standard

7
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:28,994
error, which is the standard deviation of the sampling distribution, is the

8
00:00:28,994 --> 00:00:34,920
population standard deviation, divided by the square root of the sample size.

9
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:43,259
So this is about 0.14. So then this means that this sample mean has a z score

10
00:00:43,259 --> 00:00:52,590
equal to 7.13 minus the mean 7.5 divided by 0.14. If you put the more exact

11
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:56,418
values into your calculator, then you'll get a more precise z score rather than

12
00:00:56,418 --> 00:01:04,830
using the rounded standard error. So we get about negative 2.59. If we look at

13
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:10,437
the distribution of sample means and here is 7.5 the population mean and the

14
00:01:10,437 --> 00:01:18,883
mean of sample means negative 2.59 is way over here, so what does this mean.
