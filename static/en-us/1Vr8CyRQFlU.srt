00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:04,480
Welcome back. I hope that exercise went great.

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,023
Now, let's talk about another important Datastore concept,

3
00:00:08,023 --> 00:00:11,188
keys. When you store an entity in the

4
00:00:11,188 --> 00:00:14,100
Datastore, the Datastore will assign a key to

5
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:18,030
it. This key uniquely identifies the entity and

6
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:20,380
it's used for many different purposes. They are

7
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:25,775
two ways a key can be generated. Let's take a look. The first one is when

8
00:00:25,775 --> 00:00:29,480
Datastore automatically generates this key. Let's say we

9
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:32,970
define the profile kind with these properties. And inserted

10
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:35,660
it for the first time. In this case, the

11
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:39,080
Datastore will automatically assign a key value to it.

12
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:44,970
The other way is that you specify what is called a key name or ID. In this case,

13
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:48,440
Datastore will use that value to generate the key.

14
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:50,870
This is a good alternative when you have something

15
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:53,900
that is unique for each entity. Because it can clearly

16
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:56,560
take us to our front entity based on this value

17
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:00,235
so it's easier to find. But observe that statement. The

18
00:01:00,235 --> 00:01:04,610
Keyname/ID must be unique for all entities of that kind. For

19
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:07,450
our profile kind that is exactly the case because we

20
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:09,980
have decided to use the user ID to to uniquely

21
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:13,820
identify each profile identity. The value of having user ID

22
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:16,360
as the key name is that we can retrieve the profile

23
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:20,310
entity directly using this value. And remember, since the

24
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:23,500
user object is the first parameter to cloud endpoints API

25
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,950
methods. It will become a convenient way to get

26
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:29,720
the profile, but we'll look more into this later. If

27
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,770
you are familiar with relational database modeling, you probably

28
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:35,100
see that this is very similar to the concept of

29
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:39,110
a primary key. There, as well as with Datastore,

30
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:41,490
you have the option of letting the database generate the

31
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:44,460
primary key or use the value of your choice.

32
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,620
But now, it's for you to do some work
