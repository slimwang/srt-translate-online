1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:04,599
In this case, there's nothing to add,
because of the two neighbors,

2
00:00:04,599 --> 00:00:08,240
one is in the explored list,
and one's in the frontier.

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,980
And if we're using graph search,
then we won't add either of those.
