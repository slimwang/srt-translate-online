1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,940
Okay, so what'd you think? Was that enough information

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:04,330
to kind of chew on it a little bit?

3
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:08,690
>> Maybe. [LAUGH] So, let's see, I have, I guess,

4
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:12,500
k hypotheses I have to chose from. I know that basically

5
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:15,090
you always return the output of one. I don't get

6
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:19,890
to chose what those examples are, they're drawn from some distribution.

7
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:20,310
>> Right.

8
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:25,670
>> And I want to know whether I'm going to need to see, another of examples

9
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:28,360
that are, polynomial, in the error that I'm

10
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:31,380
interested in, with the certainty that I'm interested in.

11
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:33,240
And I gotta be able to come up with

12
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,670
an algorithim, a learning algorithm that will do that.

13
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:37,560
>> Exactly. So what do you think?

14
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,530
>> I want to say the answer is yes.

15
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:41,860
>> So how would you argue that though?

16
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:43,830
Do you have a particular algarythm in mind?

17
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:46,900
>> Well I actually did, I was going to keep the

18
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:50,190
all the hypothesis that are consistent with the data that I've seen.

19
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:51,270
>> Okay, alright

20
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:52,136
and what is that called?

21
00:00:52,136 --> 00:00:54,689
>> The version space.

22
00:00:54,689 --> 00:00:55,600
>> Right. Okay.

23
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,220
>> So keep track of that and then, whenever I stop getting samples, I have

24
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:04,280
to pick one of those. So I'm just going to, pick one of them uniformly.

25
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,450
>> Okay. Well that seems good so far. You

26
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:09,740
could pick one uniformly. So what makes you think that

27
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:13,380
that's actually going to. Be able to return the

28
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:16,500
right answer, or a, a close enough answer with not

29
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:20,110
that much data. How do we actually bound the number of samples that we need

30
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:24,810
to make it so that when we pick uniformly we actually get a good answer?

31
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:27,570
>> Well, it's a little hard, I mean my, my intuition is that, given

32
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:32,100
what we don't know what the concept is only the class that it comes from

33
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:37,250
If I do anything other than choose uniformly, then I can be very unlucky.

34
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:39,270
I basically... uniformly basically means in this

35
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:42,220
case I don't know anything else to do.

36
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:45,110
So there's sort of no better algorithm than the one that

37
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:46,850
we just came up with, which is find all the

38
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:49,690
hypotheses that are consistent... And you have no reason to

39
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:52,540
choose one over the other because you don't have anymore data.

40
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:54,960
So you should just close your eyes and pick one.

41
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,680
And if you do anything else, then in the absence of

42
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01,980
some specific domain knowledge that tells you to do otherwise,

43
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:04,280
you know, you can just basically end up being very unlucky.

44
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:07,290
>> So, I, I agree with you and this is a good algorithm. But what we

45
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:09,788
lack at the moment is an argument as to why the number of

46
00:02:09,788 --> 00:02:12,170
samples that it needs, isn't exponential.

47
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:14,460
Right? Cause there's an exponentially. Large, you

48
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:17,710
know, 2 to the K different possible inputs. If we had to see

49
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:20,170
all of them to be able to guess right, that would be too many.

50
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:20,310
>> Mm hm.

51
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:24,000
>> So, we really want it to be, you know,

52
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,884
a polynomial in, in K. Not an exponential in K. So

53
00:02:26,884 --> 00:02:29,640
I'm going to say that we don't have enough background

54
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,320
yet to be able to answer this definitively. The, yes is

55
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,640
the right answer. But we're going to need to dive in a little bit more

56
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,820
deeply, and develop some more concepts to be

57
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:38,600
able to argue why that's the right answer.
