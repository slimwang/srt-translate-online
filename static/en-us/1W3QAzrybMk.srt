00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:03,090
To avoid looking at all this long tail data, we

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:06,570
can use the x limb parameter inside a q plot. This

3
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:09,350
parameter takes a vector where we have the start position

4
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:12,280
and the ending position of our axes. In our case, we

5
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:15,930
want to examine friend counts less than 1000. Running the

6
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:18,590
code, I can see that I have my plot with friend

7
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:22,420
counts less than 1000. Now there is another way to create

8
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:26,290
the same plot. Here I won't use the x limb parameter.

9
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:29,190
Instead I'm going to add a layer. I use limits

10
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:32,390
instead of x limb as the parameter inside of here since

11
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:35,400
I know this adjustment is already for the x axis. That's

12
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:39,270
why its called scale x continuous. There's also a counterpart for

13
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:43,010
the y axis called scale y continuous. One of the neat

14
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:45,190
concepts of ggplot is that you can build up your

15
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:48,260
plot in layers. We're going to discuss layers later in this lesson,

16
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:51,490
but for now I'm going to keep using the q plot syntax.

17
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:53,820
So far we've learned how to create histograms, how to

18
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,870
facet them, and how to adjust our axes. But up

19
00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:59,240
until now all of our histograms have had a default

20
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:02,030
setting. We've been getting this error message for a while

21
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:05,330
about the bandwidth defaulting to a range over 30. It

22
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:08,210
turns out we can set the bandwidth ourselves to reveal

23
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:10,760
interesting trends in the data. Let's hear what happened during

24
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:13,760
Moira's investigation when she altered the bandwidth of her histogram.
