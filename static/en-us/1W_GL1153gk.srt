1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:05,446
So far it's really pretty much been
the tracking like we saw before.

2
00:00:05,446 --> 00:00:08,890
But now the part of filter tracking,
we've got a model tracking it.

3
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:10,960
But the thing that we're going to do
now that's a little bit different,

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,540
this is sort of the cool part is.

5
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:16,490
We're not going to assume
that our appearance and

6
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:19,270
observation model remain constant.

7
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:23,880
Basically the idea is we're going to,
sort of, update our,

8
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:28,150
the model as we get
new images coming in.

9
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:30,820
Now a sort of a standard way of
doing this, and, by the way,

10
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:33,410
this works really poorly so
don't do it is.

11
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:37,260
I have a model, appearance, I look
around, I say that's my best one, and

12
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,110
I say, okay,
I guess it's changed a little bit,

13
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:42,150
let me pull out that model and
I'll find that in the next image.

14
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:44,320
And, eventually,
what happens is you get drift.

15
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,750
And the model lands on that.

16
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:48,130
There's this really, really cool thing.

17
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:49,410
Oh, you can't see.

18
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:51,060
Okay.
I'm going to pretend like there's this

19
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:53,810
really great car.

20
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:56,610
Sitting right over here and
you know, eventually and

21
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:58,080
it just gets stuck on there.

22
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:00,660
And the thing that I was tracking
would go, it would go away.

23
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:05,970
But if I don't update my
model then as things change,

24
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:07,770
I can't find it so well anymore.

25
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:11,950
So what we do here instead is
with every new appearance,

26
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:14,090
we're going to change our eigenbasis.

27
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:14,760
Right?
This is a,

28
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:18,405
this is the set of eigen vectors
that lets our It says reconstruct.

29
00:01:18,405 --> 00:01:20,445
We're going to change that a little bit.

30
00:01:20,445 --> 00:01:23,505
And that allows for
a small variation in appearance, but

31
00:01:23,505 --> 00:01:27,435
it still going to try to do things
like track the general class.

32
00:01:27,435 --> 00:01:29,385
And so
the trick is just as it is written here.

33
00:01:29,385 --> 00:01:32,745
Given the basis set, B of t minus one,

34
00:01:32,745 --> 00:01:39,520
that we use to find the loc,
the observation at time t minus one.

35
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:44,060
We, that allows us to compute
a new eigenbasis, B of t,

36
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:48,760
that we're going to use now
to evaluate our measurements.

37
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,550
All right?
So the idea is we're updating

38
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:55,550
this eigenbasis, but it's adding sort
of it's a small variation each time, so

39
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:57,840
we can't radically change
what things look like.

40
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,700
We can change them a little bit.

41
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:03,010
And this referred to as
an incremental subspace update.

42
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:06,240
As you remember from PCA we said
the whole reason that we're doing this

43
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,680
dimensionality reduction is
the idea that we believe our images

44
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,660
lie in some subspace.

45
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:14,570
But we have to find that subspace
within the bigger feature space.

46
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:18,710
So that's why this is referred to
as an Incremental Subspace Update.

47
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:19,950
And why are we doing this?

48
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:22,930
Basically, we are accounting for
appearance change.

49
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:25,670
So we might be tracking the,
the object in the image.

50
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:28,550
It's translating, it's rotating,
it's maybe shearing, but

51
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:32,600
if I rotate out of the plane,
as far as the camera is concerned,

52
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,410
my face is changing its appearance.

53
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:38,450
As I go sideways,
it usually goes worse, but that's okay.

54
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:40,580
The idea is that I want to
model that change.

55
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:43,950
So we're learning a new
appearance representation as,

56
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:45,700
as the image area changes.

57
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,110
In the papers that I've
been telling you about,

58
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:50,390
they base it upon, on this recursive
SVD algorithm, which is kind of nice.

59
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:54,350
So you don't have to do the whole
eigendecomposition, decomposition again.

60
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:56,450
So you can do this quickly in real time.

61
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:58,070
That part doesn't matter so much.

62
00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:02,260
Essentially what you have is
an algorithm, that allows you,

63
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:05,040
it's kind of like a running
mean algorithm, where you're

64
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,740
using the most recent examples more
strongly than the older examples.
