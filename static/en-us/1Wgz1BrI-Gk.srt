1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,782
We'd say the view of the bird is pretty distorted. Really the problem is that

2
00:00:03,782 --> 00:00:06,789
you're not sitting close enough to the screen. It's sort of like being

3
00:00:06,789 --> 00:00:10,690
overweight. I could instead say I'm not dense enough. If I was denser, then I'd

4
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:14,798
look thinner. Think of what the field of view represents. When you look at your

5
00:00:14,798 --> 00:00:18,849
monitor or tablet or mobile device, you're a given distance away from it. The

6
00:00:18,849 --> 00:00:23,600
screen itself is a certain height. This forms a real world field of view angle.

7
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,615
A window on your screen is your window into a virtual world. Say this window in

8
00:00:27,615 --> 00:00:31,680
the real world has a 20 degree field of view for your real world eye position.

9
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:34,893
If your virtual world also has the same field of view, you won't perceive any

10
00:00:34,893 --> 00:00:38,868
distortion. Objects toward the edge of the screen might look distorted if you

11
00:00:38,868 --> 00:00:42,666
were to back away from the screen. But at your current eye position, the field

12
00:00:42,666 --> 00:00:46,714
of view is perfect. The image is warped a bit in projection. But your eye is

13
00:00:46,714 --> 00:00:50,774
seeing the screen at a tilt that compensates for it. The formula for height for

14
00:00:50,774 --> 00:00:53,946
a given field of view and distance from the screen is height equals 2 times

15
00:00:53,946 --> 00:00:57,222
tangent of the field of view divided by 2, don't forget to use radians, times

16
00:00:57,222 --> 00:01:02,240
the distance. As the field of view increases, the tangent value increases, and

17
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:06,505
so the height of the monitor increases. Increases. What tends to happen in

18
00:01:06,505 --> 00:01:09,430
video games is that the designer cranks up the virtual world's field of view so

19
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:13,561
that the players can see more of what's happening around them. This can

20
00:01:13,561 --> 00:01:16,313
certainly lead to a more playable game, but this is also where the distortion

21
00:01:16,313 --> 00:01:19,108
comes from, from the fact that the virtual field of view doesn't match the real

22
00:01:19,108 --> 00:01:23,927
world field of view. If you moved your point of view so that you were at the

23
00:01:23,927 --> 00:01:27,161
apex of the virtual world's frustom right here, the virtual world would appear

24
00:01:27,161 --> 00:01:31,176
undistorted. Of course it might actually all be blurry at this distance, or you

25
00:01:31,176 --> 00:01:33,730
might get a massive headache, but that's the theory.
