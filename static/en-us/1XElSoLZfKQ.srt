00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Congratulations, you've now got a working search engine.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
You can crawl the Web, finding content from pages, building an index,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
and then respond to search queries with the pages that contain that content.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
This is really exciting. I think I'm ready to start my search company.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Cool. And so I was looking at the competitors out there, and the key is that you've got to have a catchy name.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
So Google, Duck Duck Go. I've got to come up with something.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
This is the really hard part. Yeah. I'm ready to announce -- I'm ready to share with you my idea.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I've been putting a lot of thought into this. How about Search With Peter dot Info?

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Oooh. Yeah. So there's a lot of work to do. I've got to buy servers.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I've got to get employees. Investors. I've got to -- Oh, man -- I should probably start now.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Okay. Well, good luck to Peter. There are some more things that we want to learn in this class.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
And there's some things we need to do to really improve the search engine to make it useful.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
In Unit 5 we'll work on making the search engine faster.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
And in Unit 6 we'll work on making it find the best page for a given query, not just all the pages.

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
So for the rest of this unit we're going to look at understanding more how the Internet works

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
and what happens when we request a page on the World Wide Web.
