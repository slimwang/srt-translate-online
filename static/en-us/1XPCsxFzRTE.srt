1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,659
To understand why
the code is not updating,

2
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:04,960
we can refer back to
our life cycle diagram.

3
00:00:06,379 --> 00:00:07,900
In the Android life cycle,

4
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:11,949
when you navigate away from an activity,
onPause and onStop are called.

5
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:16,920
When you come back, onStart and
onResume are called.

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,590
OnCreate is never called unless
you rotate the activity or

7
00:00:20,589 --> 00:00:23,460
reopen the activity after being closed.

8
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:26,039
So one option for
loading up our preferences

9
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:30,869
would be to read from shared preferences
in the OnResume or OnStart call back.

10
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:32,469
But there's a better way.

11
00:00:32,469 --> 00:00:35,609
The shared preferences object allows
you to register an object that

12
00:00:35,609 --> 00:00:38,869
implements an OnShared
preference change listener.

13
00:00:38,869 --> 00:00:42,669
This object that gets called whenever
a value in the shared preferences file

14
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:43,630
changes.

15
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:47,510
In this way, you can actually be
triggered to update the UI if and

16
00:00:47,509 --> 00:00:50,199
only if a preference
is actually changed.

17
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,440
Setting this up will take four steps.

18
00:00:52,439 --> 00:00:55,320
First, we determine the activity
that needs to get called

19
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,939
when the preferences changed.

20
00:00:56,939 --> 00:00:59,769
In this case,
that's going to be Visualizer Activity.

21
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:03,570
This is because Visualizer Activity
is the one whose UI needs to change.

22
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:06,704
Second we're going to need
Visualizer Activity to implement

23
00:01:06,704 --> 00:01:09,069
an on shared preference change listener.

24
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:11,639
This will then require
that Visualizer Activity

25
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,849
implement a method called
OnShared preference change.

26
00:01:14,849 --> 00:01:17,539
Which will be triggered whenever
a preference is changed.

27
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:21,010
Third, you need to link
the onSharedPreferenceChangeListener

28
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:24,100
with the sharedPreferenceObject
it should be listening to.

29
00:01:24,099 --> 00:01:27,312
You can do this using
registerOnSharedPreferenceChangeListe-

30
00:01:27,313 --> 00:01:27,519
ner.

31
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:28,780
And then fourth,

32
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:32,450
you also need to unregister the listener
when the activity is shut down.

33
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:35,996
You can do this, using the
.unregisterOnSharedPreferenceListener.

34
00:01:35,995 --> 00:01:37,568
[SOUND] That was a mouthful.

35
00:01:37,569 --> 00:01:39,109
Okay, let's do this.

36
00:01:39,109 --> 00:01:42,060
I'll start in Visualizer Activity
by implementing

37
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,969
the OnSharedPreferenceChangeListener.

38
00:01:44,969 --> 00:01:49,689
This is red now because I actually have
to override onSharedPreferenceChange.

39
00:01:49,689 --> 00:01:51,200
So I will go ahead and do that.

40
00:01:52,329 --> 00:01:55,219
Here, I'm going to check
what preference changed and

41
00:01:55,219 --> 00:01:58,250
then I'm going to update my
VizualizerView accordingly.

42
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:01,680
This is a lot like what I'm doing
in the current onCreate method.

43
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,190
Note, that up here, I'm passed both
a reference to sharePreferences and

44
00:02:06,189 --> 00:02:08,780
the key of the preference
that was changed.

45
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:11,569
So I don't actually need to
use the preference manager to

46
00:02:11,569 --> 00:02:14,579
get a reference to shared preferences
because I already have one.

47
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,950
This also makes taking
shared preferences and

48
00:02:16,949 --> 00:02:19,119
getting the Boolean from it pretty easy.

49
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,099
Now that I've made Visualizer Activity
implement onSharedPreferenceChange,

50
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:24,889
I'm going to register the listener.

51
00:02:24,889 --> 00:02:28,119
I'll want to do this in onCreate,
when the activity's created.

52
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:31,620
So I'm going to do it in
the setupSharedPreferences method.

53
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:33,450
I'm going to take
the SharedPreferences object.

54
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:37,841
And call
registerOnSharedPreferenceChangeListe-

55
00:02:37,841 --> 00:02:38,768
ner.

56
00:02:38,768 --> 00:02:43,430
Passing in this,
remember Visualizer Activity implements

57
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:46,000
shared preference on shared
preference change listener.

58
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,210
Which is why, I can pass in this.

59
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:52,890
Now that I've registered the listener,
I also have to unregister the listener.

60
00:02:52,889 --> 00:02:56,899
And I'll do that in OnCreates
corresponding on destroy method.

61
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:59,330
So I'm going to override on destroy.

62
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:01,930
And in that method, I'm going to
just get my PreferenceManager,

63
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:05,170
and I'm going to get
the DefaultSharedPreferences.

64
00:03:05,169 --> 00:03:08,169
And I'm going to unregister
the OnSharedPreferenceChangeListener.

65
00:03:08,169 --> 00:03:09,647
Great, let's run the app and
see what happens.

66
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:15,046
[BLANK_AUDIO]

67
00:03:15,046 --> 00:03:16,199
And it updated.
