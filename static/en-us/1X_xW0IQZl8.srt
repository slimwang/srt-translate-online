Here is a image that describes a common place example of

2
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:08,950
the dependency inversion principle. It features, a, situation,

3
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:13,180
describes a situation, which there's a lamp that you want to get electricity to.

4
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:18,870
And the way you do this is by plugging, the lamp into the wall. The lamp depends

5
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:23,560
on the abstract plug interface and not on the underlying electrical wiring.

6
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:26,680
It enables you to plugin a variety of different kinds of lamps and

7
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:29,640
other devices as well. We want to, we want to

8
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,470
come up with a similar way of dealing with that in, in our software designs.
