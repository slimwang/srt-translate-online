00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,265
Every time x increases by 10, y increases by 5. To get from 0 to 10, we have to

2
00:00:05,277 --> 00:00:10,580
add 10. And from 10 to 20, add 10 again, and so on and so forth for the rest of

3
00:00:10,592 --> 00:00:15,770
the x values. We're stepping by 10 every time. On the y side however, each

4
00:00:15,782 --> 00:00:21,636
number is 5 greater than the last one. So, the change from table entry to table

5
00:00:21,648 --> 00:00:25,520
entry, is 10 in the x column, but 5 in the y column.
