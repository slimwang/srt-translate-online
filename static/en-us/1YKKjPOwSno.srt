1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,450
Regular Android applications
use the notification API

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:06,660
to show important information to
the user of phones and tablets.

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:07,770
Android Auto Support for

4
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:12,590
messaging uses the same notification
API to the underlying implementation.

5
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:16,230
The Android Auto app that runs on the
phone looks at the notification screen

6
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:17,490
being generated, and

7
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:21,670
it notices those that contain the car
extender, like these two red ones here.

8
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:25,100
Let's look inside one of these
objects to see what it contains.

9
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:28,600
The Unread Conversation object contains
the text to speak out to the driver,

10
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:31,240
and this is handled automatically for
you.

11
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:34,430
Speech Recognition is then used
to get the reply from the driver.

12
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:37,290
And Remote Input is used to
help capture this for you and

13
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:40,510
give you a string of the spoken
audio via this intent here.

14
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:44,780
Remember, the phone is handling the text
to speech and speech recognition, and

15
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:47,580
the car is just displaying images and
capturing audio.

16
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:51,260
Let's get started with some code to
understand how notifications work and

17
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:52,825
how to add these extensions.

18
00:00:52,825 --> 00:00:56,380
We'll use the basic notification sample,
which is the same starting point

19
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:59,180
that we use when we discuss
notifications on Android Wear.

20
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:02,910
So, let's find a sample in Android
Studio that demonstrates what we need.

21
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:07,690
So here, we go to File, Import Sample,
and we're going to look for

22
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:09,400
a sample called Basic Notifications.

23
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:13,260
See it there, we hit Next, and

24
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:15,070
we can leave everything
with the default values.

25
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:18,020
So now we've got a new
project on our machine

26
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:19,500
with the basic notification sample.

27
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,020
You've had this dialogue box here,
we just hit yes to that because we just

28
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:24,820
want to reload it after some small
changes that have been made, and

29
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:26,970
now we have our sample
that we can get started.

30
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:29,110
The next thing we need to do is
get an emulator ready to start

31
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:30,120
the sample within.

32
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:33,990
Go to Tools, Android, and
start the AVD manager.

33
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:36,830
Now what we do here is we
create a virtual device, and

34
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:38,640
you need to select a phone
model to use here.

35
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,920
I'm going to pick a Galaxy Nexus,

36
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,500
since it's an older device
with a small display and

37
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:46,060
a smaller memory footprint that will
work on my small laptop display easily.

38
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:47,820
So, now we hit Next.

39
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,685
And it's important here that
we select Lollipop API 21,

40
00:01:50,685 --> 00:01:53,220
although any newer API
will work as well.

41
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:56,543
And we need to make sure we pick the
Google APIs, since that's required for

42
00:01:56,543 --> 00:01:57,775
the Android Auto Support.

43
00:01:57,775 --> 00:02:00,585
If you pick the x86 emulator, and
have the HAXM driver installed,

44
00:02:00,585 --> 00:02:02,530
the emulator will also run a lot faster.

45
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:03,660
So we hit Next.

46
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:08,100
Now here on this scale, you may need to
select 2DP on device is 1px on screen

47
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,100
to make sure the emulator
fits on your screen.

48
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:12,090
Otherwise, leave all
the defaults as they are, and

49
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:14,560
then click finish to create the ADV.

50
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,820
Now you have a list of emulators
available, so select it and

51
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:19,610
click on the play button
to get it started.
