1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:03,110
Okay, it's that time again for
another toy app.

2
00:00:03,109 --> 00:00:06,854
We'll be creating a simple app to
search GitHub repositories by name.

3
00:00:06,854 --> 00:00:10,839
Along the way, you'll be building query
URLs and learning network basics.

4
00:00:10,839 --> 00:00:11,980
If you run into problems,

5
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:14,679
you might want to use that logging
stuff we just learned about.

6
00:00:14,679 --> 00:00:16,000
So let's start there.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,730
Here's the URL stream we'll
be using in our toy app.

8
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:22,690
It uses GitHub's API and searches for
repositories with a given name.

9
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:26,609
It also allows you to sort the results
or see a certain page of the results.

10
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:29,600
This request doesn't require any
sort of API key authentication.

11
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:33,820
You can send requests to this API from a
web browser without any special set-up.

12
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:35,139
Let's try that.

13
00:00:35,139 --> 00:00:36,556
Enter that URL into a browser,

14
00:00:36,555 --> 00:00:39,849
and we get a list of the GitHub
repositories named Android.

15
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:42,840
It sounds like something that we could
make into a simple app, so let's begin.
