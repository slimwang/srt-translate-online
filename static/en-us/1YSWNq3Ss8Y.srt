00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,430
As we touched on earlier in this class,

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:05,670
rendering pages quickly is super important.

3
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:07,670
Let's think about this for a moment.

4
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:11,580
Because if you can request data asynchronously you open up

5
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:15,030
a new range of ways for making fast page loads.

6
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:18,740
Let's think about this Facebook for food app over here.

7
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:22,110
Where I've got my favorite cereal, favorite pasta, favorite meal, and

8
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:23,270
how I like my eggs.

9
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:27,020
It's displaying custom content based on me being the user.

10
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:30,030
Take a look at some possible steps for rendering this app.

11
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:33,270
In what order could we run these steps to get the first pixels on

12
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:36,060
the screen over here as fast as possible?

13
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:40,369
Just to be clear, generic refers to HTML that would be the same for all users.

14
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:42,930
That would be the HTML for

15
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:48,190
let's say favorite cereal, favorite pasta, it can also even be CSS for,

16
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:52,650
you know, how to style this image and how to style all this text.

17
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:56,040
Unique HTML refers to things like the strings for

18
00:00:56,040 --> 00:01:00,470
my name, the strings for all my favorite foods.

19
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:02,700
Because this is unique to me specifically.
