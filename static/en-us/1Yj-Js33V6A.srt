00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,350
We had said that the title of this
lesson is Common Sense Reasoning, but

2
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:04,670
let's dig a little bit deeper so

3
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:07,650
that we can see where the common
sense reasoning is coming here.

4
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:10,482
Consider the sentence,
Ashok put the wedge on the block.

5
00:00:10,482 --> 00:00:13,845
Imagine an agent that
pulls out the frame for

6
00:00:13,845 --> 00:00:17,730
move-object with a primitive action and
fills in all of these slots.

7
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:19,540
And by now we know how
the agent can do that.

8
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:21,980
I were to ask the agent,

9
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:25,830
did Ashok's hand move when he was
putting the wedge on the block?

10
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:27,110
I would expect the agent to say,

11
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:31,130
yes, because that is what happens when
people move the wedge to the block.

12
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:35,050
They grasp their hands around the wedge,
they move their hand,

13
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:36,880
then they release their fingers.

14
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,720
Now this is what common sense
reasoning is about, making inferences

15
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:44,370
that are not necessarily part
of the input sentence here, but

16
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:46,790
are part of the background
knowledge that the agent has.

17
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:49,467
So the agent can make
inferences about the world,

18
00:00:49,467 --> 00:00:51,770
common sense inferences about the world.

19
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:55,512
So the question then becomes, what is
the knowledge that an agent must have so

20
00:00:55,512 --> 00:00:59,253
that it can, in fact, make the kind of
inferences that we are talking about,

21
00:00:59,253 --> 00:01:00,597
common sense inferences?

22
00:01:00,597 --> 00:01:04,406
Suppose that the agent had not only
knowledge of the primitive action

23
00:01:04,406 --> 00:01:07,660
move-object, but
also about some of the sub-actions.

24
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:10,760
So here are some of the sub-actions for
the human context.

25
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:13,743
So in the context of moving wedges and
blocks,

26
00:01:13,743 --> 00:01:17,195
the agent might already
have a kind of micro-story.

27
00:01:17,195 --> 00:01:19,786
Which says that when
actions get done and

28
00:01:19,786 --> 00:01:22,985
things get moved from one
place to another place,

29
00:01:22,985 --> 00:01:27,420
then typically fingers are first
closed around the first object.

30
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:31,120
Then the hand moves and the fingers
are released around the second object.

31
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,971
>> So Ashok, if we can decompose
move-object into a series of

32
00:01:33,971 --> 00:01:38,110
move-body-part actions, was
move-object really a primitive action?

33
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:39,365
>> That's a valid question, David.

34
00:01:39,365 --> 00:01:44,150
Move-object was indeed a primitive
action related to the various

35
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:49,120
superficial forms in which words can
occur in a sentence, as an example,

36
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:52,320
transported, carried, or moved.

37
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,780
However, this primitive action
move-object can have its own story

38
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:58,080
in terms of further decomposition.

39
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:02,590
Notice this particular decomposition,
this particular story is specific to

40
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:05,840
the structure of the sentence where
Ashok puts the wedge on the block.

41
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,720
This raises lots of hard issues.

42
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,389
How many such stories are there?

43
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:10,889
Do we have a story?

44
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:13,180
Must an agent have such a story for

45
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:16,230
every single situation
that it encounters?

46
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:17,355
Those are hard questions, and

47
00:02:17,355 --> 00:02:20,610
it's not clear that currently hasn't
answered all of those questions.

48
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:23,399
So this theory by no
means covers all stories,

49
00:02:23,399 --> 00:02:26,770
many of the stories are beyond
the scope of this theory.

50
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:29,488
And in fact, even for
the stories that are within this scope,

51
00:02:29,488 --> 00:02:32,209
there is a hard question about
computational tractability,

52
00:02:32,209 --> 00:02:34,840
because a number of such stories
can explode very quickly.
