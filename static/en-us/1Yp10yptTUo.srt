1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:02,086
Now that you've evaluated ideas and

2
00:00:02,086 --> 00:00:05,783
thought about your own connection to
them, it's time to choose just one idea.

3
00:00:05,783 --> 00:00:06,979
For the rest of the course,

4
00:00:06,979 --> 00:00:11,130
you will use one of your ideas to work
on tasks related to the final project.

5
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:14,380
If no idea seems compelling,
you can complete the final project

6
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:17,330
using the Shopping App idea or
some version of it.

7
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:19,870
Don't get caught up in whether
your idea is good enough.

8
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:22,490
Most entrepreneurs
don't succeed at first.

9
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:26,010
But even when they don't succeed
with an idea, they learn from it.

10
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:27,950
You should have the same mindset.

11
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:31,710
You're learning how to move fast,
get feedback and iterate on your ideas.

12
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:36,600
Based on your own work of evaluating
your ideas and your reflection on

13
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,999
the Manipulation Matrix, I'd like you
to select one of the following options.

14
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,520
Have you chosen to work on your own
idea for the rest of the course?

15
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,322
Or will you work on a version
of the Super Duper Shopping App?

16
00:00:47,322 --> 00:00:52,351
And then finally,
is your idea B2C or B2B?

17
00:00:52,351 --> 00:00:55,000
Select one of these options and
select one of these options.
