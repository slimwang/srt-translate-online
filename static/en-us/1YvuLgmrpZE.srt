[Thrun] So one of the questions you might ask for a Markov chain like this is

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
what happens if time becomes really large?

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
What happens for the probability of A1000?

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Or let's go extreme.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
What about in the limit, A infinity, often written as the limits of time

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
going to infinity of any P of At.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
That's like the fancy math notation, but what it really means is we just wait a long, long time.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
What is going to happen to the Markov chain over here? What is that probability?

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
This probability is called a stationary distribution,

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
and a Markov chain settles to a stationary distribution

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
or sometimes a limit cycle if the transition is alternativistic(?), which we don't care about.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:51,000
And the key to calculating this is to realize that the probability for any t

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
must be the same as the probability 1 times (?)

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
This can be resolved as follows.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:05,000
We know that P of At is P of At given At minus 1 times P of At minus 1

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:12,000
plus P of At given Bt minus 1

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
times probability of Bt minus 1.

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
This is just the theorem of total probability or forward propagation rule

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
applied to this case over here, so nothing really new.

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
But if you call this guy over here X, then we now have X

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:39,000
equals probability of At given At minus 1 is 0.5

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
times--and this is the same X as this one over here

23
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
because you're looking for the stationary distribution, so it's X again.

24
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,000
This probability over here, A following B, is 1 in this special case,

25
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:58,000
and the probability of Bt minus 1 is 1 minus At minus 1.

26
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
And if you plug this in, that's the same as 1 minus X.

27
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
And we can now solve this for X.

28
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Let me just do this.

29
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:15,000
X equals, if you put these 2 Xs together we get minus 0.5 plus 1

30
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
or, differently, 1.5X equals 1.

31
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,000
That means X equals 1 over 1.5, which is 2/3.

32
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:31,000
So the answer here is the stationary distribution will have A occurring with 2/3 chance

33
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
and B with 1/3 chance.

34
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
It's still a Markov chain--it flips from A to B--

35
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
but these are the frequencies at which A occurs

36
00:02:38,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and this is the frequency at which B occurs.
