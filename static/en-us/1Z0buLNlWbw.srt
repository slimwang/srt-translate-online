00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,950
Let's briefly talk about magnetic tape, which is usually

2
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:08,150
used for backup purposes or so-called secondary storage, which

3
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:10,925
means that the magnetic tape is not the first

4
00:00:10,925 --> 00:00:14,400
device on which you look for your data. You first

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,200
try to find your data on the hard drive. And only if it's not there, you go to

6
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,650
secondary storage. Either because the hard drive was lost

7
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:25,230
and you need to restore and back-up or because this

8
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:29,920
data was not used for a long, long time, so it was stored on tapes and put away

9
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,630
somewhere. Tapes can have large capacity and are usually

10
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:36,958
replaceable. Meaning you just bring a reel of tape and

11
00:00:36,958 --> 00:00:40,164
you attach to the tape machine. But their access

12
00:00:40,164 --> 00:00:43,735
is fundamentally sequential. We need to seek along the tape

13
00:00:43,735 --> 00:00:47,380
until we find the point we are interested in.

14
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:50,356
So tapes are very good for things like back-up restoring

15
00:00:50,356 --> 00:00:53,580
back-ups and so on when you're writing things sequentially

16
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:56,060
for a long time or reading them sequentially for

17
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:58,942
a long time. But tapes are not very good,

18
00:00:58,942 --> 00:01:03,020
for example, as a virtual memory or something like that.

19
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:06,125
Tapes are slowly dying out, mainly because they have

20
00:01:06,125 --> 00:01:09,368
a low production volume because not many people actually use

21
00:01:09,368 --> 00:01:12,258
tape. So the cost of tapes is not dropping

22
00:01:12,258 --> 00:01:15,618
as rapidly as the cost of disks, which have much

23
00:01:15,618 --> 00:01:19,482
more mass production, so their cost gets cheaper over

24
00:01:19,482 --> 00:01:22,473
time. And at this point, it's cheaper to buy

25
00:01:22,473 --> 00:01:25,507
an entire hard drive together with all the motors

26
00:01:25,507 --> 00:01:28,837
and the head assembly and a built-in electronics for

27
00:01:28,837 --> 00:01:31,353
it, than to buy some tape and the machine

28
00:01:31,353 --> 00:01:34,379
that will read it. So people for example, use

29
00:01:34,379 --> 00:01:37,343
USB drives which is pretty much an entire hard

30
00:01:37,343 --> 00:01:40,775
disk just packaged with a USB interface, as a method

31
00:01:40,775 --> 00:01:42,770
of backup storage and so on.
