00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:03,190
So you might be wondering
what is exactly is a meme.

2
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:04,630
>> A meme is an idea, behavior,

3
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:08,200
or style that spreads from person
to person within a culture.

4
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:10,690
>> And they aren't restricted
to a single language or country.

5
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:12,800
Any place where
the Internet is available,

6
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:17,170
memes based on popular movies,
sports and political figures will form.

7
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:19,950
>> Sometimes, the visuals of
the original are recreated.

8
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:23,620
While other times, the source
image is used with some new text.

9
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:25,390
Hey, so what's your favorite meme?

10
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:27,630
>> I have to say Futurama Fry.

11
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:29,362
How about you?

12
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:31,920
>> I'm going to go with Brace Yourself,

13
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,100
because usually it shows up before
really big meme-worthy events.

14
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:36,770
>> Cool.

15
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:39,600
If you'd like to learn more about
any of the images we've used,
