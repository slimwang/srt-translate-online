00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,533
Let's look at a problem involving changing a number. We decrese a number by 7,

2
00:00:04,545 --> 00:00:09,368
multiply the result by 3, and divide the final amount by 2. Let's get started by

3
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:13,662
finding out what these words mean. Let's translate them into an expression.

4
00:00:13,762 --> 00:00:17,628
Notice that we have some unknown number, we're going to call that a. What do you

5
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:21,998
think? What's the expression that could represent the operations we performed?

6
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:23,295
Choose the best answer.
