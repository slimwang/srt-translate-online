1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,600
So the way we do this is, if we go into the Object

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:08,125
Set Up Details Page. So just navigating to Object Set Up. There you go.

3
00:00:08,125 --> 00:00:09,940
>> I mean in the quick access menu.

4
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:12,690
>> Yeah. We can go right there and then create the action ourselves.

5
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:13,895
>> Cool.

6
00:00:13,895 --> 00:00:15,820
>> So if we scroll down one of these

7
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:19,130
related lists is Button Links and Actions. And so that

8
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:21,180
will allow us to create an action that we can

9
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:24,980
drag onto the page laypout. And then access from Chatter.

10
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:26,640
>> Okay. So,

11
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,020
buttons, links, and actions. A new action, I'm guessing?

12
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:32,200
>> Yup. So, there are a couple different types of

13
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:35,280
actions we can make. One is creating, like, a child record.

14
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:35,540
>> Mm-hm.

15
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:37,480
>> Now, what's great about this if you choose this is

16
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:40,390
you can, one, it'll automatically relate the child to the parent.

17
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:40,450
>> Uh-huh.

18
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:43,520
>> But you could also pre-define fields if you wanted to, things like that.

19
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:43,980
>> Okay.

20
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:47,780
>> or a couple of the other actions. Log a call, we could use some

21
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:51,860
code if we wanted to put a visual force page in there. Or, update the record

22
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:55,250
itself, not necessarily a child record, but update like the stage.

23
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:57,940
>> So, okay, the stage but not update the child record.

24
00:00:57,940 --> 00:00:58,030
>> Yeah.

25
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:00,450
>> But I can create a child. Create a set time.

26
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:01,160
>> Yes.

27
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,060
>> Okay. So that's what I'm going to do. Target

28
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:07,890
Object will be Set Time. Label would be what?

29
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:10,780
>> Let's call it Add a Set Time.

30
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:12,080
>> Oh, this is just what's going to say.

31
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,150
>> On the action, exactly. And then we don't need

32
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:17,160
to choose that. If we choose something there it automatically

33
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,030
names it for us.

34
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:19,220
>> Oh, yeah.

35
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:19,350
>> Yeah.

36
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:21,150
>> Okay, so it's good?

37
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:25,140
>> And so now this is the mini page layout,

38
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:29,586
so when we have, you know, a new record import form.

39
00:01:29,586 --> 00:01:30,128
>> Mm-hm.

40
00:01:30,128 --> 00:01:33,190
>> it's going to ask us what fields from set time do you want to show up

41
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:35,430
on this form when you're creating the child

42
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:38,260
set time. So probably everything, I would guess.

43
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:38,830
>> Oh, yeah, yeah.

44
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:40,160
>> But, I mean, if you had an object

45
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,152
that had a lot of fields, you probably would

46
00:01:42,152 --> 00:01:42,698
[CROSSTALK].

47
00:01:42,698 --> 00:01:43,676
>> You might just want to get the.

48
00:01:43,676 --> 00:01:44,524
>> The main fields. Exactly.

49
00:01:44,524 --> 00:01:47,860
>> Okay, but we don't have a lot of fields. We'll do date, status and time.

50
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:52,785
>> Andy, your UX skills are impeccable.

51
00:01:52,785 --> 00:01:54,657
[LAUGH]

52
00:01:54,657 --> 00:01:57,168
>> All right, Save.

53
00:01:57,168 --> 00:01:57,797
>> Yep.
