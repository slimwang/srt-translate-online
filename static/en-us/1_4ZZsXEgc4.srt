00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:01,560
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:05,109
In the last lesson,
you learned all about functions.

3
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:07,280
Functions are great for
simplifying your code and

4
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:10,140
creating reuseable
shortcuts in your programs.

5
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:13,301
But let's switch gears for
a moment to talk more about data.

6
00:00:13,301 --> 00:00:14,490
>> Up until this point,

7
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:17,730
we've only worked with a few
pieces of data at a time.

8
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:22,010
A couple of numbers, some strings,
and maybe a few booleans.

9
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:24,620
But what happens when you want to
work with a lot of data all at once?

10
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,532
Let's say we own a doughnut shop.

11
00:00:28,532 --> 00:00:31,184
And let's say we need a way to
keep track of all the doughnuts we

12
00:00:31,184 --> 00:00:32,980
could sell at our shop.

13
00:00:32,979 --> 00:00:37,060
We've got glazed doughnuts, chocolate
frosted doughnuts, Boston cream

14
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:41,268
doughnuts, powdered doughnuts,
sprinkled doughnuts, maple doughnuts,

15
00:00:41,268 --> 00:00:46,410
coconut doughnuts, coconut jelly
doughnuts, and finally, doughnut holes.

16
00:00:46,409 --> 00:00:48,611
Hey, James, wake up.

17
00:00:48,612 --> 00:00:50,750
>> Right, a lot of doughnuts.

18
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:52,020
>> Exactly, and

19
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:55,230
wouldn't it be nice if there were a way
to keep track of all this information?

20
00:00:55,229 --> 00:00:58,085
A way to store it all in one place or
in one variable,

21
00:00:58,085 --> 00:01:00,888
where we could keep a list
of all these doughnuts.

22
00:01:00,889 --> 00:01:04,390
>> Well, we can do just that with
a data structure called an array.

23
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:08,000
Arrays are a data structure that
can hold multiple data values,

24
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,519
kind of like a list.

25
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:13,349
In this section, you'll explore how to
create arrays, how to use arrays, and

26
00:01:13,349 --> 00:01:15,199
how arrays are structured.

27
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,930
To start, let's look at how
we could create an array

28
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:19,840
to keep track of all
the doughnuts in our shop.
