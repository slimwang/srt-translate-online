00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:04,000
Could you write a method that
downloads in the background and

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,860
then returns the image once it's done?

3
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:08,248
Try to write one, I'll wait.

4
00:00:17,836 --> 00:00:19,850
No luck?

5
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:21,630
That's because it's impossible.

6
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:23,180
Let's see why.

7
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:25,870
When you call a function and
wait for it to return,

8
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:29,599
you're making an assumption you
probably never paid attention to.

9
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:33,070
You have seen the function
knows where to return.

10
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:36,900
This is fine in serial synchronous
code where the calling code

11
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:39,592
will be blocked until
the function returns.

12
00:00:39,592 --> 00:00:42,910
In asynchronous code, however,
the calling code may continue

13
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:46,645
doing something else, therefore,
we need to provide the function,

14
00:00:46,645 --> 00:00:50,735
with the information on what it
needs to do once it's finished.

15
00:00:50,735 --> 00:00:55,482
In SWF, that information could be passed
in a closure, a completion closure.

16
00:00:55,482 --> 00:00:57,537
You've seen many so
far, in Apple's code.

17
00:00:57,537 --> 00:01:00,523
Now, you're going to write your own.

18
00:01:00,523 --> 00:01:01,435
Yeah!
