As a new developer, you might be tempted to memorize a

2
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:05,570
certain click path in order to get some kind of process

3
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:09,420
done, but it's not always a good idea. Instead, it's better

4
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:12,590
to find the general area of where you want to get something

5
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:15,460
done, go there, and then figure it out. Let me explain

6
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:17,920
what I mean. The setup page is an important place to

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,500
go. It's where you go when you want to customize your app.

8
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:25,490
This Schema builder lets you visualize the objects and relationships and

9
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:27,560
add fields to them. It's a good place to go

10
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:30,530
to get the big picture view of what you're building. When

11
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:32,680
you click on an object, you get to the object

12
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:35,620
homepage, which is a good place to look at specific records.

13
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:38,030
When you click on a record, you get to the

14
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:42,950
record detail page. Which gives you specific information about that record.

15
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:46,380
The Quick Access menu gives you handy shortcuts to customizing

16
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:50,610
your application. And finally, there's the page layout editor which helps

17
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:53,270
you select the fields and display them in the order that you want them.

18
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:55,720
They'll run pretty quickly and you're not

19
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:58,270
going to remember everything I said. Sales Force

20
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:00,820
has a lot of ways to do something and if you click around, you're going to

21
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:06,570
find it. If you don't, try clicking the help link or use the discussion forums
