1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Now we're going to analyze the forward Euler method with the help of Dahlquist test equation.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
In which range should the step size h lie to maintain stability.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Should that step size be smaller than kÂ²/2, k being our constant.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Should the step size be smaller than the inverse of that constant.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Should it be smaller than twice that constant, or should it be smaller than 2 over that constant.
