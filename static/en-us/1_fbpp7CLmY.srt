1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Now if you have paid attention so far,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I hope you have noticed that I forgotten to mention

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
one detail about the satisfiability problem so far,

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
and I would like you to tell me what that is.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
So what do we still need to talk about?

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
The length of the Boolean formula that we're given as an input to SAT?

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
The number of variables or the number of times each variable occurs?

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
So only one of them is true,

9
00:00:23,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and I would like you to check the one which is true.
