1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
There's a complexity that comes from combinatorial problems.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
We've seen that before.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
In the cryptarithmetic problems ODD + ODD = EVEN.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
We had these up to 10! different permutations of digits to assign,

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
and it was complex because we had to consider them all.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,000
In the zebra puzzle we had 5!^5 combinations to consider.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
It was complex because it took a long time to consider them all.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
We came up with an optimization to consider a few of them by going one at a time.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:40,000
For our pouring problem, we know there are 6 actions, 2 empties, 2 fills, and 2 pours.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The glasses are of size 4 and 9.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
The goal is 6 oz.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I guess my question for you is how many combinations do we need?

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
For cryptarithmetic it was 10!. For zebra it was 5!^5.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 99:59:59,999
For pouring is it 6^4, 6^(9-4), 6^6, or 6^9, or can't tell--none of the above?
