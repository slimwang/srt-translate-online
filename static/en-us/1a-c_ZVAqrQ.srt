1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,220
Let's build that logic into our app.

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:04,850
We should check that we do
get a 200 response code

3
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:08,000
before we continue trying
to parse the JSON response.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,900
Now, if we received an error response
code, just return an empty string for

5
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:12,910
the JSON response.

6
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:15,900
It wouldn't make sense to try to project
the feature array from the response

7
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:19,160
because there would be no
information in that response.

8
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:23,284
So within the Soonami app's code, I
want you to check the HTTP response code

9
00:00:23,284 --> 00:00:27,590
in the makeHttpRequest method and
handle it accordingly.

10
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:30,831
Also, make sure to double-check the code
to make sure you handle empty or

11
00:00:30,831 --> 00:00:33,610
null cases in the networking
code in a reasonable manner.

12
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:36,240
See the note below the quiz for
more details.

13
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:41,080
For example, if the URL's null, we
shouldn't try to make the HTTPrequest.

14
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:43,368
Or if the JSON is null,
or an empty string,

15
00:00:43,368 --> 00:00:45,920
we shouldn't try to
continue with parsing it.
