1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
For this question, the second and the fourth options are true.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Taking a look at these, the first one is not true because in the Diffie-Hellman scheme a is public,

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and so in no way does the security of the scheme depend upon a.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
The second one is true.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
To solve for x is the discrete log problem, which in lecture we discussed

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
to show that this is hard.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
So the security of the Diffie-Hellman scheme depends on this being difficult.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
The third one is an incorrect statement.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
We can see that this statement is correct regardless of g.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
So even if g is not a generator, the two participants will produce the same key.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The fourth statement is correct.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The security of Diffie-Hellman is related to the difficulty of solving the discrete log problem.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 99:59:59,999
For some non-prime numbers the discrete log is not hard, but yet it would still be correct.
