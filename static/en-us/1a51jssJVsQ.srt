00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:07,850
needs to be the outer container, so that

4
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:09,690
the recipients of the frame on the network can

5
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:12,350
know how to act. Remember, other computers on

6
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:14,060
the network need to know whether they are the

7
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:16,860
recipient and the ethernet switch needs to know

8
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:18,860
how to wrap the frame to the proper recipient.
