1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:00,810
In this unit,

2
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:03,430
you'll return to the two classes
that you covered last time as well.

3
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:06,465
You'll look again at Sebastian Thrun's
introduction to Machine Learning class,

4
00:00:06,465 --> 00:00:07,277
and Charles Isbell and

5
00:00:07,277 --> 00:00:10,340
Michael Littman's Machine
learning class from Georgia Tech.

6
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:11,850
Along the way you'll cover
different methods for

7
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:15,460
doing Unsupervised Learning like
clustering and feature selection.

8
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:18,230
We really want you to focus on
three things during this unit.

9
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:21,070
One, we again want you to focus
on how Unsupervised Learning

10
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:24,140
fills in that model building gap from
the original Machine Learning work flow.

11
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:28,140
Two, we want you to understand how to
compare different models developed using

12
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:31,870
Unsupervised Learning for their relative
strengths and relative disadvantages.

13
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:34,760
But, three, and most importantly for
Unsupervised Learning, we want you to

14
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:38,240
understand the different kinds of
conclusions that Unsupervised Learning

15
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:41,160
can generate, the different kinds
of problems that it addresses and

16
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,680
how it differs from Supervised Learning.

17
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:46,180
So you should come away from this unit
with an understanding not only of

18
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:48,120
how to do Unsupervised Learning, but

19
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,450
how it can address different
things from Supervised Learning.
