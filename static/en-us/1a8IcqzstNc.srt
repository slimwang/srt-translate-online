00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,820
So, we continue to get deeper into understanding what images are.

2
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:05,745
One of the things we also have to start thinking of,

3
00:00:05,745 --> 00:00:10,450
the images are nothing else but samples of different intensities.

4
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:11,630
These samples can,

5
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:15,520
of course, be represented in various forms of frequency spectra.

6
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:18,440
So in this lecture, I'm going to basically talk about how we're going to

7
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:20,940
take an image and start looking at it, and

8
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:25,040
of various forms of frequency informations that could be extracted out of it.

9
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:29,320
And those frequency informations can then be used to analyze images differently.
