1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:04,290
So this is the second in the series of
three lectures on camera calibration.

2
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:07,010
Again, I'm going to rely on my
dear friend Aaron Bobick, and

3
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:10,080
use his lectures on camera calibration.

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,130
In the last lecture on
camera calibration,

5
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:16,230
he introduced the whole mathematics of
how we do extrinsic camera calibration,

6
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:20,790
that is, being able to capture the world
information of where the camera is

7
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:23,570
in an environment from
a series of images.

8
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:26,570
In this one we're going to talk about,
more about the intrinsics,

9
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:30,670
the focal length and other information
related to the camera, that is,

10
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:35,250
once the light enters the camera,
how is it generated into an image.

11
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:37,230
So that's what the focus of this one is.

12
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:40,470
Again, it's a fun lecture, it's going to
cover a lot of variety of topics.

13
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:41,800
Pay attention to the concepts.

14
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:45,240
Again, I wanted to introduce these
ideas to you in an optional framework.
