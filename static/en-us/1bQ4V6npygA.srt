00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,912
So, with some logic and some algebra, we can come up with two equations for this

2
00:00:03,912 --> 00:00:07,758
problem. We used the individual amounts from each account to equal the total

3
00:00:07,758 --> 00:00:11,333
amount. And we used the interest rates and those amounts to get our total

4
00:00:11,333 --> 00:00:15,289
interest. Now that we have two equations, we can use them to figure out how much

5
00:00:15,289 --> 00:00:19,028
was invested at each rate. I'm going to show you how to solve the system using

6
00:00:19,028 --> 00:00:24,457
substitution. I think it's easier than elimination because I can either isolate

7
00:00:24,457 --> 00:00:29,498
the x in this first equation or the y. If I subtract x from both sides, I can

8
00:00:29,498 --> 00:00:34,488
solve for y. So y would equal 10,000 minus x. Now that y is solved for, I can

9
00:00:34,488 --> 00:00:39,469
replace this y with 10,000 minus x, this is my substitution. I've made the

10
00:00:39,469 --> 00:00:44,411
substitution in this line, the I distribute the 0.08. Multiplying by 10,000

11
00:00:44,411 --> 00:00:49,099
moves my decimal point right four places, so I get 800. And then I have minus

12
00:00:49,099 --> 00:00:53,908
0.08 times x for the second term. Next I subtract 800 from both sides. I have my

13
00:00:53,908 --> 00:00:58,852
constant terms on the right, and then my x terms on the left. Next, I combine my

14
00:00:58,852 --> 00:01:03,691
like terms and I get negative 0.005 times x. Then, I divide by the coefficient

15
00:01:03,691 --> 00:01:08,676
of x to get x is equal to 2,500. But we need to make sense of what this means.

16
00:01:08,676 --> 00:01:13,857
Let's look back at our problem. X is 2,500. Well, that's the amount of money I

17
00:01:13,857 --> 00:01:18,692
invested at 7.5%. Knowing this, I want you to finish out the rest of this

18
00:01:18,692 --> 00:01:23,621
problem. How much was invested at 8%? Write your answer here.
