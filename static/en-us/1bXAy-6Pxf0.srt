1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,939
Let's just first find what this value should be. We have 2.064 standard errors

2
00:00:05,939 --> 00:00:15,264
below 1700. So this should be 1700 minus 2.064 standard errors, which is 200

3
00:00:15,264 --> 00:00:27,322
divided by the square root of 25. This calculates to $1,617.44. And then we'll

4
00:00:27,322 --> 00:00:32,575
do the same thing with this value on the right of 1700. We have 1700 plus 2.064

5
00:00:32,575 --> 00:00:42,344
standard errors, and this comes out to $1,782.56. And there we have our 95%

6
00:00:42,344 --> 00:00:45,522
confidence interval.
