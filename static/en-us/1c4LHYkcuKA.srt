1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:01,880
So, three is a new unit for us, and

2
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:06,900
we're going to start talking about camera models, and it's going to start off

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:12,280
gentle, and then get a little a little rougher later where

4
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:16,520
we start to get into things like perspective projection, so just bare with us.

5
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:18,280
In the middle we'll do something cool in stereo,

6
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:21,250
which you're actually going to to do for a a problem set, and

7
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:22,410
it's pretty straightforward.

8
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:24,530
But, that's what that class will, will keep trying to do,

9
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:27,900
we'll, we'll dive down into the math a little bit, come back up,

10
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:31,050
try to make sure you always have the math you need for doing the problem sets.

11
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:35,160
Some of the stuff we'll give you you won't use directly, on the problem sets for

12
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,520
the assignments, or even the exam but

13
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,470
it's important that you, that you, that you know about it.

14
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:42,810
So, what is an image?

15
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:47,760
Well, up until today, we've been talking about images as functions, remember,

16
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,460
they were a, two dimensional function or

17
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:55,010
a function of intensity, of two dimensions, x, y, u, v, i, j.

18
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:57,920
Today, we're going to start saying wait a minute,

19
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,870
it's not just an arbitrary function, these images are actually projections of

20
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:05,349
three dimensional scenes, of three dimensional points.
