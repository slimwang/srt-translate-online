1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,360
So why is configuration hard to get

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:05,810
right? First, it's difficult to define what we

3
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:07,540
mean by correct behaviour in the first

4
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:12,080
place. Second, the interactions between multiple routing protocols

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,590
can lead to unpredictability. Furthermore, each autonomous

6
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:18,930
system on the internet is independently configured. And

7
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:21,740
the interaction between the policies of these autonomous

8
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:26,770
systems can lead to unintended, or unwanted behaviour.

9
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:28,410
The third reason that configuration is

10
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:30,890
hard, is that operators simply make mistakes.

11
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:34,180
Configuration is difficult, and network policies

12
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:37,600
are very complex. Furthermore, Network configuration has

13
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,170
historically been distributed across hundreds, or

14
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:44,820
more, network devices. Across the network where

15
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:48,646
each device is configured with vendor-specific

16
00:00:48,646 --> 00:00:52,050
low-level configuration. We'll see in the first

17
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:57,690
part of this course how Software Defined Networking or SDN changes this,

18
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:01,370
by centralizing the network's configuration in

19
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:04,640
a logically centralized controller. At a

20
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,160
very high level, Software Defined Networking

21
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:10,860
provides exactly the primitives that operators

22
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:13,960
need to run the network better.

23
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:18,380
In particular, SDN provides operators three things.

24
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:24,990
The first, is network-wide views of both topology and traffic. The second,

25
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:31,170
is the ability to satisfy network level objectives such as those that we talked

26
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:35,900
about before including load balance, security,

27
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:38,320
and other high level goals. The third

28
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,720
thing, that software defined networking provides

29
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:44,760
that network operators need, is direct control.

30
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:49,450
In particular, rather than requiring network operators to configure each

31
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:54,750
device individually with indirect configuration, SDN

32
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:59,950
allows an operator to write a control program that directly

33
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:05,050
affects the data plane. So rather than having to

34
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:09,880
configure each device individually and guess or infer what might

35
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:15,350
happen, software-defined networking allows a network operator to express network

36
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:23,270
level objectives and direct control from A logically centralized controller. So

37
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:29,000
to make network operations easier, routers should forward packets

38
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,500
since router hardware is specialized to forward traffic at very high rates.

39
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:38,330
They should collect measurements such as traffic

40
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:42,280
statistics and topology information. But on the

41
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,220
other hand, there's no reason that a

42
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:48,480
router should have to compute routes. Although,

43
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,600
conventionally, routing has operated as a distributed

44
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:55,160
computation of forwarding tables, the computation doesn't

45
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,400
inherently need to run on the routers.

46
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,480
Rather, the computation could be logically centralized,

47
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,790
and controlled, from a centralized control program.

48
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:06,180
This logical centralization is the fundamental tenant

49
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:11,740
of SDN. So a simple way of summing up Software Defined Networking is simply

50
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:14,880
to remove routing from the routers, and

51
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:18,340
perform that routing computation at a logically

52
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:21,590
centralized controller. Now of course, SDN has

53
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:25,530
evolved to incorporate, a much broader range

54
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:30,050
of controls than simply routing decisions, and we'll talk about the range

55
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:33,130
of control that SDN controllers enable

56
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:35,520
in today's networks, throughout this lesson.
