1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:04,310
In this session, we're going to talk
about operators, symbols like plus and

2
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:04,910
minus.

3
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:08,210
Some of the same symbols you may
have used before in math class.

4
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:09,960
We're also going to
talk about expressions,

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,570
which make use of operators.

6
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:14,720
Expressions are statements that
can be reduced to a single value.

7
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:16,079
This session should be a fun one.

8
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:16,950
So let's get started.
