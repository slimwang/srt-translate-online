00:00:00,215 --> 00:00:02,400
>> Hey, there and welcome to the course.

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:03,570
I'm Jessica Olman.

3
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:04,950
>> And I'm Cameron Pittman.

4
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:07,120
We're going to be your instructors for this course.

5
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,244
>> Now, you're probably wondering why this course is

6
00:00:10,244 --> 00:00:13,021
called Not Your Typical Intro to HTML and CSS.

7
00:00:13,021 --> 00:00:15,793
That's because we're not going to show you how to

8
00:00:15,793 --> 00:00:18,713
make a web page with a title and some body to start.

9
00:00:18,713 --> 00:00:21,471
Instead, we're going to show you a methodical way of

10
00:00:21,471 --> 00:00:25,460
breaking down a current web page and recreating it for your own purposes.

11
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:30,326
>> Hm, you know, HTML and CSS develop and change over time.

12
00:00:30,326 --> 00:00:32,820
But the underlying principles will always remain the same.

13
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,319
Once you get a hang of those,

14
00:00:34,319 --> 00:00:37,704
learning the specific techniques is going to become a lot easier.

15
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:41,773
In the first lesson, you'll learn how to look at a basic design mockup and

16
00:00:41,773 --> 00:00:44,810
translate it to HTML and CSS to create a basic web page.

17
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:48,760
>> And in the second lesson, you'll develop a CSS framework,

18
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:52,566
which will help you make websites much faster and easier.

19
00:00:52,566 --> 00:00:56,154
Along the way, you'll learn about responsive design, which is a principle that

20
00:00:56,154 --> 00:00:59,700
will help you reach people on any device that they're using to see your website.

21
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:03,775
In the last lesson, you'll be taking on a professional framework.

22
00:01:03,775 --> 00:01:07,417
You'll be building a static website using Twitter's Bootstrap framework,

23
00:01:07,417 --> 00:01:11,000
which is what professionals use in the field every day.

24
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,880
>> Now, this course is just the beginning of your journey to

25
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:16,600
become a front-end web developer.

26
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:20,723
Here you'll build the foundations of your own online portfolio.

27
00:01:20,723 --> 00:01:22,630
>> We are really excited to have you.

28
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:24,610
So, welcome to class and let's get started
