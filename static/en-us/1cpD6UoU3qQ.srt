1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,390
Now remember that
the string data type here

2
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:06,630
is just the data type of the constants,
and not the type

3
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:10,320
of these individual attributes
that are stored in the columns.

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,780
Also I explicitly stated where
this ID variable came from

5
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:16,390
by writing it out here.

6
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:18,870
So it came from our base columns class.

7
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:21,420
So remember in the exercise
instructions, I mentioned,

8
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:25,220
we should also include here any
constants related to the pets table.

9
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:28,080
And the ones we need
are the gender constants.

10
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,430
So let me write out what the constants
will look like when defined

11
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:32,130
in our contract here.

12
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:33,240
All right, so

13
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:36,665
I've set up that the gender unknown
constant is set to the value 0.

14
00:00:36,665 --> 00:00:41,970
GENDER_MALE constant set to 1,
GENDER_FEMALE is set to the value 2.

15
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:46,200
And because these constants deal
with the data in our pets table,

16
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,850
we could keep them inside
our PetEntry class.

17
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:50,120
So now that we have these constants for

18
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:54,830
genders, we can use them in our editor
activity inside the if statement here,

19
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:57,410
where we allow the spinner selection for
gender.

20
00:00:57,410 --> 00:00:59,520
So I'm going to replace these values.

21
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,650
So replace 1 with the constant for
GENDER_MALE,

22
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:08,630
replace 2 with
the GENDER_FEMALE constant, and

23
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:11,910
replace unknown with our
GENDER_UNKNOWN constant.

24
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:16,380
So since we're using well named
constants here instead of just numbers,

25
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:18,310
our code is a lot easier to read.

26
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:23,390
So if the user selected, say female,
then we would see that nGender is set to

27
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:27,750
the GENDER_FEMALE constant, instead
of just 2 which would be unclear.

28
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:30,030
So one more thing to
help with readability.

29
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:35,320
Notice here that all these constants
come from pet contract .PetEntry.

30
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:39,890
Well, to remove the redundancy of
having to say PetContract every time,

31
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:44,060
we can actually import
from PetContract.PetEntry.

32
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:46,550
So notice up here in
our import statement,

33
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:51,090
Android Studio has helped us by pulling
in the import statement for PetContract.

34
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:54,900
But we can make it even more specific,
by adding in PetEntry.

35
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:57,960
So this means we can remove
this call to PetContract here.

36
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:03,070
And this is because Android Studio knows
to go one step into the PetContract,

37
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:07,380
into PetEntry, and
knows where to retrieve these constants.

38
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:09,479
All right, so
that pretty much sums it up.

39
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:11,750
So to finish it up,
let's answer these questions.

40
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:17,670
So first off, we made five constants for
our five different columns.

41
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:20,320
ID, name, breed, weight, and gender.

42
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:24,520
We also made a single entry
class because there's

43
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,710
a single table on
the database right now.

44
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:29,090
The table, remember, is the pet's table.

45
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:31,290
So our last couple of
questions about gender.

46
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:35,683
We'll have three constants used for
gender.

47
00:02:35,683 --> 00:02:38,930
And those gender constants
would be of type integer.

48
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:45,220
And finally, we will need to
update our EditorActivity so

49
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:46,630
that we can use those constants.
