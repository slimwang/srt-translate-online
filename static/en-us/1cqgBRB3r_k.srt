1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:04,830
First we calculate the slope of
our line using the slope function.

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:07,688
In this case the slope is 0.1817.

3
00:00:07,688 --> 00:00:08,880
Meaning that for

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:14,850
each additional employee at a client we
will receive 0.1817 additional tickets.

5
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:18,540
Second, we calculate the y-intercept
point, using the intercept function.

6
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:23,520
Giving us a value of -7.546.

7
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:28,485
And lastly, we calculate
the coefficient of determination or

8
00:00:28,485 --> 00:00:30,740
r-squared using the RSQ function.

9
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:36,370
Resulting in an r-squared
value of 0.7862.

10
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:42,023
In addition, let's quickly generate
a scatter plot with a trend line and

11
00:00:42,023 --> 00:00:43,150
r-squared.

12
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:47,413
Using Google Sheets we
calculated the linear

13
00:00:47,413 --> 00:00:52,126
equation to be y = 0.1817x- 7.546,

14
00:00:52,126 --> 00:00:56,295
with an r-squared value of 0.7862.

15
00:00:56,295 --> 00:01:01,967
For a new client with 525 employees,
we could expect 0.1817

16
00:01:01,967 --> 00:01:06,689
x 525- 7.546, or 87.86 tickets per week.

17
00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:12,772
Which is approximates to
around 88 tickets per week.

18
00:01:12,772 --> 00:01:17,440
The r-squared value is not as
good as in the prior example, and

19
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:21,080
you can see by looking at the plot that
the points are a bit more scattered.
