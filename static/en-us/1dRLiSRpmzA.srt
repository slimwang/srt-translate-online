00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:05,220
For a, we'll get this expression. Great work if you got that one correct. We can

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:10,914
do this problem by cross multiplying. So, we'll have negative 7 times 2a minus

3
00:00:10,914 --> 00:00:15,826
3, and 6 times 2a times b. Cross multiplying is really true, though, because

4
00:00:15,826 --> 00:00:19,971
we're multiplying both sides by the least common denominator, negative 42. It

5
00:00:19,971 --> 00:00:24,992
would be the product of these two numbers. We know negative 42 divided by 6

6
00:00:24,992 --> 00:00:30,552
equals negative 7. So we're really left with a negative 7 in our numerator, and

7
00:00:30,552 --> 00:00:35,572
we multiply it by 2a minus 3. Something similar happens on the right, negative

8
00:00:35,572 --> 00:00:40,726
42 divided by negative 7 is 6. So we're left with 12ab. Next we need to

9
00:00:40,726 --> 00:00:46,308
distribute this negative 7 to each of these terms. So we'll have negative 14a,

10
00:00:46,308 --> 00:00:51,338
plus 21 equals 12ab. Remember what we're doing here, we're solving for a, so

11
00:00:51,338 --> 00:00:55,637
let's get this a term over to the right side, so we have two a terms together.

12
00:00:55,638 --> 00:01:00,335
We add 14a to both sides to get this equation. These terms both share an a,

13
00:01:00,335 --> 00:01:05,512
which is what we are solving for. So we factor the a out, leaving us with 12b

14
00:01:05,512 --> 00:01:11,872
times 14. Finally, we divide both sides by this expression to solve for 1a.

15
00:01:11,872 --> 00:01:18,558
These two factors reduce to 1, leaving us with a equals 21 divided by 12b plus

16
00:01:18,558 --> 00:01:18,929
14.
