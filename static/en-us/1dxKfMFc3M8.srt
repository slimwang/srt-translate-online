1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
And the answer to the question is that

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
the first four apply, but not the fifth.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Let's go through those.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
With library privilege '1'

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
you can borrow books.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
You will use the privledge

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
but you'll get it back. You won't consume it.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
And you can do this for the first book,

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
the Zweben book,

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
and the second book, the Nau book,

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
in which case, you now have both books.

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
And then you go and study those books.

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
They are about the correct topic,

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
and finally, you know what's going on.

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
You won't even need the 50 dollars.

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
With library privledge '2' you can do the same, which is even better

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
than library privledge '1'.

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
And again, library privilege '1' is sufficient.

19
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
You won't need any money

20
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
to do what you're out to do.

21
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Now without library privileges,

22
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
you can try to buy a book, but

23
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
40 bucks is not enough to buy the book.

24
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
It costs you 50 dollars.

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
So the only way to do this is to watch videos.

26
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
It turns out there's a video about planning

27
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
and a video about scheduling

28
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
in the initial state.

29
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Both can be watched

30
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
using a bandwidth of '2.5'.

31
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
And you have a bandwidth of '3' over here.

32
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
So by doing both,

33
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
and by observing that you don't consume the bandwidth, it still stays with you,

34
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
you can watch them. And as a result,

35
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
you know about planning and scheduling.

36
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
The only thing that fails is the last one.

37
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
With 95 dollars, you can buy one book

38
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
but not two.

39
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
With one book, you can go and buy it,

40
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
you own it, you have the book.

41
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
And then you can study the book,

42
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
and be knowledgeable about a specific topic.

43
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
But it's not enough to buy two books.

44
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Bandwidth '2' is not sufficient to watch a video.

45
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
So this action over here, won't get you there.

46
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
So what you'll find in the last case, E,

47
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
is that the dollar amount

48
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
and the bandwidth is insufficient

49
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
to make you knowledgeable about

50
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
planning and scheduling at the same time.

51
00:01:59,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So it's the only case that fails.
