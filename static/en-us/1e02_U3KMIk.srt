1
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:06,020
Sunshine was a relatively complex app
in terms of integration points because

2
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:11,340
a successful outcome relied on
both user and server input.

3
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:15,720
We did a great job dealing with
certain aspects of that wide range.

4
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:19,780
The first thing we did was using a
SyncAdapter to load data from the server

5
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:21,120
in the background,

6
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:24,570
we never see partially loaded
data because of this choice.

7
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:29,020
It keeps our data relatively efficient,
and it makes efficient use of battery.

8
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:31,490
Even if we have not opened
the app in a while,

9
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:34,070
the data is being updated
behind the scenes.

10
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:37,050
The second thing we did well
was caching our data locally.

11
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:40,160
This is why being offline is only
critical when first starting

12
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,430
the application or
changing the location.

13
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:46,780
Caching keeps our data still accessible
when the user's not connected

14
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:48,230
to the Internet.

15
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:51,060
Without this, our weather app
would display a blank screen

16
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:54,010
any time your device went
through a patch without service.

17
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:54,950
And that, would be terrible.
