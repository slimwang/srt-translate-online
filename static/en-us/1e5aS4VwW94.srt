1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,250
Even as basic a thing as flipping a device

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:06,170
from portrait to landscape orientation might change the best interface

3
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:09,200
pretty dramatically. Like this audio recorder I wrote, where

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,580
the best way to lay out the interface changes in

5
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:15,440
landscape mode. This isn't just reflow and percentage sizes.

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,890
I needed to change some more dramatic styling to make

7
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:21,660
this interface work well. In today's landscape, you should really

8
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:24,910
think of your designs in terms of three main scenarios.

9
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:28,700
Phone, tablet, and desktop. This may share some

10
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:32,420
design characteristics of course, and they'll certainly share data,

11
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:35,170
but you should consider the optimal experience for each

12
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:38,230
of these scenarios separately as you build your design.
