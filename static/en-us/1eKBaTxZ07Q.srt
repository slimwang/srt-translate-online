As computer scientists, one of the most

00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:06,471
powerful tools that's available to us, is

4
00:00:06,471 --> 00:00:11,990
the concept of an abstraction. And by an abstraction, we mean a well understood

interface, that hides all the details within a subsystem. Let's see how, in a

6
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:21,370
computer system, the hierarchy of abstractions works,

7
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:24,630
and where operating system fits, within this hierarchy.
