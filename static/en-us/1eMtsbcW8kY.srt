1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,094
Since we're subtracting two logs right here,

2
00:00:03,094 --> 00:00:04,451
and they have the same base,

3
00:00:04,451 --> 00:00:08,846
the quotient property tells us we can combine them
into one log expression,

4
00:00:08,846 --> 00:00:12,623
by dividing them as the input of one log.

5
00:00:12,623 --> 00:00:18,619
So having started out with 3 natural log of (x+4) minus the natural log of 5

6
00:00:18,619 --> 00:00:22,935
we've ended up with this simpler, more compact thing--

7
00:00:22,935 --> 00:00:26,935
natural log of (x+4) cubed, divided by 5.
