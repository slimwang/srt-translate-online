00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,674
Well, we can convert a slope-intercept form and do it that way. I have negative

2
00:00:04,674 --> 00:00:09,203
5y in the left and negative 7x plus 3 on the right. Remember, I can't combine

3
00:00:09,203 --> 00:00:13,878
these because this doesn't have an x, these are not like terms. Next we divide

4
00:00:13,878 --> 00:00:19,062
every term by negative 5 to get y equals 7 5ths x plus negative 3 5ths.. I have

5
00:00:19,062 --> 00:00:23,060
a minus sign here, so I know the second term is really just a negative. Our

6
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:27,263
equation is in slope-intercept form, so our slope must be 7 5ths. Well done if

7
00:00:27,263 --> 00:00:31,355
you got that one. If you thought about it in terms of standard form, you would

8
00:00:31,355 --> 00:00:36,131
have done negative A divided by B. You want to be really careful though. This is

9
00:00:36,131 --> 00:00:40,777
not in standard form. We need to write it in standard form first. The x term

10
00:00:40,777 --> 00:00:45,428
should come first. I can switch the place of the 7x and the negative 5y and I

11
00:00:45,428 --> 00:00:49,985
get this equation. Notice, the 7x is still positive and the 5y is still

12
00:00:49,985 --> 00:00:54,660
negative. So A is positive 7 and B is negative 5. A negative divided by a

13
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:59,355
negative makes a positive, so I get 7 5ths, still the correct answer.
