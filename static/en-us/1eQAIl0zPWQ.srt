1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,469
So, let's look at that
a little bit more carefully.

2
00:00:02,469 --> 00:00:04,910
Left camera is basically
giving me these equations,

3
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:07,090
right camera is giving me this equation.

4
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:11,050
Looking into the from that image we
looked at, I have Xl and Xr here.

5
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:15,140
That was just showing you the image
itself and, of course, Yr and

6
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:16,660
Yl are the same.

7
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:17,777
Let's now come up with a new term here.

8
00:00:17,777 --> 00:00:19,564
We'll call this d for disparity.

9
00:00:19,564 --> 00:00:23,933
And, that's the distance
between point Xr and Xl.

10
00:00:23,933 --> 00:00:28,893
D, basically, is difference between Xr,
Xl and Xr, the two positions in

11
00:00:28,893 --> 00:00:34,710
the left view and the right view, which
are now projected on the same view here.

12
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:37,529
So, in essence,
d now because basically becomes f

13
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:44,050
X over Z minus f X minus Tx over
Z from these two equations here.

14
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:49,170
And now, of course, by doing simple
you know, math on this kind of stuff,

15
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:52,480
f X over Z would actually
subtract each other.

16
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:57,160
This would become a plus sign and
actually the disparity d would just be f

17
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:00,780
Tx, that is the translation
of the camera, for

18
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:03,620
when we point to the other,
divided by Z.

19
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:06,580
Of course, now,
we can do something interesting here and

20
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:07,870
now we can use this.

21
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:10,230
If we know the disparity, right,

22
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:14,020
if we know the disparity,
we can now actually compute that.

23
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:18,110
That, in essence,
is the important cri, equation.

24
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:18,940
This, in essence,

25
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:22,990
is the important equation of
computing depth from two viewpoints.

26
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:26,420
Of course, if you recall,
this is baseline.

27
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:27,868
This is depth.
This is disparity,

28
00:01:27,868 --> 00:01:29,614
which we've been looking at.

29
00:01:29,614 --> 00:01:32,060
F is focal length.

30
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:34,830
Of course, that mean I need to
know the focal length of a camera.
