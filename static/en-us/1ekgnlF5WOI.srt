00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:01,430
So far in this course,

2
00:00:01,430 --> 00:00:04,150
you've learned quite a lot about
how the network functions.

3
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:07,810
We've gone from HTTP down through
TCP ports, domain names, and

4
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:11,160
the binary values used to write
addresses and port numbers.

5
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,970
But the rabbit hole goes deeper.

6
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:16,030
In this lesson, we'll look at
IP network blocks, routers, and

7
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:17,610
network address translation.

8
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:21,600
Some things that many Internet users use
every day usually without even noticing,

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,410
but soon you'll notice
them all the time.
