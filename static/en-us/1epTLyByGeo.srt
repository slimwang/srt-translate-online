1
00:00:00,117 --> 00:00:02,675
Four of these operators are both binary and associative--

2
00:00:02,675 --> 00:00:09,856
multiply, minimum, logical or, bitwise and. Factorial is not binary.

3
00:00:09,856 --> 00:00:13,424
It only has 1 argument and it needs 2 arguments to be binary.

4
00:00:13,424 --> 00:00:17,029
And both exponentiation and division are not associative.

5
00:00:17,029 --> 00:00:20,095
So if you want to prove that to yourself, note that, say,

6
00:00:20,095 --> 00:00:26,056
(4^3)^2 is not equal to 4(3^2)

7
00:00:26,056 --> 00:00:35,714
or that 8/(4/2) is not equal to (8 /4)/2.
