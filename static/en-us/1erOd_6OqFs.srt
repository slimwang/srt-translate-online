00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:05,440
Traffic sources can be classified in a number of ways. Data traffic might be

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:08,550
bursty. It might be weakly periodic, or

3
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:11,500
it might also be regular. Audio traffic is

4
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:16,470
typically continuous and strongly periodic. Video traffic

5
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:19,450
is continuous, but it's often bursty, due to

6
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:25,190
the nature of how video is often compressed, as we saw in a previous lecture.

7
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:27,800
And it may also be periodic. Typically, we

8
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,930
think of taking these sources and classifying them

9
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:38,030
into two kinds of traffic. One is a constant bit rate source or a CBR source. In

10
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:41,050
a constant bit rate source of traffic, traffic

11
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:45,040
arrives at regular intervals, and packets are typically the

12
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:47,650
same size as they arrive, resulting in a

13
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:50,640
constant bit rate of arrival. Audio is an example

14
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,010
of a constant bit rate source. Many other

15
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:56,690
sources of traffic are variable bit rate or VBR.

16
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:59,830
Video and data are often variable bit rate.

17
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:03,540
Typically when we shape CBR traffic, we shape it

18
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:06,300
according to a peak rate. Variable bit rate

19
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:10,480
traffic is shaped according to both an average rate,

20
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:13,170
and a peak rate. Where the average rate, might

21
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:16,540
actually be a small fraction of the peak rate.

22
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:22,090
You can see, that at certain times, the peak rate, might well exceed the average

23
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:25,180
rate. Let's now talk about how to perform

24
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:27,050
traffic shaping in a number of different ways.
