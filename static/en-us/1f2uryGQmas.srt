Okay, let's see how you answered. These two questions were actually a technique

2
00:00:05,269 --> 00:00:10,051
that's called the door-in-the-face technique. Here, a person will ask for a

3
00:00:10,051 --> 00:00:14,339
larger request that is most likely a bit over the top, and then when the result

4
00:00:14,339 --> 00:00:19,886
is no, they ask for a smaller request. Here's an example I experienced

5
00:00:19,886 --> 00:00:24,168
personally. When I was in graduate school and on a limited budget, I received a

6
00:00:24,168 --> 00:00:27,588
phone call from a firefighter's association looking to raise money for

7
00:00:27,588 --> 00:00:32,800
firefighters and their families. I was a big supporter of the firefighters.

8
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:37,418
However, the person asked if I could donate $100. And I actually did not have

9
00:00:37,418 --> 00:00:42,507
$100 available to donate. And I told them sorry, that that was too much. And

10
00:00:42,507 --> 00:00:48,302
immediately the person said, oh well, can you perhaps give $15? And right away

11
00:00:48,302 --> 00:00:51,882
I said sure, I can give $15. And the idea here again is that this was a

12
00:00:51,882 --> 00:00:56,850
technique called the door-in-the-face, and it's actually quite effective.

13
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:01,205
Asking for something that is large and maybe not typical, a person's likely to

14
00:01:01,205 --> 00:01:06,290
say no. When you followup with a more reasonable request, a person is typically

15
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:10,860
more likely to respond positively. Can you think of any personal experiences

16
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:15,016
with these two techniques that we discussed? Perhaps you can share them on the

17
00:01:15,016 --> 00:01:15,669
forum.
