00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:03,280
Think about an object, just any object.

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:06,420
What part of it takes up
the most space in memory?

3
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:08,240
The inside.

4
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:13,130
It's all the properties it
carries that consume memory.

5
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:17,110
Is there a way to reduce the amount
of memory an object requires?

6
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:19,140
Yes, by emptying it.

7
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:22,220
Core data objects can
actually be emptied

8
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:26,790
as their properties aren't saved inside
the object, but in a database file.

9
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:29,910
And that's exactly what core data does.

10
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:32,960
Every core data object starts empty.

11
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,540
That's called a fault.

12
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:39,420
Whenever the user asks for the contents
of a certain property, that's when core

13
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:45,550
data fetch the value from the database,
and it becomes a regular object.

14
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:47,790
It's just like those old sea monkey ads.

15
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:49,370
Just add water.

16
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:51,950
Later on, if that value goes unused for

17
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:56,410
a certain time, the object becomes
emptied again and becomes a fault.

18
00:00:56,410 --> 00:01:01,160
This is how core data helps keep your
memory footprint as low as possible and

19
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:04,040
without any intervention on your part.

20
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:08,180
This is absolutely vital in
an environment with limited memory,

21
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:09,540
such as an iOS device.
