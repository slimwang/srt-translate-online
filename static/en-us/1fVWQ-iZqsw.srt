[Probabilistic Interference]

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
[Male] Welcome back. In the previous unit, we went over the basics

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:12,000
of probability theory and saw how

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
a Bayes network could concisely represent a joint probability distribution,

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:24,000
including the representation of independence between the variables.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
In this unit, we will see how to do probabilistic inference.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
That is, how to answer probability questions using Bayes nets.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Let's put up a simple Bayes net.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
We'll use the familiar example of the earthquake

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
where we can have a burglary or an earthquake

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
setting off an alarm, and if the alarm goes off,

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
either John or Mary might call.

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Now, what kinds of questions can we ask to do inference about?

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The simplest type of question is the same question we ask

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
with an ordinary subroutine or function in a programming language.

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Namely, given some inputs, what are the outputs?

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
So, in this case, we could say given the inputs of B and E,

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
what are the outputs, J and M?

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Rather than call them input and output variables,

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:36,000
in probabilistic inference, we'll call them evidence and query variables.

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
That is, the variables that we know the values of are the evidence,

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
and the ones that we want to find out the values of are the query variables.

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Anything that is neither evidence nor query is known as a hidden variable.

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
That is, we won't tell you what its value is.

25
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
We won't figure out what its value is and report it,

26
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
but we'll have to compute with it internally.

27
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
And now furthermore, in probabilistic inference,

28
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
the output is not a single number for each of the query variables,

29
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
but rather, it's a probability distribution.

30
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
So, the answer is going to be a complete, joint probability distribution

31
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
over the query variables.

32
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
We call this the posterior distribution, given the evidence,

33
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
and we can write it like this.

34
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:34,000
It's the probability distribution of one or more query variables

35
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
given the values of the evidence variables.

36
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
And there can be zero or more evidence variables,

37
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
and each of them are given an exact value.

38
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,000
And that's the computation we want to come up with.

39
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
There's another question we can ask.

40
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Which is the most likely explanation?

41
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
That is, out of all the possible values for all the query variables,

42
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
which combination of values has the highest probability?

43
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
We write the formula like this, asking which Q values

44
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
are maxable given the evidence values.

45
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Now, in an ordinary programming language, each function goes only one way.

46
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
It has input variables, does some computation,

47
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
and comes up with a result variable or result variables.

48
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
One great thing about Bayes nets is that we're not restricted

49
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
to going only in one direction.

50
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
We could go in the causal direction, giving as evidence

51
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:47,000
the route nodes of the tree and asking as query values the nodes at the bottom.

52
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Or, we could reverse that causal flow.

53
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
For example, we could have J and M be the evidence variables

54
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
and B and E be the query variables,

55
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
or we could have any other combination.

56
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
For example, we could have M be the evidence variable

57
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:11,000
and J and B be the query variables.

58
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Here's a question for you.

59
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Imagine the situation where Mary has called to report that the alarm is going off,

60
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
and we want to know whether or not there has been a burglary.

61
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
For each of the nodes, click on the circle to tell us

62
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,000
if the node is an evidence node, a hidden node,

63
00:04:32,000 --> 99:59:59,999
or a query node.
