1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,320
So, these three rules here, you might be thinking, okay, come on we're in the last unit.

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:08,290
Why are we even discussing this? The thing is this.

3
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:10,730
When we talk about problems that no computer can solve,

4
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:14,950
I do not want to be talking about these problems here, beauty of a painting,

5
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:17,140
or predicting soccer matches or forecasting the lottery.

6
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:21,720
I want to talk about problems that meet these three requirements here

7
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:24,070
and while we can still prove that no computer will be able to solve them

8
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:27,960
although these requirements here might sound very simple at first,

9
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:32,900
its easy to miss some of the details here, which is of course why we're now going to have our first quiz.

10
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:35,090
I'm going to give you a number of problems and I want you to tell me

11
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:39,980
if this is a computer problem according to these three rules here

12
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:42,850
or if we would not consider this as a computer problem.

13
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:44,670
And you have to be very careful here.

14
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:48,870
So, some of them are a little bit tricky, but then again you're already in the final unit.

15
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:50,910
So, you've learned how to deal with tricky questions by now, I hope.

16
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:55,040
So, here are eight problems for which I would like you to determine

17
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:57,380
if they are computer problems according to these rules here.

18
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:01,760
And again, some of them are bit tricky so you have to be really, really careful in checking it.

19
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,950
The first three problems, given an essay written by his student.

20
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:08,930
First problems, does that essay have at least 10,000 characters

21
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:12,680
Second question, which grade does this essay deserve

22
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:15,700
And third question, does the essay contain any misspelled words.

23
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:18,620
A second set of potential computer problem would be the following here.

24
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:23,950
Given two integers larger than zero, what is the sum of these two numbers?

25
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:28,190
Second potential problem, does the smaller integer divide the larger one

26
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:31,120
So is it a factor of the larger one so to say.

27
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:36,180
Third question, given those two integers, please output a random integer between these two.

28
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:37,589
So, between the smaller one and the larger one.

29
00:01:37,589 --> 00:01:39,970
And finally, I have two more problems for you to check.

30
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:45,770
One problem is given the string of zeros and ones, check if that string is randomly generated

31
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:48,490
and finally, calculate the square root of 5.

32
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:53,770
So, please for each of these problems, if you think that this is a computer problem

33
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:57,389
according to these three rules here then make a check mark,otherwise, leave the box blank.

34
00:01:57,389 --> 00:02:01,430
Again, some of them are a little tricky so you need to check carefully

35
00:02:01,430 --> 99:59:59,999
and if you get stuck then of course you can also skip to the answer, give this some thought first.
