1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:02,630
We'll use story understanding,

2
00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:05,860
To examine the general
processes of understanding.

3
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:08,660
Here are two stories that we
have encountered earlier.

4
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:14,050
The first story is talking about the
earthquake that hit lower Slabovia and

5
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:14,890
caused some damage.

6
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:18,650
The second story is talking about the
President of lower Slabovia who killed

7
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:20,470
a number of proposals.

8
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:22,030
Both of them deal with killing.

9
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:25,030
But the meaning of the two
stories are very, very different.

10
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:28,630
Humans make use of stories to
understand the world around them.

11
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:32,600
The world offers a very large
amount of data at any given time.

12
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:36,030
We use the stories to provide
structure to that data,

13
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:38,390
to make coherent sense of it.

14
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:40,660
When we discuss these
two stories earlier,

15
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:43,990
using frame as a knowledge
representation language,

16
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:47,650
we found that we could have
a frame of this notion of killing,

17
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:53,100
killing of 25 people, and this notion
of killing, killing of 25 proposals.

18
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:56,960
And there was no simple way in
the frame knowledge representation

19
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,400
to disambiguate between those
two meanings of killing.

20
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:03,140
Now we'll examine how we can construct
a different interpretation of

21
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:06,140
the first story, or
the interpretation of the second story,

22
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:10,540
based on different interpretations of
the word killing in the two stories.

23
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:12,550
In order to make the two
stories simpler, and

24
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:17,480
to illustrate our point, we're going to
focus on one sentence from each story,

25
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:20,030
sentences that contain the word kill.

26
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:21,360
Humans that have lived
through difficulty and

27
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,410
understanding the first sentence means
completely different from the second

28
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:27,250
sentence because the killed in the first
sentence means something completely

29
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:29,230
different from the killed
in the second sentence.

30
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:32,420
How can we build an err program
that can do the same thing?

31
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:36,420
We will see that err program will need
to use a lot of background knowledge in

32
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:39,890
order to be able to do that, and
that would generate hypotheses about

33
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:42,880
how humans might be using that
background knowledge to similarly

34
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,280
disambiguate between different
senses of the word killed.
