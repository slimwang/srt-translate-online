00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,520
Now when I wanted to add touchscreen support to the synthesizer application, I

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:07,000
initially started with touch events. There

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,820
were two challenges, though. First, you'll notice

4
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:13,620
that on the desktop, if I don't have that touch event emulation turned

5
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:17,340
on, it doesn't actually work at all when I use the mouse. [NOISE] Of

6
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:25,980
course, this is expected. But I didn't really want two code

7
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:29,670
paths, one for mouse and one for touch. Secondly, I really

8
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:32,439
wanted to be able to have a drag across the keyboard.

9
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:35,930
Play each note as you slid across it in turn. But with

10
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:39,100
the way touch delivers all the events to the originally touched

11
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:42,060
down element, I would have had to calculate the hit testing

12
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:45,070
myself for these. And that was kind of a pain. I

13
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:48,190
really wanted these touch events to be delivered to the down element

14
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:53,056
for each key. Instead what happens in this synth, is when I hit one key

15
00:00:53,056 --> 00:00:58,870
[SOUND] and then drag, it doesn't actually move where the events are delivered.
