1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:04,375
So let's open the MainActivity.java
file and review what's in here.

2
00:00:04,375 --> 00:00:07,170
So at the top of any Java
file is the package name.

3
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:08,820
It says the word package,

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:11,638
which is a Java keyword
followed by our package name.

5
00:00:11,638 --> 00:00:16,830
Here it's com.example.android.miwok.

6
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:20,280
This is the package name that we
specified in the new project wizard

7
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:23,770
in order to uniquely identify
our app on an Android device.

8
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:26,870
Every app in the Google Play store
has a different package name.

9
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:30,770
All the code for our app will be grouped
together under this package name.

10
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:33,880
So in the quiz A is the package name.

11
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:38,100
So next we have our import statements
and these statements import Java classes

12
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:41,020
that we didn't write, but
can still use in our code.

13
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:44,535
These files belong to other packages of
code in the Android framework which was

14
00:00:44,535 --> 00:00:45,878
written by the Android team.

15
00:00:45,878 --> 00:00:50,633
For example, we're importing
the AppCompactActivity class

16
00:00:50,633 --> 00:00:54,857
from the package called
android.support.v7.ap.

17
00:00:54,857 --> 00:00:57,423
We don't have to worry about
how the internal details of how

18
00:00:57,423 --> 00:00:59,840
the AppCompactActivity or Bundle work.

19
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,690
We can simply take advantage of them for
free in our code.

20
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:04,819
Anytime we want to add
code from other packages,

21
00:01:04,819 --> 00:01:07,110
we need to add more
import statements here.

22
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:10,730
So in the quiz B is
the import statements.

23
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:12,920
So next is a class declaration.

24
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:16,435
So this public class line is
in the class declaration.

25
00:01:16,435 --> 00:01:19,575
It declares that this file contains
the definition of the class

26
00:01:19,575 --> 00:01:21,055
called MainActivity.

27
00:01:21,055 --> 00:01:24,015
It extends from a superclass
called the AppCompatActivity,

28
00:01:24,015 --> 00:01:27,935
which means it inherits all the
behaviors that AppCompatActivity has.

29
00:01:27,935 --> 00:01:31,700
So in terms of showing the window in
the device and showing the app bar.

30
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:35,180
So we can also customize the behavior
by overwriting certain methods.

31
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:39,500
We only modify this class declaration if
we want to change the name of the class

32
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,420
or change where we're inheriting from.

33
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:44,620
And in the quiz,
C is the class declaration.

34
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:47,600
So next is a method override.

35
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,990
So here we are overriding
the onCreate method

36
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:53,390
that was originally defined in
the AppCompatActivity class.

37
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:56,620
As a reminder, this onCreate
method is called by Android

38
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:59,080
when it first creates
an instance of a MainActivity.

39
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,480
So right when you open
up an app on a device.

40
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:05,630
And here we're providing our own steps
for what to do when the app is created.

41
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:08,970
In the quiz, D is the method override.

42
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:10,977
So lastly is the setContentView.

43
00:02:10,977 --> 00:02:15,708
Inside the onCreate method we have
a line that creates the setContentView

44
00:02:15,708 --> 00:02:20,630
method and passes in the activity_main
layout as an input argument.

45
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:24,230
We're telling Android to put the UI
defined in this layout XML file

46
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:25,990
into this activity screen.

47
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:31,159
And lastly in the quiz, E is set content
view to be an XML layout resource.
