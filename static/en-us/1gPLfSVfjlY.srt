00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,370
In this lesson we're going to finish
our implementation of core data and

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:05,100
see how it works its magic.

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:08,280
We'll also look at how our
table knows what to display.

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:12,170
How a user can add a new note, and most
importantly how we actually save and

5
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:13,890
persist these changes.

6
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:17,350
We'll also see the important role core
data plays in memory management, and

7
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:19,800
we may even hear from a few
time traveling friends.
