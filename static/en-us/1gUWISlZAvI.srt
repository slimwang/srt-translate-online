00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,446
Well, let's see if we're right with these assumptions. I calculated the

2
00:00:03,446 --> 00:00:08,770
t-statistic for each one of these also using r. Use these to calculate the p

3
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:14,668
value for each. You can do this with graphpad.com quick calcs. The link is

4
00:00:14,668 --> 00:00:18,274
below. After you get in to quick calcs, you need to choose statistical

5
00:00:18,274 --> 00:00:24,854
distributions and interpreting p value. Then choose calculate p value from z,

6
00:00:24,854 --> 00:00:29,454
t, f, r, or chi-square. You'll learn about chi-squared in the last lesson of

7
00:00:29,454 --> 00:00:34,787
this course. Click Continue, enter the value of r and the degrees of freedom,

8
00:00:34,787 --> 00:00:39,792
then click Compute p. Quick calcs will give the two tailed p value. So eneter

9
00:00:39,792 --> 00:00:44,184
the 2 tailed P relationship here and see if it's less than an alpha level of

10
00:00:44,184 --> 00:00:45,713
0.5
