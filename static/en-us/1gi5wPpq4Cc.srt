00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:03,570
All right. So, person who's adept at manipulating Bayes Nets

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:06,916
would know that this chain rule idea, this probability of X

3
00:00:06,916 --> 00:00:09,000
and Y can be written either as a probability of

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,590
X times the probability of Y given X. Or as the

5
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:14,640
probability of Y times the probability of X given Y,

6
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:18,720
actually correspond to two different networks. So which of these two

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,530
networks corresponds to the fact that the probability of x and

8
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:25,650
y, the joint probability of X and can be written as

9
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:28,600
the probability of Y times the probability of X given Y.

10
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:29,320
>> Go.
