1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,772
To fully understand and appreciate OS internals,

2
00:00:02,772 --> 00:00:05,700
we will supplement the theoretical part of the course material with

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:10,450
a practical component, and that will be a sequence of programming projects.

4
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:11,580
The goal of these projects is to

5
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:14,790
give you a hands-on experience with operating systems.

6
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:18,130
For instance, you will be put face-to-face with challenges related to

7
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:21,320
multithreading, concurrency, and synchronization.

8
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,950
You will have to use operating system services for

9
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:29,260
interaction among multiple processes on a single node, like a server machine.

10
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:31,800
You will also have to look beyond the single node and

11
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:36,590
prototype distributed, or multi-node services, using some of the mechanisms that

12
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:40,820
are supported at the operating system level, like remote procedure calls.

13
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:43,600
Finally, one key issue with operating systems design and

14
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,080
implementation is the performance that they can deliver.

15
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:52,450
You will gain experience with designing and performing experimental evaluations.

16
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:57,020
These experiments will ideally provide you with insight into the behavior of

17
00:00:57,020 --> 00:01:01,720
the operating system so you can better understand its performance capabilities,

18
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:04,459
overheads, limitations, or other issues.

19
00:01:04,459 --> 00:01:07,240
Each of the projects will require you to program in the C

20
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:11,160
programming language in a Linux environment, and you will have to use some of

21
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:14,810
the standard Linux libraries, such as Pthreads, for threads.
