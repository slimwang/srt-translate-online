00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Here's how I did it--makes the function just a little more complicated.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I added a variable called "action" to hold the result of the strategies.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
If it's hold, we hold. If it's roll, we roll.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Otherwise, you lose, which means that the other strategy wins.
