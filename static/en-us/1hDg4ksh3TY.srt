1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,580
So we could that with two imports. We could also do it with just one line

2
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:09,425
listing the two with commas, and we would add this line to test.py. Usually

3
00:00:09,425 --> 00:00:12,690
we'll put the imports at the beginning of the file. If we did this where we

4
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:17,115
actually use things from the imported modules, but we would need to use

5
00:00:17,115 --> 00:00:22,630
crawler.crawl_web instead of just crawl_web here. And instead of ordered search

6
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:27,000
for example, we would need to use search.orderedsearch. If there's a definition

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,120
in a module that we need to use frequently, we might not want to have to type

8
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:33,868
the module name before every time we use it. So there's a way to import names

9
00:00:33,868 --> 00:00:38,538
from a module directly into our name space, and that's to use from. The syntax

10
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:42,568
is from, followed by the module name, import, and then the list of definitions

11
00:00:42,568 --> 00:00:46,358
that we want to import from that module into our name space. So for this

12
00:00:46,358 --> 00:00:00,000
example, we do from crawler import crawl_web, compute_ranks.
