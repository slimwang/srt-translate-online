00:00:00,102 --> 00:00:04,656
Here we have an example of players
paying real money for in game currency.

2
00:00:04,656 --> 00:00:10,637
$0.99 cents will get you 3000 of gold,
$4.99 gets you 18, 000, and

3
00:00:10,637 --> 00:00:15,841
so on, and you can see this bonus listed
underneath the higher priced items.

4
00:00:15,841 --> 00:00:19,149
And this is a great example
of being clear about value.

5
00:00:19,149 --> 00:00:23,056
The bonus markers make it obvious
that there's a specific benefit for

6
00:00:23,056 --> 00:00:26,113
buying different,
higher priced items in the store.

7
00:00:26,113 --> 00:00:28,363
And the user doesn't
have to do any math.

8
00:00:28,363 --> 00:00:33,020
For example, I already know that
the $4.99 option compared to the $0.99

9
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:37,008
one will give me 20% more gold than
I would have gotten, had I gone for

10
00:00:37,008 --> 00:00:38,229
the cheaper option.

11
00:00:38,229 --> 00:00:40,538
The store layout is also very clear.

12
00:00:40,538 --> 00:00:44,590
They're only selling one item,
gold, the in game currency.

13
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:47,276
So, the store isn't crowded
with too many options.

14
00:00:47,276 --> 00:00:50,968
Let's look at another example of
a store that could be improved.

15
00:00:50,968 --> 00:00:52,354
It has a good layout, but

16
00:00:52,354 --> 00:00:55,984
I'm not immediately sure why I
should buy a higher priced item and

17
00:00:55,984 --> 00:00:59,094
the store is mixing in game currency and
items for sale?

18
00:00:59,094 --> 00:01:00,615
There's too much variety.

19
00:01:00,615 --> 00:01:04,717
This example is not as clear as our last
one, and I would be less likely to buy

20
00:01:04,717 --> 00:01:07,991
higher priced items, or
really, anything in this store.

21
00:01:07,991 --> 00:01:12,223
So make sure to show what kind of value
a player will be getting by buying your

22
00:01:12,223 --> 00:01:13,171
in-app items.

23
00:01:13,171 --> 00:01:15,456
It's important to have a nice layout,
and

24
00:01:15,456 --> 00:01:17,620
most importantly be clear about value.
