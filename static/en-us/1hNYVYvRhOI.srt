1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,380
Let's continue coding 
our content provider.

2
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:06,250
query() will be the most complex 
of the required content provider methods.

3
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:09,730
We begin with the bones 
of the query() operation.

4
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:15,080
We use our sURIMatcher object
once again to switch on the type of URI.

5
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:17,969
This is the only function 
where we will have to fill out

6
00:00:17,969 --> 00:00:20,890
every type of URI in the content provider,

7
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:23,480
as several of them are used
for querying only.

8
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,200
We'll implement the basic 
Weather query first.

9
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:28,770
For this query,

10
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:31,853
we just pass through 
all of the parameters to the database.

11
00:00:31,853 --> 00:00:33,196
Pretty simple stuff.

12
00:00:33,196 --> 00:00:35,770
Let's fix these parameters 
so they make some sense.

13
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:38,216
"strings" here is actually a projection;

14
00:00:38,216 --> 00:00:40,192
S is a selection,

15
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:42,870
the next array is selectionArgs.

16
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:44,756
And the last string is sort order.

17
00:00:44,756 --> 00:00:46,852
That matches a lot better.

18
00:00:46,852 --> 00:00:48,530
At the bottom of the function,

19
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:51,853
we're going to set the NotificationURI
for our cursor

20
00:00:51,853 --> 00:00:54,546
to the one that was passed
into the function.

21
00:00:54,546 --> 00:00:58,360
This causes the cursor
to register a content observer

22
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:03,470
to watch for changes that happen
to that URI and any of its descendents.

23
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:08,580
By descendants, I mean any URI
that begins with this path.

24
00:01:08,883 --> 00:01:10,762
But, we still need to test this.
