1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,083
So, I did mention something in
the last slide about rolling shutter.

2
00:00:03,083 --> 00:00:06,427
Before we go there,
remember that in a CCD versus CMOS,

3
00:00:06,427 --> 00:00:10,483
there's two different things we
talked about when we looked at

4
00:00:10,483 --> 00:00:14,930
the camera inside of the camera
in one of our earlier lectures.

5
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:19,168
In a CCD, all of the photosites,
which are these color chan,

6
00:00:19,168 --> 00:00:20,542
color sensors here.

7
00:00:20,542 --> 00:00:22,216
Give basic information and

8
00:00:22,216 --> 00:00:26,670
they're kind of then read into
an amplifier after at the end.

9
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:30,683
In CMOS, the complement the
complementary metal oxide semiconductor,

10
00:00:30,683 --> 00:00:33,357
what they do is they actually
take the photosites and

11
00:00:33,357 --> 00:00:35,875
they put the amplifier
right at the photosites.

12
00:00:35,875 --> 00:00:39,291
For example, in this pipeline,
what would happen is basically,

13
00:00:39,291 --> 00:00:41,487
all of the information
would be read off and

14
00:00:41,487 --> 00:00:45,583
the amplification would happen after
things are read off from the photosites.

15
00:00:45,583 --> 00:00:48,947
But in CMOS, what happens really is
there's an amplifier in each and

16
00:00:48,947 --> 00:00:49,875
every photosite.

17
00:00:49,875 --> 00:00:54,587
So, it actually does a little bit more
work to read out the information and

18
00:00:54,587 --> 00:00:58,540
it force all distributed at
the location of the sensory cell.

19
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:01,375
Now, of course,
CMOS sensors are cheaper.

20
00:01:01,375 --> 00:01:04,917
They can also be better than CCD
sensors in many different ways.

21
00:01:04,917 --> 00:01:09,165
But when ha, what happens is when you
start putting these types of CMOS

22
00:01:09,165 --> 00:01:13,414
sensors on in smaller bodies and
cellphones and stuff like that,

23
00:01:13,414 --> 00:01:18,930
they don't actually have a very good
refresh rate as things are scanned.

24
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:23,601
For example, this is a video from
a simple, handheld cellphone camera and

25
00:01:23,601 --> 00:01:25,917
you'll notice an interesting thing.

26
00:01:25,917 --> 00:01:29,458
It seems like the whole
scene is nonrigid.

27
00:01:29,458 --> 00:01:32,254
For example, if you look at it,

28
00:01:32,254 --> 00:01:37,545
this pillar here seems to be
nonrigid as it's warping.

29
00:01:37,545 --> 00:01:40,917
And if you look at any of the lines,
they don't remain straight anymore.

30
00:01:40,917 --> 00:01:43,812
You saw that a little bit in
the other video I just showed you

31
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:45,590
with the trucks and stuff like that.

32
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:48,596
But this is much more easier to see
now the fact that there is nonrigid

33
00:01:48,596 --> 00:01:49,668
deformation going on.

34
00:01:49,668 --> 00:01:52,032
Of course,
this is because of rolling shutter,

35
00:01:52,032 --> 00:01:53,542
I will talk about that in a bit.

36
00:01:53,542 --> 00:01:57,463
Let me actually show you how we can
take the original video like this, with

37
00:01:57,463 --> 00:02:01,829
rolling shutter and now using techniques
like the one I've talked about with more

38
00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:05,833
modifications, allow us to generate
a video that looks much more stable.

39
00:02:05,833 --> 00:02:10,333
Again, original video, this was
deliberately shaken, handheld camera.

40
00:02:10,333 --> 00:02:13,263
And if you don't believe it,
that this is video,

41
00:02:13,263 --> 00:02:16,208
you can actually see the person
going up on the bridge.

42
00:02:16,208 --> 00:02:20,381
This is completely stabilized,
what we've done basically is model this

43
00:02:20,381 --> 00:02:23,220
motion and then removed it and
we synthesized it.
