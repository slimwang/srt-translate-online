00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,309
We are one step closer now, to getting this function in its fully factored

2
00:00:03,309 --> 00:00:08,482
form. Now, we know two of its linear factors. We already found x. And now, we

3
00:00:08,482 --> 00:00:13,248
also know that 2x minus 1 is a linear factor. The next thing for us to do then,

4
00:00:13,248 --> 00:00:16,481
is figure out what's left over if we pull out a factor of 2x minus 1 from this

5
00:00:16,481 --> 00:00:22,301
part of the expression. So, how do we do that? Well, we need to divide this

6
00:00:22,301 --> 00:00:27,942
expression inside the parentheses by 2x minus 1. Please use long divinsion to

7
00:00:27,942 --> 00:00:34,542
divide 2x cubed minus 13x squared plus 32x minus 13 by 2x minus 1. What do we

8
00:00:34,542 --> 00:00:37,290
get? Write your answer in this green box.
