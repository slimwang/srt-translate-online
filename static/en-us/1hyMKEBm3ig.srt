1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:03,050
Enough talk,
let's see this app in action.

2
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:07,431
I'll open up the Pirate Fleet xCode
project, and then I'll launch the app.

3
00:00:07,431 --> 00:00:10,913
And as soon as the game launches, we
begin in the guessing phase as opposed

4
00:00:10,913 --> 00:00:13,663
to when we actually get to place
our ships in our minds, and

5
00:00:13,663 --> 00:00:15,540
that's something you'll do in code.

6
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:18,620
Now we've kept the UI pretty simple.

7
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:20,974
Here at the top,
we have the opponents grid.

8
00:00:20,974 --> 00:00:24,312
And at the bottom we have our grid with
our ships in our minds that have already

9
00:00:24,312 --> 00:00:25,890
been placed.

10
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:29,202
Now as I start guessing, I want you
to think about what objects and

11
00:00:29,202 --> 00:00:31,562
relationships may exist
between the scenes.

12
00:00:31,562 --> 00:00:34,765
So I'm going to start guessing, and
I have a little strategy in mind.

13
00:00:34,765 --> 00:00:36,646
I'm going to try to
guess every two spaces,

14
00:00:36,646 --> 00:00:40,300
because I feel like that will give me
a pretty good shot at hitting a ship.

15
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:43,528
Being that smallest ship's sized two.

16
00:00:43,528 --> 00:00:45,090
So I hit a mine.

17
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:46,970
Hopefully I won't fall
too far behind here.

18
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:49,160
Got one ship.

19
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:55,922
And it looks like they're doing some
work on my big ships right now.

20
00:00:55,922 --> 00:00:58,772
This, there we go.

21
00:00:58,772 --> 00:01:01,896
All right I got the two
big ships out of the way.

22
00:01:01,896 --> 00:01:05,171
Ooh, there we go.

23
00:01:05,171 --> 00:01:08,503
Uh-oh, I think they might
all be lined up here.

24
00:01:08,503 --> 00:01:12,007
If I have enough time,
I may be able to get all of them.

25
00:01:12,007 --> 00:01:13,219
There we go!
