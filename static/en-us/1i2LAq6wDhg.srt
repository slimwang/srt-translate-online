If you got 12 pounds, nice work. When approaching this problem, we can think

2
00:00:04,256 --> 00:00:08,550
about combining the like terms or the like weights on one side. I can combine

3
00:00:08,562 --> 00:00:12,870
the m's as like terms, so I'll have 3 m on this side and 2 m on this side. I can

4
00:00:12,882 --> 00:00:17,052
also combine the 200 and the 50. These are both like terms since they're just

5
00:00:17,064 --> 00:00:22,281
numbers. 200 and 38 are also like terms. I can add those weights together. So, I

6
00:00:22,281 --> 00:00:28,257
have 238 plus 3 m is equal to 250 plus 2 m. I have 238 plus 3 m is equal to 250

7
00:00:28,269 --> 00:00:34,693
plus 2 m. We know we can remove weights from both sides so we can take off a 2

8
00:00:34,693 --> 00:00:40,917
m, from here and here. I remove 2 m from the weights and 2 m from the weights

9
00:00:40,929 --> 00:00:46,069
over here. So, I'm just left with 238 plus m equals 250. I want to think of

10
00:00:46,081 --> 00:00:51,383
about getting m alone. I want to isolate this variable. I want to figure out how

11
00:00:51,395 --> 00:00:56,463
much this weighs. So, I should remove 238 pounds from both sides. We could

12
00:00:56,475 --> 00:01:01,933
easily think about removing 200 and 200, and then removing 38, and removing 38

13
00:01:02,132 --> 00:01:05,920
from 50. So, we know one way m is equal to 12 pounds. When looking back at our

14
00:01:05,932 --> 00:01:09,730
work, we should always remember that we're trying to isolate m. You want to

15
00:01:09,742 --> 00:01:13,385
remove the variable from both sides and remove constants from both sides.

16
00:01:13,477 --> 00:01:17,275
Eventually, we want the variable on one side and constants on the other. We

17
00:01:17,287 --> 00:01:20,865
could have done this in a reverse order and maybe you did it a little bit

18
00:01:20,877 --> 00:01:25,500
differently. That's okay. We just want to make sure we are performing the same

19
00:01:25,512 --> 00:01:29,335
steps and reasoning through our results. When solving the equation, we always

20
00:01:29,347 --> 00:01:33,083
want to start off by combining like terms. This helps us know what to remove

21
00:01:33,095 --> 00:01:36,860
from both sides of the equation. We could have removed the numbers from both

22
00:01:36,872 --> 00:01:40,529
sides of the equation first. That's okay. We just need to be consistent and

23
00:01:40,541 --> 00:01:44,227
always remove or perform the same operation on both sides of the equation at

24
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:44,709
each step.
