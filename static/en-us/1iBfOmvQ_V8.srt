00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:03,795
Now this is something we're familiar with again, it's just a rational

2
00:00:03,795 --> 00:00:08,444
expression. We don't have any fractions in the numerator and denominator. We

3
00:00:08,444 --> 00:00:12,669
just have a polynomial here and a polynomial here. So use your knowledge of

4
00:00:12,669 --> 00:00:17,256
simplifying rational expressions to figure out the simplified form. What do you

5
00:00:17,256 --> 00:00:19,353
think is our final answer?
