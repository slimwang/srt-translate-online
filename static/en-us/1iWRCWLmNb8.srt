00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:04,550
You now have a pretty good idea of how to start working on a new project.

2
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:09,010
But what's the best way to learn new skills aside from just practice,

3
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:10,100
practice, practice?

4
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:12,700
I think Jacques has some ideas but

5
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:15,650
again he went back to work so we need to bug him again.

6
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:25,030
>> Heya, so I actually wanted to just mention the awesomeness that

7
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:28,820
is learning HTML and CSS on the web when you can see it every day.

8
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:32,174
So if you like something in a webpage, and you want to see how they did it

9
00:00:32,174 --> 00:00:37,510
[COUGH] you can pop open DevTools and actually see how we cut it up.

10
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:39,460
So if you like something on the audacity website, and

11
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:40,850
you want to use that motif, or

12
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:44,000
that design, those type of styles, you can see what we did.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,620
And that's really great, and

14
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:48,280
not something you can do in a lot of other environments.

15
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:52,060
So in terms of learning, it's a great place to start.

16
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:53,580
Because, I mean, that's how I started.

17
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:56,250
I was looking at how other people did,

18
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,560
how other people coded up their solutions.

19
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:03,270
How they managed to make something look a certain way and

20
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:04,510
being able to open it up.

21
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:06,770
And our DevTools are much better now.

22
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:12,530
And they will really allow you to dive into how somebody put something together.

23
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:15,890
So go and check out a website that you find interesting.

24
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:19,550
You'll, you'll be amazed that, sort of what people have done and

25
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:21,020
you can learn a tremendous amount from it.
