1
00:00:00,325 --> 00:00:03,030
Okay, so I can see how
the Firebase database is a better

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:05,230
choice than other data
options out there.

3
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:07,939
But are there other features that
are part of the platform that

4
00:00:07,939 --> 00:00:10,020
are a good fit for
shopping list plus plus?

5
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:12,100
>> Well, knowing what you want
to do with your application.

6
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:14,550
Here are the top reasons why I
think you should use Firebase.

7
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:18,200
Data that is available in real time, so

8
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:21,360
users all get updated
shopping lists on demand.

9
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,680
So if Walter adds some
items on a shopping list,

10
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,230
you'll see these immediately.

11
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:27,370
Synchronization handled by the client.

12
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:30,050
Regardless if the client is online or
offline.

13
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:34,180
This ensures that clients that were
turned off or maybe in airplane mode

14
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:38,210
get the freshest copy of the data
possible when they come back online.

15
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:41,680
This is also helpful because you can
still add items to your shopping list

16
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,100
when you're offline and

17
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:46,440
have those changes available to
Walter when you're back online.

18
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,730
Easy to implement
authentication methods,

19
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:51,140
all without writing a lot of clients.

20
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:53,980
With this, Walter can use e-mail and
password or

21
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:56,070
his Google Plus account to log on.

22
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:57,540
Well in addition to what
we've talked about,

23
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:00,550
another benefit is Firebase's
two tier approach.

24
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:03,020
Many applications use
a three tier approach

25
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:07,110
where the middle tier contains business
logic or some application server.

26
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:10,340
But this introduces complexity and
system management issues.

27
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:13,880
For shopping list plus plus,
it's not necessary.

28
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:16,730
Instead, with Firebase you
use a two tier approach.

29
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:19,770
Basically, this is a client server model
where you communicate directly with

30
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:20,980
the database.

31
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:24,060
It's cheaper, easier to maintain,
quicker set up and

32
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:27,130
in the case of Firebase,
highly performant.

33
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:29,740
>> All right,
that sounds pretty good to me.

34
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:31,900
Although I do have one more request.

35
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:35,070
Do you happen to know any developers
that are actually using Firebase?

36
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:37,910
>> Sure I've actually got
a Firebase developer advocate

37
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:39,650
here with me right now.

38
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:40,910
>> Well, shoot.

39
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:44,380
I'm a bit busy getting our first
user set up with the app but

40
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:45,990
the developer has some free time.

41
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:47,860
Maybe they could join you.

42
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:49,010
>> Sure.
That'd be great.

43
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:50,590
>> Hey, if you want,
you can take the company skateboard.
