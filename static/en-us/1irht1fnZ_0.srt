1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,450
Here are the truth tables for
all the logical connectives.

2
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:08,160
What a truth table does is
list all the possibilities for

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,070
the propositional symbols.

4
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:14,890
So P and Q can be false and false,
false and true, true and false, or

5
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:15,999
true and true.

6
00:00:15,999 --> 00:00:17,810
Those are the only four possibilities.

7
00:00:17,809 --> 00:00:19,359
And then for
each of those possibilities,

8
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:24,559
the truth table lists the truth
value of the compound sentence.

9
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:30,119
So the sentence not P is true when P
is false and false when P is true.

10
00:00:31,309 --> 00:00:33,670
The sentence P and

11
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:39,620
Q is true only when both P and
Q are true and false otherwise.

12
00:00:39,619 --> 00:00:44,021
The sentence P or
Q is true when either P or

13
00:00:44,021 --> 00:00:48,561
Q is true, and
false when both are false.

14
00:00:48,561 --> 00:00:53,051
Now so far, those mostly correspond
to the English meaning of those

15
00:00:53,051 --> 00:00:55,197
sentences with one exception.

16
00:00:55,197 --> 00:00:58,797
Which is that in English, the word or

17
00:00:58,796 --> 00:01:03,559
is somewhat ambiguous
between the inclusive and

18
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:08,103
exclusive or and this or
means either or both.

19
00:01:08,102 --> 00:01:15,217
We translate this mark into English
as P implies Q or as if P then Q.

20
00:01:15,218 --> 00:01:18,405
But the meaning in logic is not quite
the same as the meaning in ordinary

21
00:01:18,405 --> 00:01:19,367
English.

22
00:01:19,367 --> 00:01:24,239
The meaning in logic is defined
explicitly by this truth table and

23
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:25,469
by nothing else.

24
00:01:25,469 --> 00:01:27,689
But let's look at some
examples in ordinary English.

25
00:01:28,969 --> 00:01:35,209
If we have the proposition O and
have that mean five is an odd number.

26
00:01:35,209 --> 00:01:39,919
And P,
meaning Paris is the capital of France.

27
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,656
Then, under the ordinary model
of truth in the real world,

28
00:01:44,656 --> 00:01:48,554
what could we say about
the sentence O implies P?

29
00:01:48,554 --> 00:01:54,290
That is, five is an odd number implies
Paris is the capital of France.

30
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:57,070
Would that be true or false?

31
00:01:57,069 --> 00:01:58,879
And let's look at one more example.

32
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:03,179
If E is the proposition that
five is an even number, and

33
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:07,100
M is the proposition that Moscow
is the capital of France,

34
00:02:07,099 --> 00:02:11,180
what about E implies M?

35
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:15,752
Five is an even number implies
Moscow is the capital of France.

36
00:02:15,752 --> 00:02:18,300
Is that true or false?
