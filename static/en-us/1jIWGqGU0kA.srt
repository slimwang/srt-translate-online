1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:02,340
Which ones did you think, David?

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:06,170
>> So the first sentence,
colorless green ideas sleep furiously.

3
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:09,483
I recognized pretty quickly as
a pretty famous example proposed

4
00:00:09,483 --> 00:00:13,164
by Noam Chomsky of how sentences can
be semantically nonsensical, but

5
00:00:13,164 --> 00:00:14,841
still grammatically correct.

6
00:00:14,841 --> 00:00:15,804
The sentence makes sense.

7
00:00:15,804 --> 00:00:19,389
There's still a subject, a verb,
an adverb describing the verb, but

8
00:00:19,389 --> 00:00:21,920
the idea of a colorless
green idea makes no sense.

9
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,440
The idea of ideas sleeping makes
maybe a little bit of sense.

10
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,760
The idea of sleeping furiously
is kind of nonsense.

11
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,040
So the sentence really doesn't

12
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:31,490
have much meaning even though
it is grammatically correct.

13
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:35,240
The second sentence, soft drinks
due from thank bills insurance

14
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,970
really doesn't make
any grammatical sense.

15
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:40,150
It does have a seeming subject and
a seeming verb.

16
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:43,260
But the verb comes right a preposition
suggesting that the verb fills in

17
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:46,450
the slot proposed by the preposition,
which doesn't make any sense.

18
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:49,170
So this one doesn't make any
grammatical sense to me.

19
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:51,230
The same can be said for
the other two negative examples.

20
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:54,110
They don't really have the normal
subject, predicate sentence structure or

21
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:57,060
they have other rules or
constraints that are being violated.

22
00:00:58,170 --> 00:00:59,590
For the other two positive examples,

23
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:03,490
they still maintain this subject
verb sentence structure.

24
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:06,260
So here we have wall decor notifies,
which doesn't make sense but

25
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:07,670
it matches our structure.

26
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:10,590
And here we have Tuesday brought
something, which also makes

27
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:14,330
no semantic sense, but can still be
thought of as grammatically correct.

28
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:17,780
Similarly, Tuesday bringing
something does make some sense, but

29
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:21,830
a a sharp-edged suite of pumpernickel
makes no sense whatsoever.

30
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:24,270
>> Note the vocabulary that David used

31
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:28,180
in trying to find out which of these
sentences were grammatically correct.

32
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:32,240
It seemed to me that he was examining
if the structure of these sentences

33
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,640
was fulfilling certain conditions or
fulfilling certain constraints

34
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,010
that he expects from his knowledge
of English-language grammar.

35
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:42,720
One could even say that he was
doing constraint processing.
