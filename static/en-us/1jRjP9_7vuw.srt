1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,401
Our next psychotherapy is based on the principles of operant and classical

2
00:00:03,401 --> 00:00:08,770
conditioning, and that's behavioral treatments. Behavioral treatments are used

3
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:13,390
to treat a variety of disorders, from autism to ADHD, drug addiction, anxiety,

4
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:19,585
depression, phobias, even schizophrenia and intellectual disabilities.

5
00:00:19,585 --> 00:00:22,623
>> And because this is Susan's area of expertise, I'm going to pass it over to her

6
00:00:22,623 --> 00:00:24,372
for a little bit.

7
00:00:24,372 --> 00:00:28,272
>> The first published study to demonstrate the use of behavioral principles in

8
00:00:28,272 --> 00:00:32,232
treating psychological disorders was published in 1959 by Teodoro Ayllon and

9
00:00:32,232 --> 00:00:39,260
Jack Michael, and it was titled The Psychiatric Nurse as a Behavioral Engineer.

10
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:42,320
Now, Jack Michael was actually on my masters and Ph.D committees, and he

11
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,686
continues to contribute important work in the field of behavior analysis, and

12
00:00:45,686 --> 00:00:49,103
that includes both the experimental analysis of behavior and applied behavior

13
00:00:49,103 --> 00:00:55,080
analysis. Now in this particular study, they demonstrated how you could use

14
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:58,564
Skinner's operant conditioning principles to decrease the symptoms of mental

15
00:00:58,564 --> 00:01:03,601
disorders. In addition, this was the first study that actually started the

16
00:01:03,601 --> 00:01:08,440
field of applied behavior analysis. So, let's look at ABA in more detail.
