1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,910
Let's create a new app
using Android Studio.

2
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:06,890
We'll create a basic Android application
that has a single empty activity.

3
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:09,890
I'm just going to call it Location1,
and it's in this location.

4
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:12,860
The company domain,
you can put whatever you like.

5
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:14,885
I'm just going to keep
that Android.example.com.

6
00:00:14,885 --> 00:00:19,445
I'm going to make it a Jelly Bean
application for phone and tablets.

7
00:00:21,085 --> 00:00:23,675
And like I said earlier, it's
going to be a single blank activity.

8
00:00:25,225 --> 00:00:27,229
I'll keep the defaults and continue.

9
00:00:29,829 --> 00:00:31,576
Now once this has been created,

10
00:00:31,576 --> 00:00:35,450
I'm going to edit the activity
to add a single text view.

11
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:39,360
When you run the app, location services
will start getting updates and

12
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,780
it will write details about
them to this text view.

13
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:47,770
To edit the text view in the activity
editor, just select the Text tab and

14
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:50,460
you can see what your
layout would look like.

15
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:52,540
So, here's the basic layout
that has been built for

16
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:54,030
you in the default in Android Studio.

17
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:56,760
You can see, it already has
a text view and the text for

18
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:01,350
this is held in a string refered to
in strings.xml called hello world.

19
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:04,810
I'm just going to change that
to something hardcoded for now.

20
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:06,860
I'll just say location goes here and

21
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:09,630
then I'm going to give
this control an ID.

22
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:12,595
So, I'm going to give
it the ID like this,

23
00:01:12,595 --> 00:01:23,305
android:id=@+ID/txtOutput.

24
00:01:23,305 --> 00:01:26,565
So when I refer to this control
in code in a few moments,

25
00:01:26,565 --> 00:01:29,995
you will see that the control
will be called txtOutput.

26
00:01:29,995 --> 00:01:33,705
So this control is where the location
is going to get written.

27
00:01:33,705 --> 00:01:37,190
So when we get details from
location services, in this case,

28
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:41,830
the latitude of the phone, we'll write
it into this control called txtOutput.

29
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:44,670
And if I look at the design,
you can see location goes here.

30
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:47,180
It's faint, but
you can see it's there in this one.
