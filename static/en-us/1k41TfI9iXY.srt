1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,950
So now let me quickly summarize.

2
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:05,540
Basically, I dug a little bit deeper
into the whole concept of feature

3
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:10,410
detection, and we discussed the
different types of invariants, to scale,

4
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:13,310
to size, and to intensity and rotation.

5
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:17,520
Basically went through in detail to
the Harris Corner detector framework and

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,570
the SIFT detector, specifically
talking about issues with scale.

7
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:25,360
And also shared with you some example
demos of how we can make this work.

8
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:28,620
Again just for your reference there
are additional readings I encourage you

9
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:29,430
to look at them.

10
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:34,530
And also just spend a little bit of
time look at information on features.

11
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:38,480
The Open CV side this is one of
the harder areas in computer vision and

12
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:43,330
many people are writing specifically and
making it available on Open CV

13
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:48,150
to various applications of using
things like feature detection.

14
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:50,930
You'll get to play around with
this a little bit more and

15
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:53,560
again we'll be using this
approach extensively for

16
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:57,050
doing other things in
the next set of assignments.

17
00:00:57,050 --> 00:01:00,410
Now we will actually move to a few
additional examples, like for

18
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:05,360
example, image warping, morphing,
high dynamic range imaging and

19
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,290
panoramic imaging, in the next module.
