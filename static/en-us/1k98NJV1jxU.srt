>> I believe I did. So is the first frog dead or alive? I can't imagine you

2
00:00:06,397 --> 00:00:10,420
eating a frog and the frog staying alive, so I'm going to say the frog is dead.

3
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:14,340
Where is the frog if you ate it? It's probably in your stomach.

4
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:18,340
And are you happy or sad? I don't know if you like to eat frogs, but

5
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:21,520
I'm going to assume that you do. So I'm going to assume that you are happy.

00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,730
Thank you, David. So David just did common sense reasoning.

7
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:28,690
There was nothing in this input which said whether the frog was dead or alive.

8
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:33,060
There was nothing in the sentence which said Ashok was happy or sad. But David

9
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:37,470
made sensible inferences. I will discuss a lot more about common sense reasoning

10
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:41,950
a little bit later. For now, I want to talk about the knowledge representation

11
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:47,150
called Frames that will allow us to make some inferences of this kind.
