00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,480
Okay.
As I'm comparing what we have now and

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,010
our final goal,
I see a number of differences.

3
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:06,440
The first of these differences,

4
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:10,570
is that the text of the goal is much
larger than what we have right now.

5
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:13,870
Also the final font that we're using
is different from the font that we're

6
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:15,450
starting out with here.

7
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:18,310
Similarly, the text here is black and
the text here is white.

8
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:22,040
Now if you take a look at the image here
versus the image of the goal screen,

9
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:24,370
we also see that the image
has actually expanded,

10
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:26,870
to fill the entire screen of the phone.

11
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:29,420
Now this last one is
a little bit more subtle.

12
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:32,040
If you look over here at
the text that we have right now,

13
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,130
it's smushed right up against
the corner of the screen.

14
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:38,160
Whereas the text of the goal
has this space here.

15
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,120
Between the side of the screen and
the text itself.

16
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,210
And those were all
the differences that I saw.

17
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:46,520
So let's go ahead and work through
these one by one, adding attributes and

18
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:49,570
setting them to values,
which will turn this into this.
