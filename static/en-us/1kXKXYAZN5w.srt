1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The moral of the story is this is tricky.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
There are a lot of cases to deal with in getting this kind of search just right,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
and we made a couple mistakes along the way.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I sort of duplicated the history of the field.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
There a couple tools we can get to avoid mistakes.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
One tool is to write lots of tests,

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
and I just didn't do enough testing. I wanted to go fast.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I wanted to be able to show you some of the interesting ideas.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I put in a few tests, but I really need more to have confidence that I've got this right.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The second thing is to use, or better yet, reuse existing tools.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Every time I do a search, I don't want to be rewriting this search routine from scratch,

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
because it is tricky and I will make mistakes.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Rather I want to write it once or have somebody else write it once

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
and then reuse it.

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
In order to do that, we're going to have to figure out how to generalize.

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I've written a a function that's good only for solve the bridge problem through search.

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I want to write a search function that can solve a wide variety of problems.

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Then I want to reuse that so that I'm not repeating mistakes,

19
00:01:07,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and I'm not introducing new errors.
