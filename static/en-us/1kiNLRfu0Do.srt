00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:02,880
At this point let's go back to Oliver, and

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:05,520
hear what else he asks in an interview.

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,217
>> Okay, so I'd love to hear you talk more about UI view controller,

4
00:00:09,217 --> 00:00:12,760
in particular the life cycle of a UI view controller.

5
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:15,120
UI view controllers are used everywhere in iOS,

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,540
and have many different use cases.

7
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:20,820
so, to demonstrate, I built this super simple App.

8
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,640
It has view controller A here, when I tap this button,

9
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:28,570
I see view controller B, when I tap it again I go back to to view controller A.

10
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:32,790
I looked at here you talk about the ordering of the events and

11
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:38,250
the lifecycle, so in what order the methods are called, what methods are called,

12
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:39,820
is it view did load, view will appear.

13
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:42,901
And could you just expand on the lifecycle of a UI view controller?

14
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:47,140
>> This question is trickier than it first appears.

15
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:51,480
I want you to think about this, use a pen and a paper to draw out your ideas,

16
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,540
and then share your thoughts with us on the discussion forum.

17
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:58,810
Here is the question one more time, submit your answers on the discussion forum,

18
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:01,250
and comment on each other's responses.

19
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:02,650
Check this box when you are done.
