00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,240
I want to take a step back to
the http skit from lesson one.

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:07,310
If you recall, in the skit I
played the role of the client and

3
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:09,350
Jessica played the role of the server.

4
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:14,053
But there are a few other roles that I
left out, specifically the NSURLSession,

5
00:00:14,053 --> 00:00:15,660
the NSURLRequest.

6
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:17,640
And the NSURLSessionDataTask.

7
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:20,120
So you can see these three images here.

8
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:23,570
What I want you to do is to match
these images with the Swift

9
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:25,550
class they best represent.

10
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:28,720
To do that, just for
the number of the swift class so 1,

11
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,330
put it in the box that you
think best represents one.

12
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:33,280
And so on for the rest.
