00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,000
Solving this equation, might have felt really simple to you but there's

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,928
actually something really important going on here. This is highlighting a

3
00:00:06,928 --> 00:00:11,595
certain property that exponents have. If we have an equation like this one, a

4
00:00:11,595 --> 00:00:17,200
to the x equals a to the y, then we know right away that x must equal y. This

5
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:21,856
property also works the other way around. If we know that x equals y, then we

6
00:00:21,856 --> 00:00:26,970
also know that a to the x is equal to a to the y. Now that we've talked about

7
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:31,484
that concept, here's a slightly harder problem to try. This time we have 4 to

8
00:00:31,484 --> 00:00:36,099
the x minus 1 power equals 64. What is x now?
