00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
In the next programming quiz, I would like you to print out a table called expand,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
which does not exist right now.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
What expand is, is a table of the same size as grid

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
that maintains at what step each node was expanded.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
So the very first node over here was expanded times 0.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,000
The second node to expand was this one over here: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
In this table, every node that has never been expanded

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
including all the obstacle nodes should have the value of -1.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Like these guys over here - these are obstacles.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
And when a node is expanded, it should get a unique number

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
that is incremented from expansion to expansion

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
and counts from 0, in this case, all the way to 22 for reaching the goal stated.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
To give you a second example of how the quotes should work,

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
let me block off the goal by adding 1 over here

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
so there's an entire items that block the left side from the right side.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,876
Now the switch fails, and in the expansion list you find

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
that all nodes on the right side have never been expanded.

18
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:05,530
You get 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

19
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:08,270
A little warning; this is not unique.

20
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:11,210
Depending on how you break ties you might expand in a different order,

21
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:15,080
so I don't expect your table to always look exactly the same way as this one over here.

22
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:18,810
So for example, you might have 0, 2 over here, and 1 over here

23
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:22,000
but what should be the case is when there is a full blockage

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
the right side should just never expand.
