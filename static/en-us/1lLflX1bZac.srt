00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:04,710
For your window component, we're going to call that a ViewPort, and

2
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:09,370
you need to be able to use it, to display the textual content graphically. And

3
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:12,530
we're going to make some assumptions here, we're going to assume that

4
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:17,580
the ViewPort displays an inter, integer number of lines, and we're going to be,

5
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:22,350
assume that it can be resized to be any length between one and a 100 lines. And

6
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:26,260
we're going to assume that all the text in the same font, is in the same font

7
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:31,520
and has the same point size. So these are simplifying assumptions to make the,

8
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:36,770
make this particular exercise, you know, small enough to fit in a lesson and

9
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:39,460
also allow us to focus on just what the important issues are.
