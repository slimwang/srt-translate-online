Here's another question for you.

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:05,710
Suppose you have a model where you very carefully tuned it to minimize,

3
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:09,190
say the sum of squared errors on a regression.

4
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:11,630
And, let's say that in order to minimize the sum of squared errors,

5
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:15,360
you found yourself very carefully tuning the parameters, and also using lots and

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,950
lots of features to try to get every little bit of

7
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:19,490
information out of the data that you could.

8
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:22,380
Maybe you're using all the features that you could even think of,

9
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:24,390
which could potentially be dozens.

10
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:27,280
In this situation, do you think you should be more worried about the variance of

11
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:29,370
your model, or the bias?

12
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:30,560
Click which one you think is right.
