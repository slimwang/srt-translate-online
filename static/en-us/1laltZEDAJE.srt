1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,760
So it's probably not obvious why this
would be true, but this is the thing

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:06,860
that we're claiming, and I want to at
least make it clear what we're claiming.

3
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:11,270
The claim is that any value function at
any given step of value iteration can be

4
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:15,990
represented finitely as just a maximum
over a bunch of linear functions.

5
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:19,450
Each linear function can handle
an infinite number of inputs.

6
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:20,330
Right?
And that is not so

7
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:23,080
surprising if a linear
functions can do that.

8
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:25,970
But what is cool is we don't actually
have to represent the value for

9
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:28,270
each possible belief state b.

10
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:32,259
Instead, we just throw all these linear
functions into a bag, gamma sub t.

11
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:34,220
And then when we want
to know the value for

12
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:38,320
a given belief state b, we compute
all the linear function values and

13
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,350
just take whichever one is
the highest at that point.

14
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:40,930
>> Okay.

15
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:43,270
I mean I guess that that
makes sense in the abstract.

16
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:48,310
I guess the only thing that I don't yet
get is exactly where gamma comes from.

17
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:49,880
>> Yes,
that's what we have to step through.

18
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,640
And that is not at all obvious,

19
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:54,600
I think, but it is very
elegant that it all works out.

20
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:59,800
And this was originally shown
by a fellow named Sondik and

21
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,660
once you see it, it's maybe not so

22
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:04,440
hard to see, but I don't know how
he got here in the first place.

23
00:01:05,558 --> 00:01:08,510
>> It's, to me,
not all readily apparent, but

24
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:09,760
once you see things this way,

25
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,980
it gives you a very powerful way to work
with these infinite-sized state spaces.

26
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:18,770
You just have to take operations
on bags of vectors and

27
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:20,750
so it ends up all being finite.
