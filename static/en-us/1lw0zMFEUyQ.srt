1
00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:04,508
So, are IQ tests valid? That is, do they measure intelligence, or do they

2
00:00:04,508 --> 00:00:07,388
measure something else, such as a type of education you received, or how

3
00:00:07,388 --> 00:00:12,362
wealthy your parents are? In fact, it's the question of validity that's

4
00:00:12,362 --> 00:00:17,207
generated so much controversy regarding IQ tests. There are different types of

5
00:00:17,207 --> 00:00:20,168
validity, but it all boils down to, does a test measure what it's supposed to

6
00:00:20,168 --> 00:00:24,575
measure And also, does it predict the outcome it's supposed to predict?

7
00:00:24,575 --> 00:00:28,610
>> Now, the key here is not to overstretch what you think an IQ test can tell you.

8
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:32,640
Now, an IQ test does have pretty good predictive validity in some areas such as

9
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,934
academic success. So, it's good at telling you how good you'll do in different

10
00:00:36,934 --> 00:00:40,300
academic domains but not general life success.

11
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:44,130
>> That's right. So IQ tests are good at predicting school achievement. Or even

12
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:47,840
the type of college that one gets into. In fact, that's why Binet developed

13
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,981
intelligence testing back in the early 1900's. Interestingly, IQ tests can

14
00:00:51,981 --> 00:00:56,332
predict the general type of career one goes into. Whether that's law

15
00:00:56,332 --> 00:01:01,298
enforcement, accounting, or even construction. And it's also interesting to

16
00:01:01,298 --> 00:01:04,958
note that IQ is related to longevity. With people with higher IQs living

17
00:01:04,958 --> 00:01:05,700
longer.

18
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:09,116
>> Now, when people use an IQ test to try to tell you different important life

19
00:01:09,116 --> 00:01:12,476
outcomes like, being emotionally stable, generally happy, or having a

20
00:01:12,476 --> 00:01:18,380
successful marriage, you don't see a relationship between IQ and these domains.

21
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:21,389
So it's really important to limit what you think an IQ test is going to tell

22
00:01:21,389 --> 00:01:22,379
you.
