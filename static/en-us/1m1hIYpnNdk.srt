1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:02,719
The viewDidLoad function
can be very useful for

2
00:00:02,719 --> 00:00:06,080
running code once our ViewController
is loaded in to memory.

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,190
What about running some code right
before the view appears on screen?

4
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:12,506
For that,
there are two functions we can use.

5
00:00:12,506 --> 00:00:16,198
The viewWillAppear and viewDidAppear.

6
00:00:16,198 --> 00:00:21,172
WillAppear happens right before the view
and ViewController appear on screen.

7
00:00:21,172 --> 00:00:24,845
And didAppear gets called
immediately after the view and

8
00:00:24,845 --> 00:00:26,450
ViewController appear on screen.

9
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:30,338
Remember, that the view and
ViewController are linked.

10
00:00:30,338 --> 00:00:31,830
A UI ViewController and

11
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:36,600
any subclasses of it have at least one
IBOutlet that always goes to a UI view.

12
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:40,966
Here, we're going to use auto
complete to help us out.

13
00:00:40,966 --> 00:00:44,957
In the ViewController.swift file move
right to the bottom in the space

14
00:00:44,957 --> 00:00:47,560
directly above the last
closing curly brake.

15
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,640
Start typing viewWill.

16
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:56,170
You can see Xcode's auto complete
showing us the viewWillAppear function.

17
00:00:56,170 --> 00:01:00,170
It knows that ViewController is
a subclass of UI ViewController.

18
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:03,700
It also knows in UI ViewController
there's a function you can override

19
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:05,570
called viewWillAppear.

20
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:08,340
Clicking on this function
fills it in for us.

21
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:10,870
Auto complete makes sure
that the function name and

22
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:13,970
parameters are correct and
that there's no typos.

23
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:16,560
See the highlighted text
here that says code?

24
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,060
Click on it.

25
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:19,300
This is where we're
going to type our code.

26
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:22,070
For now let's add the line,
viewWillAppear called.

27
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:26,440
If we run this app by pressing the run
button we can see the print statement

28
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:28,850
being called when our
ViewController appears on screen.

29
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:30,440
There it is.
