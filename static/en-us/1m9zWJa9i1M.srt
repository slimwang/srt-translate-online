00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So now, with this play pig, with the dependancy injection,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
with the goal being 50, here's a test that I can actually run.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
So "A" and "B" are going to be my two contestants.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:16,000
"A" is hold at 50, which is equivalent to saying never hold until you win.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
"B" is the clueless function, the one that acts at random,

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and rolls is going to be an iterator of some list of numbers,

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
maybe 1, 2, 3 or whatever you want, but I want you to write in there

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
the list which is the shortest possible list, or one of the

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
shortest possible lists that allows "A" to win and then you can

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
check Play a Game of Pig between "A" and "B"

11
00:00:40,000 --> 99:59:59,999
with these rolls and make sure that "A" wins.
