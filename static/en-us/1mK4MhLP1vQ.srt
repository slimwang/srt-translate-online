00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:01,110
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:03,860
Now I know we've talked a bunch
about control flow already, but

3
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:05,980
we're still missing a big
piece of the puzzle.

4
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:08,815
Sometimes we need the ability to
run our code multiple times or

5
00:00:08,815 --> 00:00:11,009
even run forever until
some condition's met.

6
00:00:11,009 --> 00:00:13,220
And to do that, we need the loops.

7
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:15,180
And that's what this
session's all about.

8
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:15,790
Let's get started.
