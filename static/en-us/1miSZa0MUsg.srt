1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:04,417
We want to iterate, over every pixel in the image. The first index, in the

2
00:00:04,417 --> 00:00:08,812
pixels, would be 0. And the last one would the be one, less than, the number of

3
00:00:08,812 --> 00:00:14,306
pixels. Since I only need to affect, every fifth pixel, I'll increment, i, by 5

4
00:00:14,306 --> 00:00:21,398
at a time. To turn a pixel black. I'll use the setColorAt() method, and give it

5
00:00:21,398 --> 00:00:26,236
the number of the pixel I want, and the color to set that pixel to. So now if I

6
00:00:26,236 --> 00:00:31,575
run this, I get the same picture, but dimmed a little. If you look really

7
00:00:31,575 --> 00:00:35,103
closely, on your own screen, it's hard to seen on the video, you can actually

8
00:00:35,103 --> 00:00:40,586
see the little, black dots. There are probably other ways to do this, but I

9
00:00:40,586 --> 00:00:45,441
think this is the simplest. For example, you could count up by 1 at a time and

10
00:00:45,441 --> 00:00:51,670
then use mod to decide whether to actually color the pixel or not.

11
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:57,064
Alternatively, instead of checking using mod, you could set the color at 5

12
00:00:57,064 --> 00:01:03,657
times i. But then, you would need to change the condition for stopping the

13
00:01:03,657 --> 00:01:06,950
loop. I think that would require a little bit more thinking.
