Hi, welcome back. So far in this class we covered

2
00:00:03,469 --> 00:00:05,685
a lot of programming techniques, but we mostly

3
00:00:05,685 --> 00:00:09,849
done it with small examples of code. In this unit,

4
00:00:09,849 --> 00:00:11,612
we’re going to look at a larger example than

5
00:00:11,612 --> 00:00:13,885
anything we seen before. We’re going to write

6
00:00:13,885 --> 00:00:17,274
an algorithm for finding the highest scoring play

7
00:00:17,274 --> 00:00:20,547
in a crossword tile game. Now, versions of this

8
00:00:20,547 --> 00:00:22,965
game go by names like Scrabble and Words

9
00:00:22,965 --> 00:00:25,240
with Friends. So we’re going to have to represent

10
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:28,545
everything about the words, the tiles, the board,

11
00:00:28,545 --> 00:00:31,830
the scoring and the algorithm for finding the

12
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:35,117
highest scoring word. That’s going to be more code

13
00:00:35,117 --> 00:00:37,052
I’m going to be writing a lot of it and you’re going to

14
00:00:37,052 --> 00:00:39,849
get practice reading, that’s an important skill but I’m

15
00:00:39,849 --> 00:00:42,145
also going to stop and leave you plenty of places

16
00:00:42,145 --> 00:00:44,838
where you can write some other code and at any

17
00:00:44,838 --> 00:00:47,302
point, if you want a bigger challenge, you can stop

18
00:00:47,302 --> 00:00:50,173
the video and go ahead yourself and try to solve as

19
00:00:50,173 --> 00:00:52,942
much of it as you can on your own and I would

20
00:00:52,942 --> 00:00:56,329
encourage you to do that. This is a big step-up.

21
00:00:56,329 --> 00:00:58,225
I think you are all ready for it. So let’s get started.
