00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,788
We treat this just as if we were solving an equation, except that of course, we

2
00:00:03,788 --> 00:00:07,872
have an inequality sign running throughout. We're dividing by a positive number,

3
00:00:07,872 --> 00:00:11,412
this positive 3, not a negative one, so we have no funny business with the

4
00:00:11,412 --> 00:00:15,320
signs. And our final answer is, x is less than or equal to 3. And of course, you

5
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:19,188
should check your answer. But by now, you know how to do that, so I'm not going

6
00:00:19,188 --> 00:00:20,180
to take the time to.
