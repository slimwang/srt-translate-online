00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Here's a quiz to make sure you understand how to calculate these probabilistic models.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
We're going to calculate the probability of the string "woe is me,"

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
and we're going to calculate that beginning at the beginning of the sentence,

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
which we'll mark with this dot character,

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
given that we are starting at the beginning of the sentence.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I want you to figure that out, put the probability in here,

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
and it's going to be a small number with a lot of zeros to the right of the decimal place.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
So scale that by a factor of 1 billion--the probability times 10 to -9.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Now, of course, I'm going to have to give you some data to make this make sense.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm going to tell you that the probability that "woe" occurs at position i

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
given that the start-of-sentence marker occurs at position i minus 1.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I should say what we're doing here is we're sort of artificially introducing a token

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
into our data of the start-of-sentence marker,

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
which could be either what comes after a period or exclamation point

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
or at the beginning of the file. That all counts as a start-of-sentence marker.

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
That probability is 0.002.

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:23,000
The probability that "is" occurs at position i given that "woe" occurred at i minus 1 is 0.07,

18
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:37,000
and the probability that "me" occurs at position i given that "is" occurred at i minus 1 is 0.0005.

19
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Tell me the probability of the whole string "woe is me" at the beginning of a sentence

20
00:01:42,000 --> 99:59:59,999
given that we're starting at the beginning of a sentence and put your answer in here.
