1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:04,120
The tag manager class is the entry
point for working with tag manager.

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:08,350
It has methods for loading the container
and you get an instance of it by calling

3
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:12,330
get instance on the tag
manager class itself.

4
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:15,360
The first thing you need to
do is load the container.

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,910
The tag manager class has several
methods for doing this and

6
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:23,260
we're going to start out using
loadContainerPreferFresh() so

7
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:25,810
that we'll get the latest
container if possible.

8
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:29,130
And then you have to wait
until the loading finishes.

9
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:33,300
Use setResultCallback() to set
the callback that gets invoked when

10
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:39,060
the loading is done and this callback
is passed the container holder.

11
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:43,390
In the callback,
store the container holder so

12
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:46,480
it can be accessed from
other places in your app.

13
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,800
And remember how we used the application
instance to store the analytics tracker

14
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,390
back in the first lesson.

15
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:55,130
We can do a similar thing here and

16
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:58,060
store the container holder
in the application instance.

17
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:03,470
So now let's take a look at the code for
loading and storing the container.

18
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:06,450
So here in main activity,
I've defined a method,

19
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:11,210
loadGTMContainer that gets
the tag manager instance.

20
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:13,260
here I've disenabled logging and

21
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:17,330
here I load the container,
calling loadContainerPreferFresh.

22
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:24,140
Now you need to parse it the container
Id and the default container.

23
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:26,710
So this is the default container
that you downloaded and

24
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:28,460
copied into the role folder.

25
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:30,030
Then I set the result Callback and

26
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:34,340
it gets the ContainerHolder,
deal with failure if there is any.

27
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:38,330
Here, I'm actually manually refreshing
the container to make sure I really do

28
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:43,640
get the latest container and
then I'm strobing the ContainerHolder.

29
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:47,890
In the application instance and
here, at the end of the method,

30
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:52,680
we specify how long to wait,
two and the time unit seconds, so

31
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:56,980
we're going to wait two seconds for
the loading to finish.

32
00:01:56,980 --> 00:02:01,800
Let's take a real quick look at
the Tag Manager UI to remind ourselves

33
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,870
where to get the tag manager account ID.

34
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:08,340
And here in the tag manager UI,
there's the account ID.

35
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:12,625
So that's what you need to put in your
call to load container preferred fresh.

36
00:02:13,725 --> 00:02:16,565
Now it's your turn to add the code
to load and install the container.

37
00:02:17,565 --> 00:02:22,035
First, update the application
clas,s that's the sub-class

38
00:02:22,035 --> 00:02:25,485
of application that you created
in the analytics lessons.

39
00:02:25,485 --> 00:02:29,285
Update it to have methods that
get the Tag Manage instance and

40
00:02:29,285 --> 00:02:31,205
that set and get the container holder.
