1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:01,600
Great!

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:05,020
Now, you've written an application
that gets continuous updates.

3
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:08,570
And you've converted an application
that gets a single update

4
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:10,690
to one that gets continuous updates.

5
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:13,560
You've see all about different
ways to access the location

6
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:14,829
services available to you.

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,670
But as well as location,

8
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:22,110
you can also do context, where you
can detect what the phone is doing.

9
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:23,120
Is it on a bike?

10
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:23,850
Is it in a car?

11
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:25,230
Are you walking?

12
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:26,380
Are you running?

13
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:31,130
You can detect this type of activity
using the activity recognition APIs.

14
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:31,710
Let's take a look.
