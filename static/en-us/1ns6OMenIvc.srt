1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,950
Now, let's assume we can only search
to level two of this mini max tree.

2
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:05,790
Fill in the values of
the bottom of the tree,

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:09,210
again assuming your evaluation
function of number of my moves.

4
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:12,300
Property the numbers to
the top of the mini max tree.

5
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:15,460
As in the previous quiz,
use the complete level two tree link in

6
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:18,880
the instructor notes,
then fill out the top two levels here.
