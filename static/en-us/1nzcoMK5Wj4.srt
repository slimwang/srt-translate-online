1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,858
Let's quickly review
what you just learned.

2
00:00:02,858 --> 00:00:05,443
You now know what matched
pair experiment is and

3
00:00:05,443 --> 00:00:08,231
how it compares to randomized
design experiment.

4
00:00:08,231 --> 00:00:12,554
You know how to select treatment units
and matching them to control units.

5
00:00:12,554 --> 00:00:16,332
You know how to analyze test results
from a matched pair experiment.

6
00:00:16,332 --> 00:00:19,138
And you can use those results
to make a recommendation.

7
00:00:19,138 --> 00:00:19,890
Great work.
