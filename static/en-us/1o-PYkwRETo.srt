1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:02,730
A typical defense against DDoS, is for

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:05,490
a company to buy more servers or
bandwidth.

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:09,920
However, DDoS attacks can be
amplified to make such defense very,

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:11,070
very expensive.

5
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:12,450
Here's one example.

6
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:16,600
On the internet, there are many so
called open recursive DNS servers.

7
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:20,290
These are DNS servers that any
machine on the internet can query.

8
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:25,220
A typical DNS query is to look up
the IP address of a domain name.

9
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:30,530
The DNS also allows query for
the so called large TXT record

10
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:34,650
of a domain that includes a lot
of details of the domain.

11
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:39,250
Even including organization note,
description, information and so on.

12
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:44,860
The point is that the size of the query
response can be more than 1,500 bytes.

13
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:49,630
So, here's how this amplified
distributed reflective attack works.

14
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:52,270
The attacker instructs the bots to query

15
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:55,030
the open recursive DNS
servers on the internet.

16
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:59,840
And in the query, the source of
the query is spoofed as victim's IP.

17
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,190
Meaning that the response will
be sent back to the victim

18
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:04,900
instead of to the bot.

19
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:08,480
And the query itself is for
the Large TXT record.

20
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:11,670
Because the query is for
the Large TXT record,

21
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:15,280
the response will be
at least 1,500 bytes.

22
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,350
And again, because the query is spoofed,

23
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:22,180
as from the victim,
the response will be sent to the victim.

24
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:23,710
Because there are many bots, and

25
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:27,180
each bot can query multiple
recursive DNS servers.

26
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:31,760
The victim as a result will get
many many responses each with

27
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,910
at least 1500 bytes.

28
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:38,050
Therefore with just a couple thousand
bots participating in the attack,

29
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:41,270
the victim can get several
gigabytes of traffic.
