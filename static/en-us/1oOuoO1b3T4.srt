00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:04,110
Unlike the service class we just talked
about, IntentService is a service that

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:07,580
actually runs in a separate
background thread altogether.

3
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:08,529
Here's the code for

4
00:00:08,529 --> 00:00:12,359
starting an activity using Intent,
like we've been doing before.

5
00:00:12,359 --> 00:00:14,219
The code for starting a service, and

6
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:17,600
in this case an Intent Service,
looks very similar.

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,478
First, you create a class that
extends from IntentService.

8
00:00:21,478 --> 00:00:24,920
Inside that class, you will specify
what your IntentService should do in

9
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:28,720
the background by overwriting
the onHandleIntent method.

10
00:00:28,719 --> 00:00:33,369
Then you simply create an Intent and
pass in that service class.

11
00:00:33,369 --> 00:00:34,869
Finally, to start it,

12
00:00:34,869 --> 00:00:38,527
you just call startService
as opposed to startActivity.

13
00:00:38,527 --> 00:00:43,439
You pass in the Intent you just created
which inside has your IntentService.

14
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:48,539
Yap, that's an IntentService inside
an Intent, an Intent-ception.

15
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:51,012
Here is a sample, IntentService class.

16
00:00:51,012 --> 00:00:54,060
Inside onHandleIntent is where
you put the code that will run in

17
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:54,585
the background.

18
00:00:54,585 --> 00:00:59,259
Once on startService is called,
it launches an IntentService,

19
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:03,099
runs the code inside the onHandleIntent
on a background thread, and

20
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:05,079
then stops itself when it's done.

21
00:01:05,079 --> 00:01:09,069
Notice that the intent object passed
into the onHandleIntent method

22
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:12,439
is the same intent you created
when using the startService.

23
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:13,299
Which means,

24
00:01:13,299 --> 00:01:17,219
you could attach extra data to that
Intent when creating it down here.

25
00:01:17,219 --> 00:01:20,299
And then you can access that
data inside onHandleIntent and

26
00:01:20,299 --> 00:01:24,370
use it to say decide what action
to perform using that Intent.

27
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:27,710
It's important to note that
all IntentService requests

28
00:01:27,709 --> 00:01:32,131
are handled in a single background
thread, and they are issued in order.

29
00:01:32,132 --> 00:01:34,920
Each IntentService will take
as long as necessary and

30
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,230
will not block
the application's main thread.

31
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:40,810
But only one call to the IntentServices
onHandleIntent method

32
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:42,528
will be processed at a time.

33
00:01:42,528 --> 00:01:44,530
This makes IntentService great for

34
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:49,310
tasks that need to occur in order such
as updating the counter in our case.

35
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:52,384
Okay enough with all the theory and
let's start coding our toy app for

36
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:53,019
this lesson.
