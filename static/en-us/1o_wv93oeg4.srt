1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,660
Alright, and just to make sure this epsilon exhaustion conpcet

2
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:05,390
is clear, let's actually use it in a quiz. So,

3
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:08,840
here's our example from before. We've got our target concept,

4
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:11,380
which is X or, we've got our training data which is

5
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:12,990
these, with the things that are in the green boxes

6
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:15,600
here, 0 0 output 0 1 0 output 1. And

7
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:20,890
this time, I'll actually write down a distribtiuon D that gives

8
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:26,040
the. Probability of drawing each of these different input examples.

9
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:31,800
All right? So now what we'd like to do is find an epsilon such

10
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,610
that that this training set that we've

11
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:36,300
gotten has epsilon exhausted the version space.

12
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,150
>> Okay. I got it. I think I got that.

13
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:39,690
>> You think you, you think you can work that one through?

14
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:40,110
>> Yeah.

15
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:42,470
>> Anything else that we'd have to tell you? Remember

16
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:48,820
again that These are the hypothesis in the hypothesis set.

17
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:50,170
>> huh. Yeah. Yeah. I got it.

18
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:52,730
>> Alright. Let's, let's,

19
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:53,380
let's see what you got.

20
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:54,130
>> Okay.
