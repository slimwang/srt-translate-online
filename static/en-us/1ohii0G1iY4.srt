00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:05,630
The answer is 1965- 7-14. Here's how we would calculate this using Java

2
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:10,950
Objects. We would create a Day object and specify the year, month and day as

3
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:20,240
November 28th, 1964. If we use the two string method. Shows us what's in this

4
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,960
Day object right now, which is exactly what we entered. November 18th, 1964.

5
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:34,673
And then we can add days. That's the flight time. And now, this object has July

6
00:00:34,673 --> 00:00:44,920
14th, 1965. So that's the arrival date. As a side note, this format is an

7
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:49,480
international standard called ISO 8601. It was chosen for good computer science

8
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:53,250
reasons. There needed to be a standard form used by all the different countries

9
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:57,080
so that data stored in computers could be transferred across borders. They put

10
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:01,445
the year first so that when you sort a date sort of alphabetically or

11
00:01:01,445 --> 00:01:05,150
lexicographically, don't have to know that word, it's okay. The dates will show

12
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:07,605
up in chronological order.
