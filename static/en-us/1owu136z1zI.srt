1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,840
So what I show you is, is the opening,
and we typically use a disk or a square

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:09,670
that can it can, can also smooth
contours, but it'll typically break thin

3
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:13,650
connections eliminate small islands,
so small little spurious things.

4
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:17,630
Also sometimes eliminate
some sharp peaks.

5
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:23,070
The closing can smooth contours
where they, at the, concavities.

6
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:24,780
It'll fuse narrow breaks, so

7
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:29,420
things that were supposed to be
connected but had a little hole in them.

8
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:30,340
It'll, it'll do that.

9
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:32,880
And it can, you know,
sort of fill in these gulfs.

10
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,375
So often you'll do one followed
by the other, all right?

11
00:00:37,375 --> 00:00:38,917
So here's an example.

12
00:00:38,917 --> 00:00:40,910
This is the original image, okay?

13
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:44,150
And it's, it's a fake image obviously,
just to make the point.

14
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:45,840
So here's our original image.

15
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,910
And you'll notice it has,
you know, th, this cut out here,

16
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:53,290
th, these rough edges here, this kind of
noise here, these spurious things there.

17
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:56,460
And the opening, all right,
does exactly what you think.

18
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:01,770
It'll eat away this stuff, this stuff,
that stuff, and that stuff, all right?

19
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,620
And also these little ridges up here.

20
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:06,530
A closing, all right, well,

21
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:09,935
what that's going to do is that'll fill
in this hole, so that's gone there.

22
00:01:09,935 --> 00:01:14,490
Fill in that whole thing, so that's gone
there, and fill in these things there.

23
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:17,880
Okay, remember neither opening nor
closing are going to grow or

24
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:18,875
shrink things right?

25
00:01:18,875 --> 00:01:20,750
They're not erosions or dilations.

26
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:22,880
One is a dilation
followed by an erosion.

27
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:23,950
Which one is that?

28
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:27,970
That's a close and, the other one's
an erosion, followed by a dilation,

29
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:29,060
that's an open.

30
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:34,200
Well, when you do an opening
followed by a closing, okay, so you

31
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,982
take this and then you close that, you
get rid of this, you get rid of this,

32
00:01:38,982 --> 00:01:42,780
you get rid of that, you get
the two underlying elements, okay?

33
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:46,900
So, the idea is that was what
you really wanted, all right?

34
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:50,460
And these kinds of operations
are what we use often.

35
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:54,720
So to show you a real life example of
that here's a fingerprint example.

36
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,190
Here's the original image.

37
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:57,940
You, here are the ridges
that you want to find.

38
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:00,380
There's a whole bunch of
spots you don't want to find.

39
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:05,280
There are some gaps that are not real,
right there.

40
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,830
And so what they do is they apply
an opening, followed by a closing.

41
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:12,510
And you get this really
nice fingerprint image.

42
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:15,930
Okay, so that's an example of,
of doing it for real.

43
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:18,882
Something I'm not going to talk about
now, there's something called a hit or

44
00:02:18,882 --> 00:02:19,583
miss transform.

45
00:02:19,583 --> 00:02:22,374
It's basically how to
find a particular shape.

46
00:02:22,374 --> 00:02:26,247
By the way Lynn Shapiro,
I think it's in Shapiro and Stockman, or

47
00:02:26,247 --> 00:02:28,910
another book that Lynn
was associated with ha,

48
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:32,625
in their textbook, they have a whole
bunch of stuff on morphology.

49
00:02:32,625 --> 00:02:35,800
So if you need to know more of
the details you can go get that.
