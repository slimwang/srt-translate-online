1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,399
Now let's go back to the two
location vacuum world and

2
00:00:03,399 --> 00:00:05,500
represent it in first order logic.

3
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:07,929
So first of all, we can add locations.

4
00:00:07,929 --> 00:00:12,859
We can call the left location A and
the right location B.

5
00:00:12,859 --> 00:00:16,410
And the vacuum V, and

6
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:21,170
the dirt say, D1 and D2.

7
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:28,429
Then we can have relations, the relation
Loc which is true of any location.

8
00:00:28,429 --> 00:00:31,219
Vacuum which is true of the vacuum.

9
00:00:32,298 --> 00:00:34,850
Dirt which is true of dirt.

10
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:40,689
And At which is true of an object and
a location.

11
00:00:40,689 --> 00:00:45,030
And so if we wanted to say
the vacuum is at location A,

12
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:50,049
we just say At(V,A).

13
00:00:50,049 --> 00:00:53,199
If we want to say there's
no dirt in any location,

14
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,990
it's a little bit more complicated.

15
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:00,589
We can say for all dirt and for

16
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:06,540
all locations if the d is a dirt and

17
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:10,500
l is a location, then d is not at l.

18
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:14,459
So that says there's no
dirt in any location.

19
00:01:14,459 --> 00:01:19,067
Now note, if there were thousands
of locations instead of just two,

20
00:01:19,067 --> 00:01:21,829
this sentence would still hold.

21
00:01:21,829 --> 00:01:24,620
And that's really the power
of first order logic.

22
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:27,030
Let's keep going and
try some more examples.

23
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:30,293
If I want to say,
the vacuum is in a location with

24
00:01:30,293 --> 00:01:34,838
dirt without specifying what
location it's in, I can do that.

25
00:01:34,838 --> 00:01:38,564
And I can say there exists an l and

26
00:01:38,564 --> 00:01:43,533
there exists a d,
such that d is the dirt and

27
00:01:43,533 --> 00:01:49,468
l is the location and
the vacuum is at the location,

28
00:01:49,468 --> 00:01:53,900
and the dirt is at that same location.

29
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:56,679
And that is the power
of first order logic.

30
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:01,250
Now one final thing,
you might ask what first order means.

31
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:05,150
It means that the relations
are on objects, but

32
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:08,206
not on relations, and
that would be called higher-order.

33
00:02:08,206 --> 00:02:11,099
In higher-order logic, we could say

34
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:15,879
define the notion of a transitive
relation talking about relations itself.

35
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,512
And so we could say for all R,

36
00:02:21,512 --> 00:02:27,002
transitive of R Is equivalent to for

37
00:02:27,002 --> 00:02:29,752
all a, b, and c.

38
00:02:29,752 --> 00:02:36,206
R(a,b) and R(b,c)

39
00:02:36,205 --> 00:02:41,750
implies R(a,c).

40
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:46,180
So that would be a valid statement in
higher-order logic that would define

41
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:48,438
the notion of a transitive relation.

42
00:02:48,437 --> 00:02:51,250
But this would be invalid
in first-order logic.
