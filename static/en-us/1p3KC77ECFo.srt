00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:07,150
So far, you've used the APIs Explorer to investigate and test the functions in

2
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:09,601
your applications. You've got the getProfile, the

3
00:00:09,601 --> 00:00:13,845
safeProfile. However, Conference Center application includes a full

4
00:00:13,845 --> 00:00:20,880
web UI. Each of the pages in the web UI, send calls to the endpoints

5
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,800
API on the back end. As you implement the back end functionality, the web pages

6
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,540
in the app will start to work. Right now,

7
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:30,070
they don't all work. For example, if you go to

8
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:33,340
Show Conferences, it's not going to find any conferences.

9
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:37,390
It's because the implementation, because you haven't written the code

10
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:41,200
to find conferences. But in this lesson we implemented

11
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,010
the code to get and set profiles. So the My

12
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:47,240
Profile page now works. So let's see what happens,

13
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:51,451
if I change my profile. Let me change my t-shirt

14
00:00:51,451 --> 00:00:56,970
size to, very small, extra small. Change

15
00:00:56,970 --> 00:01:02,080
my display name to Jocelyn B. I'll Update my profile. And

16
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:06,480
the profile has been updated, excellent. When I click the Update Profile

17
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:10,920
button, what happens is that this web page in behind the scenes is sending a

18
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,950
call off to the saveProfile endpoint function

19
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:16,570
that you just implemented. The goal of this

20
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:18,210
course is to help you learn how to

21
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:22,540
develop App Engine applications, not to teach you JavaScript.

22
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:24,590
However, I do want to point out the code

23
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:27,620
that makes the call to getProfile and to saveProfile.

24
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:33,470
So, now here we are in Eclipse. And you'll find the code for the webpages or the

25
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:38,140
web UI under SRC, Web app, and you'll see

26
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:41,246
there's the CSS folder, the fonts folder, the IMG,

27
00:01:41,246 --> 00:01:44,935
there's index.html, and there's a JavaScript folder

28
00:01:44,935 --> 00:01:48,280
JS. And then there's this thing called partials,

29
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:54,342
which is the HTML pages. What I want to look at first is controllers.js, because

30
00:01:54,342 --> 00:01:56,233
this has the code that calls the

31
00:01:56,233 --> 00:02:00,140
getProfile and the saveProfile methods. So let's look

32
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:03,280
at getProfile. So here's the code that

33
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,330
send the call to the getProfile endpoint function.

34
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:10,750
And you see here, it's gapi.client to

35
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:14,250
invoke the client library. And then, conference

36
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:19,840
is the name of the API. And then, getProfile is the method name. And again,

37
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:28,740
we execute. And then, here's the code to call when the request is successfully

38
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:32,060
executed. And in this case, you can see that the code's just right here in line.

39
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:37,380
It's not in a separate function. That this is the callback to call when the call

40
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:43,050
to getProfile succeeds. Let's look at saveProfile. I'll search for it.

41
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:48,868
And here it is. And again, I just wanted to point out, here's the call to

42
00:02:48,868 --> 00:02:57,350
gapi.client, or gapi.client. And then conference is the name of the endpoints.

43
00:02:57,350 --> 00:03:00,370
Then saveProfile is the method to call. And in this case we're

44
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:06,320
passing at one argument. And then we call the execute, to execute the

45
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:10,990
request. And again, here's the call. Here's. The code to

46
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:15,944
execute in the call back that's called, when saveProfile

47
00:03:15,944 --> 00:03:21,610
completes successfully. If saveProfile completes successfully.

48
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:25,410
So that's all I really wanted to point out here. I'm not going to go into the

49
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:29,420
rest of the UI code in detail. I just wanted to show you the hook where the

50
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:33,430
JavaScript issues the call to the endpoint functions.

51
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:35,000
As you go through the course, you're going to be

52
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,840
implementing the endpoint functions. And I wanted you

53
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,010
to know how they get called from the UI.
