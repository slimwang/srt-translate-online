1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:04,560
What are some of the goals of
the authentication process itself?

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:09,400
So remember, authentication in
a nutshell is a user convincing a system

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:13,910
who he or she is, so
using some technique or some method.

4
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:19,255
So obviously we're talking about the
user associated with a certain identity.

5
00:00:19,255 --> 00:00:24,730
Username for example, wanting to
authenticate herself to the system.

6
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:28,610
Whatever authentication method we use,
what do we desire from it,

7
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:30,640
what should be its goal?

8
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:35,360
First of all, when a legitimate
user tries to authenticate herself,

9
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:40,640
the system can demand some evidence but
when the right evidence is provided,

10
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,970
the system should allow the login
to complete successfully.

11
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:46,930
Well, that is called availability, okay?

12
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:51,980
The system is available to the user
who's able to provide the right evidence

13
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:55,960
to support the claim, for
example, the user is Alice.

14
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:59,670
So the system should be
available to the legitimate

15
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:03,460
user who is able to provide
the correct evidence.

16
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:08,580
In other words, we don't want
to have any false negatives.

17
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:11,500
So let's just spend a little bit
of time on what do we mean by

18
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,300
this phrase false negative
that I have here.

19
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:16,480
So negative refers to the outcome.

20
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:20,490
So if the authentication process
is successfully complete,

21
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:22,490
that is a positive outcome.

22
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:26,630
A negative outcome is when we deny
the authentication request or

23
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:27,760
the login request.

24
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:30,830
So if, for some reason,
believe the evidence is not right or

25
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:35,130
whatever it is, so we're going to say
login unsuccessful, for example, or

26
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:37,230
authentication unsuccessful.

27
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:40,360
If it's the right user providing
the right evidence and

28
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:44,720
the system still has a negative outcome,
well that is incorrect.

29
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:49,760
In fact, that outcome we see is not
a correct outcome, that result is false.

30
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:53,350
The user was the right one
with the right evidence.

31
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:57,220
Whatever method we're using,
perhaps, has a problem and

32
00:01:57,220 --> 00:02:00,470
because of that it's not
able to allow the user in.

33
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:02,310
So if the outcome is negative and

34
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:05,870
that's done incorrectly that
is called a false negative.

35
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:11,750
So false negative basically means
when we incorrectly deny access or

36
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:16,400
incorrectly decline an authentication
request, we don't want to have that.

37
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,450
We have an authentication method,
we don't want it to deny

38
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:25,360
authentication requests for right
users who provide the right evidence.

39
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,190
Well the other possibility
is the bad person,

40
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:30,570
Eve, is trying to impersonate her.

41
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:34,070
So Eve walks up to the system and
says I am Alice.

42
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:38,840
So it's the user principal that
is associated with identity,

43
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,930
which is Alice.

44
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:43,080
It's really not her and it's Eve, so

45
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:48,510
the user or principal who is not
associated with Alice identity,

46
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:52,400
we don't want that person,
or Eve, to be able to login.

47
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,480
Well, if you had a guarantee,

48
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,030
then we have authenticity in
the authentication process.

49
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:01,480
If we authenticate someone, we know for
sure that it is that person, so

50
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,490
that's the authenticity part.

51
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:07,230
And another way to sort of think about
this is that we don't want to have any

52
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:08,380
false positives.

53
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:11,960
So positive here refers to the outcome
of the authentication process.

54
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:15,860
Positive means we allow someone
to login or authenticate.

55
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:18,820
And false means we
actually make a mistake.

56
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:20,870
We do that incorrectly.

57
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:25,870
If Eve is able to login as Alice,
that is not right.

58
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:27,520
That is incorrect.

59
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,440
So that's a false positive.

60
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,170
So we don't want to have
any false positives.

61
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:35,640
The second goal that we have for
authentication is that

62
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:40,100
the right user with the right identity
and evidence should be allowed in.

63
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:43,310
That means we have no false negatives,
and

64
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:47,020
somebody who is going to
impersonate a user of the system

65
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:51,470
should not be allowed in which means
we should not have any false positives.

66
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:55,300
So these are the goals of
a good authentication method

67
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:57,310
that you would want to
implement in your system.
