00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,240
So far,
I've used only simple media queries,

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:09,790
testing only one characteristic, but in
some cases, I need more complex tests.

3
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:10,910
This media query,

4
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:17,040
only applies styles when the screen
width, is greater than 500 pixels.

5
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:21,410
And the screen width,
has to also be less than 600 pixels.

6
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:23,030
If we look at this altogether,

7
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:28,810
our media query is only applied
between 500 and 600 pixels.
