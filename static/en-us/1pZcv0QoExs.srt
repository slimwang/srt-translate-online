1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,723
Okay.

2
00:00:00,723 --> 00:00:03,583
Let's see how a very
simplified particle filter can

3
00:00:03,583 --> 00:00:05,728
help us estimate the ant's position.

4
00:00:05,728 --> 00:00:10,477
Initially, at t equals 0,
we have no idea where the ant is.

5
00:00:10,477 --> 00:00:16,867
So we might as well assume that it is in
one of these squares, any one of them.

6
00:00:16,867 --> 00:00:19,015
This is our initial prediction.

7
00:00:19,015 --> 00:00:22,127
Now the observation says that
we are on a white square.

8
00:00:22,127 --> 00:00:26,600
The likelihood of us getting a white
observation when we are on a black

9
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,074
square is really low.

10
00:00:28,074 --> 00:00:32,613
So, in our simple case, we get rid of
the particles In the black squares.

11
00:00:32,613 --> 00:00:35,318
You can think of this as a correction.

12
00:00:35,318 --> 00:00:36,002
Okay.

13
00:00:36,002 --> 00:00:38,835
Now we see that the action
taken was move up.

14
00:00:38,835 --> 00:00:42,236
So we take our entire
distribution of particles and

15
00:00:42,236 --> 00:00:44,932
we shift the whole thing up, like that.

16
00:00:44,932 --> 00:00:48,973
Any particles that went outside
the valid area are discarded.

17
00:00:48,973 --> 00:00:53,768
Now this is our best guest or
prediction at time t equals 1.

18
00:00:53,768 --> 00:00:56,693
This time,
we see that the observation is black.

19
00:00:56,693 --> 00:01:01,491
So, all the particles on white
squares are basically inconsistent

20
00:01:01,491 --> 00:01:03,185
with the observation.

21
00:01:03,185 --> 00:01:05,763
As before, we get rid of them.

22
00:01:05,763 --> 00:01:06,738
All right.

23
00:01:06,738 --> 00:01:09,931
Our next step at t equals
1 is to move left.

24
00:01:09,931 --> 00:01:17,291
Observation at time two is white, so
we get rid of all the black particles.

25
00:01:17,291 --> 00:01:18,811
Next, we move up.

26
00:01:18,811 --> 00:01:22,496
Interestingly, all the particles
on the board are consistent with

27
00:01:22,496 --> 00:01:23,537
the observation.

28
00:01:23,537 --> 00:01:26,961
At step three, we move up again.

29
00:01:26,961 --> 00:01:30,559
Now the observation at
step four is black, so

30
00:01:30,559 --> 00:01:33,313
we get rid of the white particles.

31
00:01:33,313 --> 00:01:35,309
Now we're left with only three.

32
00:01:35,309 --> 00:01:39,666
Well, from here, we move right and
the observation is white, so

33
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:43,090
we get rid of the one black particle and
that's it.

34
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:46,143
We're left with two possible
positions for the ant.

35
00:01:46,143 --> 00:01:50,404
Since we don't have any further
information, that is our best guess.

36
00:01:50,404 --> 00:01:52,600
Are you wondering where
the ant's started?

37
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,921
Well, it could have started
here at t equals 0.

38
00:01:55,921 --> 00:01:58,858
Move up, see black.

39
00:01:58,858 --> 00:02:01,239
Move to the left, see white.

40
00:02:01,239 --> 00:02:03,433
Move up again, white.

41
00:02:03,433 --> 00:02:05,966
Move up, black.

42
00:02:05,966 --> 00:02:12,108
Move to the right and you see white,
but that's one possible path.

43
00:02:12,108 --> 00:02:17,088
The other starting point could have been
down at the bottom here, same thing.

44
00:02:17,088 --> 00:02:19,249
You move up, black.

45
00:02:19,249 --> 00:02:20,514
Left, white.

46
00:02:20,514 --> 00:02:22,175
Up, white.

47
00:02:22,175 --> 00:02:23,556
Up, black.

48
00:02:23,556 --> 00:02:26,633
Right, white.

49
00:02:26,633 --> 00:02:29,330
So particle fillers, useful aren't they?
