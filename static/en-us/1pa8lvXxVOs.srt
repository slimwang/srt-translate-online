1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:04,980
But what about policies in
commercial environments?

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:09,250
First of all, when you go work for
a company, they might do a background

3
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:14,030
check on you, but they don't clear
you at secret or top-secret levels.

4
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:18,330
So clearance is really not common when
it comes to these types of environments.

5
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:25,060
However, there are other requirements
that may arise in these kind of places.

6
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:28,250
If we talked about,
we go back to our payroll.

7
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:31,050
If you are a payroll
department employee,

8
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:34,290
then you can access applications
that have to do with payroll.

9
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:36,338
But others should not
be able to do that.

10
00:00:36,338 --> 00:00:41,320
So one requirement could be that data
is accessed by certain applications and

11
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:45,800
only certain users be able to gain
access to certain kind of applications.

12
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:49,270
Requirement may be that non-payroll
department people don't have

13
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:51,610
access to the payroll application.

14
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:55,720
Other requirements that
arise in these commercial

15
00:00:55,720 --> 00:01:00,680
environments is conflict of interest,
is pretty common.

16
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:03,910
So if you're a law firm,
have two customers, and

17
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:07,570
there's some competitive
relations in between those, and

18
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:10,490
a lawyer working on one case
should not have access to

19
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:14,235
data that belongs to the other company,
when those two companies compete.

20
00:01:14,235 --> 00:01:19,280
Separation-of-duty typically is good for
reducing the likelihood of fraud.

21
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:25,350
So if one person can do multiple things,
it's easier for them to commit fraud.

22
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:30,280
In commercial environments, clearance
is not there, BLP's not very useful,

23
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:33,820
but perhaps, the need for
mandatory access control is there.

24
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:38,790
So we want to look at some models
that may make sense in this setting.
