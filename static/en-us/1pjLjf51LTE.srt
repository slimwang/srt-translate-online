1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:03,760
So letâ€™s go ahead and
see how to answer these questions.

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:08,630
So the following statements here in
Java create a projection, selection and

3
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:10,100
selectionArgs variable.

4
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:15,880
And then performs a query on our pets
table and receives a cursor as a result.

5
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:21,780
Now this collection statements here
translate into this row SQLite query.

6
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:24,480
Note that when checking for
a quality in SQLite,

7
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,630
you can use a single equal sign or
a double equal sign.

8
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:29,960
And here I've used a single equal sign.

9
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:33,700
So let's walk through how each
part of the Java statements

10
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,380
maps to apart in SQLite statement.

11
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:42,660
So first of, selecting breed and weight
come from the projection up here in Java

12
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:48,170
which is made up of these two columns,
our PET_BREED and our PET_WEIGHT.

13
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:51,080
Next the table name that
we're querying from in SQLite

14
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:55,820
comes from the first parameter
of our query method up in Java.

15
00:00:55,820 --> 00:01:00,032
And lastly, our WHERE statement
here comes from the selection and

16
00:01:00,032 --> 00:01:01,840
selectionArgs variable.

17
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,120
So this selection here,
we have our COLUMN_PET_GENDER.

18
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:08,110
And this expression plus

19
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:13,010
the selectionArgs which we've narrowed
down to the GENDER_FEMALE constant.

20
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:16,060
And remember that mapped back
to the constant value 1.

21
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:22,050
And as a whole, this means our WHERE
statement becomes WHERE gender=1.

22
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:25,900
And remember we put these into
our query method down here.

23
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:30,230
So this selection criteria will show
only female pets from the table.

24
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:34,890
And this means our resulting cursor
contains these following two rows.

25
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:37,920
So visually,
here's how adding those parameters

26
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,230
narrows the information to
the cursor that we want returned.

27
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:45,220
So first, we're selecting
all the pets from our table.

28
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:48,290
Next, we know the constraints
by adding this WHERE statement.

29
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:52,330
Now we've limit it to just
these two rows of female pets.

30
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:56,950
And then lastly, we only want to
select the breed and weight columns.

31
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:02,040
So this means we just get these
two columns from these two rows.

32
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:05,750
So, back to the quiz question of
describing the resulting cursor where

33
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,840
we saw that it has two rows, and

34
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,190
the columns that were present
were the breed and the weight.
