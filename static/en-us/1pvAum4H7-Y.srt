1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
I've gone and I've fetched some art.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
In this case, you can probably guess what it's going to be.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Title Batman--let's paste him in here.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
And when I click submit, we see our Batman.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Pretty neat, huh?

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Now we have this nice art channel.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
So this is our html.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I've been including these classes, and I keep referring to,

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
oh, these are good for styling things and this area is good for styling things.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'm going to go ahead and show you a few styles here

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
that just make this app a little bit better.

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
So you can add a style tag.

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
This has type text/css.

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
We are not going to quiz you at all on this.

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
In a lot of our homeworks and stuff going forward,

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'll provide the styles,

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
but I'm going to pop in a few here that I wrote.

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Okay, I just pasted in a bunch of styles,

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
and I'll just walk you through them real quick, because it's fairly easy to read.

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Basically, the syntax is body.

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
So this means our body tag is going to have a font family--sans serif

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
so we'll get rid of the serifs.

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
It's going to be with 800 pixels.

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
This is a trick for centering it and giving some padding.

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Our error style that we added for our error message--

26
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
that's going to have red text.

27
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Our label, instead of being displayed inline,

28
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm going to make it display block, which is going to cause it

29
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
to use its own line.

30
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
And I'm going to make the font bigger.

31
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Our input for our title--I'm going to make that wider with 400.

32
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I'm going to make the font size bigger.

33
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'm going to add some padding.

34
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
That padding is kind of spaced between the outside of the element and the contents.

35
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm going to make our text area wider and taller

36
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
and give it a bigger font

37
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
and also make it a monospace font, which is good for ASCII art.

38
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm going to make the text of our submit button bigger.

39
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'm going to add some margins between these elements

40
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
that our HR--our rule--is going to have

41
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
20 pixels on either side.

42
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Our artwork is going to have 20 pixels between each of them.

43
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
And our art titles are going to be bold,

44
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
and they're going to be 20 pixels tall--the font.

45
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
And our art body is not going to have any margin on it,

46
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
and its font size is going to be 17 pixels.

47
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
So I know that was a lot.

48
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
You don't have to know this, or really even have to understand it.

49
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I just want you to know what it does or what it is.

50
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
And let's go to our browser and see how this looks.

51
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
So here's our old page.

52
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I'm going to reload this with our new styles.

53
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Oh, yeah, look at that.

54
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Now we've got this big form, nicer fonts,

55
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
and a big, big, much nicer Batman

56
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
and a much nicer camel. 25

57
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Just a few little styles can go a long way to making

58
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
a web app look a lot nicer, actually.

59
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Okay, so I hope you enjoyed that.

60
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I hope you learned something.

61
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
That's the end of this unit.

62
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Your next homework is going to be basically using these skills I just demonstrated.

63
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
So I hope you had fun with that.

64
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Thanks for participating so far.
