00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,590
Remember back in lesson two 
when Katherine used

2
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:07,450
an AsyncTask hooked up to
a refresh button to update our data?

3
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:10,290
Rato talked about how 
that was a bad idea

4
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:14,510
because the AsyncTask is not tied 
to the activity life cycle.

5
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:17,970
The virtual machine will hold on
to the activity object

6
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:21,470
as long as the AsyncTask is running, 
even after Android

7
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:26,130
has called onDestroy for the activity
and expect it to be discarded.

8
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:28,380
If you rotate your phone, 
the behavior is to destroy

9
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:31,810
your activity and instantiate a new one.

10
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:35,400
The naive AsyncTask implementation 
now has two threads

11
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:38,780
trying to perform the same update, 
and so forth.

12
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:41,130
The point is, it's not 
the best pattern

13
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:43,586
for a potentially 
very long background operation,

14
00:00:43,586 --> 00:00:45,944
such as fetching from web services.

15
00:00:45,944 --> 00:00:48,410
If you leave the app, 
the AsyncTask will continue to run

16
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:51,340
for as long as your process is kept alive,

17
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:53,890
but will run at a low priority, 
and your process

18
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:56,290
will be the first thing 
to be killed if the device

19
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:58,153
needs more resources.

20
00:00:58,153 --> 00:00:59,836
And there's a bigger problem.

21
00:00:59,836 --> 00:01:02,330
Your app has to be visible 
and running in the foreground

22
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:04,772
to instantiate the task 
in the first place.

23
00:01:04,772 --> 00:01:06,436
Because we started a task,

24
00:01:06,436 --> 00:01:08,720
to update the weather 
when we started the app,

25
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:13,070
this can have undesirable behavior 
if the weather changes rapidly.

26
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:16,110
So now we're going to learn
the right way to perform updates.

27
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:18,700
We'll want to automate 
the process while the app

28
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:20,263
is in the foreground.

29
00:01:20,263 --> 00:01:22,946
But even more importantly,
we want the app to get

30
00:01:22,946 --> 00:01:26,380
regular updates in the background 
with minimal battery drain.

31
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:28,970
That will be especially important 
later in this lesson

32
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:31,010
when we introduce 
weather notifications.
