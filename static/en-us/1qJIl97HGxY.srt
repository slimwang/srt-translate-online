00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,980
With these two concepts, states and events in mind,

2
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:07,689
let's think a little bit about modeling of behavior. Systems that

3
00:00:07,689 --> 00:00:12,170
respond to events are called reactive systems. If you think about it for

4
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:16,050
a minute that's much different than this other kinds of systems that you would

5
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:20,300
normally build, in which it's the system in charge of controlling the order in

6
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:25,560
which things happen. Here is the external world which supplies the stimuli that

7
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:30,050
are causing things to happen in the system, the system has to react to them.

8
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:35,900
In general there are a variety of different approaches to modeling behavior.

9
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:41,480
We're going to go through from the simplest, which is combinatorial systems.

10
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:44,050
Through sequential systems, to the most complex and

11
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:49,820
concurrent systems. In combinatorial systems, we're just concerned with states

12
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:55,300
no events. Sequential systems have states, that is they have memory, but

13
00:00:55,300 --> 00:01:01,498
they're linearly ordered one state after another. And then concurrent systems.

14
00:01:01,498 --> 00:01:05,820
Particularly asynchronous concurrent systems have lots of states and

15
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:10,870
lots of events and the events are happening at unpredictable moments of time.
