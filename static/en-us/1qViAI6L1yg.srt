1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,670
The new caches object has potential.

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:07,430
It's very easy to use,
it's asynchronous, and it's fast.

3
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:12,710
But there are two big catches.

4
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:16,280
First, like local storage,
it's transactional.

5
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:20,170
So it's possible that there is
a risk of over writing data.

6
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:24,230
The other issue is that the caches
object isn't available everywhere yet.

7
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,526
So you're going to need
to feature detect and

8
00:00:28,526 --> 00:00:31,400
potentially polyfill for some browsers.
