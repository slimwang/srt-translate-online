00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:04,635
If we have three sample means and their means are very close, then they're less

2
00:00:04,635 --> 00:00:10,808
likely to differ significantly. Similarly if the means are far apart from each

3
00:00:10,808 --> 00:00:16,094
other, then they're more likely to different significantly. This is called

4
00:00:16,094 --> 00:00:20,650
between group variability. And that's what we're trying to measure. You already

5
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:24,737
found that we're interested in the grand mean and the average squared deviation

6
00:00:24,737 --> 00:00:30,046
of each sample mean from the grand mean. And we're going to keep building on

7
00:00:30,046 --> 00:00:30,940
these ideas.
