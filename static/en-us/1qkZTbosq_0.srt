00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,983
This area would be x squared. And this one would be 2x. Great job if you got

2
00:00:04,983 --> 00:00:10,215
both of those correct. This shape has one side of x and another side of x. So it

3
00:00:10,215 --> 00:00:15,074
really makes it a square. So the area has to be x times x, or x squared. For

4
00:00:15,074 --> 00:00:19,893
this rectangle, we know one side is 2 and this other side is x, because this

5
00:00:19,893 --> 00:00:24,285
side is x. So we have 2 times x, or 2x.
