1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:03,969
So now typically the world constructor actually takes a vector which represents

2
00:00:03,969 --> 00:00:08,164
the gravity in the word. Now since we're a top down game we don't really have a

3
00:00:08,164 --> 00:00:12,449
2D gravity vector so we leave this at 0 0 for now. Now the second variable is a

4
00:00:12,449 --> 00:00:15,614
little tricky. This is a boolean value which tells Box2D whether or not an

5
00:00:15,614 --> 00:00:18,686
object is allowed to sleep in the world given some threshold of tolerance for

6
00:00:18,686 --> 00:00:23,066
their computation. For our purposes we don't want to let objects sleep, so set

7
00:00:23,066 --> 00:00:24,220
this to false.
