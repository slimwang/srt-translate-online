1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,420
What about unsupervised learning?

2
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:04,939
>> Right, so unsupervised learning
we don't get those examples.

3
00:00:04,939 --> 00:00:07,750
We have just essentially
something like input, and

4
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:11,720
we have to derive some structure
from them just by looking at

5
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,595
the relationship between
the inputs themselves.

6
00:00:13,595 --> 00:00:17,669
>> Right so give me an example of that.

7
00:00:17,669 --> 00:00:18,280
>> So.

8
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:25,445
When you're studying different kinds
of animals, say, even as a kid.

9
00:00:25,445 --> 00:00:27,540
>> Mm-hm.
>> You might start to say, oh,

10
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:29,310
there's these animals that
all look kind of the same.

11
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:30,270
They're all four-legged.

12
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:32,020
I'm going to call all of them dogs.

13
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:34,050
Even if they happen to be horses,
or cows, or whatever.

14
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:36,410
But I have developed,
without anyone telling me,

15
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:39,030
this sort of notion that all
these belong in the same class.

16
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:40,339
And it's different
from things like trees.

17
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:42,700
Which don't have four legs.

18
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:46,340
>> Well some do, but I mean, they have,
they both bark, is all I'm saying.

19
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:48,990
>> Did I really set you up for that?

20
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:49,870
>> Not on purpose.

21
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:51,880
>> I, I'm sorry, I want to apologize
to each and every one of you for that.

22
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,180
But that was pretty good.

23
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:54,580
Michael is very good at word play.

24
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:56,670
Which I guess is often
unsupervised as well.

25
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:58,871
No, I get a lot of [LAUGH].

26
00:00:58,871 --> 00:01:01,060
>> [LAUGH] You certainly
get a lot of feedback.

27
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:01,640
>> Yeah, that's right.

28
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,520
So I say, please stop doing that.

29
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,960
>> So if supervised learning is
about function approximation,

30
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,540
then unsupervised learning
is about description.

31
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:11,360
It's about taking a set of data and

32
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,160
figuring out how you might divide
it up in one way or the other.

33
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:16,470
>> Or maybe even summarization
it's not just the description but

34
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:17,430
it's a shorter description.

35
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:18,970
>> Yeah, it's usually concise.

36
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:20,510
Compression.

37
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:21,850
>> Compact description.

38
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:25,355
So I might take a bunch of pixels
like I have here it might say, male.

39
00:01:25,355 --> 00:01:26,810
>> [LAUGH] Wait, wait, wait, wait.

40
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:27,590
I'm pixels now?

41
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,570
>> As far as we can tell.

42
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:30,620
>> That's fine.

43
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:31,560
>> I however, am not pixels.

44
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,440
I know I'm not pixels.

45
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,560
I'm pretty sure the rest
of you are pixels.

46
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,770
>> That's right.
>> So I have a bunch of pixels, and

47
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:36,252
I might say male.

48
00:01:36,252 --> 00:01:37,750
And or I might say female.

49
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:38,970
Or I might say dog.

50
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:40,160
Or I might say tree.

51
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:43,030
But, the point is I don't have a bunch
of labels that say dog, tree, male,

52
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:43,550
or female.

53
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:47,790
I just decide that pixels like
this belong with pixels like this.

54
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:50,980
As opposed to pixels like something
else that I'm pointing to behind me.

55
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:53,880
>> Yeah we're living in a world right
now that is devoid of any other objects.

56
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:54,660
Oh, chairs!

57
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:55,400
>> Chairs!
Right.

58
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:58,940
So these pixels are very different
than those pixels because of

59
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:00,870
where they are relative
to the other pixels.

60
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:02,170
Say, right?

61
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:02,960
So, if you were looking-

62
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,250
>> I'm not sure that's helping me
understand unsupervised learning.

63
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:06,190
>> Go out and, go outside and

64
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:10,190
look at a crowd of people and try to
decide how you might divide them up.

65
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:11,830
Maybe you'll divide
them up by ethnicity.

66
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:15,840
Maybe you'll divide them up by
whether they have purposefully shaven

67
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,560
their hair in order to mock the bald or
whether they have curly hair.

68
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,880
Maybe you'll divide them
up by whether they have

69
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:24,540
goatees,
>> Facial hair.

70
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:25,492
>> Or whether they have grey hair,

71
00:02:25,492 --> 00:02:27,020
there's lots of things that
you might do in order,.

72
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:28,560
>> Did you just point at me and
say grey hair?

73
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,300
>> I was pointing and
your head happened to be there.

74
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:30,970
>> Oh come on.
>> Pixels,

75
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:31,510
>> Where's the grey hair?

76
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:35,361
>> It's a two dimensional, right there,
it's right where your spit curl is.

77
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,120
All right.

78
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,640
>> Okay.
So, imagine you're dividing the world

79
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,390
up that way.

80
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:40,710
You could divide it up male, female.

81
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:43,486
You could divide it up short, tall,
wears hats, doesn't wear hats,

82
00:02:43,486 --> 00:02:44,980
all kinds of ways you can divide it up.

83
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:47,750
And no one's telling you the right way
to divide it up, at least not directly.

84
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:48,690
That's unsupervised learning.

85
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:50,100
That's description, because now-

86
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:52,635
>> Mm.
>> Rather than having to send pixels of

87
00:02:52,635 --> 00:02:56,786
everyone, or having to do a complete
description of this crowd,

88
00:02:56,786 --> 00:03:00,264
you can say there were 57 males and
23 females say.

89
00:03:00,264 --> 00:03:02,888
Or there are mostly people with beards.

90
00:03:02,888 --> 00:03:04,071
>> So on.
>> Or whatever.

91
00:03:04,071 --> 00:03:05,105
>> I like summarization for that.

92
00:03:05,105 --> 00:03:05,651
That seems good.

93
00:03:05,651 --> 00:03:06,233
>> I like summarization for that.

94
00:03:06,233 --> 00:03:07,489
>> Yeah.
>> It's a nice concise description.

95
00:03:07,489 --> 00:03:08,266
That's unsupervised learning.

96
00:03:08,266 --> 00:03:09,165
>> Good.
Very good.

97
00:03:09,165 --> 00:03:09,849
>> And practice.
>> And that's different from

98
00:03:09,849 --> 00:03:10,410
supervised learning?

99
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:13,630
>> It's different in supervised learning
and it's different in a couple of ways.

100
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:16,400
One way that it's different
is all of those ways that we

101
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,600
could have just divided up the world.

102
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,530
In some sense are all equal either.

103
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:23,780
So I could divide up by sex or

104
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:27,660
I could divide up by height or I could
divide up by clothing or whatever.

105
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:31,700
And they're all equally good absent
some other signal later telling you

106
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:33,170
how you should be dividing up the world.

107
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:36,920
But supervised learning directly
tells you there's a signal.

108
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,925
This is what it ought to be,
and that's how you train.

109
00:03:38,925 --> 00:03:39,550
And those are very different.

110
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:42,420
>> Now, but I could see ways that
unsupervised learning could be helpful

111
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:44,420
in the supervised setting, right?

112
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:47,660
So if I do get a nice description, and
it's the right kind of description,

113
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:50,930
it might help me map to, it may help me
do the function approximation better.

114
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:53,265
>> Right, so instead of taking
pixels that input, as input, and,

115
00:03:53,265 --> 00:03:55,110
and labels like, male or female.

116
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:57,871
I could just simply take a summarization
of you like how much hair do

117
00:03:57,871 --> 00:03:59,892
you have your relative height,
the weight, and

118
00:03:59,892 --> 00:04:01,990
various things like that
that might help me do it.

119
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:02,740
That's right.
And by the way,

120
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:05,490
in practice this turns out to be
things like density estimation.

121
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:07,910
We do end up turning it into
statistics at the end of the day.

122
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,820
Often.

123
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:12,020
>> But
it's statistics from the beginning.

124
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:13,930
But when you say density estimation.

125
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:16,010
>> Yes.
>> Are you saying I'm stupid?

126
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:18,901
No.
>> All right so

127
00:04:18,901 --> 00:04:20,670
what is density estimation?

128
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:22,040
>> Well they'll have to
take the class to find out.

129
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:22,660
>> I see.

130
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:23,160
>> Okay
