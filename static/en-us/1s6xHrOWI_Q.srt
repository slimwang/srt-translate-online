1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,640
Courses and students are an example of an aggregation.

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:07,120
That is, you can shut down a course without shutting down the students.

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,890
Persons and spouses is a plain old association.

4
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:13,420
They have independent lifetimes, and

5
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:16,400
there's no containment relationship between them.

6
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,460
However, bank accounts and patrons is an aggregation.

7
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:22,670
That is, a patron can have a bank account.

8
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:24,240
Finally fonts and glyphs.

9
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,120
They're composition.

10
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:28,690
If we get rid of a font, we get rid of all the glyphs that are in the font.
