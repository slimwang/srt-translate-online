00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,150
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01,150 --> 00:00:04,720
I hope you're refreshed after importing
your first libGDX project and

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:08,240
I'm sure you're dying to learn how to
create those sweet particle effects.

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,580
Before we get to that, though, we should
start out with some simpler drawing.

5
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:14,300
So in this level we're first going to
learn a bit about about how the computer

6
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:15,740
drawing pipe line works.

7
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:19,240
With a brief detour into color theory,
and how your eyeballs work.

8
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:22,480
Then we'll talk about the main
entry point into libGDX games,

9
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,860
the Application Listener Interface.

10
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:28,500
We'll implement an application listener,
and then use ShapeRenderer to draw some

11
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,509
simple shapes, some pretty flowers and
even some fancy fractals.

12
00:00:32,509 --> 00:00:33,130
Let's get started.
