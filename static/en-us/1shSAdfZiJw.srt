00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
[Thrun] Now, to understand the explain away effect,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:11,000
you have to compare this to the probability of a raise given that we're just happy

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
and we don't know anything about the weather.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
So let's do that exercise next.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:24,000
So my next quiz is, what's the probability of a raise given that all I know is that I'm happy

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and I don't know about the weather?

7
00:00:26,000 --> 99:59:59,999
This happens to be once again a pretty complicated question, so take your time.
