00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
All right. So, it's another one of these puzzle-like questions.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This time, I've written out three context-free grammars, and then down here at the bottom,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
there are five strings that I want to be in the language of the grammar.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Check all that apply. Which of these grammars can produce these five strings?
