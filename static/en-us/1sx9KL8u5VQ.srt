00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:04,740
You've derived several schemes for
a distributed bitonic merge.

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:09,060
But in fact this computational pattern
of a butterfly network appears in at

3
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:12,080
least one other very famous algorithm.

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,350
Sadly, that algorithm was lost on
the way to developing this course.

5
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:18,290
I wonder if you've seen it, though.

6
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:20,490
Do you know what algorithm
I'm talking about?

7
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:22,940
If you do I want you
to type its name here.

8
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:25,200
If you don't then just
type in a funny joke.
