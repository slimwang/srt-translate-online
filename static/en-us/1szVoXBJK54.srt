1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:02,410
So things are looking great.

2
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:05,410
But at the moment,
we're only adding things to a database.

3
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:07,240
At some point,
you'll end up with thousands and

4
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:08,480
thousands of items in there.

5
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,350
And the browser's going to go,
hey, you know what?

6
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:13,050
I've had enough of you doing that.

7
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:15,210
You're not allowed any more storage.

8
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:18,180
So we need to make sure we're
only keeping what we need.

9
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:21,190
And it looks like this
is going to be your job.

10
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:22,130
Mike?

11
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:24,140
This is kind of a tricky one.

12
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,810
>> Yeah, but they've played with
all the commands and tools.

13
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:28,370
They can do this.

14
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:31,430
In this task, you're going to ensure
the database only has 30 Witter

15
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:34,020
items in it at any single time.

16
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:36,070
Some of the methods have
been subbed out for you, so

17
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:37,970
you want to check out that code.

18
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:42,200
To do that, run git reset --hard to
remove any local changes you have.

19
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:47,060
Then git checkout task-clean-db
to get the stubbed methods.

20
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:51,699
Now head over to
public/js/main/IndexController.js.

21
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:55,410
Down in underscore on socket message,

22
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:58,180
we're already adding
items into the database.

23
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:03,020
But after that, you need to ensure there
are no more than 30 in the object store.

24
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:10,190
The code in public/js/idbtext/index.j.s
should act as a good reference.

25
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:14,250
Again, if your database gets into
a bad state, go into dev tools and

26
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:18,300
run indexedDB.deleteDatabase and
pass at the parameter wittr.

27
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:21,590
This will remove the database and
let you start fresh.

28
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:25,500
Once you put the code in place, refresh
wittr in the browser to run your code.

29
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,855
I recommend shift refreshing to bypass
service worker until you've got

30
00:01:28,855 --> 00:01:30,630
everything working.

31
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:33,180
Then bump the version of
the service worker static cache

32
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:34,990
to pick up your changes.

33
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:38,240
If everything's working, you should
see the wittr database in dev tools.

34
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,480
And in there,
you should see no more than 30 messages.

35
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:44,450
To double check everything is working,
head to the settings page.

36
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:47,440
And type idb-clean into the test field.

37
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,148
And press Enter.
