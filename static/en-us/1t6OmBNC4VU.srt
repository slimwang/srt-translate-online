00:00:00,126 --> 00:00:02,763
A picture is worth a thousand words,
right?

2
00:00:02,763 --> 00:00:06,440
So I want to show you a few
examples that will help you develop

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:09,321
the right mindset for
creating better forms.

4
00:00:09,321 --> 00:00:11,259
This is an example that is good.

5
00:00:11,259 --> 00:00:14,549
Notice how it is quick to finish.

6
00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:16,897
Notice the placeholders.

7
00:00:16,897 --> 00:00:19,503
The fonts are visible and big enough.

8
00:00:19,503 --> 00:00:21,412
Notice the progress bar.

9
00:00:21,412 --> 00:00:24,094
And this is an example that is not so
good.

10
00:00:24,094 --> 00:00:26,742
Notice how it is hard to finish.

11
00:00:26,742 --> 00:00:29,481
Notice that you don't see any progress.

12
00:00:29,481 --> 00:00:31,257
The font is too small.

13
00:00:31,257 --> 00:00:35,130
I hope you noticed the patterns
that well-designed forms share.

14
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:36,210
In the next video,

15
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:40,067
Cam and I will summarize the principles
of a well-designed forms.
