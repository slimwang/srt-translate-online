00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,620
In summary then, the organization of a

2
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:06,270
computer system is consistent enough that many of

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:09,810
the key operating system concepts apply to all

4
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:13,670
of them regardless of size and capacity. On

5
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:15,970
the other hand, these differences should not

6
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:19,660
be ignored and advances in hardware have helped

7
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:22,630
drive innovation in operating systems, so that we

8
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:24,690
can get the most out of their capabilities.
