1
00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:06,110
They print 39. The cursor starts right here. And then, we print 3. But since

2
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:10,210
it's just print and not print line, it doesn't go down to the next line. So

3
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:14,818
then, the cursor is right here. And then, it takes the 4 plus 5. And since

4
00:00:14,818 --> 00:00:17,624
there aren't any quotes, it adds them together and gets 9 and prints right

5
00:00:17,624 --> 00:00:22,115
here. And then, since its print line our cursor would go down to the next line.

6
00:00:22,115 --> 00:00:28,968
But then, we don't print anymore, so we don't notice that. We can see that if

7
00:00:28,968 --> 00:00:32,792
we make a program. So, we add all these pieces that we need to make the

8
00:00:32,792 --> 00:00:37,184
computer happy, And then, we add our own code then we close it all up and run

9
00:00:37,184 --> 00:00:41,084
it, and it prints out 39.
