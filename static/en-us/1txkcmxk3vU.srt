1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
That was a tricky question, and you couldn't really know the answer

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
if you've never seen probability before,

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
but the answer is 0.25.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
And I will derive it for you using something called a truth table.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
In a truth table, you draw out every possible outcome

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
of the experiment that you conducted.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
There were two coin flips--flip 1 and flip 2--and each had

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:31,000
a possible outcome of heads, heads; heads, tails; tail, heads; and tail, tail.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
So when we look at this table, you can see every possible outcome of these two coin flips.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
There happens to be four of them.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
And I would argue because heads and tails are equally likely,

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
each of these outcomes is equally likely.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Because we know that the probability of all outcomes has to add up to 1,

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
we find that each outcome has a chance of a quarter, or, 0.25.

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Another way to look at this is the probability of heads followed by heads

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
is the product .

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
What are the chances of the first outcome to be heads

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
multiplied by the probability of the second outcome to be heads?

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The first is 0.5, as is the second.

20
00:01:16,000 --> 99:59:59,999
And if you multiply these two numbers, it's 0.25, or, a quarter.
