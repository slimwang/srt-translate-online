00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:05,030
Here, the final solutions are 3 plus or minus 3 times the square root of 2.

00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:08,588
Great work if you found those answers. The coefficient in front of this x

3
00:00:08,588 --> 00:00:13,364
squared term is a 1, since it's not listed. So, a equals 1, b equals negative

4
00:00:13,364 --> 00:00:17,790
6, and c equals negative 9. We substitute the values of a, b, and c into our

5
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:22,371
quadratic formula, being sure to use parenthesis around each of the values. So,

6
00:00:22,371 --> 00:00:26,592
we'll have positive 6 for the negative of b, we'll have 36 for squaring b, and

7
00:00:26,592 --> 00:00:32,976
then we'll have positive 36 for negative 4acC. Here, the denominator will just

8
00:00:32,976 --> 00:00:38,367
be 2, 2 times 1. We have 36 plus 36 in our radical, so really, that's 2 times

9
00:00:38,367 --> 00:00:43,713
36. I leave it like this since I can take the square root of 36, which is 6.

10
00:00:43,713 --> 00:00:47,997
The 2 stays inside of our radical, and then we simplify it by dividing each of

11
00:00:47,997 --> 00:00:54,201
these terms, 2 into 6 equals 3 and 2 into 6 radical 2 is 3 radical 2. Another

12
00:00:54,201 --> 00:00:57,540
way to think about this is we could factor 2 from these two 6s, leaving us with

13
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:02,782
this numerator. We cancel the common factors that reduce to 1, leaving us with

14
00:01:02,782 --> 00:01:06,430
3 plus or minus 3 root 2, our final solutions.
