00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,890
Okay, so you changed around the code so
the +3 Point button

2
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:07,630
would actually add plus three points,
and continually increase.

3
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:10,480
Now, I want you to do it for
the +2 Points button, and

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,110
the Free Throw button.

5
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:13,850
Take a moment to think.

6
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:16,630
Do you need to create any
additional variables to do this?

7
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:18,030
Yes, or no.

8
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:20,500
After you've answered this,
go ahead and update your app.
