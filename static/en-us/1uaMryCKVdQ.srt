00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:05,680
Going back to what Rato said, frame layout, linear layout, and relative layout

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:09,790
are three of the most common layouts you will use in building out your UI.

3
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:13,860
These all descend from the view group class, designed to contain and

4
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:17,870
give order to child views. They each have their strengths and

5
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:21,080
you should always try to use this simplest layout that will get the job done.

6
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,240
Frame Layout is great for simple layouts when you only have one child to view,

7
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,560
like a list view that fills the entire content area. Linear layout is

8
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:35,640
perfect for stacking the views vertically or horizontally, one after another,

9
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:40,610
it is also the only way to break up the display proportionately. Relative layout

10
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:45,200
is powerful but a bit more complicated compared to the others. Throw a bunch of

11
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,490
views inside a relative layout, and then you can configure each views

12
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:53,070
position relative to parent, the relative layout, or to sibling views, tons of

13
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:57,320
possibilities. We'll explore these layouts in greater detail when we build more

14
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:02,010
complex screens. For now, let's get back to building our forecast list.
