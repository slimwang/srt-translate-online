00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:06,391
Well, slope is run over run, or y2 minus y1 divided by x2 minus x1. So the slope

2
00:00:06,391 --> 00:00:12,507
of this first line is just 2. We rise 2 and then run 1 to the right. The slope

3
00:00:12,507 --> 00:00:18,475
of this line is one half. We rise up 1 unit and then 2 units to the right for

4
00:00:18,475 --> 00:00:22,732
the run. I'm noticing a pattern here. Do you see it?
