00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,660
Today, we'll talk about configuration. Configuration is a very routine kind of

2
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:09,200
design task in which all the components of the design are already known.

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:13,630
The task now is to assign values to the variables of those components so

4
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:15,949
they can be arranged according to some constraints.

5
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:21,860
Configuration will be your first part under the unit on designing creativity.

6
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:25,950
We'll start by talking about design, then we'll define configuration. Then we

7
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:29,660
trace through the process of configuration, a specific measure called planned

8
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:33,810
refinement. Finally, we'll connect configuration to several earlier topics we

9
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:37,530
have discussed such as classification, case based reasoning, and planning.
