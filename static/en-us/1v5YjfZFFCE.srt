00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:04,724
Finally, you get to program. Most of our exercises will be in JavaScript. Even

2
00:00:04,724 --> 00:00:08,252
if you don't know JavaScript, you should be able to get through the first few

3
00:00:08,252 --> 00:00:12,140
exercises without too much difficulty. Your goal in this exercise will be to

4
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:16,670
draw a square. To start with, you have to create a geometry object which allows

5
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:21,030
you to add vertices to it. Which lets you make triangles and squares and so on.

6
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:25,308
So, this geometry object will consist of vertices along with a face. Vertices

7
00:00:25,308 --> 00:00:29,703
are the corners of a polygon, usually a triangle. Once we've created our

8
00:00:29,703 --> 00:00:34,720
geometry object, we add vertices by pushing them onto the array. Basically, push

9
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:38,546
means add to the end of an array. And JavaScript keeps track of how large the

10
00:00:38,546 --> 00:00:41,937
array is and so on, you don't have to worry about allocating space for it. And

11
00:00:41,937 --> 00:00:47,558
these are our three vertices. We use Vector3 for both points and vectors within

12
00:00:47,558 --> 00:00:52,182
3JS, within this library. So, these are floating point numbers in fact. And

13
00:00:52,182 --> 00:00:58,497
define three points in x, y and z coordinates. A geometry object also has faces

14
00:00:58,497 --> 00:01:03,790
in it. By using a Face3, we define three different vertices that we're going to

15
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:08,077
make a single face out of. In other words, we're going to define a triangle. The

16
00:01:08,077 --> 00:01:13,837
way that face indices work is they point to the various vertices in the array.

17
00:01:13,838 --> 00:01:18,330
So, this is vertex zero. We always start counting from zero. Vertex 1 and vertex

18
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:24,308
2, and by listing out those indices, 0, 1 and 2, so these are integers, that

19
00:01:24,308 --> 00:01:28,523
says this triangle has this, this, and this vertex.
