Question I'd like you to answer for me is,

2
00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:03,390
going to the URL that we were just at,

3
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:07,110
the New York Times RSS listing. Here's the URL.

4
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:09,320
We'll also include this in the notes below so you

5
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:14,490
can copy and paste it. Use urllib and minidom in Python to download this

6
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:19,950
page and tell me how many item elements are in that listing.

7
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:25,120
Remember the, the function, get elements by tag name will be particularly

8
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:28,270
useful to you on a minidom objects. Okay, have at it.
