1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The answer is no, that it is actually impossible to construct one.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This function must be deterministic, so it produces the same output for the same input.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
We want it to produce uniform distribution

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
so that means it needs to add randomness

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
to what comes in, but that's impossible.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Since it's deterministic, the only randomness it could use is what's provided by x.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
So there's no way to amplify that to provide more randomness in the output.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
So, this is actually impossible.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
We're going to assume they exist anyway.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
And the assumption is that, even though it's impossible

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
in theory to do this, in practice we can build hash functions

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
that provide mappings that are computationally

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
very difficult and indistinguishable from uniform

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
by an adversary with a reasonable amount

15
00:00:43,000 --> 99:59:59,999
of computational resources.
