1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:04,844
So we know that formal techniques and
design and validation and

2
00:00:04,844 --> 00:00:08,320
all that, that moves you up the scale.

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:14,320
In fact, EAL7 is the formally verified
most rigorous requirement, so

4
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:21,090
since they only got EAL4, it is more the
systematic review and testing process.

5
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:24,430
It doesn't have to be formal techniques,
okay?

6
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:28,310
Systematic review and testing process
was used by the developers, and

7
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:32,290
that's why they ended up at EAL4,
which is not bad.

8
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:35,900
So the two takeaways are what you do and
how well you do it.
