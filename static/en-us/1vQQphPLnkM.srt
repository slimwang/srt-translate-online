00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:02,910
To reinforce your understanding
of reinforcement learning,

2
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:05,840
you're going to take on
a project from a new technology.

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:08,370
In the first video in this unit,
we actually talked about smart cabs, and

4
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:10,390
that's the project you're going to do.

5
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:13,120
Given some information about
maintenance, about navigation,

6
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,880
about safety,
can you design a smart cab that can

7
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:18,630
learn over time how to
drive safely on the roads?

8
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:21,770
Can you design a smart cab that will
learn over time how to avoid accidents

9
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:23,350
that have happened in the past?

10
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:25,738
Or can optimize its route more
efficiently in the future?

11
00:00:25,738 --> 00:00:27,620
That's what you'll deliver for
this final project.
