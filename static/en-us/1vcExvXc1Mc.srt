1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:04,840
So here's a t-table that applies to statistical

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:09,290
estimates with fewer than 30 samples. And the

3
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:13,590
way to read through this on the left you see the degrees of freedom which is the

4
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:18,910
number of samples minus 1. So if you have 10 samples it would be 9, if there are

5
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:24,950
15 samples it would be 14. On the top, you'll see 1 minus the confidence level.

6
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:29,898
So if you want 95% confidence, you go to 0.05. If you

7
00:00:29,898 --> 00:00:34,722
want 98% confidence, you go to 0.02. Now there's a slight

8
00:00:34,722 --> 00:00:39,580
distinction here. There's a 1-tail and a -2tails. So far, we've

9
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:44,780
talked about 2-tails in which, we always cut off tails left

10
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:49,990
and right of our confidence interval. There are occasions, which we'll

11
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:53,130
talk about later, where we should just cut off one side.

12
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:57,460
And those often occur in the context of testing

13
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:00,690
hypotheses. Now for the time being, please just look

14
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:03,640
at the 2-tails number over here. And ignore all

15
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:08,510
those 1-tail numbers in this table. Okay? So just

16
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:09,720
to make sure you know how to read this

17
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:14,150
table. Suppose we have n=8 samples and we look

18
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:16,390
for a 90% confidence interval. What number would you

19
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:18,610
find in this table to be the magic number?
