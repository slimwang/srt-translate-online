00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:02,830
Let's test your knowledge
of how to lay out.

2
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:05,170
What if I want to place
the record button here,

3
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:07,380
on the lower right of the screen?

4
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:08,480
What constraints would we need?

5
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:11,310
Write your answer below.

6
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:14,840
Remember, if you're in doubt,
add the button and next code and

7
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:17,580
play around with adding and
removing constraints until you

8
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:21,810
get it to appear correctly in the bottom
right corner of the iOS simulator.
