00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,850
In the spec which also do send,
I describe how to take the new

2
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:08,010
settings activity class I just sent you,
and allow the user to choose between

3
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:11,390
sorting by published time,
list name, and owner email.

4
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:14,050
But before you get wrapped up
too much in Android Studio,

5
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:15,790
I had a quick question about sorting.

6
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:18,530
What order by method do you think
each of these different sorts we'll

7
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:19,700
need to use?

8
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:23,840
As a hint, remember that push IDs have
a sort of special property to them.

9
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,820
So think about it and
let me know your answers here.
