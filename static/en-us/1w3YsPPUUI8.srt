1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:05,520
Inherent in any component technology is that technology's component model,

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,810
also called the component's framework.

3
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:12,470
A component model is a set of shared assumptions about the component syntax,

4
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:14,640
semantics and composition.

5
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:17,740
Component syntax includes how components are specified,

6
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:21,848
which need not be in the same language as the one in which they are implemented.

7
00:00:21,848 --> 00:00:26,360
The semantics prescribes what information is in the component's contract and

8
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:29,810
what is the nature of the environment in which the component runs.

9
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:33,360
Component composition specifies how components work with other components.
