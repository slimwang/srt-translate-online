1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,640
For this problem, we're about the claim the spaceships.

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:07,520
Actually, we're dealing with the Apollo 13 mission. We should go from 1970.

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:11,090
They were supposed to take astronauts from the earth and land them on the moon.

4
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:14,080
However, at some point during the trip, they encountered a problem

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,300
with one of their oxygen tanks and they had to abort their mission of landing on the moon

6
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:21,970
and instead figure out how to get the crew back to the earth safely.

7
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:24,960
Well in this problem, we're going to show how changing the velocity of the ship

8
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:30,720
using boost rockets can change the trajectory of the ship to make it loop around the earth

9
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,620
instead of landing on the moon and bring it back to where it started on the earth.

10
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:38,550
This is definitely the most complex part that we've given you so far.

11
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:41,390
So don't worry if it seems a little bit complicated at first.

12
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:45,640
I'm going to help you out by continuing to chunk and giving you some hints.

13
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:48,710
As always, we told you some important information to start up with.

14
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:51,680
We have some information about the earth and gravity,

15
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,410
and also significant information about the moon including the period of the moon

16
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:58,260
or the time that it takes the moon to orbit around the earth.

17
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:02,100
Well, once you have unique value that you see here is no initial angle

18
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:05,630
and this is just the angle at which the moon is initially placed from the earth.

19
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:10,240
This is a zero degree or 0 radian line and the angle between this line

20
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:15,250
and the position vector of the moon is equal to moon initial angle.

21
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:19,830
Let's have the total duration of the flight that we're considering in the times measured in meters

22
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:23,710
which has resulted to local truncation air that we're going to allow the flight path to have.

23
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:25,440
Well, Jorn mentioned this brief in the unit,

24
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,970
and I'll give you little bit more explanation about it in a minute.

25
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:32,260
We've laid out five tasks for you to complete to make it fundamental as a cohesive halt.

26
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:35,050
The first one, which you can see right here, is to find

27
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:37,240
the moon's position vector as a function of time.

28
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,730
And here we're going to consider the earth is the origin here,

29
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:44,030
as the position vector of the moon is just the vector from the earth to the moon.

30
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:46,290
Now remember this is dependent on time.

31
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:49,900
You can also say that the moon is going to move in counter clockwise around the earth

32
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:52,550
or at least that's how it looks in this picture.

33
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:54,050
Then the next thing that you need to figure out

34
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:57,590
is how to calculate this spaceship's acceleration to the gravity.

35
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:00,530
Well the input here is time and position.

36
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:06,290
The position right here is not the same as position that you just computed in the task above.

37
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:11,400
Instead, this position is a position of the spacecraft and not of the moon.

38
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:17,160
So the second task is going to define the position of the spaceship depending on time

39
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:20,150
and then you need to figure out how the gravitational attraction

40
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:23,950
to the earth and to the moon affected deceleration.

41
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:27,650
You think about how you can use vectors to do this and also as I said earlier,

42
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:29,420
pretend that the earth is not the origin.

43
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:33,730
Well, each of the first two tasks notice what your return values are

44
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:38,600
and make sure that you define variables with the event in their proper places and it's function.

45
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,170
So now you come to the slightly trickier part.

46
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:45,250
In order to adjust the spaceship's trajectory to make it go around the moon,

47
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:48,020
and then back in the right spot on the earth.

48
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:52,400
It would be helpful if the crew had some control over it's velocity during the flight,

49
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,150
lucky for them and lucky for us too.

50
00:02:55,150 --> 00:03:00,670
Those spaceship has rocket mechanisms that will allow to reduce it's speed on the way to the moon

51
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:03,210
and increase it's speed on the way back to the earth.

52
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:07,990
And we applied boost function right here. We've created two variant variables for you.

53
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:11,620
And now I'm going to help you program some of these changes in velocity.

54
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:15,830
This first one first two mid course correction or MCC

55
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:19,440
and this task is whether or not the initial deceleration has occurred.

56
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,960
Right now, it's set to false since at the beginning of the flight, this hasn't happened yet.

57
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:28,280
Similarly, we have a second variable which at first does descent propulsion system or TPS.

58
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,410
And this represents a second change in velocity.

59
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:34,060
And the amount of which we're going to change the velocity at this point

60
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:36,820
is what we're going to call the variable boost.

61
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:40,830
Now, at these two moments, remember that we want to change just the management of the velocity.

62
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:44,410
We don't want to mess with the direction at all. That would deal with itself.

63
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:48,470
So, if your task is going to be to include these two velocities shifts

64
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:53,610
and of course include them at the right times which I listed in the code.

65
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:56,750
You can notice in the setup position of velocity vectors for you right here

66
00:03:56,750 --> 00:04:00,570
and plugged the initial values as well; however, it's up to you to figure out

67
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:05,820
how to adjust their values with each step using Jorn's method and adapt a step size.

68
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:08,760
You're going to that down here in this while loop.

69
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:11,690
Here's Jorn's for you just to help you out a little bit.

70
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:14,760
Once you calculated position and velocity using Heun's method.

71
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:18,190
We also need to adjust the step size of the end of the while loop

72
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:22,260
to reset it was a new value for the next time that we go to the loop.

73
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:27,770
Now, just as we did in section 12 of the unit, we're going to store whatever the present step size is as h.

74
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:31,710
And whatever the step size that would be in the next step of h new.

75
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:35,110
To figure out the relationship between h and h new,

76
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:38,130
you need to calculate the local truncation error or LTE.

77
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:41,650
We also use basically the error that is made in a single time step.

78
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:45,510
The difference after each time step between exact quantity

79
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:48,890
and the quantity estimated by the approximation method that we're using.

80
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:52,990
So new step size, h new is going to depend on the current step size,

81
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:56,760
the tolerance, which we gave you earlier and the LTE.

82
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:00,210
So consider calculating a local truncation error takes into account

83
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:04,960
the difference between the values of position calculated by Euler and by Heun

84
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,070
and the difference in values of velocity.

85
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:11,660
T right here is the total duration of the flight so far.

86
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:16,370
This needs to be here to let all of the units line up and LTE to be measured in length.

87
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:20,510
Once you filled everything in, we're going back to the top of the applied boost function

88
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:24,700
and figure out what the proper value of the constant boost is.

89
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:28,070
Remember that our goal is to get the spaceship all the way around the moon

90
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:31,580
and then have it just as it touches the earth when it comes back.

91
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:36,520
Once you filled in everything down here, go back to the top of the applied boost function

92
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:40,110
and figure out what the proper value for the constant boost is.

93
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:46,260
We've given you just an initial value of zero, but we've also given you some other values to try out.

94
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:48,760
So try plugging each these in and see what happens.

95
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:52,470
Remember that our goal is put the spaceship all the way around the moon

96
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:58,080
and then come back the earth and just touch the place where it initially took off.

97
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,130
And because of the total time that we set at the top of our code,

98
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:06,430
the shoot trajectory is not actually going to stop in the plot right initially when the ship gets to the earth.

99
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:09,090
Instead, it's going to continue out in the earth as the spaceship

100
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:11,840
is going to go back to the moon the second time.

101
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,120
And the reason we did this was to try to make it a little bit easier for you

102
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,780
to tell which value of the boost you should use.

103
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:21,470
The correct value of boost will have the tail of it's trajectory

104
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:25,250
reaching just back to the radius of the moon's orbit.

105
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:30,030
Incorrect values of these could make the trajectory end short, go off in the wrong direction,

106
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:34,240
but even if the spaceship crash into the earth which we definitely don't want to happen.

107
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,010
And I'm sure the crew doesn't either.

108
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:40,740
Well, now that this is a complex problem, but I'm sure you'll be able to return the crew safely home.

109
00:06:40,740 --> 99:59:59,999
If you need any help, just come to the front
