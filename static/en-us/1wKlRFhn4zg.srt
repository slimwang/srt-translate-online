00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:03,570
So we've reach the end of unit four. I hope you

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:06,710
feel like you understand at a high level what's going on in

3
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:09,150
a web browser, what's going on when you request a page

4
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:12,680
over the internet. There's certainly lots of details, we're not going to cover

5
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:15,130
them all in this class. But I think you should have

6
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:18,010
a pretty clear picture of everything that's going on. There's nothing that's

7
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:19,805
magic here, everything can be understood.

8
00:00:19,805 --> 00:00:22,200
Everything's done by sending messages across

9
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:26,220
the internet and getting responses back and the responses are just text

10
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:29,160
that are processed either by your web browser or now by

11
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,810
your very own web crawler that you've written, and now you've got

12
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:35,060
a search engine that can respond to queries. So, congratulations for

13
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:38,420
making it to the end of Unit Four. There'll be a homework

14
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:40,880
to do now, and in Unit Five we're going to look at

15
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:44,285
the problem of how to actually make our search engine scale. The

16
00:00:44,285 --> 00:00:48,150
search engine that we've built in unit four works, it gives us

17
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:51,270
responses to queries, it doesn't do that in a very fast or

18
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:54,220
smart way. That's what we're going to improve in unit five. We're

19
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:56,920
going to make it so that we can respond to queries much faster

20
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:59,750
than we can with the code that we've written so far.

21
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:01,870
And then in unit six we're going to look at the very interesting

22
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:04,720
question of how do you find the best response for a

23
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,660
given query. We don't usually want to get all the pages that contain

24
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:11,130
the search word we're looking for. What we want to do is get

25
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:14,120
the best page. And that's what we'll look at in unit six.
