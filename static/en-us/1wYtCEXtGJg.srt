1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:04,460
So, which of the two methods Forward or
Inverse warping is better.

2
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:08,570
Usually, the inverse is much better
because it eliminates holes but

3
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:12,680
it does require an invertible warp
function which is not always possible.

4
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:15,190
Again we're not going to talk
much about this anymore here, but

5
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:18,280
I do encourage you all to start
looking up this in more detail.

6
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,580
This kind of stuff is of course covered
in much more detail in computer graphics

7
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:23,090
classes.
