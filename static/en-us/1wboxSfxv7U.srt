1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
The answer is $80 per square foot, and we get this by just dividing $112,000 by 1400.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:16,000
It turns out that this data set has this amazing property that the cost per square foot is constant.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
That allows us to interpolate the way we just did.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
In statistics that's often not the case, but I want to congratulate you.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
You did your very first unit of statistics.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Congratulations. You completed Unit 1.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,000
But as we go forward, we're going to look into data where the cost might not just be

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
a constant factor times the size of a home.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
See you in the next unit.
