1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:04,370
So all three people that Lauren just mentioned are considered by society to be

2
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:08,710
very intelligent people. The truth is, we don't really know their intelligence.

3
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:12,254
They never took IQ tests. In fact, there's reason to believe that Darwin for

4
00:00:12,254 --> 00:00:16,906
example, was only average in his IQ. But these people still accomplished great

5
00:00:16,906 --> 00:00:21,550
things. So what's going on here is that psychologists, when they use the word

6
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:25,574
intelligent. They mean something much more specific than the way people use the

7
00:00:25,574 --> 00:00:29,980
term in every day life. So what did all three of these people have in common?

8
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:34,128
They were all very creative. They were able to generate new ideas in new fields

9
00:00:34,128 --> 00:00:39,109
of study. So psychologists make a distinction between creativity and

10
00:00:39,109 --> 00:00:43,985
intelligence. So we do this because they're really different things. So the

11
00:00:43,985 --> 00:00:48,608
research on the relationship between intelligence and creativity has shown that

12
00:00:48,608 --> 00:00:54,379
the correlation is only about 0.20 between them. Meaning that knowing someone's

13
00:00:54,379 --> 00:00:59,200
IQ only tell us a very little bit about their level of creativity. So for

14
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,680
instance, someone could be really high on intelligence and not all that

15
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:07,610
creative. Likewise, someone could be really creative and not score all that

16
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:11,676
high on IQ. Although they probably would be at least average or maybe slightly

17
00:01:11,676 --> 00:01:13,820
above average on intelligence.
