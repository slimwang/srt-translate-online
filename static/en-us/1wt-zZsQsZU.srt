00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Here is a sequence of MDP questions.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
We're given a maze environment with 8 fields

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:16,000
where we receive +100 over here and -100 in the corner over here.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Our agent can go north, south, west, or east, but actions may fail at random.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:30,000
With probability "P," and P is a number between 0 and 1, the action succeeds,

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
and with 1 - P we go into reverse.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
For example, if we take the action go east into this state over here,

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
with P probability we find ourselves over there.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
With 1 - P we find ourselves right over here in the exact opposite direction.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Here is the east action again. With P we go to the right, and with 1 - P we go to the left.

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Of course, if you bounce into a wall we stay where we are.

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
For my first question, I'll assume P equals 1.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
There is no uncertainty in action outcome, and there is no failure.

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The state transition function is deterministic.

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I want you to fill in for each state the final value after running value iteration to completion,

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:19,000
and please assume the cost is -4 and we use gamma equals 1 as the discount factor.

17
00:01:19,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Please fill in those missing six values over here.
