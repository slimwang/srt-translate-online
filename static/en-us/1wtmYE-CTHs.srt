00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,600
Borderline personality disorder is a serious mental illness, and it's

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:08,454
categorized by unstable moods, thoughts and behaviors. People with this

3
00:00:08,454 --> 00:00:12,788
disorder have difficulty regulating their emotions and thoughts. They engage in

4
00:00:12,788 --> 00:00:15,777
impulsive and reckless behavior, and they have difficulty maintaining

5
00:00:15,777 --> 00:00:20,679
relationships with other individuals. In addition, people with this disorder

6
00:00:20,679 --> 00:00:23,965
have out of control emotions, they're afraid of being abandoned, and they

7
00:00:23,965 --> 00:00:30,038
vacillate between idolizing and despising those who are close to them. People

8
00:00:30,038 --> 00:00:33,866
with this disorder are more likely to experience self-injury, such as cutting

9
00:00:33,866 --> 00:00:39,862
themselves, burning themselves, or even attempting suicide. Moreover, they're

10
00:00:39,862 --> 00:00:43,396
more likely to experience substance abuse, eating disorders, or anxiety

11
00:00:43,396 --> 00:00:48,616
disorders. Interestingly, cultural factors or social factors may increase the

12
00:00:48,616 --> 00:00:53,500
risk of this disorder. For example, living in a community or culture that has

13
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:57,280
unstable family relationships could increase the risk of borderline personality

14
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,880
disorder.
