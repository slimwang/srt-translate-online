Hey, I'm here with Jesse Toth,
a backend Ruby developer at GitHub.

2
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:07,030
So Jesse, when I was first reading
through the Ruby documentation when I

3
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:09,610
was learning to code,
I felt pretty discouraged.

4
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:12,960
And I'm glad that I didn't give up then,
though, because

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,080
otherwise I wouldn't have ended up with
this awesome career in technology.

6
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:21,839
So, could you share with us a time or
a moment that you felt discouraged or

7
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:24,578
that maybe you weren't cut out for this?

8
00:00:24,578 --> 00:00:26,695
And how do get through that?

9
00:00:26,695 --> 00:00:27,878
>> Definitely.

10
00:00:27,878 --> 00:00:30,348
I mean, looking at the Ruby docs
myself there's a lot there.

11
00:00:30,348 --> 00:00:32,978
And there's no way to
learn all of it at once.

12
00:00:32,978 --> 00:00:35,667
There are definitely times
where I've been struggling for

13
00:00:35,667 --> 00:00:38,728
almost a whole day to try and
figure out something, that in the end,

14
00:00:38,728 --> 00:00:41,684
it seemed really simple but
I didn't understand it at the time But

15
00:00:41,684 --> 00:00:44,288
I had to struggle through it and
learn different things.

16
00:00:44,288 --> 00:00:47,358
And along the way, I learned
about not just that problem, but

17
00:00:47,358 --> 00:00:49,730
what was underneath that problem.

18
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:53,810
>> So, when you encounter a problem,
you see it more so

19
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:57,970
as a challenge to overcome rather
than as a, I messed up, right?

20
00:00:57,970 --> 00:00:58,788
>> Yeah, absolutely.

21
00:00:58,788 --> 00:01:01,801
It can be frustrating to get stuck and
to feel like you don't know, but

22
00:01:01,801 --> 00:01:04,599
once you get pass that then
you've learned something.

23
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:06,638
And you've added a new
tool to your toolbelt.

24
00:01:06,638 --> 00:01:07,320
>> That's awesome.

25
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,978
We've all got our own personal obstacles
or concerns when learning something new.

26
00:01:11,978 --> 00:01:12,910
What are some of yours?
