00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Let's talk about a problem that often occurs in robotics called a "systematic bias."

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
It goes as follows.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
When you ordered your car, you believed the front wheels were 100% aligned,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
but your mechanic made a mistake, and he aligned the wheels a little bit at an angle.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Now, for people that isn't a big concern. When we notice this we just steer a little bit stronger.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
But let's try this out with out our proportional controller.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I'm now adding a line that sets the steering drift to be 10 degrees,

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
which in radians is this expression over here, using set<u>steering</u>drift command.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I now want you to run my proportional controller with parameter 0.2,

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
and for now we're going to set the differential controller to zero.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
When you do this, what happens?

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
It works just as before or it causes a new, big crosstrack error?

13
00:00:49,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Go try it out.
