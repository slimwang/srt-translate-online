The answer is it should be a Web Corpus and a keyword. We want to use the Web

00:00:04,944 --> 00:00:08,784
Corpus to encapsulate both the index and the ranking information, so we

3
00:00:08,784 --> 00:00:12,772
shouldn't need to pass both of those in. We still need a keyword. We don't want

4
00:00:12,772 --> 00:00:15,943
the keyword to be part of the Web Corpus object, since the Web Corpus is the

5
00:00:15,943 --> 00:00:19,153
result on the crawl, doesn't know about the keyword we're searching for.
