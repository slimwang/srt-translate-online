1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:04,310
So let's get back to this example, where I would sing about this concept, and

2
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:07,223
we want to know if it's going to help students learn and increase their

3
00:00:07,223 --> 00:00:13,454
engagement. But let's pretend that after I sing, the 20 students exposed to

4
00:00:13,454 --> 00:00:20,118
this lesson report a mean engagement score of 7.13. So remember, they're rating

5
00:00:20,118 --> 00:00:23,962
their engagement from 1 to 10, and then we're going to take the average rating

6
00:00:23,962 --> 00:00:29,202
of those 20 students, and we get 7.13. For now, let's not focus on student

7
00:00:29,202 --> 00:00:34,460
learning. So first of all, what should the z score be for this sample mean?

8
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:39,452
Just to remind you we're pretending that the population mean was 7.5, and the

9
00:00:39,452 --> 00:00:45,697
population standard deviation was 0.64. So, remember, when we find the z score

10
00:00:45,697 --> 00:00:51,170
of a sample mean, we look at it compared to the whole sampling distribution
