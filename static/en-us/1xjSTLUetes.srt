1
00:00:00,005 --> 00:00:02,945
So this transparency is what I want to use to kind of

2
00:00:02,945 --> 00:00:05,720
introduce the term of alpha-blending.

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:07,700
Let's see what that means.

4
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:13,260
So by doing a multiplication that I have done here with 0.34 before each and

5
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:17,262
every image, what I've done is basically added kind of

6
00:00:17,262 --> 00:00:20,670
a [INAUDIBLE] do a mixing of different types of things.

7
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:23,690
So basically what I've done is I've made the original image,

8
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:28,530
compared to the next one, transparent by 34%.

9
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:32,870
So in essence transparency is what an alpha is referred to as.

10
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:38,960
So in essence what actually that means is I've actually converted and given each

11
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:44,980
one of them and made each of them transparent by 34% from the original image.

12
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:46,871
This is referred to as an alpha and

13
00:00:46,871 --> 00:00:50,910
it usually varies from 0 to 1 whereas 0 is completely invisible.

14
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:54,660
Remember if I multiplied by 0 here you would not have

15
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:56,840
seen Leonardo Da Vinci at all.

16
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:01,090
If I multiply by 1 you would have seen him completely visible.

17
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:05,830
Of course it would have had changes to your dynamic range of the pixel values

18
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:09,960
here, but this guy, Mr. Da Vinci, would have been perfectly visible.

19
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,510
And similarly I could play around with these numbers for all of them.

20
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,380
So alpha varies from 1, 0 to 1, where 0 is invisible and 1 is fully visible.

21
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:19,212
So, in essence,

22
00:01:19,212 --> 00:01:22,324
one of the ways we could do this is now basically add another layer.

23
00:01:22,324 --> 00:01:25,750
So RGB up to three layers of the image or three channels.

24
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:29,265
An alpha could be another channel, which would have values from 0 to 1.

25
00:01:29,265 --> 00:01:34,890
And RGB would have, of course, then since the values from 0 to 255.

26
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:41,450
This additional number, alpha value, could be also be computed and put inside

27
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:45,700
those channels or kept separately and actually dealt with as a different mask.

28
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:51,670
And this is an interesting way of being able to now create a separate mask,

29
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:54,780
which we will then be able to play around with for different applications.

30
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,700
Again, something we will come back to as we look at many examples.
