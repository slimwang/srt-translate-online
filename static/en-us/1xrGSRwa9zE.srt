There are a few ways to solve this one. Here's the approach I took. I knew that

2
00:00:04,209 --> 00:00:08,135
the cylinders were all the same length, so I created just one. I then, reused

3
00:00:08,135 --> 00:00:12,770
this cylinder's geometry to make each cylinder object. To get the four rotation

4
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:17,228
axes, I realized these formed an x shape. If I could enumerate all four

5
00:00:17,228 --> 00:00:21,070
directions in my loop, I'd be done. So, that's what this tricksy code does here.

6
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:26,766
It gives me negative x, negative z on the first iteration, negative x, z on the

7
00:00:26,766 --> 00:00:31,628
next, and so on. I then normalize this x and then use it as usual. You could

8
00:00:31,628 --> 00:00:36,243
also solve this one by using just two rotation axes and flipping the sign of the

9
00:00:36,243 --> 00:00:40,090
theta, rotating each pair of cylinders in opposite directions.
