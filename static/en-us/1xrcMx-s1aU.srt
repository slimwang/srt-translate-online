1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
All right, this time we're going to do just a tiny bit differently.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
What we're going to do is we're going to search this graph starting from b

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and we're going to mark as we go the order in which we've added things to the open list.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
So, we started off with b, the only thing on the open list, we visit both the neighbors of b

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:24,000
add them to the open list, pull c off the open list, add it's neighbors d, b,

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and we work on d, take it off the open list, add its neighbors e and c.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Now, we can take e off the open list, add its neighbors f and, well this is already done.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Take f off the open list, add its neighbors g and this is already done.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Take g off the open list, its neighbors are all already done, nothing is added.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Take a off the open list, its neighbors are already done, okay, we're finished.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
So, I want you to do this starting from d and make a note of the numbers

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
as you add them and let me clean this up, okay.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I want you to try this just like I did starting from d this time and write the numbers underneath,

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
and when you're finished, when the search is completed,

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
take whatever number you have under a, take whatever number you have under g,

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
add them together, and put it in this box here.
