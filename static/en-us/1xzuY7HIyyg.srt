1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,690
An IDS can also be
deployed in an end host.

2
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:06,757
And such an IDS is a host-based IDS.

3
00:00:06,757 --> 00:00:10,126
It can use a variety of
data on system activities.

4
00:00:10,126 --> 00:00:15,250
For example,
most host-paced IDS use ptrace to obtain

5
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:20,580
the system calls made by the program to
monitor the behaviors of the program.

6
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:24,590
System called data is very
useful to security monitoring

7
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:29,910
because whenever a program requests
a resource such as memory allocation,

8
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:32,340
access to the file system, networks, and

9
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:36,890
IO devices, it needs to make a system
call to the operating system

10
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:40,950
because the operating system
manages the system resources.

11
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:43,280
That is, most of the interesting or

12
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,840
useful activities by program
are carried out through system calls.

13
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,500
For example if the users
browser receives a page with

14
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:57,780
a malicious JavaScript that is able to
break the protection in the browser and

15
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:01,220
attempts to overwrite
the Windows registry file,

16
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:06,390
the IDS will observe a write
system call to the registry file.

17
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:09,020
And can decide that this is an anomaly.
