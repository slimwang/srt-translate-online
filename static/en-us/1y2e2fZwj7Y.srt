00:00:00,112 --> 00:00:03,400
I'm going to start with an example from unit three. You are

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:07,080
asked to define a procedure union, that takes inputs as two lists

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:10,170
and modifies the first input list to be the set union of

4
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:14,230
the two input lists. We had the lists of pages to Crawl

5
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:16,930
as well as the pages that we found linked from the

6
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:19,830
current site and we wanted to combine those in a new list

7
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:22,560
of pages to Crawl. So that's what we needed union for. So

8
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,200
that's what we did was define a procedure that took the 2

9
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,420
input lists, and output a list that was their union. This made

10
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:32,000
sense in CS101. Because we were learning about lists, and how to program

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,620
on lists. But it doesn't make a lot of sense if your real

12
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:38,230
goal is to actually do what we needed for the search engine. So,

13
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:40,360
for this quiz, what I want you to think about is, which

14
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:44,070
of the following. Would be the best thing to do if instead of

15
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:47,380
doing this as a programming exercise to learn to program, you are trying

16
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:50,510
to build a search engine and realize that what you needed to do

17
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:53,800
was union the links that you had to search

18
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,510
with the new links that you found from the current

19
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:57,490
page. Here are the options. Select the one that

20
00:00:57,490 --> 00:00:59,390
you think would be the best one to do first.
