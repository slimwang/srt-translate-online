00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,620
Let's take a quiz in which we'll take a look at an example of

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:04,810
a critical section.

3
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:08,530
The critical section that we will look at corresponds to a critical section in

4
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:12,140
a toy shop similar to the toy shop examples that we looked at.

5
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:15,560
In the toy shop, there will be new orders that will be coming in.

6
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:19,830
As well as there will be orders for repairs of toys that have

7
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:23,750
already been process, so, like, old orders that need to be revisited.

8
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:26,860
Only a certain number of threads, a certain number of workers,

9
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:31,080
will be able to operate in the toy shop at any given point of time.

10
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,815
So there will be a mutex,

11
00:00:32,815 --> 00:00:37,850
orders_mutex, that controls which workers have access to the toy shop.

12
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:40,740
Basically, which orders can be processed.

13
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:43,040
The toy shop has the following policy.

14
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,820
At any given point of time,

15
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:49,380
there can be up to three new orders processed in the toy shop.

16
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:55,750
In addition, if there is up to only one new order being processed, then

17
00:00:55,750 --> 00:01:01,750
any number of requests to service old orders can be handled in the toy shop.

18
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:06,660
The code shown in this box describes the critical section entry code that's

19
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:10,450
executed by the workers performing new orders.

20
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:14,030
As expected, we first lock the mutex and

21
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:19,560
then check a condition, and this condition must correspond to this policy.

22
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:24,820
Depending on this condition, on this predicate, we determine whether the thread,

23
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:27,650
whether the new order, can go ahead and

24
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:31,850
be processed in the toy shop, or if we must wait.

25
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:33,800
With the wait statement,

26
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:39,470
we use a condition variable new_cond as well as we include the mutex.

27
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:44,880
Because as we mentioned, a mutex must be associated with a wait statement so

28
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,190
that it can be atomically released.

29
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:50,000
The predicate statement that we must check on

30
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,300
before determining whether a thread will wait or can proceed, is missing.

31
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:59,250
For this quiz, you need to select the appropriate check that needs to

32
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:02,110
be made in order to enter the critical section.

33
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:04,220
There are four choices given here.

34
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:05,970
You should select all that apply.
