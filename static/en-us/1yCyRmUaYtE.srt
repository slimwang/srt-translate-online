1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,700
So, this command rm-rf
/ is pretty scary.

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:08,400
rm is the command for
removing files, deleting things.

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,140
The r stands for recursive, which means
that it will delete whole directories

4
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:15,350
and everything underneath them,
and the f means force,

5
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:18,660
which keeps it from checking
whether you really want to delete.

6
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:23,540
So what this command rm-rf/ does is
to delete everything on your Linux

7
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:28,170
file system, or at least everything that
your user account has access to delete.

8
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:30,980
If you wanted to delete really
everything you'd have to switch accounts

9
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:33,520
up to the super user account first.

10
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,100
But fortunately Linux has gotten
safer in the past few years.

11
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:38,200
On most systems today,

12
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:42,280
if you try to do this command, the RM
command will give you an error message.

13
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:45,080
That's because people who weren't
very nice kept telling people to run

14
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,950
this command and
made them break their computers.
