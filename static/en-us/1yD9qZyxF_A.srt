1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:03,310
DNS domains are structured as a tree.

2
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:07,461
Domains such as google.com and
udacity.com do share something,

3
00:00:07,461 --> 00:00:09,880
the com top-level domain.

4
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:12,520
There's actually a collection of
servers who are responsible for

5
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:16,329
storing all of the records for
domains in com, and

6
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:20,040
in org and edu and
each other top-level domain,

7
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:25,563
including country code demands
like uk and il and ua [INAUDIBLE].

8
00:00:25,563 --> 00:00:31,607
Now, www.example.com Is
a subdomain of example.com.

9
00:00:31,607 --> 00:00:36,598
And test.www.example.com
is a subdomain of that.

10
00:00:36,598 --> 00:00:41,620
Now, there's no rule that you can't have
hosts at any level of these subdomains.

11
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:45,540
You can have a host with an IP address
and an A record on one domain and

12
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:48,660
then have a subdomain of that
with a different host on it.

13
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:51,950
Now, early in the history of the web
it was common for an institution whose

14
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:58,780
domain was, let's say, stanford.edu to
have its web server at www.stanford.edu.

15
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:02,310
And that would have typically been
a single machine that was the web server

16
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:04,150
representing the institution.

17
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:07,780
But these days, since so many
domains are used almost entirely for

18
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:11,580
web traffic,
many organizations skip the www and

19
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:14,720
just point their domain
directly to a web server.

20
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,290
Like github.com for instance.

21
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:24,420
The name www.github.com is a C-Name,
an alias, for the A record, github .com.

22
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:27,725
Whether to use bare domains
like GitHub does or

23
00:01:27,725 --> 00:01:32,790
www domains like Udacity does is pretty
much a style and branding preference.

24
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:35,370
There's little technical difference.

25
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:38,410
For computers within an organization,
it's pretty common for

26
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:41,210
them to also have
a configured search domain.

27
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:45,190
This tells the resolver on that
computer to look up hosts inside that

28
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:46,720
domain first.

29
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,535
Like if you're on the network
of the university, example.edu,

30
00:01:50,535 --> 00:01:52,970
you might have that in
your search domain.

31
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:55,340
Then when you look up the DNS name www,

32
00:01:55,340 --> 00:02:00,300
the resolver will look for
www.example.edu first.
