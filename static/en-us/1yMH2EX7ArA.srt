1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,230
I will save the webserver.py file,
navigate to it

2
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:08,010
from within my Vagrant machine, and
execute it writing python webserver.py.

3
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:11,110
The Vagrant environment for this course
is already configured to forward port

4
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:15,530
8080 requests from the host machine
to port 8080 on the Vagrant machine.

5
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:20,780
So if we open up a browser and visit
the URL localhost8080/hello look, our

6
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:24,190
server recognized the GET request and
responded with the code that we wrote.

7
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:26,980
From the Vagrant machine, we can also
see the GET request it received from

8
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:29,970
the browser and
the code we sent as a reply.

9
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:31,570
Try and create this code on your own.

10
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:34,560
If you run in to any problems, a
functioning version of this python code,

11
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,820
can be found in the instructor notes.
