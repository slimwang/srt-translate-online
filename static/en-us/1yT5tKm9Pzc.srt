00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,530
Let's get started by asking
Sergey Brin the co-founder of Google

2
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:06,510
what the most important thing
is in building a search engine.

3
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:08,130
>> So let's get a take how to decision.

4
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:10,200
We've been here before right.

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:14,050
>> I think the most important thing if
you're going to build a search engine

6
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:17,819
is to have really good fun
corpus to start out with.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,178
In our case, we use the world wide web,

8
00:00:21,178 --> 00:00:24,680
which at the time was significantly
smaller than it was today.

9
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:27,010
But it was also very new and exciting,

10
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:30,020
there were all sorts of
unexpected things there.

11
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:33,740
There are lots of other really
interesting corpuses of information.

12
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:39,516
And, of course, we've worked on one for
books and one for

13
00:00:39,516 --> 00:00:45,210
people's, for your email, individually.

14
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:48,230
There are many, many interesting
corpuses out there and I think you

15
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:51,600
should pick the right one that you will
be excited about searching yourself.
