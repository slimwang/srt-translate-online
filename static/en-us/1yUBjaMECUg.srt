Quiz. The intrinsics have the following: a focal length,

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:09,180
a pixel x size, a pixel y size, two deg, offsets and a skew.

3
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:10,600
That's six.

4
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:12,868
But we've said there are only five degrees of freedom.

5
00:00:12,868 --> 00:00:15,982
What happened?

6
00:00:15,982 --> 00:00:19,020
A) Because f always multiplies the pixel sizes,

7
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:21,889
those three numbers are really only two degrees of freedom.

8
00:00:22,985 --> 00:00:27,070
B) in modern cameras, the skew is always zero so

9
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:29,515
we don't worry about it anymore.

10
00:00:29,515 --> 00:00:34,610
C) in CCDs or CMOS cameras, the aspect ratio is carefully controlled to

11
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:38,330
be exactly 1.0, so we don't model that anymore either.
