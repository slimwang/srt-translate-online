1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,705
For number one here,
ABC is the correct answer because

2
00:00:04,705 --> 00:00:09,716
its volatility is the same but
its total return is higher,

3
00:00:09,716 --> 00:00:14,124
so all else being equal,
higher return is better.

4
00:00:14,124 --> 00:00:19,045
In this next one,
the correct answer is XYZ.

5
00:00:19,045 --> 00:00:25,187
And the reason is, XYZ had the same
return as ABC, but it was less volatile.

6
00:00:25,187 --> 00:00:29,366
So, all else being equal,
less volatility is better.

7
00:00:29,366 --> 00:00:32,186
Now, number three was a trick question.

8
00:00:32,186 --> 00:00:39,003
[LAUGH] ABC has higher return, but
it's offset by a higher volatility.

9
00:00:39,003 --> 00:00:44,226
XYZ has lower return, but
that's offset by lower volatility.

10
00:00:44,226 --> 00:00:48,266
So, you don't really have enough
information to make the choice here.

11
00:00:48,266 --> 00:00:52,012
You can sort of stand back and
squint and look at it, and

12
00:00:52,012 --> 00:00:57,160
tell you what your gut says, but we
need a qualitative way to measure this.

13
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,060
That's what the Sharpe
ratio is all about.
