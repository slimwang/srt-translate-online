00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,680
The neurons connecting the ear to the brain are complete at around 18 weeks

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:08,235
after conception. So, does this mean a fetus can hear before it's born? The

3
00:00:08,235 --> 00:00:12,484
answer's yes. The auditory neural connections are made by about 18 weeks. But,

4
00:00:12,484 --> 00:00:16,774
the fetus doesn't start responding to sound until about 26 weeks or six months

5
00:00:16,774 --> 00:00:21,418
after conception. Fetuses actually find their mother's voice soothing and

6
00:00:21,418 --> 00:00:25,924
prefer the sound of the mother's voice over other voices. One example is

7
00:00:25,924 --> 00:00:29,458
researchers monitored the fetus' heart rate and found that it slowed when

8
00:00:29,458 --> 00:00:33,106
hearing the mother's voice, which showed that the fetus was able to attend or

9
00:00:33,106 --> 00:00:39,290
orient to its mother's voice. And it could calm him or her. However, an

10
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:42,506
increase in heart rate would indicate fear or distress, and that doesn't happen

11
00:00:42,506 --> 00:00:45,370
when a fetus hears his own mother's voice.
