1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,510
So, the last type of partners are actually key suppliers. There are two types of key suppliers.

2
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:13,170
One which you actually outsource part of your company to a third party.

3
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:18,140
It might be your accounting functions. It might be some of your sales.

4
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:21,500
It might be something as simple as doctors looking at x-rays

5
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,730
are now done by trained technicians in India.

6
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:29,680
It might be part of your supply chain for sub-assemblies or you might outsource

7
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:33,660
your entire manufacturing line, which we used to have here in the United States

8
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:37,690
to a third-party company much like Apple does with Foxconn

9
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:41,480
or your key suppliers might be traditional direct suppliers.

10
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:47,690
They simply ship your components, raw materials, iron, and ore for you to make steel, etc.

11
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:54,760
In the old days, we used to think of suppliers as not a partnership but just simply a cost to goods.

12
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:59,990
Nowadays, we understand to get the most efficient use out of our resources,

13
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:04,410
we really need a relationship that treats them like partners.

14
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:07,410
We both need to be in this to win.

15
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:12,260
We both need to understand that this is more than just a financial transaction.

16
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:17,800
So, as your startup grows, start looking for partners where you are more than just a checklist

17
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:23,890
and they're just more of a source of material and try to establish long and lasting relationships.
