1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Now that you see how this works when µ = 0.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I'd like to change it.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
When µ is not equal to 0 we call this a random walk with drift,

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
since it tends to drift in one direction or the other.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
In this case, we're going to have it drift to the right,

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:26,000
specifically, we'll say that it now has a mean of 1 and a variance of 2.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Apologize in advance. I'm sure my drawing isn't quite to scale.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Now, to really test your understanding, I'd like you to tell me

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:42,000
at 1 second and 10 seconds what are the mean and variance

10
00:00:42,000 --> 99:59:59,999
of the object's position?
