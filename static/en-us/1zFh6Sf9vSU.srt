1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:05,755
So, to learn more about the different sections of Xcode, I went up to Help and

2
00:00:05,755 --> 00:00:10,815
then clicked on Documentation, and started typing in Xcode Overview.

3
00:00:10,815 --> 00:00:14,677
And the resulting help page provided a lot of good detail, including what

4
00:00:14,677 --> 00:00:19,160
the names of these different sections within Xcode are actually called.

5
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:22,970
By the way, an online version of this document is also available in

6
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:24,370
the instructor notes.

7
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:27,020
Now, if I go back to my Xcode project,

8
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:30,540
we can see that Xcode is divided into three main sections, the Navigator on

9
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:36,480
the left, the Editor in the middle of the screen, and the Utility on the right.

10
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,240
Now, the Navigator, as the name suggests, allows us to browse through files.

11
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:44,300
Here you can see that we are making this app for iOS 8.

12
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:48,190
We are building this on iPhone and the device orientation of

13
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:52,230
the phone is Portrait, Landscape Left, and Landscape Right.

14
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:53,300
For the sake of simplicity,

15
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:57,075
however, I will only choose Portrait as the device orientation.

16
00:00:57,075 --> 00:00:59,570
Xcode created a few files for

17
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:04,080
us by default, one of which is called ViewController.swift.

18
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,379
Let's check this one out.

19
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:07,650
By the way, this code may be a little bit too small for

20
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:10,290
you to read, so let me make it a little bit bigger.

21
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:11,280
That's much better.

22
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:16,580
Notice that this file says it was created by Udacity.

23
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:19,510
Now, this for you is probably the name that

24
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:22,720
you entered under organization while you were making this app.

25
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,480
We are going to begin to write code in this file in just a few minutes.

26
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:30,920
For now, I will click on Main.storyboard in the navigator.

27
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:35,580
Now, you will notice that Xcode likes a lot of real estate, and these three

28
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:39,320
buttons here at the top right are very helpful with managing that real estate.

29
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:42,950
For instance, this button helps us show and hide the Navigator.

30
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:46,790
This button right next to it helps us show and hide the debug area, and

31
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:49,830
this is the place where you actually see error messages.

32
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:53,079
And the final button here will show and hide Utilities.

33
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:57,050
Okay, back to the Main.storyboard.

34
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:59,850
Here is where we will actually draw the things that

35
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:01,560
our user will see on the app.

36
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:05,220
It is empty for now, but by the time we are done making this app,

37
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:07,490
this is what the storyboard will look like.

38
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:10,090
These storyboards can get really elaborate.

39
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:13,010
For instance, here is a screen shot of what the storyboard for

40
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:15,650
the Udacity iPhone app looks like.

41
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:18,320
Now, one thing to notice here is that this box on your

42
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,690
screen almost looks like a square.

43
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:24,690
If you've done some work with Objective-C, another language which is used to

44
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:27,420
make iPhone apps, you will notice that this is new.

45
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:30,760
We can change the way this box looks by changing the width and

46
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,960
height settings here at the bottom of the screen.

47
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:37,550
They currently say Any, which means that this layout works for

48
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:40,280
both iPhones and iPads.

49
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:44,030
Since I'm making this app for the iPhone, I can change the layout here.

50
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:46,560
Great. This looks a little bit more like the phone.

51
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,550
Now, Xcode has a lot of other helpful features that we

52
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:51,640
will explore while making our app.

53
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:55,030
For instance, we will talk about these buttons on the left,

54
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:57,790
the cluster of these three buttons here on the right, and

55
00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:02,270
if I pull out the utility area, we'll also talk about these buttons here.

56
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:05,000
If you're curious about any of these buttons right now,

57
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,730
you can look at the handout that we have provided in the instructor notes.

58
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:11,780
Before I end this tour, I have a challenge for you.

59
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:14,770
I want you to explore Xcode and see if you can figure out

60
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:19,410
a way to run the current version of our app in a simulator inside your computer.

61
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:22,780
Once you're done with that, I want you to see if you can figure out how to

62
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:25,900
check the CPU and memory usage for our app.

63
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,080
As a quick hint,

64
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:30,840
the answer is somewhere in the documentation listed in the instructor notes.
