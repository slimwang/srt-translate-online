1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:03,740
Inconsistent writes can result in forwarding loops or

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:06,925
security policy violations where traffic ends up going to

3
00:00:06,925 --> 00:00:09,395
parts of the network where it shouldn't go as

4
00:00:09,395 --> 00:00:12,650
a result of inconsistent switch state. The ability to

5
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:15,980
respond to failures is orthogonal to consistency. A

6
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:19,160
flood of traffic at the controller technically involves problems

7
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:22,120
with reading state in a consistent fashion. But since

8
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:26,220
there also involves a step where the controller writes

9
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:29,720
state to the switches, while packets are still arriving at the

10
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:32,890
controller, I would consider that answer to be correct as well.
