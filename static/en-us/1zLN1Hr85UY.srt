00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:03,380
Let's review what we've
covered in this course.

2
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:06,432
First, we discussed the strategy for
solving a business problem,

3
00:00:06,432 --> 00:00:09,650
and stressed the importance
of understanding the problem,

4
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:13,940
the analysis needed, the decisions that
would be impacted by the analysis, and

5
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:15,979
the data that is needed
to support the analysis.

6
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:20,990
In short, spending time up front
to understand the problem and

7
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:24,140
the data available will help
ensure quality analysis.

8
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:28,819
Second, we reviewed some of
the non-predictive analysis techniques.

9
00:00:28,819 --> 00:00:32,780
And third, we reviewed a process to help
you understand the different types of

10
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:36,320
predictive models, and used
the methodology map to help determine

11
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,138
which model is best suited for
a particular business problem.

12
00:00:39,138 --> 00:00:42,875
Then we returned to our
example business problem, and

13
00:00:42,875 --> 00:00:45,700
followed the problem solving framework,
and the strategy for

14
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:49,670
selecting a model, while also learning
about Linear Regression along the way.

15
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:51,840
Congratulations, great work and

16
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,010
you're now ready to build
your first predictive model
