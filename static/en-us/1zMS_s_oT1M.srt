1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:02,330
The span in this case is logarithmic.

2
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:07,640
The reason is because par for
has logarithmic span as does reduce.

3
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:08,320
What about the work?

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,860
The work is O(n squared).

5
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:16,500
In each iteration you do a reduce,
which costs you O(i) operations.

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:21,180
So to get the total work,
you would sum overall i from 1 to n.

7
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:24,000
Notice that's a lot worse than
the best sequential algorithm,

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,250
which only has O of n operations.

9
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:28,570
So this algorithm is totally lame.

10
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:29,140
Lame!
