1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,000
So, here are the simple answers for
this one.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,650
We knew this one already.

3
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:07,210
Here the red light is
going to be hitting the t.

4
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:10,390
And the blue one is hitting r.

5
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:12,930
So, this would be my output for
this one.

6
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:14,912
And, of course, as we've seen for
everything else,

7
00:00:14,912 --> 00:00:16,043
could be flipped completely.

8
00:00:16,043 --> 00:00:21,801
Blue is, of course, r, but for
this bin, not this bin anymore.

9
00:00:21,801 --> 00:00:24,570
Similarly blue was in this bin,
and red for this bin, and

10
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:27,050
this is how I would
actually get the result.

11
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:32,030
So now, just by putting a bunch
of pinholes after the lens,

12
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:33,850
the camera plane, and pinhole here,

13
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:38,740
we were able to extract more
information about the light itself,

14
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:43,920
the rays of light, beyond just,
kind of, what were the intensities.

15
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:44,580
Right?

16
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:46,910
And that's the one thing which we
actually want to start encoding.

17
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:51,880
So when encoding the direction and
intensity of light using the simple way

18
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:56,980
of combining a camera system with
a bunch of smaller camera systems.

19
00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:01,070
The lens system and small pinholes,
but an array of them.

20
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:04,430
So, in essence what we've done is
we've added miniature pinholes

21
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:05,620
at the image plane, and

22
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:10,499
this allows us to analyze the structure
of light at each and every micro-pixel.
