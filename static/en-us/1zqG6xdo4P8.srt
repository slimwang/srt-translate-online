1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:04,160
First, as far as methods are concerned, where do the methods come from?

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:07,280
One obvious source is the operations in our analysis model.

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:12,490
In addition to the specific services provided, there are signals, okay, and

4
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:14,970
there maybe actions, activities, and

5
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:18,560
events in any behavior model such as state charts.

6
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,940
We also have to make sure that we're signing those operations in the form of

7
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:25,040
methods to particular classes.

8
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:28,660
In addition to those that come directly from the analysis model, there's others

9
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:32,670
we should always be aware might need to be included in our classes.

10
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:36,962
You should include constructors and destructors, getters and

11
00:00:36,962 --> 00:00:41,030
setters,copy constructors, printers or,

12
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:46,310
or methods that construct string versions of the data inside of a class.

13
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:48,760
Selectors, if you have, complex data,

14
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:51,060
how you're going to take out the pieces of it.

15
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:54,920
And, any kind of, iterators if you have,

16
00:00:54,920 --> 00:01:00,370
if your class has more than one, you know, is a collection class of some sort.

17
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:03,100
How are you going to provide the elements of that collection.

18
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:07,120
It's not necessarily the case that every class has to have all of these methods,

19
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:10,730
but you should be aware of the possibility of their existence so

20
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:14,440
you can determine early on whether or not that you need to define them
