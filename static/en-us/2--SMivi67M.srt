00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,024
Looking at our original inequality, and the signs of these different quantities

2
00:00:04,024 --> 00:00:07,800
that we've come up with for these various intervals, I'd like you to check off

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:11,458
which of these intervals, or values of x, does seem to satisfy our original

4
00:00:11,458 --> 00:00:15,394
inequality. Then I'd like you to write the solution as an inequality in this

5
00:00:15,394 --> 00:00:15,665
box.
