1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,538
Well, we square, or multiply the two side lengths together to get the area. So

2
00:00:04,538 --> 00:00:10,730
this first side length would be 2, since 2 times 2 equals 4. The second square

3
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:15,808
would have a side length of 5, since 5 times 5 equals 25. And the last square

4
00:00:15,808 --> 00:00:19,897
would have a side length of 9, since 9 times 9 equals 81.
