00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,104
>> Now we can come into our earlier equation and replace ax plus bx with our new

2
00:00:04,104 --> 00:00:08,282
quantity. Now we can compare a bit more easily. In fact, let's compare these

3
00:00:08,282 --> 00:00:12,236
expressions directly. Let's say for the moment that they're equal to one

4
00:00:12,236 --> 00:00:16,868
another, so that we can directly compare the coefficients. If this is the case,

5
00:00:16,868 --> 00:00:21,599
then we must have a plus b equals 5, since these are the corresponding

6
00:00:21,599 --> 00:00:27,292
coefficients of the x to the first terms. We also know that ab must equal 6. So

7
00:00:27,292 --> 00:00:33,144
you have two numbers a and b that add to give us 5 and multiply to give us 6.

8
00:00:33,144 --> 00:00:36,234
What do you think those two numbers are?
