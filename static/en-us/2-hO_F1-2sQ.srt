00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,736
So now you've seen what kind of function we write using Python to increase the

2
00:00:04,736 --> 00:00:09,214
value of any input number by 2. In other words to make the output value be 2

3
00:00:09,214 --> 00:00:14,190
grater that the input value. Now maybe you can create your own function. Can you

4
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:19,630
design a function that will take some sort of input and then of the output, be 3

5
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:24,905
lower than that. Let's see, a logical name for this function then would be,

6
00:00:24,905 --> 00:00:30,210
decrease by 3, and once again I'm going to call the input x. I'll type in the

7
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:35,667
return for you. What I'd like you to do is to fill in what you think belongs

8
00:00:35,667 --> 00:00:41,674
right here. What general expression representing the output belongs here if our

9
00:00:41,674 --> 00:00:46,140
input is x and we want our function to decrease the input by 3.
