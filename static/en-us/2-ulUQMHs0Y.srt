1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:04,300
To get started let's replace the hash
tag in our delete link with the password

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:07,070
/restaurant/ id number / delete.

3
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:09,180
Here inside my do get block.

4
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,961
I'm going to make a confirmation page
to call to the user's attention in

5
00:00:11,961 --> 00:00:13,617
the restaurant they
were about to delete.

6
00:00:13,617 --> 00:00:17,300
Within it I create a post form that
only contains the button element,

7
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:19,170
to confirm the delete.

8
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:22,500
Then I use w file to write my
output back out to the client.

9
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:26,050
Similarly to my edit post,
I grab the ID part of my URL and

10
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:28,780
create a query to find
that restaurant object.

11
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:32,729
I then call session.delete on the object
and commit the delete to the database.

12
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:35,520
I redirect once again to
the main restaurants page.

13
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,600
Let's save our code and
fire up the server one more time.

14
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:43,780
And we see that we can now create, read,
update and delete via our webpage.

15
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:45,310
All objectives complete.

16
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:46,790
And of course, the source code for

17
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:49,460
objective five can also be
found in the instructor notes.
