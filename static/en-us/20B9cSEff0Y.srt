00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:04,891
Unfortunately, the baby monkeys did not develop well socially. In fact, they

2
00:00:04,891 --> 00:00:08,308
were aggressive, anti-social, and if they did become parents themselves, they

3
00:00:08,308 --> 00:00:13,482
were abusive to their offspring. These monkeys did not have any role models to

4
00:00:13,482 --> 00:00:17,526
teach them how to parent or how to interact with other monkeys.

5
00:00:17,526 --> 00:00:20,108
>> That's right. And that's why Harlow's research was criticized so much by

6
00:00:20,108 --> 00:00:21,205
ethical groups.

7
00:00:21,205 --> 00:00:24,439
>> Although it was completely legal in the time before the Animal Welfare Act told

8
00:00:24,439 --> 00:00:27,085
us we had to treat animals ethically.

9
00:00:27,085 --> 00:00:32,438
>> However, it does demonstrate an important part about development. It reinforces

10
00:00:32,438 --> 00:00:35,427
the idea that we are social creatures and we need to have interactions for

11
00:00:35,427 --> 00:00:37,520
aappropriate development.
