00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:04,440
Let's start by looking at birthdays using ggplot. Ggplot is a

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:08,430
graphics package that allows us to make visualizations. We're using ggplot

3
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:11,340
since it's easier than the base graphics that comes with R.

4
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:13,980
It has some nice features, such as the format of plots and

5
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:16,790
legends that are automatically generated. The first thing we need to

6
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:19,920
do is to download and install the ggplot library. Now that

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,070
we have got the ggplot loaded, let's use the qplot function

8
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:26,120
to plot a histogram showing the number of users whose birthdays fall

9
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:28,790
on any given day. I can run their name pf

10
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:32,500
command to get an output of all my variables. Now, I'm

11
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,670
trying to create the date of birth by day histogram

12
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:38,220
for all my users. So, I'm going to use the date of

13
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:41,858
birth day variable, here. For the qplot function, I'll pass

14
00:00:41,858 --> 00:00:45,226
it two parameters, x and data. X is going to take the

15
00:00:45,226 --> 00:00:48,950
variable of data birthday, and data's going to take the variable pf,

16
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:51,280
which is where all my data comes from, from the pseudo

17
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,880
Facebook dataset. Running this command, I see my histogram come

18
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,680
out in a plot window below. Now, you might notice that

19
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,770
this plot is slightly different in color. If you're curious about

20
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:04,560
setting color and themes in R, see the instructor notes. Getting

21
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,780
back our code in console, you can see that we

22
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:09,840
get this warning message, when we run the code. This is

23
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,360
fine for now but, you should think about what this warning

24
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:16,490
message means. So, here's our histogram so far but, I want to

25
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:19,190
add one more layer to this plot. Let's fix the label on

26
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:22,540
the x axis, so we can see everyday of the month here. So

27
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:24,750
to adjust the x axis, I'm going to add a + sign right

28
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:28,270
after my code and then hit Return. This immediately takes me down the

29
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:32,080
next line with a little bit of indentation right here. I'm going to

30
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,700
add the layer scale x discrete and then give it the priority order

31
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:38,210
breaks from 1 to 31. This is because I want all my

32
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:41,550
days to be 1 to 31, the days of the month. And running

33
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:43,480
this code, we can see we've done a little bit

34
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:46,580
better. What are some things that you notice about this histogram?
