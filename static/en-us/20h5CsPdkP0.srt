00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,422
The numbers one, negative one, i and negative i all, when taken to the fourth

2
00:00:04,422 --> 00:00:08,813
power, equal one. In case you're curious about how exactly this works, I've

3
00:00:08,813 --> 00:00:13,076
written them all out for you here. I think probably taking negative i to the

4
00:00:13,076 --> 00:00:17,496
fourth power is the least intuitive of these, but we know that when we multiply

5
00:00:17,496 --> 00:00:22,182
two negatives together, the negative signs cancel one another our basically. So

6
00:00:22,182 --> 00:00:26,446
negative i times negative i is just i squared which is negative 1. So negative i

7
00:00:26,446 --> 00:00:30,636
to the fourth is really just negative 1 squared or 1. This is another way where

8
00:00:30,636 --> 00:00:34,860
imaginary and real numbers interact in a super fascinating way in my opinion at

9
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:39,080
least. Who would have thought that there are all these different numbers that

10
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:41,683
are multiplied by themselves 4 times equal to 1?
