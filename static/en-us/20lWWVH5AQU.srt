1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,200
There are a few terms related
to Packer that you need to know.

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:05,720
A template is a JSON
file that defines one or

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:08,760
more builds by configuring
the various components of Packer.

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,240
Packer will read the template and

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,220
use that information to create
multiple machine images in parallel.

6
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:16,720
Builders are components of Packer that
are able to create a machine image for

7
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:17,890
a single platform.

8
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:20,600
Builders read in some configuration and
use that to run and

9
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,150
generate a machine image.

10
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:24,740
A builder is invoked as
part of a build in order to

11
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:27,060
create the actual resulting image.

12
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:30,380
Example builders include VirtualBox,
VMware,

13
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:35,280
Amazon EC2 and more can be created and
added to Packer in the form of plug-ins.

14
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,850
Builders take a source image that is
different for each specific builder.

15
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:42,600
So, this Virtual Box builder
will have an ISO as a source.

16
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,792
Where as an Amazon EC2 builder
will have an AMI as a source.

17
00:00:45,792 --> 00:00:49,065
Provisioners are components
of Packer that install and

18
00:00:49,065 --> 00:00:51,645
configure software within
a running machine,

19
00:00:51,645 --> 00:00:54,815
prior to that machine being
turned into a static image.

20
00:00:54,815 --> 00:00:58,555
They perform the major work of making
the image contain useful software.

21
00:00:58,555 --> 00:01:02,345
Examples of provisioners include
shell scripts, and also Chef or

22
00:01:02,345 --> 00:01:05,084
Puppet scripts, that install software.

23
00:01:05,084 --> 00:01:08,840
Post-processors are Packer components
that take the result of a builder or

24
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:12,590
another post-processor and
process that to create a new artifact.

25
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:16,132
Examples of post-processors
are compressed to compress artifacts,

26
00:01:16,132 --> 00:01:20,710
upload/upvote artifacts, in this case,
vagrant builder vagrant box.

27
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:24,380
Artifacts are the result of a single
build and are usually a set of ID's or

28
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:26,480
files to represent a machine image.

29
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,920
Every builder produces
a single artifact.

30
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,410
And a build is a single task that
eventually produces an image.

31
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:37,130
For example, the same Packer script
could run builds for VMware,

32
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:38,710
AWS, and VirtualBox.

33
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:43,080
So Packer reads a template file,
picks the appropriate builder for each

34
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:47,310
platform that's listed in the template,
and runs a build to produce an image.

35
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:48,480
Then once the machine is up and

36
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:51,800
running on that platform using that
image, it runs the appropriate

37
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:55,980
provisioners to install whatever other
software configuration you need it to.

38
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:58,690
That's then saved out
as a modified image.

39
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:02,889
And after that's done, it optionally
runs one or more post-processors on it,

40
00:02:02,889 --> 00:02:05,740
and in the end saves
the resulting artifact.

41
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:07,470
So, given what you've seen here,

42
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:10,470
how would you switch from
Ubuntu to CentOS in Packer?

43
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:15,010
Would you run Packer on a machine or
VM that's already running CentOS?

44
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:17,990
Would you change the source
in the builder configuration?

45
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:20,950
Would you change the source in
the provisioner configuration?

46
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:24,250
Would you change the target in
the post-processor configuration?

47
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:27,420
Or is the answer that you can't,
Packer only supports Ubuntu?
