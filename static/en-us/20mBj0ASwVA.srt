1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,695
Using the beautiful soup module, we can take all this code that we wrote fairly

2
00:00:03,695 --> 00:00:07,160
painstakingly in the first three units of the class, and I know that now that

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:10,790
you're a fairly experienced programmer, it doesn't seem too hard to write this

4
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:14,900
code. But this code is actually very fragile. It only works on very specific

5
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:19,436
ways of encoding link targets and we can replace that with much simpler code

6
00:00:19,436 --> 00:00:24,000
that uses far fewer lines and works much better. We're doing that by importing

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,354
from bs4 which is a BeautifulSoup library. The BeautifulSoup definition, which

8
00:00:28,354 --> 00:00:32,506
allows us to create an object that represents a web page. Here, we're passing in

9
00:00:32,506 --> 00:00:36,416
the contents of the page just like we were doing in get all links. And the

10
00:00:36,416 --> 00:00:40,198
BeautifulSoup module provides definitions that give us a very easy way to

11
00:00:40,198 --> 00:00:44,010
extract all the links from a webpage. In the first part of the course where

12
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:47,376
we're writing this code ourselves, but we wanted to really understand how to do

13
00:00:47,376 --> 00:00:50,994
things and our goal is to learn about programming. If you're actually trying to

14
00:00:50,994 --> 00:00:54,634
solve problems, you're much better are finding a module like BeautifulSoup,

15
00:00:54,634 --> 00:00:58,106
where someone has already put a lot of effort into figuring how to do this in

16
00:00:58,106 --> 00:01:01,522
the right way and written a tool that works much more robustly on much more

17
00:01:01,522 --> 00:01:05,510
complex web pages than the code we wrote this. So, modules are a real big win

18
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:09,195
and we can use this without worrying about it polluting our namespace because we

19
00:01:09,195 --> 00:01:13,026
know the only name that we've imported here is the name BeautifulSoup. And we've

20
00:01:13,026 --> 00:01:16,870
replaced these 18 lines of code with 6 lines that if you understand what the

21
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:20,714
module does, are much easier to understand and much simpler than having to

22
00:01:20,714 --> 00:01:25,306
understand all 18 lines and they work a lot better. So, modules are a huge win,

23
00:01:25,306 --> 00:01:28,958
they make it very easy to share code. And one of the things you should be

24
00:01:28,958 --> 00:01:32,654
thinking about as you develop more programs, especially if you're developing

25
00:01:32,654 --> 00:01:36,462
them to actually solve problems, not just to learn about programming, if there's

26
00:01:36,462 --> 00:01:39,878
a module that already exists that you can use to make your coding much more

27
00:01:39,878 --> 00:01:40,403
simple.
