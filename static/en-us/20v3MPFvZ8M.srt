equations we've been playing around with recently, we actually know a fair

amount about it. Start off by telling me the x-coordinates at the point where

00:00:12,002 --> 00:00:16,047
the curve intersects the x-axis or the x-coordinates of the x-intercepts. There

00:00:16,047 --> 00:00:17,135
should be two of them.
