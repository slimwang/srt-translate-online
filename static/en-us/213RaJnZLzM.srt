1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:02,500
Well, we made it to Core Data at last.

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:05,440
Core Data is Apple's favorite
framework for the model layer.

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:08,860
Learning to use it is an important
step but not necessarily an easy one.

4
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:12,380
The goal of Core Data is to persist
runtime state just like NSCoding but

5
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:14,710
it's a bigger, more comprehensive
approach as you'll see.

6
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:17,635
When you learn the framework, you
need to learn how to get all of these

7
00:00:17,635 --> 00:00:19,960
Core Data components
snapped together correctly.

8
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:22,320
We call them the Core Data stack.

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,770
Learning the stack turns a lot
of people off to the topic.

10
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:26,210
It seems complicated but in truth,

11
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:29,540
the set up work is usually the same
every time that you write an app.

12
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:31,110
S we're going to try
something a little different.

13
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:31,820
Here in lesson three,

14
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:34,920
we're going to work on an app in which
the Core Data is already set up.

15
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,490
That's how you spend most of
your development time anyways.

16
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:39,710
After that, in lesson four,
we'll come back and

17
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:42,500
look at the steps involved in adding
Core Data to an app from scratch.

18
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,480
So we hope that you're feeling brave.

19
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,130
We're going to try to make this into
a tool that you'll really like.
