00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,520
There are a couple of different
ways to let your mobile app know

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:05,880
which analytics account to use.

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:11,120
You can do it programmatically, or
you can use an xml configuration file.

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,020
In this lesson,

5
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:16,170
we're going to use an xml file to
configure our analytics tracker.

6
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:21,310
You'll need to create a new xml
file in the res xml folder.

7
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:26,380
Go to res choose New >
Android Resource Directory.

8
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:28,200
The name of the directory is xml.

9
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:32,340
Now that you've got your xml folder,
you create a new resource file.

10
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:34,930
You can call the file what you like.

11
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:40,190
I suggest something like track_app.xml

12
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:44,270
You'll need to make sure that
the root element is resources.

13
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:47,860
The most important thing to put
in the analytics config file

14
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:50,020
is the analytics account id.

15
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:53,778
Do that by adding a string
resource that has the name

16
00:00:53,778 --> 00:00:59,560
ga_trackingId and
the value is your analytics id.

17
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:04,450
And remember that you can get your cam
id from the analytics admin dashboard.

18
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:08,600
But to start within our app, we're
going to enable automatic tracking, so

19
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:14,540
you'll need to add the string
resource ga_autoActivityTracking

20
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:16,000
to the config file.

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,400
The autoActivityTracking
needs to be set to true.

22
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:22,560
This is the minimum you need in
your tracking config file, but

23
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,570
I strongly recommend you
also configure screen names
