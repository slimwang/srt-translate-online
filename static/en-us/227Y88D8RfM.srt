Hey Chris.

2
00:00:01,450 --> 00:00:03,170
How you feeling about
the earthquake app so far?

3
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:04,710
>> You know, pretty good.

4
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:08,010
We covered a lot last lesson, and
the app's looking pretty slick.

5
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:09,530
>> It does look very slick.

6
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:13,590
However we only pretended that we got
a list of the earthquakes from the USGS.

7
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:14,430
>> True.

8
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:17,310
>> We just copy and pasted the data
that we got from the web browser and

9
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:19,770
hard coded it as a string into our app.

10
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:20,470
>> Right.

11
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:21,980
>> In this lesson, lesson two,

12
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:25,990
we're going to learn about networking,
which is an exchange of information that

13
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:28,080
happens between computers
over the Internet.

14
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,200
>> Yeah, this is a powerful concept
because you'll be able to request data

15
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,310
from anywhere on the Internet and
display it on your phone.

16
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:37,550
>> Networking is
a fairly advanced topic.

17
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:39,728
So if it sounds a little scary,
don't worry.

18
00:00:39,728 --> 00:00:44,430
There are semester-long college
courses that cover only the subject.

19
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:47,390
The main goal here is that you'll
have more questions about how these

20
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:48,690
things work.

21
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:51,138
>> Yeah, and we don't want you to get
overwhelmed with all the details.

22
00:00:51,138 --> 00:00:53,990
So we're going to provide you with just
enough information at just the right

23
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:56,480
time so you'll understand
the high level process and

24
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,210
how to write the Android
code to make it happen.

25
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:01,220
>> Dude, we should tell
them about the Soonami app.

26
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:02,580
>> Yeah, we totally should.

27
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:05,379
Well, it helps to work with
a working version of networking code

28
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:06,870
before you write it yourself.

29
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:07,550
So in this lesson,

30
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:10,270
we're going to be using a sample
app called the Soonami app.

31
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:14,030
The Soonami app uses the same
USGS API as the Quake Report app, but

32
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:16,290
with a slightly different use case,
showing whether or

33
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:20,000
not a particular Soonami alert was
issued for a particular earthquake.

34
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,330
In this lesson, you'll practice reading
and understanding how the Soonami app

35
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:29,530
makes an HTTP request to the USGS
service and receives a response back.

36
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:32,910
>> Yeah, so just to be clear, the
Soonami app is meant to prepare you so

37
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:36,020
you can write the networking code
on your own in the QuakeReport app

38
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:37,190
in lesson three.

39
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:39,020
This is going to be good,
let's get started.
