To add our y-axis the method and

2
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:08,119
function signature are identical to what we did with our x-axis.

3
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:13,240
Here we are adding a y-axis that corresponds to the attendance field of

4
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:14,480
our data.

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,970
Much of the magic with the chart happens with the ed series method.

6
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:22,850
If you notice, as I type the method call under myChart object for

7
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:26,310
the addSeries method, Chrome actually tries to help me out and

8
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:29,570
autocomplete the method I might be trying to call.

9
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:31,420
We can actually scroll this here, and

10
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:35,940
see every method that starts with add defined in the myChart object.

11
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:39,980
This can be very helpful if you're interactively trying to explore a library or

12
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:43,210
object that you're not familiar with without having to go

13
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:44,580
to external documentation.
