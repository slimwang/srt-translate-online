00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:04,696
The correct answer is 20.64. Remember the margin of error is given by t

2
00:00:04,696 --> 00:00:09,370
critcial times the standard error of the mean. tcritical in this case was

3
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:15,152
2.064, our standard error of the mean was 10. Multiply those together and we

4
00:00:15,152 --> 00:00:16,344
get 20.64.
