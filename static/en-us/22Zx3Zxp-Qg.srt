1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:05,960
Up to now, we talked about mechanisms for virtualizing the memory resource.

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,940
In particular for dealing with dynamic

3
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:13,425
memory pressure and sharing machine pages across

4
00:00:13,425 --> 00:00:20,240
VM's. A higher level issue is the policies we have to use for

5
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:25,570
allocating and reclaiming memory from the domains to which we've allocated them

6
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:31,475
in the first place. Ultimately, the goal of virtualization is maximizing the

7
00:00:31,475 --> 00:00:34,820
utilization of the resources. Memory is

8
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:38,740
a precious resource. Virtualized environments may use

9
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:45,000
different policies for memory allocation. One can be a pure share

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,080
based policy. The idea here is, you pay less, you get less. That's the idea.

11
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:53,780
So if you have a service level agreement with

12
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:56,590
the data center, then the data center gives you a

13
00:00:56,590 --> 00:01:00,140
certain amount of resources based on, the more of dollars

14
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:02,630
you put on a table. So that is a pure

15
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:06,170
share based approach. The problem with a share based approach,

16
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:08,430
is of course the fact that it could lead to

17
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:12,960
hoarding. If a virtual machine gets a bunch of resources

18
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,770
and it's not really using it, it's just wasting it.

19
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:21,728
Now, the desired behavior is if the working-set

20
00:01:21,728 --> 00:01:24,240
of a virtual machine goes up, you give it

21
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,840
more memory. If it's working-set shrinks, get back

22
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,140
the memory so that you can give it to

23
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:32,310
somebody else. So working-set-based approach would be the

24
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:35,260
saner approach. But at the same time, if I

25
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:41,970
paid money, I need my resources. So, one thing that can be done is sort of put

26
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:47,488
these two ideas together in implementing a dynamic idle-adjusted

27
00:01:47,488 --> 00:01:50,540
shares approach. In other words, you're going to tax

28
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:53,010
the guys that are hoarders, so you tax the

29
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:57,195
idle pages more than active pages. If I've given you

30
00:01:57,195 --> 00:01:59,580
a bunch of resources, if you're actively using it,

31
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:02,970
more power to you. But if you're hoarding it,

32
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:04,720
I'm going to tax you. I'm going to take away the

33
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:07,000
resources that I gave you. And you may not even

34
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,169
notice it because you're not using it anyway.

35
00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:13,008
So that's the idea in this dynamic idle-adjusted

36
00:02:13,008 --> 00:02:18,960
shares approach. And now what is this tax? Well, we could make the tax rate 0%,

37
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:25,190
that is plutocracy, meaning you paid for it, you got it, you can sit on it,

38
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:27,500
I'm not going to tax you, that's one approach.

39
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:32,490
Or, I could make the tax 100%, meaning that

40
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:35,320
if you've got some resources and you're not

41
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,105
using it, I'm going to take all of it away.

42
00:02:37,105 --> 00:02:40,860
[LAUGH] So that's the wealth redistribution. Sort of

43
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:45,350
a socialistic policy, use it or lose it. And

44
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:47,535
in other words, if you make the tax

45
00:02:47,535 --> 00:02:52,450
100%, we are ignoring shares altogether. Now something in

46
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:57,570
between is probably the best way to do it, so for instance if you use a tax rate

47
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:03,490
of 50% or 75% saying if you have idle pages, then the tax rate is 50%, there's

48
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:09,060
a 50% chance I'll take it away. And that's what is being done in

49
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:12,740
the VMware ESX server today in terms of

50
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:16,765
how to allocate memory to the domains that

51
00:03:16,765 --> 00:03:19,738
need it. You are going to use share based

52
00:03:19,738 --> 00:03:22,552
approach, but if you're not actively using it,

53
00:03:22,552 --> 00:03:27,046
we're going to take it away from you. And of course we'll give it back to you if

54
00:03:27,046 --> 00:03:29,698
you start using it, and that's the reason why

55
00:03:29,698 --> 00:03:32,282
you don't want to make the tax 100%, but

56
00:03:32,282 --> 00:03:36,380
have it somewhat smaller. So by having a tax

57
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:40,790
rate that is not quite 100% but maybe 50%

58
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:43,980
or 75%, we can reclaim most of the idle

59
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:47,490
memory from the VM's that are not actively using it.

60
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:52,820
But at the same time, since we're not taxing idle pages 100%, it allows

61
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:56,380
for sudden working set increases that might

62
00:03:56,380 --> 00:04:00,750
be experienced by a particular domain. Suddenly, a

63
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:07,480
domain starts needing more memory, at that point it may still have some reserves

64
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:13,000
in terms of the idle pages that I did not take away from that particular domain.

65
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,228
So the key point is that, you don't want to tax

66
00:04:16,228 --> 00:04:20,760
at 100% because this allows for sudden working set increases

67
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:24,440
that may be there, in a virtual machine that happens

68
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,870
to be idle for some time, but suddenly work picks up.
