>> We know negative 4, 3 is a solution to our system of equation. Well, we can

2
00:00:04,307 --> 00:00:08,722
also check it to be sure. Here are the 2 original equations, and here was our

3
00:00:08,722 --> 00:00:13,259
solution. We want to check our solution in each equation and make sure that we

4
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:17,697
wind up with true statements at the end. Try doing that, and make sure these

5
00:00:17,697 --> 00:00:18,618
numbers match.
