00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:02,510
The qualities that
investors are looking for

2
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:05,790
in a company I think can boil
down to three questions.

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:08,580
The first is, is the market big enough?

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:12,790
Is there enough opportunity out there
for a company to go out and succeed?

5
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:14,081
The second question is,

6
00:00:14,081 --> 00:00:17,958
is the problem that you're trying to
solve something that's important?

7
00:00:17,958 --> 00:00:21,524
Is it something that a lot of
people believe is an actual problem

8
00:00:21,524 --> 00:00:22,948
that needs to be solved?

9
00:00:22,948 --> 00:00:24,310
And the third thing is,

10
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:29,250
is your company best positioned to solve
that problem better than anybody else?

11
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:32,390
And you have to ask yourself
those three questions.

12
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:34,880
There's one other thing
you have to look at.

13
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,860
And that is that for early stage
investors, they're looking for

14
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:41,030
a 20 to 100 return on their money.

15
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:44,320
And when you think about your problem
and you think about taking money and

16
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,570
what you will ultimately be
able to return, you have to ask

17
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:51,820
yourself the question, can you return
that much money to the investor?

18
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:54,395
And if you can't,
then you probably need to go back and

19
00:00:54,395 --> 00:00:56,220
re-evaluate the problem that
you're trying to solve.
