1
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:04,780
So, we've got some, some first order logic. What does this really mean to

2
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:08,550
you as a developer. Say you have a spec, you could have written it,

3
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:12,940
could have been given it, or whatever, and you want to implement it directly. So

4
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:15,290
we're going from, from spec directly to implementation,

5
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:20,310
just one level of refinement. Property two says that you have an obligation to

6
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:24,170
make sure that each operation in the spec doesn't break anything.

7
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:28,268
Any invariant. You can do this. You can insure yourself of this by testing,

8
00:00:28,268 --> 00:00:32,150
by code reviews or even by proving. But somehow you, you have to do it.
