1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:05,030
Congratulations on completing Stage 2, and implementing bolts in Python.

2
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:08,250
You're exploring some of the more advanced concepts of Storm apologies, and

3
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:11,040
now we're going to add more cool functionality.

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:16,290
In Lesson 3, Stage 4, rather than displaying a word cloud,

5
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:20,390
what we're going to do is calculate and display the top N words.

6
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:23,070
In this stage we're going to switch out the rolling CountBolt for

7
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:26,840
the CountBolt, and we're going to use open source bolts,

8
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:29,810
the total rankings bolt, and the intermediate rankings bolt.

9
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:35,555
This is an extremely useful function, and one of the applications is

10
00:00:35,555 --> 00:00:40,890
display the top-N hashtags, that continuously update in real time.

11
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:44,020
This is a complex assignment that requires some patience to import and

12
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:45,480
connect successfully.

13
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,130
But this is also an authentic real world assignment that you may

14
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:50,710
want to use as the basis of a starter project.

15
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:53,650
Our hackathon groups use this stage as a launching point for

16
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:55,540
most of their ideas, let's get started.

17
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:00,090
In part 0, add your credentials to your Tweet Topology, and

18
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:03,080
rename your Tweet Topology to the TopNTweetTopology.

19
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:08,620
Next, in part 1 remove the RollingCountBolt, and use the CountBolt.

20
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:12,350
And as a hint, remember this requires modifications to connect.

21
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:17,322
Next, import and connect the total rankings bolt, and required dependencies.

22
00:01:17,322 --> 00:01:20,920
At this stage I give multiple hints below in the reading node, to help you

23
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:24,080
along, but I would really urge you to try working this out on your own first.

24
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,110
This is a realistic experience working with open source tools, and

25
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:28,950
it requires some trial and error.

26
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:31,480
Delving into code and finding examples.

27
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,220
Use the hints or

28
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:35,290
simply check out my approach in Stage 5, if you want further help.

29
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:37,970
If you're still with me and you want further hints,

30
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:41,900
one is to use MavinPackage often and learn from build failures.

31
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:47,140
Mainly to bring in import statements not listed as dependencies.

32
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:51,550
And then two, after you've duplicated the total rankings bolt, read very

33
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:55,850
carefully that the total rankings bolt, requires the intermediate rankings bolt,

34
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:59,480
and that this bolt is configured using a global grouping.

35
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:03,220
In hint three remember that the tuple schema must match between the count

36
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:04,910
bolt and the intermediate rankings bolt.

37
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:09,449
I also suggest connecting the count bolt to the report bolt,

38
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:11,860
as a type of print statement to test your implementation.

39
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:16,670
But remember that this connection can fail when the tuple schema is changed.

40
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:19,670
In hint 4, I give some helpful syntax to connect the ReportBolt to

41
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:21,950
the TotalTankingBolt if needed.

42
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:25,630
But remember that since we're using open source bolts with no documentation,

43
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:30,250
I actually had to look though all the dependencies in order to get this syntax.

44
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:33,230
Once completed with part one, in part two, visualize your topology and

45
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:37,570
change the TopN variable you created, to change the number of words to keep.

46
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:40,230
Displaying TopN words is an extremely useful function, and

47
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:43,680
one of the applications is, display the TopN hashtags.

48
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,870
We can go from our word cloud that looks like this, to displaying,

49
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:53,660
say the top 100 words that looks like this, and finally to this,

50
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:57,250
where we are displaying the top 20 hashtags.

51
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:00,945
Next, in part three, add a filter using skip words list,

52
00:03:00,945 --> 00:03:04,050
to the parse tweet bolt to skip undesirable words.

53
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:07,260
What I did was actually use my top N visualization,

54
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:11,540
to choose the words to skip based on words that come up often in Twitter.

55
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:15,150
Next, in part four, update the tweet spout to emit hashtags instead of words,

56
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:19,390
and remember that, hashtags simply begin with the # character.

57
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:22,420
This is a fairly trivial update, and finally in part 5,

58
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:24,510
visualize the top end hashtags.

59
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:28,840
Remember to hit refresh periodically, and you can also use

60
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:35,287
the Visualization http://127.0.0.1 :5000/basic.

61
00:03:35,287 --> 00:03:38,160
This visualization is simpler, and

62
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:41,790
can be used as the starting point for some of your project ideas.

63
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:45,170
But as you can see as the counter updated the size and

64
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:48,270
location, of our top hashtags move along the screen.

65
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:51,630
Once you're completed with the top and hashtags, take a screenshot and

66
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:52,730
post it to the forums,

67
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:57,390
comment on two other posts and, why not Tweet your image to your followers?

68
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:57,890
Good luck.
