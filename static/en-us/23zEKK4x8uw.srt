1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,615
Well, they both share a factor of x plus y. Remember that a here is one factor,

2
00:00:04,615 --> 00:00:09,230
and the quantity x plus y is another factor, since we're multiplying these two

3
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:13,943
numbers together. The same is true on the right, 2 is a factor, and then x plus

4
00:00:13,943 --> 00:00:15,228
y is another factor.
