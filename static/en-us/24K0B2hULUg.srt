1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,210
Have you ever wondered why people lie?

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:06,870
Or what is some people love sex
and others not so much?

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:10,160
Why does some people kill people,
but others will risk their lives

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,180
to save the life of a stranger?

5
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:15,760
Why is some people outgoing?
And why is some people shy?

6
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:19,500
Why is that you salivate
at the smell of your favorite food?

7
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:23,660
And really, why is it that we can remember
random childhood life events,

8
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:26,630
but we can't remember what
we had for breakfast this morning?

9
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:29,360
Well these are just a few of the questions
that psychologists have asked

10
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:33,510
and provided answers to over the years.
Psychology is so much more

11
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:36,640
than a therapist sitting on a couch,
talking to a person.

12
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:41,040
It's the real science behind understanding
people and their thoughts and behaviors.
