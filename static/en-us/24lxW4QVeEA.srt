00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:01,980
Here it's probably Lauren that handled the

2
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:04,750
situation better, as she said, there's nothing we

3
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:08,160
can do about the changing of the tides, and Greg might lose some sleep if he

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,630
tries to solve this in a problem focused

5
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:13,150
way. It's highly unlikely that he's going to

6
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:17,830
be able to change the tides, so again, poor Greg, he can't cope with the tides.
