00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,609
When you look at a series of frames
from a video of driving on a highway

2
00:00:03,609 --> 00:00:06,839
you see that the position of vehicles
in one frame is typically very close to

3
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:08,369
where they appear in the next.

4
00:00:08,369 --> 00:00:10,949
So once you've detected
a vehicle in one frame of video,

5
00:00:10,949 --> 00:00:13,769
you can predict roughly where
you'll find it in the next.

6
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:17,259
As you can see, knowing the position
of a car in one frame can give you

7
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:19,170
huge advantage in trying to
find it in the next frame.
