1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:04,230
To answer the question of which of these
two data structures you think is better,

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:07,390
I want you to think about the requests
you need to make to display the data

3
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:09,320
on the two main screens of the app.

4
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:11,900
Let's look at the active
lists details activity first.

5
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:14,990
We don't have any items left, but
eventually we do plan to have them here.

6
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:17,810
So we should be picking
a data structure accordingly.

7
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:21,200
If you decide to go with Data Structure
A, you simply need to attach a listener

8
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:24,210
on the list that you're interested in,
such as this list right here and

9
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:27,060
then that will contain all of the data
that you need to display this screen.

10
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,980
You have all the list properties here
such as the owner and the edit time.

11
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:32,960
And then you have all of the items,
which I'll display here.

12
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,530
Now with data structure b, you'd
actually need to attach two listeners.

13
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:39,430
You need to attach one here to
get the shopping list data.

14
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:42,180
You need to attach one here to
get all the shopping list data.

15
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:45,500
And you need to attach a corresponding
listener here to get all the shopping

16
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:46,490
list items.

17
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:49,500
Now you're retrieving the same amount of
data in Data Structure B as you are in

18
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:50,830
Data Structure A, but

19
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:53,780
in Data Structure B it just happens
to be in two different places.

20
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:55,870
Overall that's an extra listener.

21
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:57,740
So it looks like Data Structure A is
a better choice for

22
00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:59,170
ActiveListDetail screen.

23
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:01,600
But let's go ahead and
take a look at ShoppingListsFragment.

24
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,019
On this screen I simply need to
get a list of shopping lists.

25
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:06,740
If we're looking at Data Structure A and

26
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:10,570
I attach a listener to active lists,
I would be grabbing all of this data.

27
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:13,720
And that's great, but
it also includes a lot of item data.

28
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,060
Now looking at the screen,

29
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:18,860
you might notice there isn't actually
any item data that's displayed here.

30
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:21,310
So essentially you're
downloading a lot of extra data,

31
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:23,200
which doesn't sound too great.

32
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,970
In comparison we have data structure B,
and similarly we could attach a listener

33
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:29,190
to activeLists and
that would grab all of this data.

34
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:31,970
And because the item data
is separated out down here,

35
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:34,170
you wouldn't be grabbing
any of that item data.

36
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:36,990
So in this case Data Structure B is
a much better option because you'd

37
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:38,780
just receive the data that you need.

38
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:42,890
And the disparity between how good
Data Structure A is and Data Structure B

39
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:46,680
just grows bigger as you start to
get more users and more items.

40
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:50,250
Overall pulling down extra data
is a much bigger deal than making

41
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:51,530
an extra listeners.

42
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:53,710
Listeners were built to
be pretty lightweight and

43
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:56,330
when you're using Data Structure B
on the details page,

44
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:58,420
you're actually not
requesting any more data.

45
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:00,970
So Data Structure B turns out
to be the better option overall.
