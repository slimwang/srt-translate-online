00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,250
Now we've talked a bit about how to
share your prototype with people who

2
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:04,910
might help you build it better.

3
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:08,000
One other very common kind of
presentation is a demo of your

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,140
prototype.

5
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:10,660
These demos come in all shapes and

6
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:14,710
sizes, from a 30-second elevator
pitch to a 2-hour presentation.

7
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:17,250
You'll want to spend some time thinking
about how to best talk about your

8
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:20,270
prototype and
show it to various audiences.

9
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:23,180
These presentations do have some
fundamentals you can start with.

10
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:28,130
Your elevator pitch can quickly explain
what your app does, who you do it for,

11
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:30,050
and why it is important.

12
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:32,800
You've already made an elevator pitch
if you've been through that course.

13
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,900
But it'd be a great idea to take some
time now to refine that elevator pitch.

14
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:40,520
After all, if you've properly adapted
your app using the marketing course,

15
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:44,020
it's likely that the who has changed
since you first made that pitch.

16
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:45,630
And if you've been prototyping well,

17
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:47,500
it's possible that the what
has changed as well.

18
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:50,940
Take a moment to revisit
your elevator pitch now, and

19
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:51,980
check the box when you're done.
