1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,920
One easy transformation we
can do is a circular review.

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:06,800
We'll cover other elements
of meaningful motion

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:11,280
in more detail later in the course,
so let's consider this a preview.

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,760
In this app, clicking one of
the recycler view items will kick off

5
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:18,100
a circular review transition
to new item texts.

6
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:21,670
The circular reveal effect is
used a lot in material design and

7
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:23,119
ties in nicely with ripples.

8
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:25,530
So let's talk a little bit

9
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:28,280
about how we're going to
make this circular reveal.

10
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:32,240
This is the signature of
the createCircularReveal function.

11
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:35,925
The view we're going to operate on,
a center X and

12
00:00:35,925 --> 00:00:41,370
Y to start the transition,
a startRadius, and an endRadius.

13
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:45,440
So let's say this is the view group
holding the text we want to change.

14
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,080
First we need to find
the center point of our reveal.

15
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:52,600
We can do that by taking the item's
width and height and dividing in half.

16
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:56,640
The reveal should start from nothing,
so our starting radius is zero.

17
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,720
You might remember from geometry class
that the diameter is a line segment that

18
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:04,580
passes through the center and
whose end points lie on the circle.

19
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:07,510
The radius is half of the diameter.

20
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:12,010
So if we fit our item to a circle, and
situate the center points here to line

21
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:16,910
up, our ending radius would be
from about here to here, or

22
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:20,400
a little bit more than half
the width of the item.

23
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,550
One reason why it would
be a little bit more,

24
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:25,480
is just because if it's a square item,
it's not going to

25
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:29,570
perfectly align with a circle, so
you would need to adjust that.

26
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:33,610
So now we have all the pieces we
need to create a circular reveal.

27
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:37,360
As I mentioned before, you couldn't
just use half of the width of the item.

28
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:42,510
You actually need to use the hypotenuse
of half the width and half the height.

29
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:45,340
And here are all the components
of the createCircularReveal

30
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:47,410
function that create our animator.

31
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:50,850
After that set,
we chang the text, and the title,

32
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:53,750
along with the background color.

33
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:55,410
Lastly, we start the animation
