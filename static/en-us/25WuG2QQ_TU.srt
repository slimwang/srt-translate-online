1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:04,900
What this program here is part of is
a program that shows an email directory

2
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:06,939
for the Just Java Coffee Shop.

3
00:00:06,939 --> 00:00:10,590
And employees of the Just Java
Coffee Shop all have email addresses

4
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:15,910
that are their last name and then a
period, their first name @justjava.com.

5
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:19,350
Now what the program should be
printing is the employee's name

6
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:22,540
followed by their email
address in this format.

7
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:23,390
Let's see if it does that.

8
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:27,960
Okay, so the first line here is making
a variable called first name and

9
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,000
setting it's value to Lyla.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,470
All right, good.

11
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:34,350
And then the next line is has a variable
called last name which its creating and

12
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:36,480
it's setting that to Fujiwara.

13
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,470
Okay, and now we're creating
a variable called contactInfo, and

14
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:41,730
setting it to something
a little bit more complicated.

15
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:43,970
Let me just make the variable right now.

16
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:48,170
Okay, so we're setting it equal to the
concatenation of the value in firstName

17
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:50,950
plus a space,
plus the value in lastName.

18
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:52,420
So, first name is Lyla.

19
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:53,380
Last name is Fujiwara.

20
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:58,980
And this is going to be
Lyla space Fujiwara.

21
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:01,690
Okay, looks pretty good.

22
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:02,840
Now for this next statement,

23
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:06,210
I want to just say that these two
bits are actually all one line.

24
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:09,300
So we're taking contact info
which we've already declared, and

25
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:11,020
resetting its value equal to this.

26
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:12,420
So let's figure out what this is.

27
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:16,600
Well last name is Fujiwara,
the value of first name is still Lyla.

28
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:20,660
Okay so what this is doing is erasing
what was in contact info before, and

29
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:26,220
now setting it equal to opening bracket,
concatenated with Fujiwara,

30
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:32,458
concatenated with a period,
concatenated with Lyla,

31
00:01:32,458 --> 00:01:40,120
concatenated with @justjava.com and
then a closing bracket.

32
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,920
So this is the current
value of contact info.

33
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,900
And on this next line here
we display contact info,

34
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:49,310
meaning that we're going
to display this here, but

35
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:53,150
this string right here is not
the same as this string right here.

36
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:56,400
In fact it's only part of the string,
this part.

37
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:59,700
We're missing the Lyla Fujiwara.

38
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,220
Now, before we changed the string,

39
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:06,640
it was storing Lyla Fujiwara,
but we sort of overrode it

40
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,110
in this line here when we said it
equaled to a completely different value.

41
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:14,850
What we really want is
the concatenation of these two.

42
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:17,100
So if you wanted to fix this program,

43
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:22,600
you could add right here contactInfo+,
and then all of this.

44
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,800
That would have taken the current
value of contact info, Lyla Fujiwara,

45
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:29,635
and concatenated it with
the email address in this format.

46
00:02:29,635 --> 00:02:32,555
One other short note,
I am making an assumption that for

47
00:02:32,555 --> 00:02:37,025
our email addresses @justjava.com, it
doesn't matter if this is a capital or

48
00:02:37,025 --> 00:02:40,357
lowercase F or if this is a capital or
a lowercase L.

49
00:02:40,357 --> 00:02:43,587
For many email services that
consumers use, this is true.

50
00:02:43,587 --> 00:02:45,077
For example, for Gmail, this is true.

51
00:02:45,077 --> 00:02:47,617
You can leave this as lower case or
upper case and

52
00:02:47,617 --> 00:02:49,517
it will still reach the same person, but

53
00:02:49,517 --> 00:02:52,637
if you were worried about the difference
here, that's definitely a good catch.

54
00:02:52,637 --> 00:02:55,737
As I've said and I'll say it again,
case really does matter a lot of

55
00:02:55,737 --> 00:02:58,337
the time when we're talking about
anything to do with computers.
