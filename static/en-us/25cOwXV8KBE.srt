1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:03,820
So I want you to consider a little
bit the implications of the CAPM, and

2
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:09,310
I want you to consider implications in
upward markets and downward markets.

3
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:10,150
So here's the question.

4
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:15,730
If we're in upward markets, do you
want a larger beta or a smaller beta?

5
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:20,250
And if we're in downward markets, do you
want a larger beta or a smaller beta?

6
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:22,910
And remember,
CAPM says that alpha doesn't matter.
