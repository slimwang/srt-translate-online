00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:02,880
At this point lets go back to Oliver, and

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:04,620
hear what else he asks in an interview.

3
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:07,950
>> So I personally have a bunch of swift websites and

4
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:10,870
blogs and things that I love to read on a regular basis,

5
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:12,460
could you tell me about the ones that you like to read.

6
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:17,370
>> Its interesting that Oliver asks this question in the interview.

7
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:21,250
I think he does this because the list of swift related blogs and websites you

8
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:25,940
read, show an advanced level of involvement with the Apple ecosystem.

9
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:28,410
Now, I want you to think about this questions and

10
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:30,550
then share your responses with us on the discussion forum.

11
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,570
I do recognize though, that you are new to Swift.

12
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:36,590
So you may not have much to share.

13
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:39,080
But it's still good to see what other people are reading.

14
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:42,430
And it helps to have those Swift resources book marked.

15
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:45,960
By the way, Oliver has already posted his favorite Swift blogs on the forum.

16
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:49,410
So here is your challenge one more time.
