00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
This unit is about games. Why games?

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Well, for one, games are fun.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
They've captured the imagination of people for thousands of years.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
They form a well-defined subset of the real world

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
in that they have rules, which we understand and write down, and they are self-contained.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:23,000
They're not as messy as driving a car or flying an autonomous plane

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
and having to worry about everything in the world.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
In that sense, they form a small-scale model of a specific problem.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Namely, the problem of dealing with adversaries.
