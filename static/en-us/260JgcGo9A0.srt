1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:04,500
Okay, starting off we've got this work object that's got all of my jobs in it.

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:05,160
Very cool.

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:10,710
Then we come down to the bottom here and we find the locationizer function.

4
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:13,890
Locationizer's taking in the work_obj from above and

5
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:14,780
let's take a look inside of it.

6
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:17,760
We start off by initializing a new array,

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,760
which in this case is called locationArray and it starts off empty.

8
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:23,130
And then we've got a for n loop.

9
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:29,360
This for n loop is going to iterate over every job within work object dot jobs.

10
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:32,210
So remember, work object is the object that we have up here,

11
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:36,080
it's being passed in, and we're going to iterate through all of the jobs in it.

12
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:38,590
For each of the new jobs, we're going to create a variable and

13
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:41,310
don't worry, it's going to get overwritten every time we run through this loop.

14
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,660
The variable is called new location.

15
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:48,710
And we're going to set it equal to the location of each job.

16
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:51,690
So let's break this down a little bit.

17
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:54,340
We've got the work object, and then within the work object,

18
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:56,130
we've got the jobs array.

19
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:57,970
And now because of the for in loop,

20
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:02,940
we've got the index of each job within the jobs array within the work object.

21
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:05,349
And then for each job we want the location.

22
00:01:05,349 --> 00:01:08,120
So we're just going to use .notation to get the location.

23
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:11,744
Once we have each location we're going to push them using the .push

24
00:01:11,744 --> 00:01:13,060
array method.

25
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:16,190
So we'll start off with the name of the array that we want to return later and

26
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:20,090
we'll do .push with a location as the parameter.

27
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:23,350
Once this for loop is finished we're going to return the location array which we

28
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:24,030
created earlier.

29
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:26,680
All right, let's go ahead and see if this works.

30
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,730
All right, we'll come down here.

31
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:34,350
And let's console.log locationizer.

32
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:36,810
And we'll pass in the work object from above.

33
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:41,820
And if all goes well, we should see an array of locations where I worked.

34
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,520
We'll hit test run.

35
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,120
Scroll down.

36
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:48,350
And there we go. The log says that I've worked Mountain View, Seattle.

37
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:49,700
And I've had two jobs in Nashville.
