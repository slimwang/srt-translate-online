Here's an illustration of the processing
of outgoing IPsec traffic.

2
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:09,880
First, the SPD is looked up
to see if the traffic, for

3
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:14,710
example http traffic from A to B,
needs to be protected,

4
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:19,030
that is whether the traffic
should undergo IPsec processing.

5
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:25,390
If there's an SPD entry then the SA
is looked up in the SADB and

6
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:30,930
the packet is processed accordingly and
SPI is inserted in the IPSec header.
