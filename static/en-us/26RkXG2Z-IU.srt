1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:01,720
So I'm not seeing anything that says, you

2
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:04,900
know, create new workflow. So, what should I do?

3
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:07,430
>> So, the new rule button is actually

4
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:09,960
creating a new workflow. And what that means, when

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,540
it says new rule, is you're going to set up

6
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:15,620
a set of criteria that'll cause this to happen.

7
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:17,500
>> Okay, a trigger basically.

8
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:20,000
>> It's basically, there's another thing in Salesforce called a

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,120
trigger, which is what I'm trying to steer away from.

10
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:22,380
>> Okay.

11
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:25,120
>> But. A trigger is just a workflow made

12
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:25,430
of code.

13
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:25,820
>> Okay.

14
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:28,450
>> So, what we're doing right is

15
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:31,960
we're creating a situation that will only fire

16
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:34,470
when a certain set of criteria is made. And that's why it's called a rule.

17
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:35,080
>> Okay.

18
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:37,440
>> And so in this case, let's say this

19
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,500
is going to be on the maintenance ticket object

20
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,910
because it's going to be when a maintenance ticket

21
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:44,520
is created. That's when we're going to fire this rule.

22
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:50,120
>> So, Maintenance Ticket, Next. All right. So I guess I'll call the

23
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,040
rule Alert Technician.

24
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:51,540
>> 'Kay.

25
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:54,490
>> And I want to evaluate the rule when

26
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:57,780
the record is, what does this mean, evaluate the rule?

27
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:01,770
>> So, it's only going to run this rule When you,

28
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,330
>> The rule means the work flow, the series of steps?

29
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:05,680
>> The work flow, exactly. So in this case, what we're going to

30
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,250
eventually do is send an email and a task to a technician. But

31
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:11,740
this is asking, when should we do that? Should we do that every

32
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:15,250
time a maintenance ticket is created? Every time it's created and every time

33
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:17,490
it's edited? Or, every time it's created

34
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:19,760
And it meets this rule criteria down there.

35
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,350
>> It's edited but it's edited in a certain way.

36
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:23,830
>> If it didn't meet the criteria first, and then

37
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:26,640
it meets this rule criteria after it's been edited, fire it.

38
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,500
>> Gotcha, gotcha.

39
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:32,420
>> So, in this case, I think we would want the last, the last of the

40
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:34,700
three. Which is, every time it's created and

41
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:37,230
if it's edited to then meet this Criteria.

42
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:40,450
>> Like I wouldn't want to send an email. Or try to send an email

43
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:43,790
if the technician didn't have a valid email address or something like that.

44
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:44,100
>> Yeah.

45
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:48,310
>> Alright, so I'm going to run the rules of following criteria are

46
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:53,690
met. So the technician has an email address. Is what I'm going for.

47
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:54,580
>> Right.

48
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:58,280
>> Okay. So, I see maintenance ticket

49
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,930
technician, but I really want the email field.

50
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:01,270
>> Yup.

51
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:05,870
>> But I don't see that here. Is that, should I just click technician, or

52
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:06,540
what am I doing wrong?
