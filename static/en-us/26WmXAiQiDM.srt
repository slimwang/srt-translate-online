1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:05,100
And inode has the following structure
and every single one of the block

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:10,060
pointers, both the direct and
indirect ones, is 4 bytes long.

3
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:13,920
If in the system a block
on disk is 1 kilobyte,

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,790
what is the maximum file size that can
be supported with this inode structure?

5
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:22,440
You should write your answer,
rounded up to the nearest gigabyte.

6
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,670
Also answer,

7
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:27,507
what is the maximum file size if
a block on disk is now 8 kilobytes.

8
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:31,365
In this case, provide the answer
to the nearest terabyte.
