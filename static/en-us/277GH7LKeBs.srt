1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,540
And I would ague that all three arguments here are in a way correct.

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:08,260
So you could argue that randomization is more powerful than determinism.

3
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:12,350
Of course, we don't know why and we don't know if that is so,

4
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:16,890
but it could be a valid reason that somehow randomization is a bit more effective

5
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:20,090
but I think you could argue that randomization is in a way

6
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:25,210
or that randomization could in a way be a bit more effective than determinism.

7
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:27,950
After all, you're not really saying how much more effective,

8
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:31,250
but maybe you gain a little edge through trying randomization.

9
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:35,090
Of course it could also be that simply no one has had the right idea yet

10
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:38,620
how to design a really really good deterministic algorithm for 3-SAT.

11
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:41,830
Of course, the links of the table that I've just shown you suggest

12
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:45,580
that people have put a lot of thought into this but maybe tomorrow,

13
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:48,820
somebody comes up with a really good idea for a comparably

14
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:54,000
fast exponential time algorithm for 3-SAT, and finally, I think this is also an important point,

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,520
it could be that analyzing deterministic algorithms is just way more complex

16
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:01,050
than analyzing the randomized ones.

17
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:03,590
The 3-SAT algorithm, the randomized one that I've shown you

18
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:09,570
with a running time of 1.334^n * some polynomial is very very simple

19
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:12,940
and it's analysis is also not that complicated.

20
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:16,910
For the deterministic algorithms, however, you have to go through

21
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:19,710
a lot and lot and lot of analysis to prove those bounds.

22
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:23,890
So, it could be that you could modify some deterministic algorithm

23
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:29,700
to be better than the randomized one but simply the analysis required to do so, is much more complex

24
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:34,650
and by analysis, I really mean that you don't really have to modify the algorithm that much

25
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:36,810
but just look at its performance a little more closely.

26
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:41,000
So, there are couple of reasons why the randomized 3-SAT algorithms

27
00:01:41,000 --> 99:59:59,999
could be better than the deterministic ones, but of course, we don't know for sure.
