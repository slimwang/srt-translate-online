00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,602
Let's do one final factoring by grouping example together. How would you factor

2
00:00:04,602 --> 00:00:08,884
x cubed plus 4 x squared minus x minus 4? Now, this one is definitely a little

3
00:00:08,884 --> 00:00:13,325
bit slippery. Think really critically as you're going through the problem and

4
00:00:13,325 --> 00:00:17,613
double-check at the end that there are no fractable expressions left in your

5
00:00:17,613 --> 00:00:19,114
final answer. Good luck.
