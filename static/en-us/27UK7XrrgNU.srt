1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:02,630
So by now hopefully you've bought into this idea. That it

2
00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:05,350
makes sense to start a product by thinking at a high

3
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:09,192
level and not delving into details too soon. Now you're going

4
00:00:09,192 --> 00:00:12,826
to apply that idea to something you've actually built before. And

5
00:00:12,826 --> 00:00:17,380
the way to do that, is first you'll identify a product.

6
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:20,020
This doesn't necessarily have to be a mobile app, or even

7
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,450
an app at all. It should just be some product that

8
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:25,470
you've worked on in the past. Once you decide on that,

9
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:28,940
you'll think about what the intended UX was. And

10
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:31,200
I'm using this word intended, even though there's definitely

11
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,670
a chance you may not have explicitly thought about

12
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:37,680
user experience. You probably had some implicit understanding of

13
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,440
what you wanted this app, or this product to

14
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:44,530
feel like using. Next you'll make a Prezi Wireframe,

15
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:46,220
to help you focus on the high level flow

16
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:50,740
of this product. And then you'll find opportunities for high

17
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:54,990
level improvements. This can be rearranging this steps, adding a step,

18
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:58,790
or moving a step. Or hopefully by forcing yourself to write

19
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:01,650
down the flow of the product at high level, kind of like

20
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:06,600
this. You'll spot any opportunities for big picture improvements, good luck.
