1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:01,220
How many points?

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,806
Well, the answer is 4, which is d.

3
00:00:05,806 --> 00:00:08,164
All right.

4
00:00:08,164 --> 00:00:09,180
Why?

5
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:13,860
Because we have, well wait a minute, it looks like nine unknowns, right?

6
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:18,080
It's three by three, but no, you've seen this before.

7
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:22,290
It's only matters up to a scale factor, right?

8
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:27,080
I can scale all those entries in the matrix by a constant and

9
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:30,230
when I map it back out to the non-homogeneous coordinates,

10
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:33,330
when I divide it out, that scale factor goes away.

11
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:36,880
So there are eight unknowns, eight degrees of freedom.

12
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:43,070
Again, I can take four points, the four points of a rectangle, pop them down

13
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:46,068
here, they don't have to be four points of a rectangle, it's just easier to see.

14
00:00:46,068 --> 00:00:49,680
And once I've mapped four points to four points, assuming I

15
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:55,680
don't have any weird degeneracies, then I could compute, the homography.

16
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,910
What do I mean about weird degeneracies?

17
00:00:57,910 --> 00:00:59,388
Well here would be one.

18
00:00:59,388 --> 00:01:04,400
We said, that points that start on a line, have to stay on a line.

19
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:08,470
So, if I took four points that were on a line,

20
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:12,810
and then I mapped them to four new points that were not on the line,

21
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:15,700
the system should explode and it would, and your computer would melt and

22
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:18,960
all that kind of stuff, because, there is no linear solution of this

23
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:24,330
projection that would map four collinear points into four non-collinear points.

24
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:27,550
But in general if I have four points distributed spatially and

25
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:31,220
I put them down and I map them to four other points distributed spatially then

26
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:33,430
I'm able to compute the homography.

27
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:36,200
Many times through this class I'm going to ask you, how many points do

28
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:40,100
you need to compute a homography and I hope at least you'll scream four.

29
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,230
I'm amazed when I do this in class,

30
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:44,770
I say how many points you need to do amography?

31
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:45,490
And they don't know, and

32
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:48,070
it's only been like eight minutes since I did this, so pay attention.
