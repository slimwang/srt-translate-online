00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:05,031
So we've seen we can create derive classes and they inherit attributes from

2
00:00:05,031 --> 00:00:09,208
their base class. We can create another derive class. We'll make a BlackBear and

3
00:00:09,208 --> 00:00:13,602
we can add attributes to our derived classes. So we'll give the BlackBear a

4
00:00:13,602 --> 00:00:18,470
climb_tree method and a chase method. Here's what the BlackBear code looks like.

5
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:22,433
It's base class is Bear. It's got two additional methods to find, the climb_tree

6
00:00:22,433 --> 00:00:26,832
method and the chase method. And in the chase method, we'll use climb_tree. We

7
00:00:26,832 --> 00:00:31,870
also use eat. Since BlackBear doesn't define eat, it will inherit the eat method

8
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:35,762
from the base class, and we'll be using the bear's eat method. Yummy, yummy,

9
00:00:35,762 --> 00:00:40,225
yummy. So let's see how that works. We create our human victim Dave, and we'll

10
00:00:40,225 --> 00:00:44,602
put him up the tree, then we create a BlackBear. Then we have Yogi chase our

11
00:00:44,602 --> 00:00:49,060
victim. We see that Yogi can climb the tree and eat the victim. If we create a

12
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:52,720
GrizzlyBear and have the GrizzlyBear try to chase Dave, well, we have not

13
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:56,799
defined the chase attribute for the GrizzlyBear. And it doesn't inherit it from

14
00:00:56,799 --> 00:01:00,593
BlackBear since its base class is Bear, it's not a subclass of BlackBear.
