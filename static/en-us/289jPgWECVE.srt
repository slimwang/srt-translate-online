1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,180
So to state this in logic, we first have to define what j is.

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:08,412
And we're going to use the other the, the there exists quantifier. And

3
00:00:08,412 --> 00:00:13,070
that's represented by a backwards facing E. So there's going to exist some

4
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:18,920
position which we're going to call j. And it's going to be greater than one.

5
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:21,628
We've already taken care of the k squared's equal to one.

6
00:00:21,628 --> 00:00:26,250
So it's going to be greater than one and it's up to, the length of Y.

7
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:32,590
And what must be the case is that the value in Y of the jth position.

8
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:36,430
At the jth position must be equal to the value in X at the first position.

9
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:42,770
In order to make use of this we're going to then use the three

10
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:46,268
segments that we have and define. And we're going to use a recursive definition

11
00:00:46,268 --> 00:00:50,060
like we did before. And, but it's going to be in terms of these three segments.
