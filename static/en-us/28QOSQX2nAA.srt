00:00:00,753 --> 00:00:03,398
Here is the code for up heapify, right now it is blank.

2
00:00:03,398 --> 00:00:07,001
Here we have a hip. Now suppose that we insert a

3
00:00:07,001 --> 00:00:14,519
new element. For example, with value nine, this is

4
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:21,193
the current node. Since we insert in a new element,

5
00:00:21,193 --> 00:00:25,350
the hip propriety may be belated. So to fix that, we

6
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:29,114
have to ask is the value of this node smaller than the

7
00:00:29,114 --> 00:00:33,380
value of its parent. That’s the case. The property is

8
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:38,846
belated. So how do we fix that? We just interchange

9
00:00:38,846 --> 00:00:44,230
the values, this becomes nine and this becomes

10
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:56,348
fourteen. To do this in Python code, we just write this

11
00:00:56,348 --> 00:00:59,629
line to check the value of the current node is smaller

12
00:00:59,629 --> 00:01:03,956
than the value of its parent, that’s true. We just

13
00:01:03,956 --> 00:01:12,762
interchange the values like we did here. Since we

14
00:01:12,762 --> 00:01:18,279
modified the value of this node, the hip property may

15
00:01:18,279 --> 00:01:23,310
be now belated between this node and its parent. So

16
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:28,142
we set the current node to be this one and we can

17
00:01:28,142 --> 00:01:40,019
do that in Python code like this. Now we again check,

18
00:01:40,019 --> 00:01:42,244
is the value of this node is smaller than the value of

19
00:01:42,244 --> 00:01:53,391
its parent, yes. So we just interchange those values.

20
00:01:53,391 --> 00:01:57,157
Since we have already written code for doing that,

21
00:01:57,157 --> 00:02:06,588
we just need to repeat the same process until this

22
00:02:06,588 --> 00:02:10,588
condition is false or until we reach the red node.
