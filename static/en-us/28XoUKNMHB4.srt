00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Alright, so we've just seen,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
especially in that last quiz, how to

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
evaluate an expression or a statement

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
in in an environment,

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
but we've been assuming that the environment,

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
which I said is kind of like the world,

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
comes pre-prepared, but what if we

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
want to build a new world?

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
What if we want to set the values of variables?

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
What if I want to determine what the current temperature is?

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Here I've written 2 code snippets,

12
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
1 in Python and 1 in JavaScript

13
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
that do the same thing, and both of them

14
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
extend or create an environment.

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
They make a bigger, richer world that has

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
new bindings of values to variables.

17
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Here in Python, we assign the value zero

18
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
to the variable x, and then we're going to

19
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
print out x + 1, that'll be 1,

20
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
and over here in JavaScript, we use a

21
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
var statement to introduce the variable x and assign it the value zero,

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
and then we write out onto the web page x + 1,

23
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
which in an incredible surprise move will also be 1.

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
We're going to want to handle

25
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
statements like these in our JavaScript

26
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
interpreter in order to build our web browser.

27
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
So let's test our knowledge of assignment.

28
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
statements with a brief quiz.

29
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
So here I've written a fragment of Python code

30
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
that's going to print out results to the screen

31
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
based on these 2 print statements in myfun.

32
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
What I would like you to do is to determine

33
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
which of the following outputs

34
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
could actually be produced by this program

35
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
and try to work through it in your head,

36
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
and this quiz is multiple, multiple choice.

37
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Check each box that corresponds to a

38
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
string that could be printed out

39
00:01:30,000 --> 99:59:59,999
if you were to run this program in the Python interpreter.
