1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:04,100
The answer is all adult
patients in the practice.

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:08,220
This is screening for
smoking, so the denominator,

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:11,330
the group for which that
screening should be performed,

4
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:15,130
would be everyone who might be smoking,
all adult patients in the practice.
