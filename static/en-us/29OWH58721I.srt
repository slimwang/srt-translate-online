00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:05,920
Assistive technology is an umbrella
term for a broad range of devices,

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:11,198
software and tools that help any person
with a disability complete a task.

3
00:00:11,198 --> 00:00:13,920
In the broader sense this include
something as low tech as a crutch to

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,890
help someone walk or
magnifying glass to assist reading, or

5
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:18,670
as high tech as a robotic prosthesis or

6
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:21,580
image recognition software
running on a smartphone.

7
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:23,720
It can include something as
general as browser zoom or

8
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:26,510
as specific as a custom-designed
game controller.

9
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:29,610
It can be a separate physical
device like a braille display, or

10
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:32,710
be implemented completely in
software like voice control.

11
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:35,490
It can be built into an operating
system like some screen readers or

12
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:37,140
it can be an add-on like
a Chrome extension.

13
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,750
And assistive technology in
particular is pretty blurry.

14
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:45,030
After all, all technologies being built
to assist people with some task or

15
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:47,190
another, and things often move in and

16
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:49,530
out of the assistive
technology category.

17
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:52,820
For example, one of the earliest
commercial speech synthesis products was

18
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:56,580
a talking calculator for the blind, and
now we see speech synthesis popping up

19
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:59,710
all over the place, from driving
directions to virtual assistance.

20
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:00,380
On the other hand,

21
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:03,490
technology which is general purpose
often finds an assistive use.

22
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:08,130
For example, people may use
their smartphone's camera zoom

23
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:11,120
to get a better look at something
small in the real world.

24
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:14,210
In the context of web development we're
still talking about a diverse range of

25
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:16,130
technologies that we want to support.

26
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:18,640
People may interact with your
website using a screen reader or

27
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,070
braille display with a screen magnifier,
via voice control,

28
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:25,190
using a switch device, or
some other form of assistive technology

29
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:28,670
which adapts the page to create a more
specific interface that they can use.

30
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:33,410
For all of these technologies, ensuring
that our website support assistive

31
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:38,410
technology uses is going to come down to
programmatically expressed semantics.

32
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:43,220
But before we can explain exactly what
programmatically expressed semantics

33
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:46,750
refers to, we need to talk
a little bit about affordances.
