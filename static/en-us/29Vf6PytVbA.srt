1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,180
>> Did you know that no two countries with a McDonald's, they've never gone to

2
00:00:04,192 --> 00:00:06,793
war with each other? Did you know that? >> No.

3
00:00:06,793 --> 00:00:11,784
>> No, I didn't know that. , >> Yeah, because everyone's way too lazy after they

4
00:00:11,796 --> 00:00:16,043
get fat. >> China and the US haven't gone to war because there's a McDonald's in

5
00:00:16,055 --> 00:00:20,358
China and then there's a McDonald's here. >> Really? No I didn't know that. >>

6
00:00:20,358 --> 00:00:21,744
Two countries?

7
00:00:21,744 --> 00:00:26,638
>> Yeah, did you know? >> No, I didn't know that. >> Wouldn't surprise me. >> Is

8
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:28,636
that really true? >> It's true.

9
00:00:28,636 --> 00:00:32,415
>> Nobody had heard of the golden arches theory of conflict prevention before,

10
00:00:32,427 --> 00:00:36,130
but I put them on the spot and asked them for a possible explanation. Why do you

11
00:00:36,142 --> 00:00:40,482
think that is? >> Because that good food, tastes good. >> Globalization of the

12
00:00:40,494 --> 00:00:44,427
economy. >> Once you have a McDonald's in your country, your motivation just

13
00:00:44,439 --> 00:00:49,247
goes way down. >> To have a McDonald's you've reached a certain status, I guess.

14
00:00:49,342 --> 00:00:52,670
, And that makes you more first world. I don't know.

15
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:56,741
>> Maybe countries that bring in McDonald's accept Americans a little more

16
00:00:56,753 --> 00:00:58,551
freely. >> I don't know.

17
00:00:58,551 --> 00:01:02,494
>> This correlation between McDonald's and peace can only lead to some

18
00:01:02,506 --> 00:01:07,103
interesting policy conclusions. So I asked another question. >> So do you think

19
00:01:07,115 --> 00:01:13,156
that if every country in the world had a McDonald's, there'd be world peace? >>

20
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:14,896
Absolutely not.

21
00:01:14,896 --> 00:01:20,313
>> I don't think so because there's different, different, different ways that

22
00:01:20,325 --> 00:01:25,968
everybody think. I wish everybody agreed to do it, but I don't think so. >> I'm

23
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:31,671
skeptical that it's true, actually. >> It's called the golden arches theory of

24
00:01:31,683 --> 00:01:34,645
conflict resolution. >> Okay.

25
00:01:34,645 --> 00:01:40,782
>> Correlation does not mean causation, so. >> Words of wisdom. >>, >> That

26
00:01:40,794 --> 00:01:45,294
would be nice wouldn't it? >> Guess I'd go to McDonald's to get that Big Mac,

27
00:01:45,966 --> 00:01:49,645
that smile on your face. You don't have to about anything. >> Mcdonald's

28
00:01:49,657 --> 00:01:54,028
originated here, right? So, I mean , I just don't think it's in their best

29
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:57,684
interest to be putting up McDonalds's in places that they're at war with. >> I

30
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:02,018
mean, that, the, it stretched too far. There's way to correlate that data. >> I

31
00:02:02,554 --> 00:02:06,377
think there probably is something more driving the conflict than not having a

32
00:02:06,389 --> 00:02:06,942
McDonald's.
