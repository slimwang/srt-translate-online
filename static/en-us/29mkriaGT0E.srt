00:00:00,149 --> 00:00:02,610
Hi, here's an interview question.

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:07,130
Tell me about a time when
you showed initiative.

3
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:08,570
And this is how I might answer it.

4
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:13,240
So this is from back when I
was a senior in college and

5
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:15,430
working part time at
a software consultancy.

6
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:19,090
Now we were a bunch of young
engineers eager to get our

7
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:21,010
hands on real life code, and

8
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:24,730
we weren't doing a really good job of
documenting our day to day process.

9
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:29,780
There wasn't a defined rule in
the company for this purpose either.

10
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:34,410
So I tried to figure out what were
the best practices in terms of tracking

11
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:36,960
a large scale software project.

12
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,180
For instance,
drawing system design diagrams,

13
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:43,530
keeping track of functional
requirements, etc, and

14
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:47,869
making sure that those are in sync with
what was actually being implemented.

15
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:54,440
I started coordinating these
efforts among our team members, and

16
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:58,540
started assigning smaller bits
of tasks to different people.

17
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:02,610
My managers really liked this, and
I was, essentially, working as the team

18
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:05,559
lead for documentation for
the rest of my time there.

19
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:11,160
Now this helped us come up
with a better quality product,

20
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:16,610
avoid communication issues and make sure
that we had a complete documentation for

21
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:19,740
any future developers to come and
take over our work.

22
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:26,120
But most importantly, this was a very
enriching experience for me, and

23
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:30,570
I learned a lot which I probably
couldn't from any textbook or

24
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:32,100
any software engineering class.
