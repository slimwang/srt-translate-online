00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,940
We've presented at a high level what the programming model looks like.

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:06,282
Now what you need to know is what is the GPU good at?

3
00:00:06,282 --> 00:00:09,513
How is it going to be good at running programs I write in this programming model?

4
00:00:09,513 --> 00:00:11,052
So what is the GPU good at?

5
00:00:11,052 --> 00:00:13,316
For now, let me just tell you two things.

6
00:00:13,316 --> 00:00:15,556
Keep these in mind as you're planning your program.

7
00:00:15,556 --> 00:00:21,157
Thing number one: it is really good at efficiently launching lots of threads.

8
00:00:21,157 --> 00:00:26,126
You may be used to other programming environments where launching threads is an expensive process.

9
00:00:26,126 --> 00:00:27,665
That is not the case here.

10
00:00:27,665 --> 00:00:33,677
In fact, as we'll discuss later, if you're not launching lots of threads, you're not using the GPU effectively.

11
00:00:33,677 --> 00:00:37,005
Dave, my co-instructor, likes to say that the GPU doesn't even

12
00:00:37,005 --> 00:00:40,108
get out of bed in the morning for fewer than a 1000 threads.

13
00:00:40,108 --> 00:00:42,842
The second thing that a GPU is good at is actually running

14
00:00:42,842 --> 00:00:46,284
lots of those threads in parallel all at the same time.

15
00:00:46,284 --> 00:00:49,149
Now we're going to consider a simple example.

16
00:00:49,149 --> 00:00:54,856
We're going to take an input array of 64 floating point numbers, numbered 0 to 63,

17
00:00:54,856 --> 00:00:57,660
and we're going to square each number in the array.

18
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:01,709
So the output will be 0, 1, 4, 9, and so on.

19
00:01:01,709 --> 00:01:03,367
We're going to do this in three steps.

20
00:01:03,367 --> 00:01:06,432
We're going to start by looking at how we'd run this code on the CPU.

21
00:01:06,432 --> 00:01:10,036
Then we'll talk about how we'd run this on the GPU without looking at code,

22
00:01:10,036 --> 00:01:12,207
instead just discussing what our code would do.

23
00:01:12,207 --> 00:01:14,611
Then we'll dive into what the code actually looks like.
