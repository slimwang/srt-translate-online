1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,860
So, now you've learned the layout of simple AppEngine

2
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:06,510
app that uses endpoints. You started out by getting

3
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:10,710
the project from your udacity's GitHub repository. However, there

4
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:12,950
are various other templates for you to use when

5
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:15,610
you create a Maven project. And these are called

6
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:18,860
archetypes. To create a new Maven project using an

7
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:22,880
archetype, open a console terminal window and change to

8
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,710
a directory where you want to build your project.

9
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:29,850
From the command line invoke Maven by typing

10
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:34,740
mvn archetype:generate. Hit return. If this is the first

11
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:37,380
time you're doing this, Maven needs to actually

12
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:40,960
download some things to show you the available archetypes.

13
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,810
Now, we see all the different archetypes that

14
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:46,410
you could use. It's kind of a overwhelming list

15
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:48,500
and you can filter it. So let's see

16
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:51,220
what archetypes we've got for appengine. So I'll enter

17
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:54,470
appengine here. And we've got three here, three

18
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:56,750
appengine archetypes. So let's see what we've got for

19
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:59,940
endpoints. Okay, we've got two. And you can do

20
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:02,970
other filtering if you want. And the archetypes can

21
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:05,510
change over time. But I'm going to go ahead

22
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:10,350
and create a archetype using the hello-endpoints-archetype. So this

23
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:13,980
is similar to the Hello World endpoints project that

24
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:16,550
you got from udacity, but it has a little

25
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:21,230
more functionality and a little more pizzazz to it. So here we want

26
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:26,570
two. So I'm going to enter two and the take the default number 3. And

27
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:32,421
then the group identity is really the package name. So, I'm going to call mine

28
00:01:32,421 --> 00:01:38,370
com.google.training, that'll do. And then, I'm going to

29
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:41,730
call mine the artifact can be training.

30
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:43,830
Take the default snapshot. The package is

31
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:47,270
com.google.training. Then it's a quick summary of what

32
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:54,770
we're going to do. Just press Yes and Yes. Okay, build success. So now, if I

33
00:01:54,770 --> 00:02:00,130
explore my directory, I have all the files for my project. So now I can

34
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:02,840
go into Eclipse and import this project that

35
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:06,820
I just created from the archetype. Existing Project,and

36
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:09,270
there it is. That's my project. Training's a bit

37
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:12,290
generic so I'm going to change the name. New

38
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:14,950
Hello World. Don't worry about the errors, we'll solve

39
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:19,570
those later. Finish, Continue, and you see over here I

40
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:21,930
have my new Hello World project. And I could

41
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:23,970
just go ahead and deploy that right away to

42
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:28,040
local host. Let's do it. Oh no. Launching dev

43
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:31,640
server has encountered a problem, can't find Maven installation embedded.

44
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,990
All right, I forgot about that. You always have to

45
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:38,650
remember this when you get a new project, say okay,

46
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:43,140
then you go to run as run configurations. Then we

47
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:45,990
need to find the one that we just used and

48
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:48,160
we need to make sure that the Maven run time

49
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,740
is external, not embedded. Dev App server is now running.

50
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:54,690
Let's go to local host. Okay, I needed to refresh

51
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:58,380
the browser. And you see I've got the new, the UI

52
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:01,460
for the new project. Could also go look

53
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:04,110
at the endpoint APIs that are available here in

54
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:06,930
the API Explorer. This is also called the Hello

55
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:10,970
World API. Or a slightly different greeting. So we'll

56
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:15,570
call, let's call get greeting. Oops, don't know

57
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:18,250
what the ID is. List greetings, and here are

58
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:20,900
the greetings. So, it's up to you if you'd

59
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:23,530
like to go ahead and create that archetype and

60
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:27,460
explore the project. I leave that to you, but I do want you

61
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:28,680
to know that there's lots of

62
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,660
different templates available for creating Maven projects.
