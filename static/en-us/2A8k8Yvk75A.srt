00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,544
This is pretty tricky, so let's have a quiz to see that you understand it. So

2
00:00:03,544 --> 00:00:07,384
the question is, what's the difference between sobj1, which is the result of

3
00:00:07,384 --> 00:00:11,344
calling super passing and Discerning Bear with a Discerning Bear instance and

4
00:00:11,344 --> 00:00:15,184
sobj2, which is the result of calling super passing and Grizzly Bear with the

5
00:00:15,184 --> 00:00:19,150
Discerning Bear instance. And you should be able to answer this, by giving a

6
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:23,566
single line of code, that behaves differently, depending on whether the variable

7
00:00:23,566 --> 00:00:25,414
sobj references sobj1 or sobj2.
