The third principle of knowledge based AI agents in CS7637 is that reasoning is

2
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:11,120
typically top-down as well as bottom-up. Ordinarily, we assume that data is

3
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:14,530
coming from the world and most of the reasoning is bottom-up as we interpret

4
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:19,231
the data. In contrast to knowledge based AI, low level processing of the data

5
00:00:19,231 --> 00:00:23,840
results in the invocation of knowledge structures from memory. These knowledge

6
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,890
structures then generate expectations, and the reasoning becomes top down.

7
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:32,080
Frames were an example of this kind of top down reasoning. We had the input,

8
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:35,810
Angela ate lasagna with her dad last night at Olive Garden. And

9
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:39,960
the processing of this input led it to the invocation of this particular frame.

10
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,080
Once this frame has been pulled out of memory,

11
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:45,550
then this particular frame can generate a lot of expectations. For example,

12
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:51,740
was the object alive when Angela ate it? False. Where is the object now?

13
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:56,400
Inside the subject. What is the subject's mood after she had dinner?

14
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:01,300
She was happy. A similar kind of top down generation of expectations occurred

15
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:05,570
when we used frames to understand simple sentences about earthquakes.

16
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:08,960
Scripts are another example of this kind of top-down generation of

17
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,918
expectations and expectation based processing. Once we have a script,

18
00:01:12,918 --> 00:01:15,727
then that script generates expectations over the next action.

19
00:01:15,727 --> 00:01:17,195
[BLANK_AUDIO]

20
00:01:17,195 --> 00:01:21,250
It tells us what to look for in the world, even before that happens. And

21
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:24,480
when that doesn't happen, we know an expectation has been violated and we

22
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:29,240
are surprised. Constraint propagation is another way of thinking about top down

23
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:33,040
processing. We will input data in the form of pixels representing this cube.

24
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,690
We have to infer that this image, in fact,

25
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:39,090
is that of a cube. We have knowledge about this constraint of various kind of

26
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:42,820
junctions that can occur in the world of cubes and this knowledge then generates

27
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:47,232
expectations of what might be a blade and what might be a fold. This notion of

28
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:51,601
top-down processing using knowledge structures to generate expectations of

29
00:01:51,601 --> 00:01:55,980
the world in order to be able to interpret data essential to knowledge based AI.

30
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:58,418
It's also deeply connected with human cognition.

31
00:01:58,418 --> 00:02:02,900
Some current theories of human cognition think of brains as predictive machines.

32
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:06,030
We are constantly generating expectations, we are constantly making predictions

33
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:08,900
over the world, that guide our reasoning, that guide our actions.
