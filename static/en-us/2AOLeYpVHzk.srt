00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,969
You've just seen how to add changes to the staging area, so

2
00:00:02,969 --> 00:00:05,920
now let's go over how to create a commit with those changes.

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:10,940
I've just added my changes to cake-recipe.txt and frosting0recipe.txt and

4
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:12,970
I'm ready to create a commit for them.

5
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:15,860
To do that, I'll run the command git commit.

6
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:19,560
And Git opens the editor I've configured so that I can write a commit message.

7
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,650
In my case, the editor is Sublime.

8
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:24,780
I'll enter the message Add a cake and frosting recipe since that

9
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:27,610
describes the changes that will be present in this commit.

10
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:31,320
It's standard Git practice to write your commit message as if it were a command,

11
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:36,670
which is why I said Add a recipe, rather than Added or Adds a recipe.

12
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:40,610
Next, I save the file and quit the editor.

13
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:44,130
And I can use git log to see that the commit has been created.

14
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:45,460
Here it is.

15
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:49,930
Now if I run git status again, the initial commit note has gone away and

16
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:53,730
the only remaining untracked file is chili-recipe.txt.

17
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:56,510
I'd also like to commit this file in a separate commit and

18
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:58,950
I can do that using the same process.

19
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:02,110
Now go ahead and commit the changes in your reflections directory that you

20
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:03,740
previously added to the staging area.

21
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:07,110
You can do this using the command git commit.

22
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:10,500
Then continue committing until you have committed all your changes using git

23
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,850
add, git status and git commit.

24
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:16,490
What is the output of git status after all your changes are committed?

25
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:17,540
Paste the output here.
