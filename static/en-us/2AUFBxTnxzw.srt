1
00:00:00,205 --> 00:00:03,078
Of course, I don't want to just
show a bias towards Microsoft here.

2
00:00:03,078 --> 00:00:05,362
They've done some amazing
stuff in this area.

3
00:00:05,362 --> 00:00:08,416
But of course, Google has also played
into this area recently with all

4
00:00:08,416 --> 00:00:09,625
of their Google Map stuff.

5
00:00:09,625 --> 00:00:14,259
So here, for example,
I'm showing an example from Google Maps,

6
00:00:14,259 --> 00:00:17,172
basically showing the Coliseum in Rome.

7
00:00:17,172 --> 00:00:19,978
They have actually captured,
but more importantly,

8
00:00:19,978 --> 00:00:23,455
citizens have captured and
put up and registered on the scene.

9
00:00:23,455 --> 00:00:27,927
So, again, just looking at the coliseum,
there are lots of pictures available

10
00:00:27,927 --> 00:00:30,296
using sites like
the outside Panoramio and

11
00:00:30,296 --> 00:00:32,878
we can basically look
at different pictures.

12
00:00:32,878 --> 00:00:35,175
And when I can click on it,
I can actually zoom in.

13
00:00:35,175 --> 00:00:41,115
And of course, now I can browse
the scene in a lot of detail.

14
00:00:41,115 --> 00:00:45,603
And of course, if you notice with
this interface as I move around,

15
00:00:45,603 --> 00:00:49,931
it basically either finds a picture and
a best viewpoint for it or

16
00:00:49,931 --> 00:00:52,835
lets me browse around
in the space itself.

17
00:00:52,835 --> 00:00:56,075
And again, just browsing shows you
different images and you can kind of

18
00:00:56,075 --> 00:00:59,265
again, do a little bit of touring
around and see interesting sights.

19
00:00:59,265 --> 00:01:02,232
Now, I want to make sure that people
understand while in the old days,

20
00:01:02,232 --> 00:01:04,955
this was important for
well known sites with a lot of pictures.

21
00:01:04,955 --> 00:01:08,707
But with the growth of cameras,
something we've talked about before in

22
00:01:08,707 --> 00:01:12,705
this class and the availability of,
you know systems like Google Maps,

23
00:01:12,705 --> 00:01:15,925
where they're actually doing
allot of capture themselves.

24
00:01:15,925 --> 00:01:19,012
We can actually do this for sites like
For example, the Georgia Tech campus.

25
00:01:19,012 --> 00:01:20,798
So here now, let me show you a video.

26
00:01:20,798 --> 00:01:23,813
Say, you want to come to Georgia Tech
campus and some of you, of course,

27
00:01:23,813 --> 00:01:25,055
have not been able to.

28
00:01:25,055 --> 00:01:28,502
You can basically now get a tour
of the Georgia Tech campus.

29
00:01:28,502 --> 00:01:29,262
So here basically,

30
00:01:29,262 --> 00:01:31,644
I'm going to first show
the Klaus Advanced Computing building.

31
00:01:31,644 --> 00:01:34,908
If you notice there is a blue mark
where I was, that's my office.

32
00:01:34,908 --> 00:01:37,368
And of course,
I clicked on one of the panoramas.

33
00:01:37,368 --> 00:01:41,799
And now we can see the Clough
Undergraduate Learning Center,

34
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:43,392
the Van Leer building.

35
00:01:43,392 --> 00:01:45,305
Zooming back out on the map.

36
00:01:45,305 --> 00:01:48,696
Now, I'm going to show a little bit more
detail and actually get into something.

37
00:01:48,696 --> 00:01:51,142
Again, you may have used
called street views.

38
00:01:51,142 --> 00:01:54,798
The Clough's building,
I'm at this dot here in my office.

39
00:01:54,798 --> 00:01:58,575
Loads of different types
of available images.

40
00:01:58,575 --> 00:02:02,085
Here we're going to basically
get on to the first drive.

41
00:02:02,085 --> 00:02:05,845
And again, I'm just going to
put myself on that street.

42
00:02:05,845 --> 00:02:07,296
There.

43
00:02:07,296 --> 00:02:09,614
And we're going to go for a little walk.

44
00:02:09,614 --> 00:02:13,557
Here you basically see these are of
course, images captured by street views.

45
00:02:13,557 --> 00:02:14,944
We'll talk about that in a bit.

46
00:02:14,944 --> 00:02:16,627
But now,
I can actually start moving around.

47
00:02:16,627 --> 00:02:18,848
Again, if you notice there
are lots of pictures here.

48
00:02:18,848 --> 00:02:22,822
Now these pictures have been taken
by a street view camera system.

49
00:02:22,822 --> 00:02:24,690
I'll show you that in a bit.

50
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:29,342
I'm going out on Ferst Drive, the
biomedical buildings are on this side.

51
00:02:29,342 --> 00:02:33,674
Once I get to Ferst, what I want to do
is I want to have in down Ferst a little

52
00:02:33,674 --> 00:02:37,428
bit more, but I want to actually
come back on Atlantic Drive.

53
00:02:37,428 --> 00:02:40,541
And on Atlantic Drive, we can move up.

54
00:02:40,541 --> 00:02:43,748
This is again Bandolier
from the other side.

55
00:02:43,748 --> 00:02:46,525
Bandolier is of course,
where the electrical engineering and,

56
00:02:46,525 --> 00:02:48,855
electrical and
computer engineering department is.

57
00:02:48,855 --> 00:02:52,185
And this, of course is the College
of Computing building.

58
00:02:52,185 --> 00:02:54,820
And this,
of course is where my office is.
