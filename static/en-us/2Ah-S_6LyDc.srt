00:00:00,003 --> 00:00:03,358
That was a lot of new information, let's take some time to digest it before

2
00:00:03,358 --> 00:00:08,505
moving on. What will happen if I tried to declare a variable house of type

3
00:00:08,505 --> 00:00:14,220
house and then create a new dog and try to put that into the variable house.

4
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:17,999
Will, the program declare a variable of type house and store a new dog in it.

5
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:23,794
Will we get an error in compatible types because dog is not a kind of house? Or

6
00:00:23,794 --> 00:00:27,590
will we get an error dog is abstract cannot be instantiated?
