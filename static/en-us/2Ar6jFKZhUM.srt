1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Let's use the Laplacian smoother with K=1

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
to calculate the few interesting probabilities--

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
P of SPAM, P of HAM,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and then the probability of the words "today",

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
given that it's in the SPAM class or the HAM class.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
And you might assume that our recovery size

7
00:00:22,000 --> 99:59:59,999
is about 12 different words here.
