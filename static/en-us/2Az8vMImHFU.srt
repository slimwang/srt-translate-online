00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,364
We've been talking a lot about complex numbers together, but what if we have a

2
00:00:04,364 --> 00:00:08,988
situation like this, where we have one complex number divided by another complex

3
00:00:08,988 --> 00:00:13,610
number? Since right now, both the numerator and the denominator each have a real

4
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:18,030
and an imaginary component and one is not directly a factor of the other one, we

5
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:22,752
can't do anything with this expression. We often encounter fractions like this,

6
00:00:22,752 --> 00:00:26,587
and usually, what we do to manipulate them differently is to change the

7
00:00:26,587 --> 00:00:30,595
denominator in some way. What I'd like us to do then is to figure out how to

8
00:00:30,595 --> 00:00:34,755
change the denominator of this fraction so that it ends up being the smallest

9
00:00:34,755 --> 00:00:38,655
real number we can make it, other than 0, of course, since we don't want to

10
00:00:38,655 --> 00:00:43,118
divide by 0. So, think critically about the past few quizzes we've done and what

11
00:00:43,118 --> 00:00:47,341
you can multiply one complex number by to get a real number. Fill in whatever we

12
00:00:47,341 --> 00:00:50,999
need to multiply at the top and bottom of this fraction by, to come up with an

13
00:00:50,999 --> 00:00:54,883
equivalent fraction that has a real number in the denominator. I know this is

14
00:00:54,883 --> 00:00:58,665
new and it probably feels a little bit difficult right now but just give it a

15
00:00:58,665 --> 00:01:02,447
shot, and if you feel like you need to review a little bit to prepare for this

16
00:01:02,447 --> 00:01:05,545
question, you can go back and what the past couple of videos.
