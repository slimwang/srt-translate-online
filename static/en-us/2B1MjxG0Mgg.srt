00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,930
Now recall from our previous lectures, where we

2
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:07,000
had basically talked about how computational photography is a process that takes

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,360
information from a three-dimensional scene, and goes through a series of

4
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:15,560
different steps to be able to generate an image that a user can interact with.

5
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:18,760
So in the whole traditional aspect of computational photography,

6
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:23,630
we start 3D scene, that is illuminated, optics is used to be able to

7
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:29,160
get information from the scene onto a sensor, which converts it into pixels.

8
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,960
And we've looked at in detail how image processing techniques can take

9
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,560
the pixels for enhancement or even for analysis of images, like finding features

10
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:41,400
that would be then used for various computational photography processes.

11
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,350
The thing I want everybody to remember is, what we're interested in is going

12
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:48,660
from rays of light in a 3D scene, and going to be able to

13
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:52,360
generate pixels that can be used for various types of computational processes.

14
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:56,220
Of course, we want the computational processes to also impact illumination,

15
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:58,310
optics, sensor, not just image processing.

16
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:03,150
So, one thing I want to emphasize also is that, in the study of computational

17
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:08,170
photography, we do rely on various types of disciplines, ranging from optics,

18
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:11,340
sensors, computer vision, computer graphics and

19
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:14,905
image processing, and they impact each and every aspect of this pipeline,

20
00:01:14,905 --> 00:01:18,580
of we're trying to get information all the way from 3D scenes,

21
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:22,560
to actually generate an image that could be processed and displayed.

22
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,320
And these are the disciplines that we have, kind of will be studying in

23
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:31,740
different details to help us build the foundations of computational photography.

24
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:35,120
We already looked at image processing to kind of help us extract

25
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:38,850
information from images, but we will be looking at more scene analysis and

26
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:43,250
stuff like that from optics and also from computer vision.

27
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:46,540
And we'll study things like sensors, especially camera sensors and

28
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:48,010
how light is actually captured.
