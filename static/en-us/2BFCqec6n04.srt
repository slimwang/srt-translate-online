00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So, here's a quiz.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Let's assume we fit all the 23 parameters of the Bayes network

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
as explained using maximum likelihood.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Let's now do classification and see what class and message it ends up with.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Let me start with a very simple message, and it contains a single word

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
just to make it a little bit simpler.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 99:59:59,999
What's the probability that we classify this one word message as spam?
