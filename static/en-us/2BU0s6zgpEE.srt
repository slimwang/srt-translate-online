00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:02,820
So let's wrap up what we've talked about today.

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:05,530
We started off today by talking about state spaces and we used this to

3
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:09,120
frame our discussion of mean-ends analysis. Means-ends analysis is a very

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,650
general purpose problem solving method, that allows us to look at our goal and

5
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:16,780
try to continually move towards it. We then use means-ends analysis to try and

6
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:19,940
address a couple of different kinds of problems. But when we did so,

7
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:23,890
we hit an obstacle. To overcome that obstacle, we used problem reduction.

8
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:26,930
We can use problem reduction in a lot of other problem solving contexts, but

9
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:30,000
here we use it to specifically to overcome the obstacle we hit during means-ends

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
analysis. Problem reduction occurs and we take a big hard problem and introduce

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,600
it into smaller easier problems. By solving the smaller easier problems,

12
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,340
we solve the big hard problem. Next time we're going to talk about production

13
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:44,760
systems, which are the last part of the fundamental areas of our course. But

14
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,530
if you're particularly interested in what we've talked about today, you may wish

15
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:50,590
to jump forward to logic and planning. Those were built specifically on

16
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:53,800
the types of the problems we talked about today. And in fact in planning,

17
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:57,170
we'll see a more robust way of solving the kinds of obstacles that we hit,

18
00:00:57,170 --> 00:00:59,890
during our exercise with means and analysis earlier in this lesson.
