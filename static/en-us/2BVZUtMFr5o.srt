>> So note that both the state at the top and

00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:20,760
this state at the bottom have a equal amount of difference compared to

3
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:25,840
goal state. We could've chosen either state to go further. For now,

4
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,360
we going to go with the one at the bottom. The reason of course is that if I

5
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:34,350
put A on D that will get in the way of solving the rest of the problem. For now,

6
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:38,090
let us go with this state. Later on we will see how an AI agent will

7
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:42,090
decide that this is not a good path to take and this is the better path to take.
