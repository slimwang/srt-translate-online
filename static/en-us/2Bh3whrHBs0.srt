1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:05,880
It should be obvious now that the value
of a dollar delivered in the future,

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:11,430
even if it comes from the US government
is worth less than a real dollar

3
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:12,830
right now.

4
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:16,280
A real dollar right now is worth $1.

5
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:21,060
If I promise to give you a dollar in
the future it's not worth as much.

6
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:22,920
So how should we estimate or

7
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:27,620
think about the value of dollars
delivered in the future?

8
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:31,660
I think we've also agreed that
the United States government,

9
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:35,950
promising to give you a dollar in
the future, is worth a bit more,

10
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:39,430
than the promise of Tucker Balch
giving you a dollar in the future.

11
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:45,520
But having a real dollar in your hand
right now, this one, is worth the most.

12
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,560
Why is that?

13
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,930
You know intuitively why that is.

14
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:53,698
The deeper reason is there's a chance
that I won't deliver on that guarantee

15
00:00:53,698 --> 00:00:56,011
whereas we can be pretty
sure that the U.S.

16
00:00:56,011 --> 00:00:59,080
government will deliver
on that guarantee.

17
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:01,190
So it amounts to risk.

18
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:04,769
And it all boils down to interest rate.

19
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:06,710
We're trying to figure
out the present value,

20
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:11,110
or PV of a dollar that will
be delivered in the future.

21
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:15,230
So it's worth some fraction
of this future value.

22
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:19,830
Present value is worth some
fraction of the future value.

23
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:22,660
So here's the formula in it's entirety.

24
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:27,007
Present value is equal to
future value divided by 1 plus

25
00:01:27,007 --> 00:01:32,290
interest rate raised to the i.

26
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:38,370
So the i is how far into the future
this payment is going to be delivered.

27
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:44,430
So for instance, if it's going to be
delivered right now i is equal to 0 this

28
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:50,690
whole component becomes 1 and present
value is equal simply to future value.

29
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:56,332
In other words, if we're going to
pay a $1, present value is worth $1,

30
00:01:56,332 --> 00:02:00,620
if in the future that future is
going to be 1 year from now.

31
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:07,180
It's 1 plus the interest rate,
raised to the 1th power.

32
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:11,880
And that is what the future
value of that dollar is.

33
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,200
So, let's work out an example.

34
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:17,130
Suppose with the United States
government, because they're so

35
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:21,551
trustworthy, you can
negotiate a 1% interest rate.

36
00:02:21,551 --> 00:02:24,910
Actually, as of today, which is 2015,

37
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:31,150
this 1 year interest rate is
only one-quarter of a percent.

38
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:34,168
In order words,
interest rates are very, very low.

39
00:02:34,168 --> 00:02:40,166
If you work it out, the value of
a $1 bill paid to you in the future,

40
00:02:40,166 --> 00:02:45,244
1 year from now,
at a 1% interest rate is $0.99.

41
00:02:45,244 --> 00:02:50,473
In other words, today,
it's worthwhile for you to pay $0.99 to

42
00:02:50,473 --> 00:02:56,070
the US government for the promise that
they'll give you a dollar in a year.

43
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:59,840
Okay, consider now the Balch Bond.

44
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:05,830
So it's hard for me to sell you
this asset right now for the same

45
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:10,010
price as the US government because
if you had to choose between me and

46
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:15,330
the US government for a 1% return, why
wouldn't you choose the US government?

47
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:16,170
You should go with the US

48
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:19,040
government because they're
more trustworthy than I am.

49
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,170
So, how can I attract you?

50
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:23,430
Well, I can offer you
a higher interest rate.

51
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:25,682
Let's say 5%.

52
00:03:25,682 --> 00:03:29,753
And that works out to
a value of about $0.95.

53
00:03:29,753 --> 00:03:34,488
In other words, in order for
me to attract you to buy my promise for

54
00:03:34,488 --> 00:03:38,660
$1 in the future,
I could only charge you $0.95.

55
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:41,630
So let's consider this in a chart form.

56
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:47,353
So how much is $1 worth if I
promise to give it to you today.

57
00:03:47,353 --> 00:03:51,158
Well, in that case,
this i is equal to 0, so

58
00:03:51,158 --> 00:03:57,189
the present value is equal to the future
value of all this divided by 1.

59
00:03:57,189 --> 00:04:01,153
So in all cases, if the number
of years we're going to wait for

60
00:04:01,153 --> 00:04:04,760
the delivery of that dollar is 0,
the value is $1.

61
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:10,890
But what if we talk about promising
you that dollar in the future.

62
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:16,149
If we look at this for the US bond,
in 1 year we see it's worth $0.99.

63
00:04:16,149 --> 00:04:17,230
If we carry that forward,

64
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:22,630
it's sort of this exponentially
decreasing value like that.

65
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:28,410
If you look at the Balch Bond,
which is, of course, not as worthwhile

66
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:33,000
as the US government, you see one that
decreases at an even faster rate.

67
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:39,540
So in other words, at each year in
the future, this $1 is worth less.

68
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:44,595
In other words, if I promise to give you
$1 in two years, it's worth less than,

69
00:04:44,595 --> 00:04:47,700
if I promise to give you $1 in a year,

70
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:50,400
it's worth even less than if I
promise to give you $1 right now,

71
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,850
and these charts are different
depending on what the interest rate is.

72
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:56,890
In other words, for
the higher interest rate assets,

73
00:04:56,890 --> 00:04:59,750
they decrease further into the future.

74
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:04,910
In other words, a dollar delivered
in the future is worth less now

75
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:06,780
than the lower interest rate assets.
