00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,919
Let's say all these pets were entered
incorrectly. So from the catalog activity,

2
00:00:04,919 --> 00:00:08,939
if i go into the overflow menu, and click
Delete All Pets,

3
00:00:08,939 --> 00:00:13,349
this removes all the pets from the list.
So this option from the overflow menu

4
00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:18,060
removes all the incorrectly entered
information requires taking which action

5
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:18,538
on the table?
