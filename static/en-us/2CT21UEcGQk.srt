00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,500
Now let's do an exercise called Junk Yard.

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:06,610
Find an example of a data visualization that contains chartjunk and

3
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:09,380
describe the elements that are considered chartjunk.

4
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:11,460
Post your original image, your description and

5
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:14,290
a sketch of the improved version of the visualization.

6
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:17,120
You don't need to re-create the data visualization precisely, but

7
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:19,320
you can if you're familiar with visualization software.
