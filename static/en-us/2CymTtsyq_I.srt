00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,548
Here are a bunch of lines that I've drawn on one coordinate plane. You'll notice

00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:10,725
that I've labeled each of these lines with a name. We have v, w, x, y, and z.

00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:16,039
And I'd like you to pick which of these categories each of these lines falls

00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:20,523
into. For some of these lines, there may be more than one category.
