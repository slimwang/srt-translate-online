1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,166
So that ends our conversation
about segmentation.

2
00:00:02,166 --> 00:00:05,576
You can go from these, sort of,
very simple methods that just, sort of,

3
00:00:05,576 --> 00:00:08,986
cluster in some feature space, to ones
that cluster the feature space and

4
00:00:08,986 --> 00:00:11,151
then do histograms and
cluster around those.

5
00:00:11,151 --> 00:00:15,929
To the more gra, the more complicated
graph-based methods which use fo,

6
00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:19,208
some form of spectral
partitioning in order to div

7
00:00:19,208 --> 00:00:22,160
to split the graph
into multiple sections.
