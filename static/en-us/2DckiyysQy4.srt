1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
For this problem, we are to calculate the expected number of edges

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,000
in an Erdos-Renyi graph with 256 nodes and a success probability of 0.25.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
But before we answer that question, I want to look at a simpler question

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
where we have 4 nodes and a success probability of 1.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
In the case where the success probability is 1, every possible edge will be created.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
And we'll have a complete graph. In the case of 4, we'll have 6 edges.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:29,000
And we've already discussed that the number of edges in a clique with n nodes is n(n-1)/2.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
To get the expected number of edges when pâ 1,

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
we have to multiply the total number of possible edges by p.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
And so, in the original problem, we have n is 256 times n-1 is 255 divided by 2

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:48,000
times p that is 0.25, which is 8160.
