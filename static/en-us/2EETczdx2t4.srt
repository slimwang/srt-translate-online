1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,569
Let's keep expanding the nodes in
order until we have fully expanded

2
00:00:03,569 --> 00:00:05,490
level three of our tree.

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:12,009
As we see, some nodes have two children,
others have three.

4
00:00:12,009 --> 00:00:16,109
Even so, we see that the exponential
growth of the children makes it

5
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:20,269
increasingly difficult to display
the full tree on the screen at once.

6
00:00:20,269 --> 00:00:22,429
In level four it is x's turn.

7
00:00:22,429 --> 00:00:24,570
Again we expand the tree completely.

8
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:27,679
Scrolling through the tree shows how
increasingly dense it is getting.

9
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:31,044
Level five gets a bit more interesting.

10
00:00:31,044 --> 00:00:35,127
In the left node's branch
o has one final move.

11
00:00:35,127 --> 00:00:38,050
However, in the next
branch x has blocked o in.

12
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:42,300
O has no move and the game ends.

13
00:00:42,299 --> 00:00:46,009
To indicate that our computer
player has lost in this situation,

14
00:00:46,009 --> 00:00:49,049
we will mark this node with a -1.

15
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:53,059
Expanding level five completely, we see
that one branch looks particularly dire

16
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:55,569
for our computer player,
as it has many losing situations.

17
00:00:56,799 --> 00:01:01,390
Even worse, the opponent has control
of the board at the level above.

18
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:03,880
We have to find a way to
warn our computer player

19
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:06,900
from making a move that
leads to this branch.

20
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,635
By level six there are no moves
left anywhere on the board.

21
00:01:10,635 --> 00:01:12,055
All games have ended.

22
00:01:12,055 --> 00:01:14,665
The ones where o wins
we will mark with a +1.

23
00:01:15,795 --> 00:01:20,334
The ones where o lost on level five,
we've already marked with a -1.

24
00:01:20,334 --> 00:01:24,447
Now that we have seen all the possible
futures of the game, we'll back

25
00:01:24,447 --> 00:01:29,204
propagate this knowledge to our computer
player so we can make a wise first move.
