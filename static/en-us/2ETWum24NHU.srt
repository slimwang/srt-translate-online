1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:03,360
The sixth issue is also technical in nature.

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:06,370
It has to do with using objects as components.

3
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:09,170
It is tempting to identify objects and components, and

4
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:13,420
many component technologies do exactly that, for example, JavaBeans.

5
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:14,660
After all, both objects and

6
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:18,710
components represent encapsulated state that supports operations.

7
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:21,080
However, there are problems that arise when using objects to

8
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:22,030
implement components.
