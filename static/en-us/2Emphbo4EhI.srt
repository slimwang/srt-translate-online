00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,089
Let's start by expanding out each of the
things that we have with an exponent. So,

2
00:00:05,105 --> 00:00:11,282
we know that 3^2 is just equal to 2 threes
multiplied together, so 3 times 3.

3
00:00:11,282 --> 00:00:14,580
And we know that these two things are also
multiplied together, so we need a

4
00:00:14,592 --> 00:00:20,620
multiplication sign between these two
threes and these four threes. So, again,

5
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:24,931
we just have a bunch of threes multiplied
together and, as we know, exponents are

6
00:00:24,931 --> 00:00:28,489
just a tool for writing repeated
multiplication of the same number in a

7
00:00:28,489 --> 00:00:32,596
shorthand way. So our base is going to be
three since three is being multiplied over

8
00:00:32,608 --> 00:00:36,334
and over again, and we have six of them
multiplied together if you count them out.

9
00:00:36,334 --> 99:59:59,999
So the exponent is six. Remember, typed
in, you need to type 3^6.
