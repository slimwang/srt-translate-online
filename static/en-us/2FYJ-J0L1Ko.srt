00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,239
Now we need to subtract this quantity we just wrote down here, from what is

2
00:00:03,239 --> 00:00:08,400
written above. So what is s cubed minus 4 x squared minus the quantity x cubed

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:13,330
minus 2 x squared. Please write your answer down here. Note that setting up the

4
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:17,650
problem this way, makes subtraction very easy, since like terms are lined up.

00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:20,390
Just be careful about our minus sign out here and the signs inside
