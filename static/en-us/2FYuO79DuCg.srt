1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:04,810
So when we reason inductively, we often make causal inferences. And a causal

2
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:08,505
inference is simply when we decide that one thing causes another. So for

3
00:00:08,505 --> 00:00:13,767
example, when I go on a vacation, I always get sick. And implicit in this

4
00:00:13,767 --> 00:00:17,788
statement, is a causal inference. And the causal inference is that vacations

5
00:00:17,788 --> 00:00:22,890
causes me to get sick. Now, when we use inductive reasoning and causal

6
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:29,003
inferences, we sometimes fall prey to what's known as confirmation bias. And

7
00:00:29,003 --> 00:00:32,601
confirmation bias is when we seek out information and pay attention to

8
00:00:32,601 --> 00:00:36,628
information that confirms our already held beliefs, and we dismiss and ignore

9
00:00:36,628 --> 00:00:42,692
information that dis-confirms, or contradicts, our beliefs. So for example,

10
00:00:42,692 --> 00:00:45,878
when you're writing a paper, do you actually look for information that

11
00:00:45,878 --> 00:00:50,424
dis-confirms and contradicts your thesis? Or do you write about and pay

12
00:00:50,424 --> 00:00:54,971
attention to only that information that confirms your ideas? Yeah, I thought

13
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:58,506
so. You know, many of us do this. But next time you're writing a paper, try

14
00:00:58,506 --> 00:01:04,477
this. Try to integrate, both confirming and disconfirming evidence. It'll make

15
00:01:04,477 --> 00:01:08,355
for a stronger paper. Which actually leads to our next topic, Critical

16
00:01:08,355 --> 00:01:09,487
Thinking.
