00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:01,320
Most of you, I hope,

2
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:05,840
will use either MATLAB or Octave for, for the work in this class.

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:09,630
We talked about how you can use also Python and OpenCV, etcetera.

4
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:13,040
MATLAB or the open source version of it of Octave makes it easy.

5
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,150
If you're an actually student somewhere, you know,

6
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:18,220
really registered somewhere, there is a student edition of MATLAB.

7
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:23,000
It is less than most textbooks and a great thing for you to purchase.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,670
So, in MATLAB, images and matrices just work really well.

9
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:30,220
So, you know, here's all it takes to read an image.

10
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:32,470
Right? So we've got this function, imread, and

11
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:35,480
we're going to read in as a file peppers.png.

12
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:37,810
And by the way, if you don't put these semicolons in there,

13
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:40,700
MATLAB spits out all the numbers, which is incredibly painful.

14
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:43,600
And then what we're going to do here is, I'm going to take just

15
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:48,920
the green channel, and the green channel can be indexed because in,

16
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:53,140
in MATLAB, images have a certain number of rows, certain number of columns, and

17
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:56,180
you can think of this as the color planes or the layers.

18
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:02,660
So when I say im of colon that means all the rows comma colon all the columns.

19
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:04,989
And then 2 that's red, green, blue.

20
00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:05,820
So that's green.

21
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:11,430
Now some of you are screaming, no, Professor Bobic, you messed up.

22
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:13,730
I will certainly mess up in this class.

23
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:16,630
Although I will mess up less frequently in this class then in my

24
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:18,110
in class, class.

25
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:20,670
Why? Because Megan hates to see me mess up.

26
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:24,300
That's actually not really true, she likes to put it in there, but anyway.

27
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:27,170
No, unfortunately, I did not mess up, or fortunately?

28
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:27,670
I don't know.

29
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:32,570
MATLAB indexing starts at one.

30
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:33,450
In, sort of,

31
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:38,410
normal computer, zero would be red, one would be green, two would be blue.

32
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:42,610
In MATLAB indices, indexing of arrays, it starts with one.

33
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:46,810
So one is red, two is green, three is blue.

34
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:50,300
That means that we all the time have to be subtracting one off of indices in

35
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:53,320
order to be able to multiply them to get into other locations,

36
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:56,250
the computer scientists out there will know exactly what I'm talking about.

37
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:59,490
Just remember that MATLAab is one based indexing.

38
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:03,900
So we've got our green channel, which is just a single channel.

39
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,160
Well, I can just show that.

40
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:08,220
And if I can imshow, we'll talk about that in a minute.

41
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:09,949
Well, green has just got a single layer, so

42
00:02:09,949 --> 00:02:12,030
it thinks of it as a grayscale image,

43
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:15,170
and I am showing this case would just display it.

44
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:18,810
And then you'll notice, MATLAB makes it really easy to plot things also.

45
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:22,390
So it says draw a line, and it, can you see that red line in there?

46
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:25,100
It just drew a line right across there.

47
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,280
Ain't MATLAB great?

48
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,885
In fact, I can also just call plot.

49
00:02:28,885 --> 00:02:32,619
So what this is, is this says, give me the 256th row.

50
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:36,610
Give me all the columns and then plot it, and you'll just get a plot.

51
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:41,350
By the way, I recommend highly getting used to sort of exploring your image.

52
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:44,770
Plotting the values and being able to see is what's going on,

53
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:45,920
what really should be going on?
