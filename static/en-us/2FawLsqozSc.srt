00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:05,310
We can also compute Cohen's d for multiple comparisions. And remember that this

2
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:09,878
is a measure of effect size. You've learned before that Cohen's d is the

3
00:00:09,878 --> 00:00:14,162
difference between sample means divided by the pooled standard deviation in the

4
00:00:14,162 --> 00:00:21,120
case of independent samples tea tests. You just learned that the square root.

5
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:24,618
of the means squared for within subject variability is essentially the pooled

6
00:00:24,618 --> 00:00:30,178
standard deviation. so thats teh formula for co hence d however now we haev

7
00:00:30,178 --> 00:00:35,659
three samples therefore well compute 3 cohens d one for each pair of samples

8
00:00:35,659 --> 00:00:44,805
compute cohens d for the difference in means going in the direction symbolized
