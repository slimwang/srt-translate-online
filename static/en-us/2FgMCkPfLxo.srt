1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,190
Thanks very much for coming in and
sitting down with me, Parema.

2
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:05,670
We're building a new app here for
our company.

3
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:10,100
We're looking specifically at the to-do
and calendar management space.

4
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:13,350
And so based on the flow that I've
laid out here, I'd like to talk

5
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:15,540
to you about a couple of different
things that we're seeing with it.

6
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:18,860
So obviously over here,
we have a very clear screen for

7
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:20,810
creating and editing new events.

8
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:23,390
But I'm kind of curious
to understand initially,

9
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:27,820
coming from the home screen or the data
glance screen, do you see an easy and

10
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:30,500
clear way to create new entries?

11
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,117
>> Yeah, is that using
the floating action buttons?

12
00:00:33,117 --> 00:00:34,460
>> Perfect.

13
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:37,630
So the floating action button is
a pattern that we've established across

14
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:39,160
our application here.

15
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:41,576
So we have fabs in a couple
of different places.

16
00:00:41,576 --> 00:00:46,000
Fab placement has been a thing
that we've dealt with in the past,

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,620
so I'm kind of curious to understand.

18
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:53,760
On these two screens, we have fabs up
near the hero section of the page.

19
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,280
But over here, we've got our
fab at the bottom of the page.

20
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,340
Does the location of the fab changing,
does that cause any issues for

21
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:05,379
you or are you comfortable with that?

22
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:10,205
>> I personally like it with
the hero by the hero banner.

23
00:01:10,205 --> 00:01:15,146
I don't know why, because I'm able
to see all the events down below, so

24
00:01:15,146 --> 00:01:19,682
and then looking over that, and
then I have to go over and search for

25
00:01:19,682 --> 00:01:21,722
the floating action button.

26
00:01:21,722 --> 00:01:23,476
So, which is why I feel,

27
00:01:23,476 --> 00:01:27,747
it's actually kind of nice when
it's with the hero banner.

28
00:01:27,747 --> 00:01:28,443
>> Yeah.

29
00:01:28,443 --> 00:01:32,381
You know even with such a strong
affordance associated with the hero

30
00:01:32,381 --> 00:01:36,160
banner, we can still get at it
here on this screen, as well.

31
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:39,280
But there is no hero
element to associate with.

32
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,220
And so we still end up
having to roll with it at

33
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:43,910
the bottom of the screen here.

34
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:45,940
One of the things too is that,

35
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:50,660
one of our concerns is that with a fab
of this size, right, that potentially

36
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:53,160
it could obscure some of the information
that we're looking at here.

37
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,300
Now in this case,
if we're just looking at that,

38
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:58,990
it's just avatars of the people, but
as you're showing through the list,

39
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:01,370
there could be more valuable
bits of information.

40
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:04,010
Do you feel that that would be a real
strong problem for our users, or

41
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:06,500
they would be able to work
around that with scrolling?

42
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:09,467
>> I think they would be
able to work around that,

43
00:02:09,467 --> 00:02:13,664
although it does look a little
like blocking some of the content.

44
00:02:13,664 --> 00:02:14,380
>> Yeah, for sure.

45
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:18,910
>> That might happen, but I think once
you get a hang of it and once you're

46
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:23,530
comfortable with the app, I think
eventually users will get a hang of it.

47
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:27,680
>> Okay, interesting, so
I have one big question.

48
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,830
Given that this is sort of a to-do
in an event management system,

49
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:34,980
do you see a clear way to actually say,

50
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:39,160
I'm done with this particular event?

51
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:43,791
>> Do you mean to say by just crossing
it off, clearing it from the list?

52
00:02:43,791 --> 00:02:45,680
>> Mm-hm.
>> And just marking.

53
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,240
So I think it's these check buttons.

54
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,875
>> Very cool, okay so you picked
up that affordance quite quickly,

55
00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:55,090
whereas other participants we've
had come through our study

56
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:57,670
have maybe struggled with
that just a little bit

57
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:00,410
Why do you feel that that affordance
jumped out for you so quickly?

58
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:01,550
You picked up on it really.

59
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:06,935
>> I think it's sort of like
the distinguishing factor between,

60
00:03:06,935 --> 00:03:10,522
one of them was checked, and
the other was not checked.

61
00:03:10,522 --> 00:03:11,149
>> Oh, I see.

62
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:15,830
>> So, I figured okay, this event
is probably over, or it's done.

63
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:19,040
So you move on and
check the rest of them.

64
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,070
>> Yeah, it's interesting
though that in this case,

65
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:22,800
the affordance is just a gray dot.

66
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,300
>> Exactly.

67
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:27,080
>> So if you were to see three gray
dots here and perhaps not the checkbox,

68
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,080
do you think that that would
stand out as much for you?

69
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:33,988
>> I think that would be
a little confusing to-

70
00:03:33,988 --> 00:03:34,590
>> Little confusing?

71
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:36,860
>> Yeah, what does this button do?

72
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:41,354
Maybe I would be curious to try
it out and see what happens then.

73
00:03:41,354 --> 00:03:42,042
>> Interesting, okay.

74
00:03:42,042 --> 00:03:44,909
So you're willing to be a little
bit forgiving with the application,

75
00:03:44,909 --> 00:03:46,767
try some things to learn
what the pattern is.

76
00:03:46,767 --> 00:03:47,347
>> Yeah.

77
00:03:47,347 --> 00:03:49,020
>> Interesting.

78
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,550
One other big question that's
come up in previous feedback,

79
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:56,270
is that we can only manage those
events from this particular screen.

80
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:59,060
Do you feel strongly that we
would want to able to manage them

81
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:00,950
from something like the home screen?

82
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:03,980
The home screen is much more of
an at a glance screen, and so

83
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:07,520
we did not strongly associate
event management there.

84
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:10,950
Do you still feel that that's valuable,
do we need to go that direction?

85
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,910
>> Yeah, I think it definitely
will be convenient,

86
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:20,040
since it's listing out the details of
the event, to be able to check it off.

87
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:26,330
Or are you talking with respect
to details that particularly need

88
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:31,880
to be in the home screen, or just about
having to manipulate, edit events?

89
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:35,636
>> It's really solely just about
manipulating or editing the events.

90
00:04:35,636 --> 00:04:40,505
>> Yeah, I think we could add something
like just swiping the event and

91
00:04:40,505 --> 00:04:44,693
giving the user more options
on what they can actually do,

92
00:04:44,693 --> 00:04:49,916
like what editing options they actually
get while doing that function.

93
00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:51,523
>> Interesting.

94
00:04:51,523 --> 00:04:53,470
So if we were to add
some sort of swiper or

95
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:56,184
some other gesture of support
to one of these screens,

96
00:04:56,184 --> 00:04:59,140
what would your expectation be
that that gesture would do?

97
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:03,510
If we were to, for instance,
swipe across one of these things?

98
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:08,770
>> From most of the apps that I've used,
probably have a delete.

99
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:13,575
As well as maybe a more that
would take you to a list

100
00:05:13,575 --> 00:05:18,161
of functionality, like you know.

101
00:05:18,161 --> 00:05:21,500
>> Would you want to reveal like
a hidden panel behind that thing?

102
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:24,160
Or go with something that's
a little more like Google's inbox,

103
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,760
where it's just task completion?

104
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:31,550
>> I think I would want more of a panel.

105
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:32,085
>> I see, okay.

106
00:05:32,085 --> 00:05:33,663
>> That gives options, more options.

107
00:05:33,663 --> 00:05:34,545
>> You'd would want to see more options?

108
00:05:34,545 --> 00:05:35,230
>> Yeah, yeah.

109
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:35,904
>> Interesting.

110
00:05:35,904 --> 00:05:41,334
If we did support something like just
a gesture to mark a task complete,

111
00:05:41,334 --> 00:05:43,390
not a revealed panel.

112
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:47,800
Would you want that particular
entry to disappear,

113
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,970
would you want it to
remain on the screen?

114
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:52,360
What would be a clear indication,,

115
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:57,770
aside from just the blue
checkbox that this event is done?

116
00:05:57,770 --> 00:06:02,753
>> I think that any event that's
done does not need to appear on

117
00:06:02,753 --> 00:06:07,438
the home screen, so
I'm just thinking why it would have

118
00:06:07,438 --> 00:06:11,541
to be on their home screen
once the event is over.

119
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:15,092
So I would only have checking it off,

120
00:06:15,092 --> 00:06:20,220
would mean it's going to
disappear from the list.

121
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:20,800
>> Interesting.

122
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,480
Would you have that expectation
of the daily at a glance screen?

123
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:27,480
Would you want to see things
that have been completed there?

124
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:31,050
>> Because it sounds to me like in
your heads up in our landing page,

125
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:31,940
you don't want to see that.

126
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:35,171
But you do want to see it here?

127
00:06:35,171 --> 00:06:38,707
>> Yeah, in the daily calendar,
daily event list,

128
00:06:38,707 --> 00:06:43,495
I would want to see all the events
that have been completed.

129
00:06:43,495 --> 00:06:45,735
And events that are coming up.

130
00:06:45,735 --> 00:06:50,649
>> Yeah,, I think in previous feedback
we got an indicator that we would want

131
00:06:50,649 --> 00:06:53,464
to see that stuff in
case we made a mistake.

132
00:06:53,464 --> 00:06:57,730
We accidentally swiped something
that we didn't intend to.

133
00:06:57,730 --> 00:07:02,810
Okay, one last question for you, and
then I'll let you get back to your work.

134
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:06,230
So the one thing that we haven't talked
a whole lot about is how we delete

135
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:06,920
events, right?

136
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:10,160
It's one thing to say an event is done,
but I've just made a mistake and

137
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,085
I've created one.

138
00:07:11,085 --> 00:07:16,070
Where would you expect to see
delete come out in this UI?

139
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:20,452
>> So I think delete would
be when you swipe the event.

140
00:07:20,452 --> 00:07:23,608
Just have a red delete in there.

141
00:07:23,608 --> 00:07:24,491
>> Oh I see.

142
00:07:24,491 --> 00:07:25,884
So you'd want to reveal a panel?

143
00:07:25,884 --> 00:07:30,990
>> Reveal a panel that says delete and
other options, potentially.

144
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:33,760
>> But if we were to create
an edit UI like this,

145
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:36,480
where when you tap on one of these
things you come to an edit UI,

146
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:39,570
you would see the title of the text,
the people.

147
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:43,150
Would you expect to see a delete
button on that edit screen as well?

148
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:47,225
I would expect something like
a console to say that oh oops,

149
00:07:47,225 --> 00:07:50,331
I clicked on the new
event button by mistake.

150
00:07:50,331 --> 00:07:53,240
So I don't want to create a new event.

151
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:58,030
Of course I know that the up
navigation takes you one page back.

152
00:07:58,030 --> 00:08:03,180
But I think a console button to just go
back to the home screen would be useful.

153
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:05,240
>> Interesting,
you want a stronger affordance there.

154
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:05,880
>> Mm-hm.

155
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:06,930
>> Okay, great.

156
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:08,990
Well I really appreciate all
the feedback that you've given us.

157
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:11,348
This is really helpful in setting
the direction and the tone for

158
00:08:11,348 --> 00:08:12,157
the next iteration.

159
00:08:12,157 --> 00:08:13,769
>> No problem
>> Thanks for coming out and helping.
