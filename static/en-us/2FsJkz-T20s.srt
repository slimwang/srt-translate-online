1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:03,330
There are a lot of different
views on DevOps going around.

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:06,410
So I'd like to clear up a few
things about how we're going to be

3
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:08,770
talking about it in this context.

4
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:13,050
First off, doing DevOps doesn't
mean that ops is going away or

5
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:16,149
that devs are taking over
ops responsibilities.

6
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:19,490
Dev and ops both have experiences and
knowledge to contribute.

7
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:20,680
Neither role is being eliminated.

8
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:25,140
Another thing DevOps isn't,
is just a bunch of tools.

9
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:27,580
In this course,
you'll learn about several tools for

10
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:30,140
doing things like deployment and
monitoring.

11
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:34,640
But using these tools is not
the same thing as doing DevOps.

12
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,060
Here's an analogy.

13
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:40,010
Google Calendar is a great tool for
helping you get to meetings on time.

14
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:44,440
But putting your meetings on a calendar
doesn't make you show up on time.

15
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:48,210
And it doesn't cause you to want
to show up on time, either.

16
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:51,128
If you're like me, you'll want to show
up to meetings on time because you

17
00:00:51,128 --> 00:00:53,731
respect your coworkers and
you want to get things done with them.

18
00:00:53,731 --> 00:00:57,275
And if you had a meeting conflict, or
show up late because you forgot about

19
00:00:57,275 --> 00:01:00,094
a meeting, you'd feel like you
failed to meet up to that.

20
00:01:00,094 --> 00:01:04,967
But using a calendar program is a tool
to help you accomplish a goal you

21
00:01:04,967 --> 00:01:05,981
already had.

22
00:01:05,981 --> 00:01:10,070
So DevOps is kind of like
showing up to meetings on time.

23
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,860
It's not a matter of
using particular tools,

24
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:15,160
even though tools can help you do it.

25
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:19,050
It's an organizational change
that's supported by those tools.

26
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:23,530
But, at the same time, it would be
basically impossible to organize large

27
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:26,040
meetings without some sort of calendar.

28
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,740
And likewise, it's not practical to
scale software deployment without

29
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:31,530
some tools to do that.

30
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:34,120
The tools that you'll learn about
in this course provide support for

31
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:37,600
making big changes in how
you manage software systems.

32
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,520
And, although, in this course you'll
be working by yourself rather than

33
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,020
in an actual large organization,
I hope that you'll get a sense of how

34
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:49,020
to apply these ideas and tools in your
own organization and your own projects.
