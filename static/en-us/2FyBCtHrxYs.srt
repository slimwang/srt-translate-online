00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:04,450
Today, we will talk about understanding. Understanding is a very big general

2
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:09,350
world. We'll be talking about understanding of even some stories in the world.

3
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:15,704
Understanding will be very heavily on what we learn about Frames. And it will

4
00:00:15,704 --> 00:00:18,889
help us set up the infrastructure for learning about common sense reasoning in

5
00:00:18,889 --> 00:00:24,460
the next lesson. We'll start with talking about thematic role systems,

6
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:27,780
which are the most structured type of frame representation. Then we'll talk

7
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:31,780
about how these roles, these thematic roles can be used to resolve ambiguity in

8
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:35,320
understanding the world. Finally, we'll talk about how grammar and

9
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:38,580
other constraints can be used to guide our interpretation of the world.
