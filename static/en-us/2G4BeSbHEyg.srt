1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,210
And the answer here is not actually

2
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:05,130
3 of those statements, those 3 down here are correct.

3
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:07,890
I'll explain them in a minute, and this one here is not correct.

4
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:12,060
So the formula indeed does have a satisfying assignment.

5
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:15,260
Not only one; it actually has several satisfying assignments,

6
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:18,090
but each of those assignments has the property that

7
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:20,670
exactly one variable is set to true,

8
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:23,240
and I'll show you in a second how that works.

9
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:26,740
And of course--I mean, the last thing was probably quite easy to figure out;

10
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:29,730
as you see this already has kind of a square shape,

11
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:32,980
so if we continue like this and add another variable here,

12
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:36,090
then we would have to add another line down here,

13
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:38,790
and each of those formulas grows by 1 and

14
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:41,860
the whole thing grows by one of those brackets here

15
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:43,860
for each variable that we add,

16
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:47,630
so the size is O(n squared) for n variables.

17
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:50,050
So let me explain this here to you.

18
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:53,250
So there are several satisfying assignments,

19
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:55,850
but each of those satisfying assignments has the property

20
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:58,500
that exactly 1 variable is true.

21
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,010
So for example, let's say that we set

22
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:03,530
X1 to true,

23
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:06,000
then what will happen is the following,

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,020
so X1 is true; this means this one down here goes to 0.

25
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:14,630
This one goes to 1, this one goes to 1, this one goes to 1,

26
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:16,610
this one goes to 1, and this one is 1.

27
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:18,530
So let's have a look here

28
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:21,080
at this part of the formula.

29
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,920
All of the variables here are connected by an or,

30
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,990
so we have X1 or X3 or X4 or X5 or X6.

31
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:30,710
This means if just one of the variables here

32
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:32,410
is set to true,

33
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:34,060
which it now is,

34
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:37,060
then the whole bracket here,

35
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:39,810
so from here to here will also evaluate to true,

36
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:43,390
and then we take this very, very big not here,

37
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:46,230
which means this will evaluate to 0.

38
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:49,160
Now this very big not here evaluates to 0,

39
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:51,900
then we have to make sure that this variable here

40
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,960
evaluates to 1,

41
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,250
because all of them are connected by an and,

42
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,290
and we are looking for a satisfying assignment,

43
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:01,290
so to do that, we have to set X2 to 0

44
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:04,450
so that this here evaluates to 1.

45
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:06,890
Now for the next bracket, it works the same way,

46
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:09,830
because again, we have X1 set to true,

47
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:11,850
so the bracket evaluates to true,

48
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:13,670
so the not evaluates to 0,

49
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:16,320
and so again we have to set this to 1

50
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,000
which means X3 is 1

51
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,040
and we can go on through this the same way.

52
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:26,550
So the formula forces us to set every variable except for X1 to false,

53
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:28,340
and now the way that this formula is structured, of course,

54
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:32,130
we could also have chosen to set X2 to true,

55
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:34,400
but then if X2 is set to true,

56
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:40,220
we have this here, so X2 here is 1, 1, 1, 1,

57
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:44,000
which means in order to get these here to go to 1,

58
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,310
so we need to have these here go to 1,

59
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:50,960
because this here evaluates to 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

60
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:54,440
so we have to set all of these variables here to false.

61
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,090
Yeah, finally, what about this one here?

62
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:59,800
Well, since X2 is set to true,

63
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,240
not X2 is set to false,

64
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:05,700
but luckily, because we've set all of the variables to false,

65
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:08,700
so we have 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.

66
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:11,900
In this case, the large not here

67
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,330
evaluates to true,

68
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:15,910
so this bracket here also evaluates to true,

69
00:03:15,910 --> 99:59:59,999
and we have satisfied the Boolean formula.
