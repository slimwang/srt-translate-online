1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
We see in this game each player has a dominant strategy.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
For max, if he plays strategy 1,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
then that's better than playing strategy 2.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
If min plays 1, then strategy 1 is also better than strategy 2.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
If min plays 2, so strategy 1 is the dominant strategy,

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
and that should have probability 1.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Strategy 2 should have probability 0.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
And it's the same thing for min,

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
that 2 minimizes better than 1 in both cases.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
So, strategy 2 should have probability 1,

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
and strategy 1 should have probability 0,

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
and that means we're always going to end up with this outcome,

13
00:00:39,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and the value of the game is 3.
