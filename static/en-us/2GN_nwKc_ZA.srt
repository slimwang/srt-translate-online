1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,900
Notice that we start with all the countries initially on the map and then

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:09,190
go year to year plotting the game of the World Cup as it changes host country.

3
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:14,270
And only showing the countries that were involved in that World Cup for

4
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:15,620
the given year.

5
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:19,760
So this is going through every year of the World Cup, in which there are twenty,

6
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,970
and plotting the home country's attendance numbers as an orange circle.

7
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:26,750
And every other participating country in the World Cup for

8
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:29,520
a given year is shown in light blue.

9
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:33,380
If the country did not participate in a given year of the World Cup,

10
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:38,350
this year being 2014, since it was the last World Cup, we simply make it white.
