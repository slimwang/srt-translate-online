1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,540
Let's talk about edges in just a generic image,

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:06,980
and how it is that edges come to be within a picture.

3
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:10,680
So what you can see here is this is some ancient picture somebody drew out,

4
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:13,370
that there are edges that happen for a variety of reasons, right?

5
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:16,110
So here's one right there, okay.

6
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:17,840
And that's at a depth discontinuity.

7
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:20,850
First we're looking at the bottle, then we're looking at the background.

8
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:22,060
Here's a shadow edge.

9
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:24,975
Of course, shadows aren't really that harsh but, go with me further.

10
00:00:24,975 --> 00:00:28,360
There's idea that there's a discontinuity in the illumination.

11
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:33,710
Up here, from this top to there, is a discontinuity in the surface normal.

12
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:36,524
That is the shape in one way, and then the [INAUDIBLE] the shape changes and

13
00:00:36,524 --> 00:00:38,610
it's pointing the different direction.

14
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:43,620
And then finally, edges here can do to be to essentially color discontinuity, so

15
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:47,840
we go from white to black on the same surface, same illumination, same shape and

16
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,840
everything, but the reflectance is actually different.

17
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,370
So that's what edges look like.

18
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:54,150
We can look at them in a real picture.

19
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:55,780
I think this is UT Texas,

20
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:58,690
which would mean that again this was stolen from Crystal Robin as well.

21
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:02,990
Borrowed. All right, so in a real image we have depth discontinuity.

22
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:06,040
So the side of the building, we have shadows.

23
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:09,610
So there you can see the shadow being cast by the sun on the front.

24
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:11,730
What's interesting is we have textures.

25
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:13,330
So if you were to blow up this area.

26
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:15,280
And we'll, maybe we'll take a look at some texture later.

27
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,630
Just from the, the texture or you can think of this as paint things are on

28
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:21,470
the surface, you get different edges that show up.

29
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:25,350
And then finally, the top ridge of that little cement thing,

30
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:28,620
the edge around the bridge on top, that's like the top of the bottle cap.

31
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:34,130
Same stuff, same color, but I get a discontinuity in surface orientation.

32
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:40,100
So, our goal for today and, and next time also, is to find the edges in image.

33
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:43,280
Or to put this another way, we want to convert an image,

34
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:48,600
which is a function of x y, into a reduced set of pixels or

35
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,790
curves et cetera that are the important elements of the picture somehow.

36
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:57,210
And the idea is so, you know, that it encodes the changes that matter to you.
