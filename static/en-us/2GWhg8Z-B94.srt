00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,700
Here, you can see my
GeofenceTransitionsIntentService and

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:06,880
this extends the base
IntentService class.

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:10,850
In it, I've defined a TAG, which is
just a string, called gfservice.

4
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:15,270
I've created a constructor,
which has the same name obviously,

5
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:17,700
GeofenceTransitionsIntentService.

6
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:19,410
And I super the TAG.

7
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:22,490
I've created an onCreate
override function, and in that,

8
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:24,010
I just called super.onCreate.

9
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:28,879
And then finally, I've created this
protected void, onHandleIntent,

10
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:32,910
and I'm passing it an intent called
Intent, and returning a void.

11
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:34,000
There's a lot of code in here and

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,950
we'll see how to build that in
the next steps and what that does, but

13
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:40,365
this is how you get started with your
GeofenceTransitionsIntentService.
