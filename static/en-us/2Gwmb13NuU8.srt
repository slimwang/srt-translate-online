1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,890
First, you really need all your features to be

2
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:06,510
available and fully usable on the mobile version. If you

3
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:09,300
try to guess what content or features your users

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:13,080
won't miss on the mobile, you'll probably get it wrong.

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,360
It might seem logical, right up until the point

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,740
where I try to browse store inventory for my mobile

7
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:21,490
device, only to find that feature is not availbale.

8
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:25,500
Secondly, with two apps or sites, there's a natural tendency

9
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,420
to focus on one or the other and to

10
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:31,420
get out of sync between them. Maintaining two separate applications

11
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:33,970
and keeping them fundamentally the same is hard to

12
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:37,720
do. And finally, there's the problem that it's difficult to

13
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:41,080
identify when you really want the mobile version. My

14
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:43,630
tablet for example has nearly as big a screen as

15
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:46,640
my laptop, and it's actually higher resolution than my

16
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,700
laptop. Mobile design is actually more of a spectrum that

17
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,990
spans all the way from low-resolution devices up into

18
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:58,150
desktop design. At the very least, there are three

19
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:00,620
simple rules if you want to offer a mobile-only

20
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:03,510
site. First, you want to make sure a user

21
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:07,740
can still get to the full site from the mobile site if they want to, in case you

22
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:12,170
forgot any features. Secondly, you should but canonical URL

23
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:16,590
in meta-information. This is commonly done for search engine optimization,

24
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:18,210
but it's also important to keep your

25
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:21,510
mobile site and your desktop site together. Finally,

26
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:23,430
if someone links to a specific page on

27
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:26,010
your desktop site, you shouldn't transfer them to

28
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:28,280
your top-level mobile page. You need to

29
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,490
transfer them to that specific page or its

30
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:33,920
equivalent, on the mobile site. It's really frustrating

31
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,320
when you get redirected to the top-level page.
