1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
In this problem, we're again in the 2-location vacuum world,

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
but this time around, we have local sensing,

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
meaning at each turn, we get input of what location we're at,

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
the left or the right, and whether there's dirt in that location.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
But we don't know what's going on in the other location.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,000
We have a dynamic world where dirt can appear anywhere.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
As we move around, dirt can spontaneously appear

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
in the location we left or in the location we're going to visit.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
However, if we're sucking, the dirt can't appear,

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
because if it did appear there, we would successfully suck it up.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
And now in addition, the right and left moves

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
are stochastic in that they don't always succeed.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Sometimes when you try to go right, you do successfully go right,

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
and sometimes you stay in the same location, same for left.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The suck action is always successful.

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
It will always clean up dirt in the current location.

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Now, when we start out, we get the percept

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
saying that we're in the leftmost location

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
and that location is clean, and that means our belief state

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
is that we're in either 5 or 7.

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Now, the first thing I want you to answer is if we decide to move right,

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
what do we predict the possible belief state will be,

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
the possible set of states in our belief state will be

24
00:01:36,000 --> 99:59:59,999
after we execute the right movement?
