00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:04,120
So now, we're going to move on to night terrors. This occurs most often in

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:11,035
childhood and results in waking from sleep in a terrified state. Most of these

3
00:00:11,035 --> 00:00:14,856
occur in the first third of the night. Now, if this happens, the person might

4
00:00:14,856 --> 00:00:19,050
be difficult to comfort because they're going to be thrashing around violently.

5
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:23,719
This could last 10 to 20 minutes and then, they'll fall back asleep.

6
00:00:23,719 --> 00:00:26,774
Oftentimes, the person will have no memory of the event and can't explain what

7
00:00:26,774 --> 00:00:31,035
happened the following morning. Now, some people with night terrors, also sleep

8
00:00:31,035 --> 00:00:36,026
walk in which they engage in behaviors they would do while they're awake. Even

9
00:00:36,026 --> 00:00:40,813
though they're asleep. For example, this could include eating, getting dressed,

10
00:00:40,813 --> 00:00:46,064
moving furniture, or even driving a car while asleep. Now, sleepwalking can

11
00:00:46,064 --> 00:00:52,170
occur in children and adults. About 4 to 15% of children sleepwalk, and about

12
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:57,918
1.5 to 2.5% of adults sleepwalk. Now let's go to my friend who has night

13
00:00:57,918 --> 00:01:00,220
terrors, and let's see what he has to say about it.
