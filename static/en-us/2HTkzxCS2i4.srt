00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:03,356
In lesson 11, you learned how to test for a significant difference in means

2
00:00:03,356 --> 00:00:08,426
between two independent samples. But in many research studies, we want to

3
00:00:08,426 --> 00:00:13,756
compare means from more than two independent samples. If we have three samples,

4
00:00:13,756 --> 00:00:19,732
we would need to do three T tests, A and B, B and C, and A and C. But what if

5
00:00:19,732 --> 00:00:24,580
we have four samples. How many t-tests would you need to compare all of them to

6
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:25,889
each other?
