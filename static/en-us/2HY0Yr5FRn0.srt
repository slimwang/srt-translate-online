Lorenzo's first response
was pretty good.

2
00:00:03,029 --> 00:00:07,429
He started out by listing all
the details that I provided to him and

3
00:00:07,429 --> 00:00:09,300
noting down the base rule.

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:14,019
Now, in some sense you could solve this
problem without applying the full base

5
00:00:14,019 --> 00:00:19,730
rule but it was a good decision in the
end for him to use it in full effect.

6
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:24,612
He did fumble in one place where
he used a slightly incorrect

7
00:00:24,612 --> 00:00:29,303
form of the base rule but
he corrected himself quickly and

8
00:00:29,303 --> 00:00:35,670
the mistake that he made could have led
him to a shorter route to the solution.

9
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:40,403
But it's important to note that these
shortcuts don't always work out so

10
00:00:40,404 --> 00:00:45,230
it's safer to apply the full rule or
algorithm or formula, as you know it.
