00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,634
First, let's check and see if we can easily factor this equation. We need to

2
00:00:04,634 --> 00:00:09,209
move the 16 over so that we have 0 on one side of the equation and everything

3
00:00:09,209 --> 00:00:13,518
else on the other side. Then we need to try to think of two numbers that

4
00:00:13,518 --> 00:00:18,191
multiply to equal 9 times 16 and add to equal 24. Since we can't find two

5
00:00:18,191 --> 00:00:23,452
numbers like this, we can't easily factor this. Since we can't easily factor,

6
00:00:23,452 --> 00:00:28,535
let's try and substitute into the quadratic formula. We must determine our

7
00:00:28,535 --> 00:00:34,075
values for a, b, and c before substituting. Because our discriminant is equal to

8
00:00:34,075 --> 00:00:37,840
0, we have only one solution, which is negative 4 3rds.
