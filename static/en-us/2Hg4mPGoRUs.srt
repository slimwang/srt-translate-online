00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,320
So here we are in this Web page.

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:05,320
Let's take a look at what it looks like when we can see our click locations.

3
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:05,950
I'm going to go ahead and

4
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:11,520
open up the console by pressing Command+Option+J and start clicking around.

5
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,920
We can see x location with a pixel value and

6
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,030
y location with a pixel value of where we were clicking on the page.

7
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:21,940
For this question, I want you to use this code here to pass x and

8
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:25,900
y click values into a function called logClicks.

9
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:30,040
You'll need to right some code here that will collect the x and y click values.

10
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:31,590
logClicks is defined in helper js.

11
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:34,140
It's going to append the x and

12
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:37,860
y values to a list and Console.log what you saw before.

13
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:42,030
X location with a pixel value, and y location with a pixel value.

14
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:42,960
When you do everything right,

15
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,280
you should start seeing your clicks showing up in the Console.
