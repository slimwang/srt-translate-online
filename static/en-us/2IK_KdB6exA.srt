00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,210
So to answer that question let's
take a look at our log files.

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:06,840
I have here a bad request error: the
first sort property must be the same as

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:09,570
the property in which
the inequality filter is applied.

4
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:11,540
In your query,
the first sort property is name,

5
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:14,260
but the inequality filter
is on max attendees.

6
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:15,740
So that means that this
is the correct answer.
