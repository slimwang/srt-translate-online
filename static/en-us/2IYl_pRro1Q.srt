1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:03,370
So the question is, given any variable, we're going

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:05,820
to introduce the variable S, and we're going to assign it

3
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:09,250
any string. Which of the pairs below are two

4
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:12,090
things where both elements of the pair are the same

5
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:15,050
exact value? So here are the choices. Check all

6
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:17,910
the choices where the first thing and the second thing

7
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:21,060
have exactly the same value. So the first thing is

8
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:25,630
S index 3, S index 1 plus 1 plus 1.

9
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:30,240
So, for any string that we choose for S, those two always have exactly the same

10
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:36,010
value, then you should check this box. Second, we have S index 0 paired

11
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:40,865
with S plus S, index 0. For the third

12
00:00:40,865 --> 00:00:46,265
choice, we have S index 0 plus S index 1 paired

13
00:00:46,265 --> 00:00:50,868
with S index 0 plus 1. For the

14
00:00:50,868 --> 00:00:57,446
fourth choice, we have S index 1 paired with S plus the

15
00:00:57,446 --> 00:01:03,880
string ity index 1. And for the fifth and final choice, we

16
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:09,640
have S index negative 1, and remember, the negative indexes go from the

17
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:15,850
back of the string, paired with S plus S index negative 1.

18
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:17,920
So for this question, you should check all the

19
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,840
boxes where the two items in the pair have

20
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,940
exactly the same value, no matter what value S

21
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:26,140
has, as long as S is a valid string.
