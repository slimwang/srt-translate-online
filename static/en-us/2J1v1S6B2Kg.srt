00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
In physics, the conservation of energy is highly related to the conservation of area in phase space.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I'm going to introduce that notion in a second.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Solvers did also conserve that area, are pretty good at conserving the energy,

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
not exactly but almost exactly.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
For simplicity, I'm looking at a one dimensional system.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
The position is one dimension just a single number,

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
the velocity has one dimension, just a single number.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Phase space is the coordinate x and v and this is actually use the momentum

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
which is mass time velocity.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I don't want you to be confused, so I stick to velocity.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:48,000
For every point in this phase space, you can look it's temporal evolution

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:57,000
given the value of x and given the value of v, we can solve the system of differential equations

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
and something is going to happen about that point and another point and to another point.

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
You start from that initial condition to given x and the given v

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
and look at what happens to this x and that v and look at what happens to position and velocity.

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:21,000
The trick now is to look at infinitely many initial conditions at the same time.

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
A complete some area in phase space. This is what we're talking about.

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Let's look at all of these initial conditions. What's going to happen with them?

19
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Where is the evolution going? Where is the differential equation taking us?

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Can this way, we see an evolution of area in phase space?

21
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
This set of initial conditions will have to say one second end up here

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
and after another second may be end up here and so and so on.

23
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:00,000
An area in phase space remains constant, that's called Liouville's theorem.

24
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Why does the area in phase space stay constant as it evolves? Let's look at the first equation.

25
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
The position changes with the rate of the velocity,

26
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:19,000
so if you rate for a small time and look at wherever ending, x will increase a little here,

27
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
increase more here, more here, and so on depending on v

28
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
and this motion does not depend on x, it just depends on v.

29
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:36,000
So, our initial area will be deformed to this which, is the same area.

30
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Simply use this part, glue it to that part and you'll see

31
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:45,000
that the blue parallelogram has the same area as the top of the rectangle.

32
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
So the first equation alone would not change the area.

33
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
If you look at the second equation on its own, the rate of change of the velocity

34
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:01,000
depends on x and on x only, so if this velocity is changed by that much,

35
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
also this velocity will change by that much and that velocity will change by that much.

36
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
The rate of change does not depend on v, it just depends on x,

37
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:17,000
so we could have a different rate of change here but it has to be the same for all velocities

38
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:23,000
and maybe there's a little bit of change here and again it has to be the same for all velocities.

39
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:30,000
So our purple rectangle is transformed into something that may look like this

40
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,000
and that still has the same area as the original purple rectangle had.

41
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:43,000
To see that, simply take this slice and push it down and take this slice

42
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:49,000
and push it down and so on and so on.

43
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
So each equation alone would not change the area.

44
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
If it continuously apply these rates of change, together we also have no problem.

45
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
If x evolve for an infinitesimal short amount of time,

46
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
and then we let v evolve for an infinitesimal short amount of time

47
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
and then it's the turn of x again and so on and so on--that's going to work.

48
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
If we apply the first equation for an infinitesimal amount of time,

49
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
and then we apply the second equation for an infinitesimal amount of time,

50
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,000
the area stays the same, and we apply the first equation again and so on and so on.

51
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:28,000
If you step through this and infinitesimally short time steps, that's going to work.

52
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Problem is can be applied both equations at the same time

53
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:38,000
and do not use infinitesimally short time steps then it's going to break

54
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
and that's precisely what the forward Euler's method does.

55
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:47,000
You can see one solution to that problem, you apply the first one for a finite time step

56
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,000
then the second one for a finite time step then the first one and second one and so on

57
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
one after the other, that's going to work, that's going to conserve a phase space area.

58
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
This leads to the conservation of that area and solvers

59
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
which have the same property are called symplectic.

60
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Sometimes people also use the term geometric integrators.

61
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,000
We are going to build the simple most one of these and have a look at the long term behavior

62
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
and there's something to note all of this works because the force

63
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
neither depends on time nor on velocity.

64
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:27,000
If the force was influenced by time or velocity that would most probably break this nice behavior.

65
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Homework 1 is going to show the evolution of phase space

66
00:05:31,000 --> 99:59:59,999
in action producing some nice diagrams.
