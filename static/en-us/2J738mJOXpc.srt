00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:07,400
how they're used along with DNS

00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:08,560
In the next lesson,

4
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:11,500
we'll see how addresses are grouped
together into networks and

5
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:14,970
how the world is coping with
the ongoing shortage of IPv4 addresses.
