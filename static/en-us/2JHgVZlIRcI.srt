1
00:00:00,312 --> 00:00:03,331
There are some other options you
can configure in your tracker

2
00:00:03,331 --> 00:00:04,444
configuration file.

3
00:00:04,444 --> 00:00:07,695
For example,
you could set the session timeout.

4
00:00:07,695 --> 00:00:12,046
And the session is a pretty
integral concept to Analytics.

5
00:00:12,046 --> 00:00:15,980
And the session timeout indicates how
long the app can be in the background

6
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:18,880
before Analytics consider
the current session to have ended.

7
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,410
I'm not going to go over all
these parameters now, but

8
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:24,630
you can read about them at your
leisure in the developer docs, and

9
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:27,620
the link to that is in
the instructor notes below.

10
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:32,900
One quick thing I do want to say is that
we already looked at the tracking ID,

11
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:37,840
but if you want to stop sending data to
Analytics, the easiest and quickest way

12
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,620
to do it is just to take your
analytics ID our of the tracking ID.

13
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:45,540
Now it's your turn to create
the tracking configuration file for

14
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:46,720
your app.

15
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:54,050
Create a new XML resource file called
tracker_app.xml in the res > xml folder.

16
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:58,360
Don't forget, you may need to create the
xml folder if it doesn't already exist.

17
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:01,150
And of course, you can call your
config file whatever you like.

18
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:03,980
It doesn't have to be tracker_app.xml.

19
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,540
That's just a good name.

20
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:09,150
And make sure that the root
element is resources.

21
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:14,458
Set your account ID, and you do that
with the ga_trackingId parameter.

22
00:01:14,458 --> 00:01:16,917
And then enable auto tracking,

23
00:01:16,917 --> 00:01:21,850
and you do that with
the ga_autoActivityTracking parameter.

24
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:23,870
And don't forget to set it to true.

25
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:31,470
And then finally, add the screen name
tags for the activities in your app.

26
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:34,910
And check off each of these boxes
when you've completed the tasks.
