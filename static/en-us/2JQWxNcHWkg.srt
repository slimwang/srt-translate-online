00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So, question for you.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
How many edges are there in an n-node hypercube?

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Possibly to make it easier for you or possibly to make it harder for you,

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
instead of coming up with an exact answer, I'll just give you a list of the Î values.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Work out what you think the answer actually is, but you only need to match it

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
with regard to the Big Î of one of these functions.
