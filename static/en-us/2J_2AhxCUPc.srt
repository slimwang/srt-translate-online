1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,310
I've mentioned before there are two
ways to add the constraints to our

2
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:04,590
record button.

3
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:07,400
There's another way if you don't want to
use the align button I’ve shown you

4
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:07,930
previously.

5
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:12,800
This is just to show you another way to
accomplish the same auto layout task,

6
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,620
you don't have to do this step.

7
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:17,780
First, I’m going to delete these two
constraints by highlighting them and

8
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:19,420
pressing the delete key.

9
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:21,420
Then, with the record button selected,

10
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:25,820
I'm going to hold down the control key,
and drag diagonally here into the view.

11
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:31,780
Now if I hold down the shift key
I can select center horizontally,

12
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:36,500
center vertically in container, and
then press the add constraints button.

13
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:40,670
This adds the exact same constraints
we did earlier using the align button.

14
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:45,630
I know this may seem like a bit of work
just to start understanding auto layout

15
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:48,570
and to get the button to be in
the center of the screen, but

16
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:51,480
as the saying goes you have to
learn to crawl before you can walk.

17
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,250
In the next section we're going to
wire up our button to the code in

18
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:59,360
the viewcontroller.swift file and make
the record button actually do something.
