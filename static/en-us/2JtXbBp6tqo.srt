00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,010
To round things out, let's double-check the subtleties of your understanding of

2
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:07,658
inverse functions. I've written a bunch of statements here and I'd like you to

3
00:00:07,658 --> 00:00:11,670
tell me which ones are true. Now, we may not have talked explicitly about every

4
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:15,883
single one of these. So, think about each of them carefully, and if you need to

5
00:00:15,883 --> 00:00:20,452
try more than once, that is completely fine, as always. You can check off as

6
00:00:20,452 --> 00:00:24,766
man as you want to, even all of them, if you think that that's appropriate. So

7
00:00:24,766 --> 00:00:30,045
here are your choices. All functions have inverses. All inverse functions have

8
00:00:30,045 --> 00:00:34,880
inverses. A functions domain can influence whether or not it has an inverse.

9
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:39,911
All functions pass the vertical and horizontal line tests. And lastly, all

10
00:00:39,911 --> 00:00:44,269
inverse functions pass the vertical and horizontal line tests.
