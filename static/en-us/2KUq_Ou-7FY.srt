00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:02,469
Alright so here's what we're going to do. We're going to try to figure

2
00:00:02,469 --> 00:00:06,280
out how to draw sorry, compute XOR as instead of a single

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:08,740
perceptron, which we know is impossible, we can do it as a

4
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:12,050
network of perceptron. Just to, to make it easier for you, here's

5
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:15,300
how we're going to set it up. That we're, we've x1 and x2

6
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:19,540
as our inputs We've got two units. This first unit is just

7
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:22,330
going to computing AND and we already know how to do that.

8
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:26,160
We've already figured out what weights need to be, here and here.

9
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,710
And what the threshold needs to be, so that the output will be

10
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:31,970
the and of those two inputs. So, that's all good. But ,what we don't

11
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:34,310
know ,eh, what, what, it turns out to be the case, that the

12
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:38,430
second unit, with now three inputs, X1, X2, and the and of X1 and

13
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:42,510
X2, can also be made to, or can be, can be, now, we

14
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:44,780
can set the weights on that, so that the output is going to be

15
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:47,210
XOR. So, what we'd like you to do is, figure out how to

16
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:51,050
do that. How do you set this weight - Is the input of X1,

17
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:54,350
this weight which is the and input, and this weight which

18
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:58,488
is the X2 input, and the threshold. So that ,it's going to actually

19
00:00:58,488 --> 00:01:00,710
compute an XOR. And, and just so you know, this

20
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:02,790
is not a trick question. You really can do it this time.
