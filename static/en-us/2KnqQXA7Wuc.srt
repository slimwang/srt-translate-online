1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,803
So, what we saw in this last quiz was
really interesting. Remember that we

2
00:00:03,803 --> 00:00:08,786
started out with 3^2 times 3^4, and we ended up
with 3^6 power.

3
00:00:08,786 --> 00:00:13,693
What we need to notice here is how the
exponents are related to each other. 2+4,

4
00:00:13,693 --> 00:00:19,169
our two original exponents, is equal to 6,
the final exponent. So, this actually

5
00:00:19,169 --> 00:00:23,519
shows us a general rule for multiplying
factors that have exponents. If the two

6
00:00:23,531 --> 00:00:28,191
numbers are multiplying together have the
same base, then their exponents just add

7
00:00:28,203 --> 00:00:31,926
to one another, and the base stays the
same. So, let's write that in a more

8
00:00:31,926 --> 00:00:36,651
general way. If we have some number, or
variable a, and it's taken to the power of

9
00:00:36,663 --> 00:00:41,331
b, and that's multiplied by another number
a that's taken to the power c. Then

10
00:00:41,338 --> 00:00:46,318
together, that multiplication can be
written as a^b+c.

11
00:00:46,318 --> 00:00:56,188
So, like we saw in the last quiz,
3^2 times 3^4=3^2+4=3^6, just like we found out

12
00:00:56,188 --> 00:01:00,316
in the end. Since exponents indicate
repeated multiplication, since each of

13
00:01:00,331 --> 00:01:05,230
these factors right here is just the
number or variable a being multiplied by

14
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:09,400
itself over and over again some number of
times. When they are multiplied together,

15
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:13,075
it's just even more a's multiplied
together, or some different number of a's

16
00:01:13,075 --> 00:01:16,893
multiplied together. This is just a
convenient way for us to not have to write

17
00:01:16,905 --> 00:01:20,346
out all of the numbers like we did when we
were doing this last quiz.
