1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,630
So the question is, how can we prevent aliasing from happening?

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:06,060
One is we can get more samples, okay?

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:10,200
We can join the megapixel craze in the current video technology.

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:16,160
My birthday's coming up this month and I treated myself to a new camera,

5
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,370
and the camera has 36 megapixels in an image, all right, so

6
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:24,520
that I can pull out really fine detail in a, in a, in a portrait.

7
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:27,610
But, in general, this sort of the megapixel thing doesn't go on forever.

8
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:29,940
You know, stuff always can or will go faster and

9
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:32,590
faster as I think, as things get further away, for example.

10
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:36,030
So what do you want to do, well, what you want to do is,

11
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:38,730
you want to make sure your signals are less wiggly.

12
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:41,530
That is, they don't have all that high frequency component.

13
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:43,460
You want to get rid of some of that information.

14
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:44,290
So the idea is,

15
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:47,550
we're going to get rid of some of the high frequency information, but

16
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:50,620
that's going to be better than aliasing, all right?

17
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:54,440
The idea is we don't want to see that weird checkerboard effect, right.

18
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:56,790
So we're going to remove some of the high frequency, but

19
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:59,460
the idea is that the thing will be well behaved.

20
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:03,970
So let's talk about that real quickly in our audio example.

21
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:08,030
What we're going to do is, we're going to introduce lowpass filters.

22
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:11,160
And what the lowpass filter is going to do is,

23
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:13,150
we're going to put that right here.

24
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:17,190
So where the analog voltage is coming out of the microphone, so

25
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:21,040
the signal that goes into the A to D converter,

26
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,740
doesn't have frequencies higher than a certain amount.

27
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:25,980
We'll say, okay, great.

28
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:30,920
So that says that we can reduce the number of samples we need to take,

29
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:34,530
or limit the number of samples we need to take, and then when we do

30
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:39,680
the reconstruction, we'll know that anything that was reconstructed that was

31
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,230
of a higher frequency than we let in should be thrown away.

32
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:47,650
So we use the lowpass filter again for the output to the speaker.
