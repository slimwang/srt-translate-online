00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,116
I'm standing here by the Google Corkboard

2
00:00:03,116 --> 00:00:07,520
Server Rack. This server rack was built in

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:10,840
1999 by Google employees simply because you

4
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:13,770
could not buy the computers required to achieve

5
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:17,390
the scale, reliability, and performance that Google

6
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:20,770
required. Each row here, has eight hard drives

7
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:25,880
on it, and four complete PCs. And there is a cork mat, to shield the electronics

8
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:28,370
from the metal frame that carries the row up.

9
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:31,130
That's why it was called the Google Corkboard Server

10
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:34,480
Rack. When your application runs on the Google Cloud

11
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,720
platform, you can be sure it runs on the

12
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:41,140
latest and best hardware. Well, perhaps not this version

13
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:45,510
from 1999. But the latest version that we built.

14
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:48,410
So, in this lesson we're going to cover the heavy

15
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:51,710
duty stuff. We'll start it off by looking at memcash,

16
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:55,370
a great way to optimize the performance of your application, then we'll

17
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:58,975
look at background jobs. In the form of push queues, pull queues,

18
00:00:58,975 --> 00:01:01,840
and cron jobs and we'll wrap it up by looking at some

19
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:06,930
of the scaling and tuning parameters for appendium. Let's get started, shall we?
