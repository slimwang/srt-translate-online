1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:04,696
So our second combined therapy, are the integrative therapies. And these are

2
00:00:04,696 --> 00:00:08,440
eclectic. And by eclectic what we mean is that the therapist can use any

3
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:13,490
technique he or she feels is best for the situation. So for example, in

4
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:18,448
treating post traumatic stress disorder, sometimes we use prolonged exposure

5
00:00:18,448 --> 00:00:23,762
therapy. And prolonged exposure therapy is a combination of cognitive

6
00:00:23,762 --> 00:00:29,008
behavioral therapy and systematic desensitization and relaxation therapy. So

7
00:00:29,008 --> 00:00:32,848
the idea here is that the person thinks about, is exposed to the trauma in

8
00:00:32,848 --> 00:00:36,752
their, in their minds, they imagine it, but at the same time, they also are

9
00:00:36,752 --> 00:00:44,157
relaxed and have to stay relaxed. So, if that happens, they become desensitized

10
00:00:44,157 --> 00:00:49,730
to the trauma and it no longer bothers them. Now sometimes, in fact, drugs

11
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:53,630
might also be added to this combination to help treat the anxiety and help with

12
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:55,770
the relaxation.
