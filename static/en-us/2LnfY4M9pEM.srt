1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:01,300
There are many services out

2
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:04,520
there that let you create
clusters on demand in minutes.

3
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:07,210
This allows you to pay for a cluster
only when you need the resources.

4
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:12,950
Amazon's offering is called
Elastic MapReduce, or EMR for short.

5
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:16,465
It works well with other
AWS services such as S3 and

6
00:00:16,465 --> 00:00:21,721
automatically installed applications
such as Hive, Presto, and Spark.

7
00:00:21,721 --> 00:00:22,441
Google has a service too.

8
00:00:22,441 --> 00:00:27,040
Cloud Data Proc allows you to analyze
data with MapReduce, Hive, Spark,

9
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:27,844
and others.

10
00:00:27,844 --> 00:00:31,677
Microsoft also has a Hadoop
cloud service, HDInsight.

11
00:00:31,677 --> 00:00:34,330
Which one you choose
depends on your budget and

12
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:37,742
how well it works with other
cloud services you're using.

13
00:00:37,742 --> 00:00:40,400
For this lesson you'll
be using Amazon's EMR.
