00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,770
The equation for line A is x equals 2, and the equation for line B is y equals

2
00:00:04,782 --> 00:00:09,825
negative 5. Let's talk about why. Remember that along any vertical line, every

3
00:00:09,837 --> 00:00:14,761
single point has the same x value. The y values are going to range everywhere

4
00:00:14,773 --> 00:00:19,528
negative infinity all the way to positive infinity. But the x one it stays

5
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:23,975
constant along that entire range. So, this is the only equation that we can

6
00:00:23,987 --> 00:00:27,895
write that fits every point along that line. There's a similar deal for line B

7
00:00:27,907 --> 00:00:31,905
and other horizontal lines. But regarding their y-coordinates instead of their

8
00:00:31,997 --> 00:00:35,825
x-coordinates. We said that every point along a horizontal line has the same y

9
00:00:35,837 --> 00:00:39,965
value. Its x values go from negative infinity to positive infinity. But the only

10
00:00:39,977 --> 00:00:44,157
equation that accurately describes every point along the line is y equals

11
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:48,970
negative 5. Vertical and horizontal lines then have sort of special equations

12
00:00:48,982 --> 00:00:53,400
because they only have one variable in them. This is pretty different from

13
00:00:53,412 --> 00:00:58,152
equations of other lines we've seen, like for example y equals 3 x minus 2. Here

14
00:00:58,164 --> 00:01:02,292
we have an x and y in the same equation. What these equations show is,

15
00:01:02,304 --> 00:01:07,303
respectively, that for vertical lines, this relation with x is going to be true

16
00:01:07,315 --> 00:01:12,163
regardless of y value. And for horizontal lines, this equation involving y is

17
00:01:12,175 --> 00:01:15,687
going to be true regardless of x value, or for any x value.
