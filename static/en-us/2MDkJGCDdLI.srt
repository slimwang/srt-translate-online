The solution for the drinking birds crossbar and nose are nothing special. You

2
00:00:03,575 --> 00:00:07,228
set the position. You rotate it by 90 degrees and you're pretty much done. The

3
00:00:07,228 --> 00:00:10,956
eyes are a little bit more interesting. First you have to translate to position,

4
00:00:10,956 --> 00:00:14,542
then rotate. To do this, you have to make an object 3D so that you can do the

5
00:00:14,542 --> 00:00:18,492
rotation after the translation. Our drinking bird is functional but could always

6
00:00:18,492 --> 00:00:21,639
be improved. He could maybe have a few helices for his tail feathers. His

7
00:00:21,639 --> 00:00:25,164
eyeballs could be flatter and he could have pupils for his eyes. He could have a

8
00:00:25,164 --> 00:00:28,796
jaunty hat and a corncob pipe in his mouth. The crossbar could surround his tube

9
00:00:28,796 --> 00:00:33,275
instead of poking through it. He could have classier feet. I hope you'll play

10
00:00:33,275 --> 00:00:36,025
around with him and improve his appearance. I'd love to see what you come up

11
00:00:36,025 --> 00:00:36,273
with.
