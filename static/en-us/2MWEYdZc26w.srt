00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
For homework 3.4, we also give you equations for the position of our robot.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Let's start at the center coordinates of our circle,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
because our robot is undergoing circular motion,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
and we can look at the (x, y) coordinates of our robot before the motion.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Now, the question is given these (x, y) coordinates and the robot's orientation angle theta,

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
how can we find cx and cy.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Well, we just define a right triangle, and we see that this angle is theta.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
We can show this angle must also be theta.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
This length is R, so that means this horizontal distance is R times the sine of theta,

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
and the vertical distance is R times the cosine of theta.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:52,000
That means that cx is just equal to the initial x position minus this extra distance,

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:00,000
R times the sine of theta, and cy is equal to the initial y position plus this extra distance,

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
R times the cosine of theta.

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Okay. Now let's let our car advance by some turning angle beta.

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
This angle is beta, and here is our robot car.

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Let's call these coordinates x-prime, y-prime.

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
How can I get an equation for x-prime and y-prime.

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Well, we can see that this total angle here is equal to beta plus theta,

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
and just as we defined a right triangle before, we can define another right triangle

20
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,000
where this line is going to be R times the sine of beta plus theta,

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
and this line will be R times the cosine of beta plus theta.

22
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
So working from our center point,

23
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:57,000
x-prime is going to be equal to cx plus this extra distance, which is R times the sine of beta plus theta,

24
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:05,000
and the y-prime we can see will be cy minus the extra distance of R times the cosine of beta plus theta.

25
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Theta prime, of course, will just be equal to our old theta plus the turning angle.

26
00:02:11,000 --> 99:59:59,999
We can't forget to make the mod 2Ï€. Good work.
