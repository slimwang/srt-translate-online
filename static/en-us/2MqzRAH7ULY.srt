>> Interesting answer, David, note that there are several factors in

2
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:02,260
David's answers. In the two situations that he thought were most similar to

3
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:06,430
a woman climbing up a ladder, in the similarity in the relationship, climbing up

4
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:12,350
as well as similarity between objects, woman and ladder. In contrast, one that

5
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:16,070
he did not think was really similar to a woman climbing up a ladder, woman

6
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:20,610
painting a ladder. Although there is some similarity between the objects woman,

7
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:24,910
and ladder, the relationship is very different here it is climbing up a ladder,

8
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:28,590
here it is painting a ladder which are two very different activities.

9
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:32,370
Between one and two we notice, that both of them have the same relationship,

10
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:36,830
climbing up, but an object is different, In one case it is the step ladder and

11
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:40,950
in another case it is a set of stairs. So one can have similarities in

12
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:45,410
relationships, one can have similarities in objects, of course some of you

13
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:48,980
may have different rankings with the similarities of the one they would give.

14
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:52,010
Because, your background knowledge might be different or your priorities might

15
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:56,350
be different, but the point here is the similarity can be measured around

16
00:01:56,350 --> 00:02:01,210
several dimensions. Around the dimension of relationships, around

17
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:04,760
the dimension of objects, around the dimensions of features of objects, and

18
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:08,538
around the dimensions of values of features of objects that are participating in

19
00:02:08,538 --> 00:02:12,100
relationships, we'll talk more about this in just a few minutes.
