1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:04,049
In our provider query code, let's write
the case for a single task with ID.

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:08,759
To select a row of data by its ID,
we'll use the selection and

3
00:00:08,759 --> 00:00:11,539
selection args parameters
of the query method.

4
00:00:11,539 --> 00:00:15,369
First we'll have to get
the row ID from the past MURI.

5
00:00:15,369 --> 00:00:19,410
The URI will look similar
to the tasks directory URI.

6
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:23,370
It'll start with the same scheme
authority and tasks path.

7
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:27,520
But this time also with an ID
as the last part of the path.

8
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:31,939
And we can grab this ID by using a call
to get path segments on that URI.

9
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,799
And get with the index one passed in.

10
00:00:35,799 --> 00:00:39,070
Index 0 would be the tasks
portion of the path.

11
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:41,429
And index 1 is the segment
right next to that.

12
00:00:41,429 --> 00:00:45,460
And I'll store this ID in
a string variable named ID.

13
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:49,090
Then let's create our selection and
selection args for this ID.

14
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:53,570
I'll create variables mSelection and
mSelectionArgs to hold these values.

15
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:57,390
The selection will be the string _id=?.

16
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:03,850
And this is just the default name of
the ID column, _id, in our tasks table.

17
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:06,519
Followed by an equal sign and
a question mark.

18
00:01:06,519 --> 00:01:09,019
The question mark indicates
that this is asking for

19
00:01:09,019 --> 00:01:12,349
the rest of this equality from
the selection args parameter.

20
00:01:12,349 --> 00:01:17,519
And the selection args should be the row
ID which we just got from the past NURI.

21
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:20,209
And selection args has to
be an array of strings,

22
00:01:20,209 --> 00:01:23,149
even if it's an array with
just one value in it.

23
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:27,719
So again, our selection is the string of
the ID column followed by an equals and

24
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:29,049
a question mark.

25
00:01:29,049 --> 00:01:33,479
And our selection args is an array
that holds the value of the row ID.

26
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,500
And finally we'll put this selection and

27
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:39,280
the selection args into the same
query code we used before.

28
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,769
This time with the desired
row ID criteria.

29
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:45,379
That completes this
task with ID case and

30
00:01:45,379 --> 00:01:49,030
you can change the selection parameters
to filter any of the data you return.
