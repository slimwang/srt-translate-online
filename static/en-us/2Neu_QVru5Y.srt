1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:05,420
Let's walk through and pick the Q on which to place Ty, based on the scheduling

2
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:10,400
policy. Now if you ask the question, what is the minimum I

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:15,370
plus Q for PU for this particular thread Ty, that's

4
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:20,970
going to be the infinity that Ty has on PU.

5
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:25,450
The affinity that T, Ty has on Pu is 2. But also we have to look

6
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:29,791
at the queue size. And the queue size of Pu is 1. There's only one thread

7
00:00:29,791 --> 00:00:37,250
sitting there. So the overall min of I plus Q for Ty with respect to Pu is

8
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:43,174
3. Let's do the same thing for Ty on Pv. In the case of Pv, its

9
00:00:43,174 --> 00:00:47,390
affinity apparently is higher because there's only one

10
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:50,900
intervening task that ran since the last time Ty

11
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:57,560
ran on it. That's good news, but we also have to look at the Q of Pv. When

12
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:03,510
Ty gets put on Pv's Q, it has to sit behind whatever they may be, and in the

13
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:11,440
case of Pv, the Q already has four threads to run. So when Ty is put on Pv's

14
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:12,660
Q, it's going to be stuck at the end of

15
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:16,220
this Q. Which means that, in a sense, the amount

16
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:19,538
of intervention that is going to happen for Ty on

17
00:01:19,538 --> 00:01:22,580
Pv, by the time it gets to run, is actually

18
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:25,990
the size of the, the affinity index for Py with

19
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:30,090
respect to Pv currently as well as the intervention that's

20
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,200
going to happen by the time it actually gets to

21
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:35,490
that. So that's four, so the overall I plus Q

22
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:38,970
is five for this guy, and three for this guy.

23
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:41,275
Which means that the choice I am going to make

24
00:01:41,275 --> 00:01:46,420
is to put Ty on Pu, because, that's the one that will result in the least

25
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:49,280
amount of intervention for polluting the cache of

26
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,870
Pu with respect to this particular thread Ty
