1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:05,088
Now we're going to allow the user to
create new notes by tapping a button.

2
00:00:05,088 --> 00:00:10,312
When we have to add a new cell for the
table, notify the table so it reloads.

3
00:00:10,312 --> 00:00:13,660
The beauty of core data is that
it takes care of all of that.

4
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:16,390
So let's create the new method.

5
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:19,100
Try it out and
see what's actually happening.

6
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:24,780
First let's add an add button and
link it to an IB action.

7
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:27,125
Now, we get to implement this action.

8
00:00:27,125 --> 00:00:30,887
And you might want to think a little
bit about what should go in here.

9
00:00:30,887 --> 00:00:34,390
Creating a new note seems like
the obvious thing so let's start there.

10
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:41,881
Okay, so we have our new note, but
now do we have to do anything else?

11
00:00:41,881 --> 00:00:43,969
Should we update the table view?

12
00:00:43,969 --> 00:00:45,247
Well you think about it.

13
00:00:45,247 --> 00:00:48,324
I'll go ahead and run the app.

14
00:00:48,324 --> 00:00:52,937
So we have a storyboard which
is updated with an add button

15
00:00:52,937 --> 00:00:56,510
which is linked to an IB action.

16
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:58,871
Now, we get to implement this action and

17
00:00:58,871 --> 00:01:02,628
you might want to think a little
bit about what should go in here.

18
00:01:02,628 --> 00:01:07,550
Creating a new note seems like
the obvious thing so let's start there.

19
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:10,302
Now do we have to do anything else?

20
00:01:10,302 --> 00:01:12,589
Should we update the table view?

21
00:01:12,589 --> 00:01:16,281
While you think about it,
I'll go ahead and run the app.

22
00:01:16,281 --> 00:01:18,348
Tada magic.

23
00:01:18,348 --> 00:01:20,632
Well, I don't know about you, but

24
00:01:20,632 --> 00:01:24,465
I usually want to see how
a magic trick actually works.

25
00:01:24,465 --> 00:01:27,710
So who's actually getting
the job done here?

26
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:31,615
It's the MVC, the notifications,
and the delegate at work.
