1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:02,020
Alright, now we can actually dive in and

2
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:04,930
give a definition for PAC-learnable. So, a concept class,

3
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:09,640
C, is PAC-learnable by some learning algorithm, L, using

4
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:13,760
its own representation of hypothesis, H, if and only

5
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:16,190
if that learner will, with high probability, at least

6
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:20,090
1 minus Delta, ouput a hypothesis h, little h,

7
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:23,470
from its set of hypothesis. That has error less

8
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:26,040
than or equal to epsilon, so it's very accurate.

9
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:29,120
And it needs to be the case that the time that it takes

10
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:32,259
to do this. And the number of samples that it needs draws from

11
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:37,070
this distribution D is relatively small. In fact, bounded by polynomial in one

12
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:41,460
over epsilon, one over delta and the size of the hypothesis space n.

13
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:44,306
>> Okay, so in other words you're saying something is

14
00:00:44,306 --> 00:00:51,182
PAC-learnable if you can learn to get low error, at least

15
00:00:51,182 --> 00:00:54,330
with some high confidence you can be fairly confident that you will have

16
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:59,300
a low error in time that's sort of polynomial in all the parameters.

17
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:01,910
>> Exactly, and you can see here that this, this epsilon and delta

18
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:04,239
actually giving us a lot of wiggle room, if you really want to

19
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:08,930
have perfect error. Or perfect certainty. Then these things go to infinity. So,

20
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:12,160
you just, you need, you need to look at all the possible data.

21
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:12,220
>> Mm.

22
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:15,780
>> So, yeah this is really going to only give us partial guarantees.

23
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:15,780
>>

24
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:18,200
Okay. Sure. Okay, I think I understand that. .
