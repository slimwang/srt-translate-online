00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,120
We have seen some aspects of VLIW.

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,840
Now lets discuss VLI backward compatibility as a

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:12,218
quiz. Let's say we have a simple VLIW processor. It has a 64-bit that specifies

4
00:00:12,218 --> 00:00:15,129
two operations, so it's roughly equivalent to

5
00:00:15,129 --> 00:00:18,182
two normal instructions, and let's say that this

6
00:00:18,182 --> 00:00:21,590
processor fetches, decodes and executes, etc, one of

7
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:25,262
the 64-bit instructions per cycle. Now, we want

8
00:00:25,262 --> 00:00:26,936
to build a better version of this

9
00:00:26,936 --> 00:00:30,010
processor. It can do four operations per cycle.

10
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:34,771
So, it will need to fetch the code and execute two of those 64-bit instructions

11
00:00:34,771 --> 00:00:41,152
per cycle. The question for you is, is this new processor a VLIW processor? The

12
00:00:41,152 --> 00:00:46,920
possible answers for you are yes it is, or no it's not really a VLIW processor.
