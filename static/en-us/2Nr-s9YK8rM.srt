1
00:00:00,005 --> 00:00:04,622
Log base 2 of 24 minus log base 2 of 3 should, according to the quotient

2
00:00:04,622 --> 00:00:11,327
property, equal log base 2 of 24 over 3. And 24 over 3 is just 8, so this is

3
00:00:11,327 --> 00:00:16,760
log base 2 of 8. However, we can rewrite 8 as 2 to the 3rd power, and we know

4
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:20,820
that log base 2 of 2 to the 3rd is just 3, 3 is the exponent we need to take a

5
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:27,260
2 to, to get 8. There we go, once again the quotient property has seriously

6
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:31,990
helped us simplify a log expression. Instead of log base 2 of 24, minus log

7
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:35,373
base 2 of 3, we just have the number 3.
