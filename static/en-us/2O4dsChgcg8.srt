1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:05,570
The main shortcoming of DES,
is that it uses a 56 bit key.

2
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:09,160
Which means the keyspace
is relatively small.

3
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:10,350
To overcome this,

4
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:14,420
we can run this multiple times,
each using a different key.

5
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:18,000
The standard is to run DES three times.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,990
And this is called a triple DES.

7
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:24,370
The standard is to run the encryption
process, then decryption process,

8
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:26,580
then the encryption process again.

9
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:30,880
And correspondingly for decryption, this
will mean to run the decryption process

10
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:36,230
first, then the encryption process,
then the decryption process again.

11
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:41,220
And record that with DES, the decryption
process is actually the same as

12
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:46,810
the encryption process, only that we
apply the keys in the reverse order.

13
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:50,140
The advantage of using
this order of operations,

14
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:53,830
is that it supports
multiple key lengths.

15
00:00:53,830 --> 00:01:00,770
In particular If key 1 is the same as
key 3, then the result is a 112-bit DES.

16
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:06,570
If all three keys are different,
then the result is a 168-bit DES.

17
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:08,950
If we set key 2 the same as key 1,

18
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:15,440
then the the triple DES has in effect
become a single DES with key three.

19
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,690
This is useful for compatibility.

20
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:22,550
For example a triple DES device
can be configured to communicate

21
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:27,255
with a single DES device, by simply
setting key 2, the same as key 1.
