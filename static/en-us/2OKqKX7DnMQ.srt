00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:05,087
So let's bring up the Z table. So here's our Z table, area under the normal

2
00:00:05,087 --> 00:00:10,834
curve. And we want this probability here. Well first of all, if 95% is here and

3
00:00:10,834 --> 00:00:18,258
the total area under the curve is 100%, then that means 2.5% is in this tail and

4
00:00:18,258 --> 00:00:24,587
2.5% is within this tail. So we want to find out what this Z value is when

5
00:00:24,587 --> 00:00:33,016
there's 2.5% less than that Z value. So let's bring up the Z table. We want this

6
00:00:33,016 --> 00:00:42,016
gray region to be 0.025, or 2.5%, so if we try to find 0.25, we see that it's

7
00:00:42,016 --> 00:00:51,832
here, at a Z value of negative 1.96. So this here is negative 1.96, and this

8
00:00:51,832 --> 00:01:02,262
total area up until this Z value is 95% plus 2.5% which is 97.5%. So let's look

9
00:01:02,262 --> 00:01:10,585
for 0.975, and we see that it's here, at positive 1.96. If we found that the Z

10
00:01:10,585 --> 00:01:16,025
score here is negative 1.96, then since this is symmetric and mu is 0 standard

11
00:01:16,025 --> 00:01:21,380
deviations from itself, then we know that this would be positive 1.96, but I

12
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:26,133
just wanted to show you, using the z table, how they're symmetric.
