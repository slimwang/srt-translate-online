1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,900
Now, wait a minute, we have an NP complete problem here knapsack and have just shown

2
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:11,910
that the running time for solving this problem is of the order of n*v given n objects

3
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:15,040
and the total value of those objects, if you sum it all up, of v.

4
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,640
Now, I just have to quiz you here of course.

5
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,540
Does this mean that P=NP, although I've told you we don't know, and of course, I don't?

6
00:00:22,540 --> 99:59:59,999
I just want you to select something here but also to think about why.
