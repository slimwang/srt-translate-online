Alcohol is the second leading cause of premature death in the United States.

00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:08,485
Excessive alcohol use is associated with brain tissue loss and intellectual

impairments.

00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,625
>> Long term alcohol use also results in problems with the liver including fatty

00:00:13,625 --> 00:00:16,480
liver and cirrhosis of the liver.

>> In addition to heart attack, heart disease, hypertension, stroke, cancer and

00:00:20,044 --> 00:00:23,662
impaired immunities which are all associated with excessive long term alcohol

>> That's a lot of negative effects so keep that in mind. Now, let's recap the

10
00:00:29,592 --> 00:00:34,039
benzodiazapines and the barbituates. Both of those are used as medicines, but

11
00:00:34,039 --> 00:00:38,616
they're also both abused. The barbiturates are used as medicine to treat

12
00:00:38,616 --> 00:00:42,908
epilepsy, because they reduce seizure activity. And the benzodiazepines are

13
00:00:42,908 --> 00:00:46,418
used to treat anxiety, and sometimes they're prescribed for individuals as a

14
00:00:46,418 --> 00:00:49,210
