00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,695
We can use a quadratic formula to solve this problem. First we put our answer in

2
00:00:05,695 --> 00:00:13,170
standard form, plug in 0 for y, and then substitute into the quadratic formula

3
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:18,318
to obtain our two solutions of 2 plus 3i and 2 minus 3i.
