00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:05,620
This equation will be a parabola that opens downward. Great work if you got it.

2
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:10,162
We know it's a parabola since we have an x squared term, but just a y term. We

3
00:00:10,162 --> 00:00:14,586
don't have y squared. Because we don't have both x squared and y squared, we

4
00:00:14,586 --> 00:00:19,578
know our shape will be a parabola. To figure out which direction the parabola

5
00:00:19,578 --> 00:00:23,980
opens, we need to solve for y. So, first I'll subtract 27 from both sides of

6
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:30,560
the equation. We subtract 27 here and here, to get this new equation. Now we

7
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:36,630
want to divide every term by negative 4 to get y by itself. So, dividing this

8
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:40,787
by negative 4, we get y. Dividing this by negative 4, we get positive 27

9
00:00:40,787 --> 00:00:45,003
divided by 4 and dividing this by negative 4 we get negative three fourths x

10
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:50,714
squared. So since this equation is of the form y equals, we know that it's

11
00:00:50,714 --> 00:00:56,487
going to open up, or it's going to open down. Since the x squared term has a

12
00:00:56,487 --> 00:01:02,852
negative coefficient, our parabola opens downward. And, just to show you, this

13
00:01:02,852 --> 00:01:08,074
equation is the one I have shown graphed, this equation is still the same. And

14
00:01:08,074 --> 00:01:13,981
this one is identical as well. All three equations represent the same parabola

15
00:01:13,981 --> 00:01:15,881
that opens down.
