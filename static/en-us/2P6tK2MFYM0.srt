00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:04,210
As an exercise, I want you to build
the graph laplacian for this thing.

2
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:07,060
Fill in the entries of
the laplacian here.

3
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:10,130
And you can just leave an entry
blank if you want to indicate a zero

4
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:10,630
should go there.
