00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,620
Let's take a closer look at how naming base

2
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:06,205
redirection works. In the example shown here, I've looked up

3
00:00:06,205 --> 00:00:11,020
symantec.com from two different locations. You can see that

4
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:13,570
when we look up the domain name, we don't get

5
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:15,860
an A record immediately, but rather we get a

6
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:18,210
CNAME or a canonical name. Which tells us to look

7
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:20,860
up the following domain name in Akamai. When we look

8
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:24,810
up that domain name, we see, two corresponding IP addresses.

9
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:27,066
Notice that when we perform the same look

10
00:00:27,066 --> 00:00:30,660
up from Boston, we also get redirected to Akamai

11
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,150
through the CNAME, but we get, two different IP

12
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:37,040
addresses, that are presumably more local to the Boston

13
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,510
area. So depending on where the client looks

14
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:42,690
up the domain name, it recieves different IP addresses

15
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:46,050
at different locations in the network. This is how

16
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:50,298
operators use DNS to redirect clients to nearby replicas.

17
00:00:50,298 --> 00:00:54,098
As another example,you can see when I ping youtube.com,

18
00:00:54,098 --> 00:00:56,910
I get very low latencies. And when I do

19
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:59,380
a reverse lookup on this IP address, I in

20
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:03,100
fact see that the content was posted on Google CDN.
