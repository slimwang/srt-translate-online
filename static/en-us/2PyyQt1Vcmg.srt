00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:04,200
Now that we have learned how to specify states in planning,

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:08,125
let us look at how to specify the operators. So consider the operator,

3
00:00:08,125 --> 00:00:12,700
climb-ladder. You might specify the climb-ladder operator, and

4
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:17,970
any other operator in general, to a set of preconditions, and post-conditions.

5
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:22,740
So for the climb-ladder operator, the precondition might be that the robot is on

6
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:27,380
the floor and the ladder is dry. Notice that these are being written in

7
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:31,261
the language of propositional logic. And the postcondition for

8
00:00:31,261 --> 00:00:35,160
the climb-ladder operator might be that the robot is on the ladder.

9
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,970
This captures the notion that the robot has climbed the ladder. It was

10
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:43,610
earlier on the floor and later it's on the ladder. Several things to note here.

11
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:50,212
First, by convention the precondition does not have any negative leg holds.

12
00:00:50,212 --> 00:00:53,300
All the leg holds in the precondition are positive.

13
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:57,150
Post conditions of operators may have negative leg holds.

14
00:00:57,150 --> 00:01:02,090
Second, the meaning of this pre-condition, and post conditions is that,

15
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:07,330
these assertions are true in the world before this operator can be applied.

16
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:11,420
And that these assertions become true in the world after this operator has been

17
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:16,800
applied. This captures the syntax of the operator climb-ladder.

18
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:22,070
The semantics of this operator is that this operator can be applied if and

19
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:26,690
only if the preconditions of the operator are true in the world.

20
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:30,160
It cannot be applied if the preconditions are not true in the world
