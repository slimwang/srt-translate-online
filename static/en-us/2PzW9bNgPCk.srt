1
00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:03,220
Alright, this one is going to be tough.

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:06,730
In this exercise we're going
to let Gigagal start jumping.

3
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:08,960
First, by making her fall.

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,960
Then, by making sure she
doesn't fall through the floor.

5
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:14,950
And finally,
the hardest part is deciding what to do

6
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:17,350
in response to the jump
key being pressed.

7
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:21,285
Should Gigagal start jumping,
continue a jump she already started or

8
00:00:21,285 --> 00:00:25,102
is Gigagal falling and therefore
we shouldn't do anything at all?

9
00:00:25,102 --> 00:00:28,340
Stick with it though,
because the result is way too much fun.

10
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:31,640
It's up to you now.

11
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:34,580
You've got the set up, the constants
that determine how jumping works

12
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:37,840
like how strong gravity is and
how high Gigagal should jump.

13
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,060
Set up the jump state enumeration
that determines whether Gigagal is

14
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:43,590
on the ground,
currently jumping, or falling.

15
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:46,350
Then sort out how to transition
amongst those states.

16
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:47,510
Finally, just jump around.
