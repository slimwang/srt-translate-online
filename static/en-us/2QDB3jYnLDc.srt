1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:03,480
So here we can see my app and a couple
of the modifications that I've done.

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:06,380
First of all,
there's the AndroidManifest.xml.

3
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:09,040
I've added the uses-feature for OpenGL.

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,050
I've added the meta-data for
the Google services.

5
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:15,840
I've also added the meta-data For
the API key.

6
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:20,310
As I scroll across you can see API_KEY,
and here's my API key that I got for

7
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:22,280
the Google developers console.

8
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:25,190
I can show in a moment where I
configured the Google developers console

9
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:26,390
for this app.

10
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:30,890
I've set my permissions, and you can see
them here, INTERNET, ACCESS_NETWORK, and

11
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:32,451
WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE.

12
00:00:32,451 --> 00:00:33,797
And that's pretty much it.

13
00:00:33,797 --> 00:00:35,400
It's very straightforward.

14
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:39,610
In the Google developer's console, I can
look at the Google developer's console.

15
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:42,220
And if I click Edit
allowed applications.

16
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:42,940
And I scroll down.

17
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:44,650
I have a number of
applications that I've filled.

18
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:47,171
But this one is called maps3_6.

19
00:00:47,171 --> 00:00:51,306
And I've just added the SHA1 key,
followed by a semicolon,

20
00:00:51,306 --> 00:00:54,560
followed by the name of the application.

21
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:58,010
And when I did that,
I was given this API key, here.

22
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:02,278
You can see it begins with AIza and
ends with Drz8 and

23
00:01:02,278 --> 00:01:08,195
when I go back to my manifest file I
can see that key is present right here,

24
00:01:08,195 --> 00:01:11,493
beginning with AIza ending with Drz8.

25
00:01:11,493 --> 00:01:14,740
So that's what I had to do to
set up the application to run.

26
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:16,300
Now in my activity.

27
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:18,430
Now in my layout I've added a fragment.

28
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:23,415
And it's typed
com.google.android.gms.maps.StreetViewP-

29
00:01:23,415 --> 00:01:24,230
anorama.

30
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:26,870
And I've called it streetviewpanorama,
simply.

31
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:30,130
So next we're going to update
the code behind our main activity

32
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:33,850
to handle this fragment and
to draw the street view for us.
