All we have to do now is explicitly write down the solution for the values of x

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:08,398
that satisfy this inequality. First, I'd like you to write the solution using

3
00:00:08,398 --> 00:00:12,174
inequalities to show the ranges of x and then, I'd like you to write it in

4
00:00:12,174 --> 00:00:16,476
interval notation. Be really careful about where on a number line these

5
00:00:16,476 --> 00:00:21,076
intervals fall, and think back to what we learned about compound inequalities.

6
00:00:21,076 --> 00:00:25,504
These use either, or, in-between two inequalities or and, where things with and

7
00:00:25,504 --> 00:00:30,109
can be written using the change notation, or something similar to this. Remember

8
00:00:30,109 --> 00:00:34,339
also how compound inequalities translate into interval notation. If you need to

9
00:00:34,339 --> 00:00:36,535
review any of this, you can always go back to a previous lesson to look it up

10
00:00:36,535 --> 00:00:41,244
and refresh your memory. Or you can go to the forums, they're always there to

11
00:00:41,244 --> 00:00:41,988
help you.
