1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,190
Now unless you're one of the first students to make it

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:05,410
through this class there are probably a lot of, responses in that

3
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:08,410
thread. And in this question you're really going to take advantage

4
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:11,500
of the form. And the way your going to do that, well, let's

5
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:14,740
write it as a flow. First your going to find somebody elses

6
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:18,670
response to the previous question. But when you do this make sure

7
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:21,630
that you don't read the review or anything but the name

8
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:25,580
of the app to begin with. Because the second step is to

9
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,510
form your own opinion about this app. What do

10
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:30,410
you like about it? What do you dislike? What would

11
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:33,750
you change? Once you figure these answers out for yourself,

12
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:36,480
you can go on to step three, which is actually

13
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,100
to take a look at the other students' prezi. You'll

14
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,620
learn what they didn't like about this particular app and

15
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:47,860
how they would fix it. Finally, you'll respond. Just in

16
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:50,890
that same thread, you'll respond to the post that this

17
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:54,130
other student has made. And this is the part where you have to make sure to be

18
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:59,080
productive. Nobody's wrong in these situations, different people like

19
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:01,500
different things. In fact, in the next lesson, we're

20
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:05,379
going to learn that even though good or good

21
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:08,170
can differ between users. We still have systems and

22
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:10,410
techniques that we can use to insure the products

23
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:13,890
we build will be good for our intended audience.
