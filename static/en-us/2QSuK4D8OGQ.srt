00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:03,678
So, here's a question for you. Say, you render an image by the extreme of

2
00:00:03,678 --> 00:00:07,176
finding what object is visible at each pixel and finding how light effects just

3
00:00:07,176 --> 00:00:10,621
that surface, which of the following objects can be rendered with this simple

4
00:00:10,621 --> 00:00:15,498
system? Here's a hint, exactly two answers are correct. So, could you make the

5
00:00:15,498 --> 00:00:20,742
object polished metal surface reflecting everything around it, unpolished wood

6
00:00:20,742 --> 00:00:25,378
showing a grain, a light bulb, or an object made of glass reflecting light

7
00:00:25,378 --> 00:00:29,620
through it? Here are your four materials. Pick two that could be made with this

8
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:30,719
simple rendering system.
