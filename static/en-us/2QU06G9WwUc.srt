1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The first approach I'll talk about--I'll call it Solution #0

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
because it's really not even approaching a solution--

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
is to have pairwise shared keys.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
And the idea here is for everyone who ever might want to communicate

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
to get together and form keys between them,

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
so let's say this is Alice, Bob, Colleen, Diana,

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
someone whose name starts with E, and someone whose name starts with F.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
And Alice would set up a pairwise shared key, secretly communicating

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
with each of the other people.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Bob has a shared key with Alice.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Bob would find a shared key with all of the other people

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
that he might want to communicate with, and Colleen needs to find

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
a shared key with the remaining people, and so forth.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
And you would have a key between every pair of people,

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
and so whoever wants to communicate, well,

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
if it's between Colleen and Edgar, they would have a shared key

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
that they've previously established to communicate.

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
This might work for a small number of people.

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
If we have a large number of people, this gets to be ridiculously expensive,

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
so we'll have a short warmup quiz to see how expensive.

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The question is how many keys would we need

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
if there was a group of 100 people, and any of pair of them

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
should be able to communicate secretly with each other?
