00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:03,798
People forget things because of interference. They can also forget things

2
00:00:03,798 --> 00:00:08,832
because of brain injury of disease. Forgetting things because of brain injury

3
00:00:08,832 --> 00:00:13,046
or disease is what we call amnesia. Now, there's two types of amnesia that

4
00:00:13,046 --> 00:00:17,747
psychologists study. The first is anterior grade amnesia. Someone with an

5
00:00:17,747 --> 00:00:21,968
anterior grade amnesia can't remember anything after the onset of a disease, or

6
00:00:21,968 --> 00:00:27,480
a brain injury. Do you remember HN that we talked about earlier in the lesson?

7
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:31,957
He had anterior grade amnesia. That was a perfect example of that. Now, the

8
00:00:31,957 --> 00:00:36,674
second type of amnesia is retrograde amnesia. Someone with retrograde amnesia

9
00:00:36,674 --> 00:00:40,096
can't remember anything before a brain injury, or before the onset of a

10
00:00:40,096 --> 00:00:44,892
disease. Let's go to Greg to talk about a personal experience with both of

11
00:00:44,892 --> 00:00:46,490
these types of amnesia.
