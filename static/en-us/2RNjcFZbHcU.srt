One thing that has fascinated me for literally my entire life, is stars, and

2
00:00:03,891 --> 00:00:08,119
how far away from us they are. Did you know that when we look at a star, like

3
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:10,955
the sun for example, we're looking at something from the past because of the

4
00:00:10,955 --> 00:00:15,905
time it takes the light to reach us. That's pretty weird and pretty awesome, I

5
00:00:15,905 --> 00:00:19,880
think. So let's work out how long it takes the light to reach us from the sun.

6
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:24,424
As you saw before, the distance from the earth to the sun is approximately 1.5

7
00:00:24,424 --> 00:00:29,932
times 10 to the 11th meters. Light travels at a speed of 3 times 10 to the 8th

8
00:00:29,932 --> 00:00:34,896
meters per second. As we can see from the units of speed here, meters per

9
00:00:34,896 --> 00:00:38,678
second, speed is equal to some distance, divided by the time it takes to go

10
00:00:38,678 --> 00:00:44,362
that distance. Now thinking about this equation, what do we need to do to

11
00:00:44,362 --> 00:00:49,880
calculate time? Do we need to multiply speed by distance, divide distance by

12
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:53,449
speed or divide speed by distance?
