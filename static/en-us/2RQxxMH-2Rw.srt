00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,060
Now it's time for you to meet Carol, and as I mentioned at the beginning of this course,

2
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:10,060
Carol is working in finance and her job is to design algorithms

3
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:12,570
that will optimize financial investments.

4
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:15,290
Given recent market turmoils,

5
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:18,580
her employer has asked her to come up with an algorithm

6
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:23,610
that will help them design a secure portfolio of investments.

7
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:29,340
The problem that Carol is looking at is actually quite similar to the one that Bob is looking at.

8
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:32,960
She is looking at a number of investment opportunities for her company,

9
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:41,360
for example, she could invest in precious metals such as gold, silver, or maybe even copper.

10
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,100
She could also invest in stocks.

11
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:50,690
So, for example, a copper mining company or in a silver and copper mining company

12
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:57,050
or she could invest in an industrial manufacturer or also in some other bank.

13
00:00:57,050 --> 00:01:02,790
In order for the portfolio to be secured, she wants to spread her risk as much as possible.

14
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:07,540
She does not want to invest in things that are too similar or too closely connected.

15
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:12,620
For example, she wants to invest either in gold or in silver,

16
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:18,350
but this line here basically tells us that she does not want to invest in both at the same time,

17
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:23,750
and so she basically only wants to invest in one of those precious metal.

18
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:27,660
If she invest in copper, she probably does not want to invest in the mining company

19
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:32,250
because none of the copper price goes down so will the stock up the copper mining company.

20
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:34,870
Similar here, this is a silver and copper mining,

21
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:39,550
so either invest in this company or in those precious metals here.

22
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:43,930
If the industrial manufacturer is actually a supplier to this company here,

23
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:49,020
you probably wouldn't want to invest in both of them at the same

24
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:52,890
and let's say that the bank down here is backing the two mining company,

25
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:58,640
so you either invest in the bank or maybe also these two mining company separately

26
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:04,360
but you definitely would not want to--well, actually lets just say you also didn't want to invest

27
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,230
in two mining companies at the same time.

28
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:10,690
In order to spread the risk as much as possible,

29
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:16,010
Carol, of course, wants to find a portfolio that contains as many different items as possible

30
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:18,550
because then she has spread out her risk,

31
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:22,020
but at the same time, she must observe those rule.

32
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:25,460
She cannot just select all of these possibilities

33
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:29,200
but only possibilities that are not connected to each other.

34
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,410
The way that is very similar to Bob's problem because Bob,

35
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:35,060
when he was looking at the genes, he was looking for genes

36
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:38,080
where every gene is connected to every other gene,

37
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:43,050
and now Carol is looking for possible investments that are not connected at all to each other.

38
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:47,210
What is the largest portfolio

39
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:53,350
or how many items can Carol select at maximum so none of them are connected?

40
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:56,180
I would like you to figure that out as our next quiz

41
00:02:56,180 --> 99:59:59,999
and I would like you to put your answer here in this box please.
