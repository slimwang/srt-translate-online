1
00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:04,496
Remember that the reason Athena is creating all of these box models in the first

2
00:00:04,496 --> 00:00:08,565
place, is for her architecture internship. So, that means that when she's

3
00:00:08,565 --> 00:00:12,518
discussing functions like this one, she's probably going to want to focus on the

4
00:00:12,518 --> 00:00:16,672
values of the domain that make sense in the physical situation she's discussing.

5
00:00:16,672 --> 00:00:21,088
We figured out before, that if Athena wants to make sure, that she's actually

6
00:00:21,088 --> 00:00:25,483
able to fold her piece of paper into a box, x should be greater than zero. But

7
00:00:25,483 --> 00:00:30,677
it should also be less than 2.5 inches. However, we saw that if x equals zero,

8
00:00:30,677 --> 00:00:35,284
then the volume equals zero. And if x equals 2.5, the volume also equals 2.5.

9
00:00:35,284 --> 00:00:40,222
The idea of zero volume is actually pretty understandable. It's negative volume

10
00:00:40,222 --> 00:00:44,399
that's the issue. So, I'm going to go ahead and decide to include these

11
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,554
endpoints in our domain. So, here we go. This is the domain of the function that

12
00:00:48,554 --> 00:00:52,276
we've decided upon, using our common sense to deal with the situation at hand.

13
00:00:52,276 --> 00:00:55,680
So, like we talked about in the last lesson, this is not a

14
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,920
mathematically-imposed domain restriction. This is one that we're imposing upon

15
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:05,910
the equation ourselves to make the equation better fit the situation of the box.

16
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:10,150
So, let's visualize this with a graph using this domain restriction. So, here's

17
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:13,990
what a graph of this function looks like with these domain restriction put in

18
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:19,607
place. We can see that the graph is only allowed to take on values of x between

19
00:01:19,607 --> 00:01:24,008
0 and 2.5. And as shown in this inequality, our interval includes these end

20
00:01:24,008 --> 00:01:26,813
points, so they are closed circles to either one.
