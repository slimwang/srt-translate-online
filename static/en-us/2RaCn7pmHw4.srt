00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:01,440
Now, let's do a quiz.

2
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:05,400
What is the multiplicative
inverse of 3 MOD 17?

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,150
Enter your answer here.

4
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:10,000
That is, you need to find a number,
let's say X,

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,069
such that 3 times X MOD 17, equal to 1.
