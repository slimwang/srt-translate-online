1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
When we have 2 different ways to refer to the same object,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
that's called aliasing.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Aliasing in programs is similar to the way we think about aliasing in Spycraft.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
You might not be able to tell from my drawing,

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
but this is James Bond.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
And we can refer to James Bond

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
either by his name, James Bond,

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
or by his spy name, 007.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Both of those are ways to refer to the same person.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
If something happens that changes the state of James Bond,

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
so instead of pleasantly enjoying a martini, like he is now,

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
the bad guys are after him, and he grabs his gun

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
and is no longer so happy, well, that affects the state

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
of both James Bond and 007.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Both names refer to the same person,

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
so whatever state that person has is true for both names.

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Aliasing for variable names

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
has the same property, so if we have 2 variable names

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
that refer to the same object, any change we make to the object p refers to

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
also affects the value that q refers to.

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
If we did an assignment using p to change the value

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
in the second position on p,

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
that also changes the value the name q refers to.

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
If we do an assignment like this where instead of changing the value

25
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
of one of the cells that's part of the p object,

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
we assign p to a new value, well, this assignment

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
we create a new object, a list containing 3 elements,

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
the numbers 007.

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
And it will change what the variable p refers to

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
to point to that new object.

31
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
The value of q is the same as it was before.

32
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
It still points to the same object, which we haven't modified.
