00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,180
Hello and
welcome to the Computer Vision class.

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:07,290
I'm Irfan Essa and I'm a professor here
in the School of Interactive Computing

3
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:09,040
and the College of
Computing in Georgia Tech.

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:11,810
This is a class on computer vision.

5
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:16,460
It's aimed at covering the foundational
aspects of how to analyze images and

6
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:18,730
to extract content from images.

7
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:22,550
That is, how can we build a computer or
a machine that can see and

8
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:23,590
interpret an image.

9
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:26,905
First what do I mean by foundational?

10
00:00:26,905 --> 00:00:30,236
I mean that we are going to
cover the mathematical and

11
00:00:30,236 --> 00:00:34,249
computational methods to provide
you with core concepts of how

12
00:00:34,249 --> 00:00:37,140
can a computer be built
to interpret images.

13
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:40,015
Notice I am using the word interpret.

14
00:00:40,015 --> 00:00:44,290
In Computer Vision we are interested
in extracting information,

15
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:45,680
knowledge from an image.

16
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,490
Many want to go beyond processing
an image to really knowing what

17
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:52,880
is inside the image,
what's the content of the image.

18
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:56,680
So we will learn the math and the basic
concepts how to compute with an image

19
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,180
and extract information from it.

20
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:01,430
So this class will have lectures,

21
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:04,000
of course what is a class
without without a lecture?

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,710
All the video lectures are by my
friend and colleague Aaron Balik.

23
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:11,410
And I'm biased but
I've known Aaron for a long time and

24
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:13,770
I can tell you he's a great lecturer.

25
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:15,860
He actually and
seriously thinks he's funny but

26
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:17,480
I guess I will let you
be the judge of that.

27
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,256
I've known Aaron for over 20 years
now and we've worked together.

28
00:01:22,256 --> 00:01:27,380
I started at MIT and I learn computer
vision early days at MIT also.

29
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:28,940
And then we were both
here at Georgia Tech for

30
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:31,980
a while, until he decided recently
to become Dean of Engineering

31
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:33,830
at the Washington University
in St Louis.

32
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:38,480
So bidding him farewell, and
since I really do love this material and

33
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:41,200
Computer Vision, I've decided to
take over this class from now on.

34
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:45,290
So the video lectures are still
going to be by Aaron,

35
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:48,810
but I will now manage
an able team of TA's and

36
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:51,870
course developers over the term and
will work with them to

37
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:55,590
provide additional material like
the assignments and exams for this term.

38
00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:00,160
I'll also be the one you will hear from
on various communication channels for

39
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:00,750
this class.

40
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:05,570
It's now back quickly to a bit
more about Computer Vision.

41
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:08,120
Computer Vision is really
about analyzing images and

42
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:11,270
videos to extract knowledge from them.

43
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:15,370
Mostly these images are of real scenes
like that of a street image with

44
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:20,120
cars and such where autonomous vehicle
they'll have to navigate through or

45
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:24,420
it could be other types of images like
that of an X-ray inside a human head and

46
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:27,860
we need to do image analysis to
be able to extract things about

47
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:30,330
of interest in medical applications.

48
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:34,390
So essentially the goal is image and
video understanding which means

49
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:38,580
labeling interesting things in an image
and also tracking them as they move.

50
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:43,690
In this class you will learn
about the foundations of how to

51
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:46,905
build systems that can do this
kind of image understanding.

52
00:02:46,905 --> 00:02:50,760
In addition to math and
the foundational theoretical context,

53
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:54,430
you will also learn about doing
a series of assignments to give you

54
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:56,410
real hands on experience
with computer vision.

55
00:02:57,490 --> 00:02:59,390
I look forward to seeing
all of you online and

56
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:01,425
engage with you as you learn
this exciting material.
