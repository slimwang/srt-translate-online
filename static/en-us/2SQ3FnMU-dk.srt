Grant has recruited Athena, with all of her experience designing things, to

2
00:00:03,673 --> 00:00:08,600
create a new logo for the Gleaming Glasses company. It's going to have a pair

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:12,696
of glasses on it, of course, and Athena wants to make sure that the glasses are

4
00:00:12,696 --> 00:00:17,922
exactly symmetric. Now, she really likes the look of the function f of x equals

5
00:00:17,922 --> 00:00:22,850
x to the 4th, what I have graphed right here. So, she's trying to figure out

6
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:26,936
how to use it to make the glasses. We need to figure out how to help Athena

7
00:00:26,936 --> 00:00:32,174
transform this function. Flip it over, move it from side to side, like this,

8
00:00:32,174 --> 00:00:37,600
and also move it up and move it down. All these different kinds of

9
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,065
transformations are definitely going to be required for the design of this

10
00:00:41,065 --> 00:00:43,569
logo. Let's help her out.
