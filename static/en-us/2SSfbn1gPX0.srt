1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,680
The first one tries to stop
intrusion from happening.

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:06,760
In other words,
try to prevent attack from happening.

3
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:09,470
This is obviously a firewall.

4
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:14,010
The second one tries to evaluate
an intrusion after it has happened.

5
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:17,740
In other words, try to detect whether
there's an intrusion happening.

6
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:20,870
This is obviously an intrusion
detection system.

7
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:25,770
The third one, watches for
intrusions that start within the system.

8
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:30,730
Again, this means detection, so
it is intrusion detection system.

9
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:35,340
The fourth one, limits access between
networks to prevent intrusion.

10
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:39,420
Again, this tries to prevent attacks,
so this is firewall.
