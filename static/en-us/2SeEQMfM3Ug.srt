1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:01,600
All right one other question.

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:03,740
I'm actually kind of
surprised you didn't ask me,

3
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:07,160
is what's this rollout nonsense?

4
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:09,290
>> I recognize that from
reading about T.D. Gammon.

5
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:10,460
>> How is it the same?

6
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:13,760
>> Because it's a word actually
comes from an understanding of how

7
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:17,740
people figure out which backgammon
boards are better or worse.

8
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:21,240
They actually, the rolling here is
the rolling of the backgammon dice.

9
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:24,290
>> That's not at all
what I was thinking.

10
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:25,830
>> What are you thinking?

11
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:29,150
>> Well, I was just thinking that
we have some roll out policy

12
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:31,460
which tells us what to
do when we're here.

13
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:34,320
And I said well let's just act randomly,
but

14
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,670
I don't know why that's
the right thing to do.

15
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:37,080
I mean, if I end up here and

16
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:42,180
I've got to do something we're trying
to get an estimate of this state, and

17
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:45,310
taking this particular action and
ending up in this state.

18
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:46,680
Why is that good or bad?

19
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,170
And the way you're going to do it is,
I'm going to say,

20
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:51,440
well I know how good it is to be here by
behaving randomly from that point on.

21
00:00:52,622 --> 00:00:58,020
I mean, that'll give you probably an
underestimate of the true value, but it

22
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:01,840
would be nice if you could do something
that perhaps made a little more sense.

23
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:06,290
So people who have done work on MCTS
have often put some effort into,

24
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:07,320
well lots of things.

25
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:11,520
Being clever about this expansion,
keeping the right set of statistics,

26
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,390
kind of shoving their
expiration in very smart ways.

27
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:17,090
But other people have spent a little
bit of effort trying to figure out

28
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:20,630
can I come up with a better
policy besides behaving randomly?

29
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:25,470
That will help me to have a better
estimate of this particular q value.

30
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:29,520
And we can talk about I'm going to just
quickly talk about one by mentioning

31
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,280
something that we have already
talked about so far in this lesson.

32
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,870
Do you remember the command
you came up with Pac-Man?

33
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:40,290
>> It was like eat, eat, eat, avoid.

34
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:41,580
>> Right.
>> So like eat little dots,

35
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:43,550
eat big dots, eat ghosts, avoid.

36
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:45,770
>> Right, so I'm going to
point out that of those four.

37
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:51,660
Which I'll just call eat,
eat, eat, and avoid.

38
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:52,700
Which one of those is different?

39
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:53,830
>> So, I don't know.

40
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:54,670
The first one.

41
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,390
>> Eat?
>> Where you're eating big dots.

42
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:58,180
Yeah, or small dots.

43
00:01:58,180 --> 00:01:59,960
Now I guess you want to say, avoid.

44
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,130
Because it's the word that's
different in the list.

45
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:04,460
>> Avoid is different, but it's
actually different in a different way.

46
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:08,960
Here we said, eat a little dot, eat a
big dot, eat a ghost, and avoid ghosts.

47
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,430
Remember when I said before that

48
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:13,880
temporal extraction
becomes goal extraction?

49
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,370
I'm going to claim that each
of these does have a goal.

50
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:18,140
One is to eat little dots.

51
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:19,920
One is the big dots.

52
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,270
And one is the little goblins.

53
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:26,230
But that when you execute the eat
small dot, it actually terminates.

54
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:27,610
At some point you eat a small dot.

55
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:29,220
And now you can move
on to the next thing.

56
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:31,920
At some point you eat large dot and
now you can move on to the next thing.

57
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,320
At some point you eat a goblin and
then you can move on to the next thing.

58
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:40,530
But avoiding goblins, avoiding ghosts,
that isn't really something that ends.

59
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:43,492
You're supposed to be
avoiding ghosts all the time.

60
00:02:43,492 --> 00:02:46,060
>> I see.
Well, I guess it's sort of the negation.

61
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:48,090
I do understand how
that's different now.

62
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:51,710
So hitting the ghost
ends when you succeed.

63
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:53,258
Avoiding I want to say
ends when you fail.

64
00:02:53,258 --> 00:02:53,933
[LAUGH] Right.

65
00:02:53,933 --> 00:02:55,314
>> Right.
>> Like I'm avoiding the ghost

66
00:02:55,314 --> 00:02:56,170
then said ooh.

67
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:57,770
I wasn't able to avoid the goals.

68
00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:01,690
Right, so in fact these things have sort
of goals, they have success conditions.

69
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:03,500
They end when you succeed.

70
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,060
Avoid is a little different.

71
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,160
It sort of ends only when you fail.

72
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:11,320
You can never succeeded avoiding goals
you can only fail at it in some sense.

73
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:15,580
Whereas here there a sort of finite
time in which you achieve your goal and

74
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:16,680
that success.

75
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:21,260
So it turns out that when you ask
people to come up with these kinds of

76
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:27,280
options, they actually come up
with things that look like this.

77
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,250
Lots of goals with lots
of success metrics.

78
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,790
But they also come up with things
where you can sort of only fail.

79
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:34,760
We actually have a word for that and
they're called constraints.
