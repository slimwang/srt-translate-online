1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,640
So, how do we do this?

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:05,490
Now, this will relate back to
the concepts we had looked at

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:08,970
when we looked at the frequency
domain of an image.

4
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:11,490
That is,
how do we actually start representing

5
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:14,560
things at a different frequency
spectrum and of course,

6
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:17,730
we played around with
things like the pyramid.

7
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:18,800
So, to achieve this,

8
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:23,310
basically we would have to find in
the scale and the pyramids of images,

9
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:29,450
the most amount of information
in both space and in scale.

10
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:32,250
Space in this case would
be the image itself.

11
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:35,540
Scale is, again,
the pyramid levels for example.

12
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:38,015
Being able to find information
at different frequency spectrum

13
00:00:38,015 --> 00:00:39,540
differently.

14
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,400
So one of the more important methods
that's actually widely used is,

15
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:45,940
as I said, SIFT,
Scale Invariant Feature Transform.

16
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:46,780
For this process,

17
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:52,520
what is suggested is that basically use
the pyramid to find the maximum values.

18
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:56,350
Again, we use this kind of stuff
to do things like edge detection.

19
00:00:56,350 --> 00:01:00,110
And in this case, then eliminate
the edges and pick only the corners.

20
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:03,920
So, run the same process that
we've been doing before,

21
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,770
except that now find all edges
using different frequencies and

22
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:11,400
then eliminate the edges and
pick only the corners.

23
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,610
So again, the same concept that we've
been doing for corner detection, but

24
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:16,920
except we do it at multiple scales.

25
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,290
We find edges at multiple scales.

26
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:21,640
And then we basically kind of say,
look here.

27
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:24,640
Which one of them are corners at
each and every one of the scales?

28
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,990
So in essence, what happens now
is that basically each point

29
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:31,240
is compared to its eight neighbors,
shown here.

30
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:33,750
So each point is compared
to its eight neighbors.

31
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:36,450
And then we can of course
also scale it up and down.

32
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:41,470
And in this case, each point is also
compared to its nine neighbors above and

33
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:43,060
below in scale.

34
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:45,670
So eight local neighbors at this point,
and

35
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:49,070
then above, nine points,
below, nine points.

36
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:52,230
And these are of course different
scales which could be computed using,

37
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:55,170
again, things like pyramids and
stuff like that we've looked at.
