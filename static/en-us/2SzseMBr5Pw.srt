1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Well, it seems there's definitely a relationship between these.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:12,000
the massive point seems to move as page load time increases. I'd say--yes, they are related.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
They don't really appear to be linear though.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
If I draw a line to try and fit this,

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I can do okay for one piece of this but then this piece over here

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:35,000
doesn't appear anywhere near that line, or I could possibly draw a line like this

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:43,000
that's consistent of a lot of range of points, but this appears to be pretty far away.

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Definitely not linear and not exact either. You can, say, pick this value.

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:58,000
We have a whole bunch of different click-through rates for the same page load time.

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Now, is the relationship positive or negative?

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Well, we started off with a higher click-through rate over here.

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:13,000
It seems the only going downward as page load time increases, so we have a negative relationship.

13
00:01:13,000 --> 99:59:59,999
When in fact, the relationship probably looks something like this.
