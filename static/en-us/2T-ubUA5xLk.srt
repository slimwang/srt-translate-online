1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
And the answer is: & =& amp;

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
And so this translates something like this:

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
this portion turns into an ampersand,

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
this portion turns into an ampersand,

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
and this portion is just text,

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
So that's what we get--nice work!
