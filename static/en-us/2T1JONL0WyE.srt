00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,590
So for this quiz, I want you to think carefully about a strategy that will be

2
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:07,018
the most effective way to finish the problem. We've got a lot of different

3
00:00:07,018 --> 00:00:10,760
things we might do next. We don't necessarily need to do all of these, and the

4
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:14,420
order in which we do them will make a big difference in how efficiently and

5
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:18,192
correctly we solve the problem. So, I want you to think about this and give an

6
00:00:18,192 --> 00:00:21,796
answer that lists the steps you would do in order. And an example to show you

7
00:00:21,796 --> 00:00:25,300
the format for the answer is just to put the letters in order. This is not a

8
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:29,265
correct answer, but note that you can include some of the steps more than once,

9
00:00:29,265 --> 00:00:33,017
and you don't need to include all of the steps. This is pretty tricky, and I

10
00:00:33,017 --> 00:00:36,821
don't expect you to match exactly what I think the best answer is. But there's

11
00:00:36,821 --> 00:00:40,649
several different ways to answer this that would be accepted, and you should be

12
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:44,119
able to come up with one of those. So, see if you can order these steps.
