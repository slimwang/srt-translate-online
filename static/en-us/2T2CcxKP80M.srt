1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:03,969
So one thing I want to emphasize in this part of the lecture is that

2
00:00:03,969 --> 00:00:07,930
the basic element we want to be able to do analysis on most of

3
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:11,180
the time in a 3D scene is rays of light.

4
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:12,950
And you want to be able to use a rays of light to

5
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:14,830
be able to extract information.

6
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:18,630
So here's a beautiful image of a sun that actually if you see this image,

7
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:21,350
basically all of the rays of light are coming in.

8
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:24,930
And we want to be able to kind of model a lot more information about how rays of

9
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:28,320
light from this light source are hitting different parts of a scene.

10
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,760
And, of course, it's because of the phenomenon of this being hit

11
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,390
these tree branches being hit, and us being able to see it,

12
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:38,340
that kind of gives us the more visual feel of the scene.

13
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:39,730
So we've looked at previously, and

14
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:44,640
we've talked about the whole concept that basically an image is a 2D area of

15
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,440
pixels and that's how we actually capture a 3D scene into a 2D image.

16
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:53,780
But we want to remember that the fundamental primitives at least in the whole

17
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:58,270
analysis of a picture of computational photography process is rays, you want to

18
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:01,880
be able to be able to look at information that's coming and hitting the scene.

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,050
And then, of course getting reflected and we want to be able to capture as

20
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:09,810
much information from the environment based on that illumination and

21
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:11,620
the rays that are hitting the scene.

22
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:14,520
One of the things that's important when you start thinking about rays of light

23
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:18,410
is that basically they follow a path from the source to the scene.

24
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:22,860
So therefore, we can start using things like geometry of the rays of light to be

25
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:25,840
able to extract information about what the scene is like.

26
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,880
And more importantly, what we are interested in is how we can actually use

27
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:33,770
computation, that can control all parameters of how the optics and

28
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:37,750
the sensor, that is, the way the process of illumination goes,

29
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:42,260
the rays of light, to go through optics, to the sensor that actually allows us

30
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:45,560
to generate those pixels, that we can do image processing on.

31
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:48,860
So, one of the important things for us to remember now is that we want to be

32
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:53,040
able to use computation, to control how the illumination,

33
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,350
which would then create the rays of light, that would be then controlled again

34
00:01:56,350 --> 00:02:02,380
with the optics to create information on a sensor that would generate the pixels

35
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:05,790
that we actually will be doing processing on to be able to generate an image.
