Each of the projects involves solving a design problem in several ways.

2
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:07,360
To determine which approach is best,

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:11,080
you are asked to evaluate your solutions in a systematic way, that is,

4
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:14,670
to conduct a design study. The result of each study is documented in

5
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:19,540
a report that conforms to a prescribed format laid out in a template file

6
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:24,190
linked to from the class resources page. We will now go through the contents of

7
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:28,560
the template as a way of illustrating what a software design study is all about.
