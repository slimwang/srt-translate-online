What if I were to ask this question instead?

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Make the function query return a list of links

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
submitted by user 62443,

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
and sort those links by the submission time ascending.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
The earliest submission first,

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
and the last submission last.
