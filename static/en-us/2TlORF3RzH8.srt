In the introduction module,
you used canny edge detection

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:07,730
to find pixels that were likely
to be part of a line in an image.

3
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:11,280
Canny is great at finding all
possible lines in an image, but for

4
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:15,429
land detection, this gave us a lot
of edges on scenery, and cars, and

5
00:00:15,429 --> 00:00:18,108
other objects that we
ended up discarding.

6
00:00:18,108 --> 00:00:20,170
Realistically, with lane finding,

7
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:24,530
we know ahead of time that the lines we
are looking for are close to vertical.

8
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:27,039
So, how can we take
advantage of that fact?

9
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:30,500
Well, we can use gradients in
a smarter way to detect steep

10
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,829
edges that are more likely to
be lanes in the first place.

11
00:00:33,829 --> 00:00:37,839
With Canny, we were actually taking
a derivative with respect to x and

12
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,220
y in the process of finding edges.

13
00:00:40,219 --> 00:00:44,060
But let's stop and have a look at what
those individual derivatives look like

14
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:44,940
for an image of the road.
