One final note on computational performance. If you're using

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:05,810
third party libraries you should check and see if there

3
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:09,950
is a smaller, faster mobile-optimized version. For example, if you're

4
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:13,560
using Jquery you might consider switching to Zepto. For any

5
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:15,660
library you use though, be sure to use the

6
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:18,250
most up to date version. Many libraries are in the

7
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:22,140
process of optimizing for lower memory and CPU consumption, and

8
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:23,990
this can be a great way to save some cycles.
