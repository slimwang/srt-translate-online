1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,940
So out of these four colors here,

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:08,070
three of the colors can look very
similar to this primary blue color.

3
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:11,228
Now these two look
visually similar already.

4
00:00:11,228 --> 00:00:14,018
And if you're certain
types of color blind,

5
00:00:14,018 --> 00:00:18,286
this green will not be that
distinguishable from any of these blues.

6
00:00:18,286 --> 00:00:21,340
So the answer would be to
choose this red color.
