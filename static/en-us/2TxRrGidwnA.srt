00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,790
So here we are in our
functions playground.

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:05,519
Let's start by defining
Global Functions and Methods.

3
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:10,940
Global Functions are functions that
can be called from anywhere in an app.

4
00:00:10,939 --> 00:00:13,439
Global Function syntax
is easy to recognize

5
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:16,859
because Global Functions aren't
called by a particular object.

6
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:19,359
They're just called sort
of floating in thin air.

7
00:00:20,989 --> 00:00:24,079
One Global Function that you're
familiar with by now is print.

8
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:29,439
The min, max, and absolute value
functions are a few more examples.

9
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:33,170
Global Functions like print,
can be called from within any class.

10
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:35,829
Methods on the other hand,
are defined in and

11
00:00:35,829 --> 00:00:38,920
associate with a particular class.

12
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:43,810
The vast majority of Swift functions
that you write and call will be Methods.

13
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:46,520
Here we have a method
called sum of strings,

14
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,760
it's defined within
the arithmetic class.

15
00:00:48,759 --> 00:00:52,079
And is also called by an instance
of the arithmetic class.

16
00:00:53,429 --> 00:00:55,789
So that's Global Functions and Methods.

17
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:58,579
To get to the next page in
the playground, just press Next.

18
00:01:00,109 --> 00:01:03,060
And if you want to see all of
the pages in the playground,

19
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:09,129
you can go up here to the Navigate menu,
click on Reveal in Project Navigator.

20
00:01:09,129 --> 00:01:10,149
And here on the left,

21
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:13,969
you can see how the playground is
organized and access any of the pages.
