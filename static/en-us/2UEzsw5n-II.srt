1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:02,550
So now let's do some interesting stuff.

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:07,010
What if I want to view rows
from the DataFrame in between

3
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:10,270
some random values and
not the head and the tail?

4
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:12,480
We can do something of this kind.

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:18,780
If you want data from index,
10 to 20, just add this line.

6
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:20,530
Let's see the output.

7
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:21,740
Here it is.

8
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:25,470
All the data between the index 10 and
20 are displayed.

9
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:29,970
But you might also observe that
if you want data between 10 and

10
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:34,140
20, you have to mention 10:21.

11
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:38,290
Because 21 is not
inclusive in the range.

12
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:42,400
This operation is called slicing and
it is a very important operation

13
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:45,840
in Python pandas, which you will
encounter in the future lesson.
