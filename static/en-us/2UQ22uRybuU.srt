1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:02,790
Now that we've learned about
camera calibration and

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:04,370
correcting for distortion,

3
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:08,609
we can start to extract really useful
information from images of the road.

4
00:00:08,609 --> 00:00:12,279
One really important piece of
information is lane curvature.

5
00:00:12,279 --> 00:00:14,529
Think about how you drive on a highway,

6
00:00:14,529 --> 00:00:17,919
you take a look at the road in
front of you and cars around you.

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,380
You press the gas or
break to go with the flow.

8
00:00:20,379 --> 00:00:22,539
And based on how much
the lane is curving,

9
00:00:22,539 --> 00:00:25,885
left or right, you turn the steering
wheel to stay in that lane.

10
00:00:25,885 --> 00:00:28,533
Now, how does this work for
a self-driving car?

11
00:00:28,533 --> 00:00:32,890
Self-driving cars need to be told the
correct steering angle to turn left or

12
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:37,659
right and we can calculate this angle if
we know a few things about the speed and

13
00:00:37,659 --> 00:00:41,159
dynamics of the car and
how much the lane is curving.

14
00:00:41,159 --> 00:00:44,959
To determine the curvature,
we'll go through the following steps.

15
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,870
First, we'll detect the lane
lines using some masking and

16
00:00:47,869 --> 00:00:49,669
thresholding techniques.

17
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:53,859
Then, perform a perspective transform
to get a birds eye view of the lane.

18
00:00:53,859 --> 00:00:56,579
This let's us fit a polynomial
to the lane lines.

19
00:00:56,579 --> 00:00:59,119
Which we couldn't do very easily before.

20
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:02,579
Then, we can extract the curvature
the lines from this polynomial

21
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:04,390
with just a little math.

22
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:07,060
So let's start by learning more
about the perspective transform.
