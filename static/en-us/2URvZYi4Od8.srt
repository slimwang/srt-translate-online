00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Let's now go to a difficult challenging case

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:11,000
where I'd like to recover the focal length f from measurements of the type z, delta x, and B.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Suppose I happen to know that an object is 100 m away,

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
and my baseline is 0.5 m, which is 50 cm.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
And suppose my displacement x2 minus x1 is exactly 1 millimeters.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 99:59:59,999
What do you think f is expressed in mm?
