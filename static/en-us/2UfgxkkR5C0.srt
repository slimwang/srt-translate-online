1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,990
What we need to do now is to figure
out how to disable the stop recording

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:06,480
button, when we're recording.

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,180
We know that the stop recording
button is a UIButton.

4
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:13,740
Look at the documentation and
see if you can find the function or

5
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:17,530
property to enable or
disable the stop recording button.

6
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:22,401
Remember that when you look at
documentation for a class like UIButton,

7
00:00:22,401 --> 00:00:24,514
you should always check
what functions and

8
00:00:24,514 --> 00:00:27,287
properties that class inherits
from its parent class.
