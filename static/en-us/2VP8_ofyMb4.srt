1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,340
That was a really good question so
let's turn it into a quiz.

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:07,810
So here's some five different
examples of learning rate sequences.

3
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:10,840
That you might consider using in one
of these kinds of learning algorithms.

4
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:13,990
There's our friend 1/T which came
out of the analysis that we did to

5
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:15,100
get out the average.

6
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:17,380
So we're hoping that
one should really work.

7
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:20,979
But then let's look above and
below it so 1/T squared.

8
00:00:20,979 --> 00:00:22,730
1 / T to the two-thirds.

9
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:25,080
1 over square root of T.

10
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:25,670
And actually,

11
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:28,890
it's sometimes pretty popular to use
learning rates that are just a constant.

12
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:31,870
Just a small number that just
stays constant over time.

13
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:34,470
And so what I'd like us to figure out is

14
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:38,010
which of these five rules
satisfy the two conditions?

15
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:41,340
In other words, that the sum of
the learning rates is infinite.

16
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:43,360
But the sum of the squares is finite.

17
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,870
>> Okay,
we can probably do that together.

18
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:46,690
>> Cool.

19
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:47,680
>> Okay, well go.
