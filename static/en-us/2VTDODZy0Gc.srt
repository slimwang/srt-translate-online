00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:05,480
There are some deep implications that may not be readily obvious. Core

2
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:10,240
services are trusted services, since they provide access to

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:15,400
hardware mechanisms. Why? The services may need to step

4
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:20,360
outside the language-enforced protection model to control the hardware

5
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:25,440
resources. In other words, the applications that run on top

6
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:30,550
of an extension have to trust the extension. Extensions

7
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:36,080
to core services affect only the applications that use that extension.

8
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:39,520
That is, it is not catastrophic and does not affect

9
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,030
other applications that do not rely on this particular extension.
