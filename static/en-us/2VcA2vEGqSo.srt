1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The answer can be seen directly from this formula over here.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
In the first case we plug in X equals 10.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
F over Z is 10 divided by 100.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
We multiply 10 by 0.1, and we get 1.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
It turns out all the units take care of themselves.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
No matter which way we pose the question, we can effectively ignore those units,

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
because they're the same outside the camera as they are inside the camera.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
For the second question, we transform this equation over here as follows:

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:37,000
We now plug in Z as 400, X as 20, lowercase x as 1,

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
to give us a focal length of 20 mm.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
We can transform this equation further into this quotient over here.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
F over x is 40 times uppercase X of 2 mm is 80 meters.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Finally we can write this expression over here, and we plug in x over f.

14
00:00:55,000 --> 99:59:59,999
We get 100th times 300 is 3 meters over here.
