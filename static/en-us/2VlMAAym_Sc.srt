You might have guessed that the perimeter is the distance around an object. So

2
00:00:04,677 --> 00:00:09,273
if I just add up the distances around an object, I can find the perimeter. For

3
00:00:09,285 --> 00:00:13,510
this one, I have 2 d's and, and 2 3's, so the perimeter is 2d plus 6. The d's

4
00:00:13,522 --> 00:00:17,870
have the same length, so we can add them together. They're like terms. The

5
00:00:17,882 --> 00:00:22,290
perimeter of this shape is 2a plus 3b. We don't know the length of these two

6
00:00:22,302 --> 00:00:26,683
sides, but we can add them together because they're both a, they have the same

7
00:00:26,695 --> 00:00:31,039
length. The same is true for the b's. Be careful that you don't write 5ab here.

8
00:00:31,138 --> 00:00:35,569
We can't combine these two terms. a is one number, and b is another number. I'm

9
00:00:35,581 --> 00:00:40,036
not multiplying, I'm really adding the distances around the object. If you got

10
00:00:40,048 --> 00:00:41,550
these two right, nice work.
