1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:02,974
So your job was to adjust this program so that

2
00:00:02,974 --> 00:00:06,214
it works for that building, where both the 13th and

3
00:00:06,214 --> 00:00:09,810
14th floor should be skipped in the elevator. So, that

4
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:12,370
means that the numbers from 1 to 12, should stay

5
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:15,000
unchanged. There won't ever be an input of 13 or

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,290
14. So that means 15 should get mapped to 13,

7
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:23,080
16 should become 14, 17, 15 and so on. That

8
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:25,600
means if the floor number is 15 or greater, or in

9
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:30,520
other words if it's greater than 14, then we want to subtract 2 and not 1.

10
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:31,680
And those are the two changes that you

11
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,590
need to make to the program and it'll work.
