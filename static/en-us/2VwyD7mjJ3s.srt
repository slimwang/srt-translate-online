00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,910
Okay, so Michael wanted to have a quiz here,

2
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:04,550
'because Michael again, likes those sort of things and, and

3
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:07,450
I like to please Michael. So, we came up

4
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:10,810
with three possibilities, one of which we hope is right.

5
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:12,210
>> [LAUGH]

6
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:14,620
>> And I've labeled them here in orange, A, B,

7
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:16,800
and C and put little radio boxes next to 'em, so

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,050
you could select 'em. So which of those three hypotheses

9
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:25,530
are, is a good one to pick next? So, A is

10
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:30,380
a horizontal line that says everything above it should be a plus. B is a,

11
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:34,930
another horizontal line that says everything above it should be a plus. And C is

12
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:37,290
a vertical line, like the last two

13
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:39,610
hypotheses that we found, that says everything to

14
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:44,090
the left should be a plus. So, which do you think is the right one? Go.
