Thank you Andy and Lauren. I'm here at the location of our first event, where

2
00:00:04,243 --> 00:00:07,591
we're going to assess our senseletes' abilities to detect differences in

3
00:00:07,591 --> 00:00:13,246
weight. While they finish setting up, let me explain the rules. Here, our

4
00:00:13,246 --> 00:00:16,495
senseletes are going have to be asked five times to reliably compare

5
00:00:16,495 --> 00:00:22,060
differences in weight. This will allows us to the get the difference threshold.

6
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:24,820
Let's go back to the studio to get a better explanation of what we mean, by

7
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:26,540
difference threshold.
