1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,158
So, it's pretty straight forward to think
about applying the negative sign to both

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:08,260
the x and the 9 when we're talking abut
subtracting expressions from one another,

3
00:00:08,353 --> 00:00:12,630
but what we're really doing here is using
an example of a much broader property. And

4
00:00:12,642 --> 00:00:16,321
that property is the Distributive
Property. So, we're distributing this

5
00:00:16,332 --> 00:00:20,380
negative sign to both the x and to the 9
when we say that we want to subtract them

6
00:00:20,392 --> 00:00:25,144
both from the 4. So, I'm going to show you
a slightly different way of looking at how

7
00:00:25,156 --> 00:00:29,199
to distribute that negative sign and what
distributing a negative sign really means.

8
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:33,733
First things first, we know that when we
subtract, like we're doing here, that's

9
00:00:33,733 --> 00:00:37,666
actually the same as adding the negative
of the thing that you want to subtract.

10
00:00:37,666 --> 00:00:44,429
So, for example, if we have 5-3, that's
actually equal to 5 plus -3. Now, that may

11
00:00:44,429 --> 00:00:48,579
seem like we're working backwards but hang
in there, this is going to be helpful. So,

12
00:00:48,591 --> 00:00:53,371
let's do the same thing here. This is
equal to 4 plus the negative of this

13
00:00:53,371 --> 00:00:57,570
entire quantity. However, when we're
taking the negative of something, what

14
00:00:57,582 --> 00:01:02,241
we're really doing is multiplying it by
-1. So, in order to get -3, we actually

15
00:01:02,253 --> 00:01:08,952
have to say -1 times +3. So, that means
that if we want -x+9, we actually need

16
00:01:08,952 --> 00:01:12,868
-1 times x+9.
You'll notice that I didn't write a

17
00:01:12,868 --> 00:01:16,537
multiplication sign between this
coefficient, -1, and the parentheses

18
00:01:16,537 --> 00:01:21,224
that's around x+9, because remember,
there's an invisible multiplication sign

19
00:01:21,224 --> 00:01:24,765
implied between those when there's no
space between them. So, I'll just get rid

20
00:01:24,777 --> 00:01:29,675
of that. So here, it's a bit easier to see
explicitly why the Distributive Property

21
00:01:29,687 --> 00:01:33,747
is being applied in this case. We have a
-1 that we're multiplying each term inside

22
00:01:33,747 --> 00:01:39,841
the parenthesis by. So, both x and -9 are
each being multiplied by -1. The

23
00:01:39,841 --> 00:01:43,810
Distributive Property basically says that
if you have some number or variable, let's

24
00:01:43,822 --> 00:01:48,112
call it a, and you want to multiply that
by some number of terms that are inside

25
00:01:48,124 --> 00:01:52,153
parentheses, let's just pick two to be
simple and call them b and c. And we'll

26
00:01:52,165 --> 00:01:55,964
just add them, although of course, c can
be negative, and you could be subtracting

27
00:01:55,964 --> 00:01:58,754
or b could be negative. If you want to get
rid of the parentheses, you'll end up with

28
00:01:58,754 --> 00:02:04,330
a being multiplied by each of these terms. So,
the a multiplies the b and that's added to

29
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:09,338
a times c as well. So, you can see why we
use the word distribute here. The

30
00:02:09,338 --> 00:02:15,238
multiplication of the a affects the b and
also affects the c. So, you have a times b,

31
00:02:15,238 --> 00:02:19,667
original operator that was between b and
c, the plus sign, a times c.

32
00:02:19,667 --> 00:02:25,212
So, if we use that property in this case,
we leave our 4+ and then we have -1 times x.

33
00:02:25,212 --> 00:02:29,871
Write the sign that's between the two
terms inside the parentheses, -1 times 9.

34
00:02:29,872 --> 00:02:35,942
However, we know that -1 times x is just -x and
-1 times 9 is also just -9, so we end up with

35
00:02:35,942 --> 00:02:42,519
4-x-9. And that is actually what's happening 
when we are quote-unquote distributing this

36
00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:46,370
minus sign to both terms in here and then,
of course, we could rearrange and simplify

37
00:02:46,382 --> 00:02:47,226
again.
