1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,190
For this quiz I want you
to fix this website.

2
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:06,740
You'll be trying out
Calc with these images.

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:08,039
But this time,

4
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:11,970
I want you to fit these three images
all the way across the screen.

5
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:15,450
Each of the three images will need to
be a third of the available width, and

6
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:18,310
there should be a ten
pixel margin between them.

7
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:22,660
Pop open dev tools and inside
the head you'll find this style tag.

8
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:24,910
Inside the style tag,
you'll see some comments.

9
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:27,600
These are the places where I
want you to make some changes.

10
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,320
You can find a link to the website
in the instructor notes.

11
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,259
When all three images
are aligned correctly,

12
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:38,010
with ten pixels between these images,
a code will appear on the website.

13
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:39,970
Type that code into
this box to continue.
