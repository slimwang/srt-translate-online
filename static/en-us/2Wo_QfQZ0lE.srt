1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:02,820
Welcome to Android Fundamentals.

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:05,540
Getting started on Android
is straightforward.

3
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:09,080
Simply installing Android Studio
and creating a new project is enough

4
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:11,910
to have ticked the "Hello World" box
on your Android resume.

5
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:13,610
But that's not why we're here.

6
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:15,340
We're also not here to teach you Java

7
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:19,212
and we're not going to walk you through
every API in the Android SDK.

8
00:00:19,212 --> 00:00:22,260
But what we will do
is to help you build a real app.

9
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:24,765
We'll dig into the fundamentals
of how Android works;

10
00:00:24,765 --> 00:00:27,050
its patterns and best practices.

11
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:31,500
Our course is deeply rooted in code,
but this isn't a copy/paste code lab.

12
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,390
We'll teach you the principles you need,

13
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:37,780
and help you navigate the hundreds of
resources like sample code, documentation,

14
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:41,960
and stack overflow that you'll be using
in your career as an Android developer.

15
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:45,360
Getting started is easy,
but building something great is harder,

16
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,170
which is why we're here.

17
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:49,130
We'll work right alongside you,

18
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:50,270
and by the end of this course,

19
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:53,330
you'll be able to turn
your app vision into reality,

20
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:55,230
and you'll build it the right way.

21
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:57,840
So, in that spirit of collaboration,
we'll begin by telling you

22
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,010
a little bit about us, and where you'll
be seeing us throughout the course.

23
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:03,270
Katherine, why don't you get us started?

24
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:04,269
Sure.
