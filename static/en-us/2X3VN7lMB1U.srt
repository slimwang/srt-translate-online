1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:02,330
All right, now it's your turn.

2
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:07,650
Add
layout-sw600dp-port/activity_main.xml.

3
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:11,000
Start by grabbing the starting
code using the instructor notes.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,510
Then use a relative layout
of the root layout,

5
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:16,360
using three views to
make up the app bar.

6
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:20,390
Have the detail view overlap
just the bottom app bar view.

7
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:23,220
Place the forecast
view below the app bar.

8
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:24,110
That's pretty much it.

9
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,700
Note, use the dimensions
in the previous slide for

10
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:30,060
the height of the three views that
you have to place in the app bar.
