00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,360
We've covered a few new topics
in Android such as making custom

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:09,260
preferences with custom attributes,
using support library annotations, and

3
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,660
using shared preference listeners.

4
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:14,850
Most importantly we've now covered
the primary air estates for

5
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:16,950
the interaction points for our app.

6
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:20,030
It's important to take a moment here
to remember what we've done and

7
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:23,070
to talk about how to generalize
this process to work on whatever

8
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:25,000
app you may be refining.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,230
First, we identified what interaction
points existed in our app,

10
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:31,850
each of which is a place where
errors and bugs can creep in.

11
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:36,440
Then we looked at what we already
done well at each of these points and

12
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:39,250
what air cases we had
not covered already.

13
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:42,960
This gives us a list of issues to
cover to avoid bugs in our app.

14
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,340
In a real app, we would also want to
take user feedback into account when

15
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:49,040
coming up with a list of
changes to spend resources on.

16
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:52,040
Finally, we went through
each of the issues and

17
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:54,500
designed a solution to
the problem at hand.

18
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,090
Some of these solutions were simple and
straight forward.

19
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:59,480
Some of them were more complex and

20
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:03,660
required prioritization but by covering
these issues, we've made our app

21
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:06,510
far more comprehensible when
errors inevitably occur.
