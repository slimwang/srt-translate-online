1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,490
Once the Detail Activity is launched, 
it shows Hello World.

2
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:06,507
Instead, we want 
to read the forecast data

3
00:00:06,507 --> 00:00:10,704
from the Intent, and display it.
Make the appropriate changes

4
00:00:10,704 --> 00:00:14,591
in the app, so it matches the mocks.
Then verify the behavior

5
00:00:14,591 --> 00:00:16,700
by compiling and running the app.
