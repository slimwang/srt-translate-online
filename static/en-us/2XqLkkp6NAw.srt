00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,960
One of the most confusing things for a lot of people about the parameter, this

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:07,960
is how it will get bound within functions when they get passed as call backs.

3
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:11,580
Consider this example where we pass our function to setTimeout,

4
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:14,290
which will call the function for us a second later.

5
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:17,080
As you can see, we aren't providing any values that could be

6
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:20,130
passed as arguments to our call back function fn.

7
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:23,480
So it seems hard to imagine that this code will work as we want it to.

8
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,700
Let's focus on those positional parameters first,

9
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:27,760
since they seem a bit more intuitive.

10
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,070
What do you expect they're going to be bound to?

11
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:30,580
Hint.

12
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:34,880
Remember that you can't tell what value a function's parameter will be bound to,

13
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,090
until you look at the specific indication of that function.

14
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:41,680
So we'll need to go looking for the indication of the fn function.

15
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,000
