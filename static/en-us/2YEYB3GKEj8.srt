00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:05,070
So far, we've assumed that polynomials
are represented by their coefficients.

2
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:13,270
For example, A is equal to -x +
1x,+ 1x squared, for example.

3
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:17,409
If you've ever worked with polynomial
interpolation or fitting before,

4
00:00:17,409 --> 00:00:21,810
however, you will know that an order n
polynomial is uniquely characterized by

5
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:24,540
its values at any n distinct points.

6
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:27,970
The order of a polynomial by the way
is the number of coefficients used to

7
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:31,010
define it or the degree plus one.

8
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:33,740
Hence we might just as well
represent a polynomial

9
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:38,220
by it's values at a sequence of
inputs as by it's coefficients.

10
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:43,498
For example, that same polynomial could
be represented by saying that A (-1)

11
00:00:43,498 --> 00:00:48,360
= -2, A(0) = -2, and A(1) = 0.

12
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,720
Going from the coefficient
representation to the value

13
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:54,010
representation can be though
of as matrix multiplication.

14
00:00:55,080 --> 00:01:00,080
To calculate A of some value, I take
the dot product of the corresponding

15
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:05,930
row of the matrix consisting of
the powers of the argument X

16
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:11,360
with this column consisting of
the coefficients of the polynomial a.

17
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,470
This matrix is important enough
that it gets its own name and

18
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:17,070
it's called the Vandermonde matrix.

19
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:22,000
Its determinant is the product of
the differences of all the values of x.

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,110
So as long as these are distinct
the determinant will be non-zero and

21
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:28,250
that means the matrix is invertible.

22
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:32,800
So given the values then, we should
be able to recover the coefficient.
