00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:05,610
Let's look at the solution to our disk access time quiz. We can ignore queuing,

2
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:11,000
so our read of a randomly chosen byte begins by seeking there.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,020
The head assembly is at one end of the disk. A randomly chosen

4
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:21,012
byte will be at the cylinder where we are, or 999 cylinders

5
00:00:21,012 --> 00:00:25,573
away, or anywhere in between with equal probability.

6
00:00:25,573 --> 00:00:32,070
So on average, we will be seeking 500 cylinders away, times 10 microseconds per

7
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:38,772
cylinder. So our seek will take us five milliseconds. At that point, our head

8
00:00:38,772 --> 00:00:44,587
is in a random place on the correct track. Now we need to wait for the

9
00:00:44,587 --> 00:00:50,582
beginning of the correct sector to get under the head. And just like

10
00:00:50,582 --> 00:00:55,622
when we were doing the seek, the rotational latency will

11
00:00:55,622 --> 00:01:00,710
be on average, half of a rotation. Sometimes we will be lucky

12
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:05,723
and land just at the very beginning of the sector we want. Sometimes we

13
00:01:05,723 --> 00:01:09,043
will be unlucky and land just past the beginning

14
00:01:09,043 --> 00:01:11,359
of the sector we want. So, we will not

15
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:13,303
be able to read that sector, even though we

16
00:01:13,303 --> 00:01:15,759
are technically right above the data we want to read.

17
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:19,297
We will have to wait for the beginning of the sector to get back which is

18
00:01:19,297 --> 00:01:22,880
a whole rotation. So, on average, we will

19
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:27,170
be having half a rotation. Each rotation is

20
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:31,210
a hundredth of a second or 10 milliseconds.

21
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:35,090
So we end up adding another five milliseconds

22
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:37,780
to our read time. Next, we need to

23
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:41,700
read our sector. There are ten sectors per track.

24
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,688
So the read will take 1 10th of a

25
00:01:43,688 --> 00:01:48,019
rotation, which will be one millisecond because we already determined

26
00:01:48,019 --> 00:01:52,345
that a rotation will be ten milliseconds. So in total,

27
00:01:52,345 --> 00:01:57,530
it will take 11 milliseconds to complete a disk access.
