1
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:05,130
Suppose our goal was to pull out the
reddish pixels, so here's one example.

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:05,760
All right?

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:08,210
So let's suppose we filter this, and

4
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:11,280
we say, we're going to pull out all
the pixels where the red value can be

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,980
anything at all, the green has to be
low and the, the blue has to be low.

6
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:16,602
What do you get?

7
00:00:16,602 --> 00:00:17,420
All right?

8
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:20,630
Well, you'll see that you get
bunch of stuff where like, look.

9
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:24,640
Here's a green value, that's dark green,

10
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,260
which is perfectly reasonable because it
might not have very much red at all, but

11
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,700
it has got, you know,
a certain amount of green.

12
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:34,060
Suppose well,
I want it to be even more red.

13
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:36,087
Okay?
So you might say well,

14
00:00:36,087 --> 00:00:41,540
let me require that the green and
the blue be even more, me be lower.

15
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:43,360
You know,
you start to see that you've lost,

16
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,470
first of all you've got these edges
here, these pixels on the thing, and

17
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:50,930
you've lost some of the red pixels
that you wanted in the, in the apple.

18
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:53,170
And basically,
it's kind of hard if you're building,

19
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:55,860
these are essentially box filters,
right there.

20
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:58,810
There's certain range in red,
certain in green, certain range in blue.

21
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:02,130
And it would be hard to build a box
filter that pulled out all your red,

22
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:03,580
your red apples.

23
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:06,260
And the reason for this,
and we've seen this before,

24
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:10,200
is that, here we're plotting
three different shades of the,

25
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,070
three different intensities
of sort of the same green.

26
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:16,940
In the RGB space, right, so in,
in a nice sort of green in the middle,

27
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:19,520
we get this nice separation
between these values.

28
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,540
But as things get darker, they get
closer, and as they get brighter,

29
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:25,160
they get closer.

30
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:27,300
Why is it as they get
darker they get closer and

31
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:29,180
if they get brighter they get closer?

32
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:31,332
Remember that cube, right?

33
00:01:31,332 --> 00:01:34,691
So as I get closer to white, right?

34
00:01:34,691 --> 00:01:38,611
The I, I have no choice, but
to sort of get closer in RGB space, and

35
00:01:38,611 --> 00:01:42,530
as I get closer to black I have
no choice, but to get closer.

36
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:47,330
So to try to do this separation in
RGB space is kind of difficult.
