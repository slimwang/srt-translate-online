00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,640
Let's have a quiz on regularization.

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:04,641
So check the statements that are true.

3
00:00:04,641 --> 00:00:06,944
Regularization will likely have the most impact when:

4
00:00:06,944 --> 00:00:12,535
The load is relatively evenly distributed among tasks but with some significant outliers.

5
00:00:12,535 --> 00:00:16,930
So for example, most U.S. counties contain at most 1 city,

6
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:20,290
but there are a few that have dozens of cities.

7
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:23,658
Or is it the case that regularization will have most impact

8
00:00:23,658 --> 00:00:26,686
when the load varies wildly from task to task?

9
00:00:26,686 --> 00:00:30,665
And by wildly I really mean that there's no real average case.

10
00:00:30,665 --> 00:00:33,336
An example of this would be popularity.

11
00:00:33,336 --> 00:00:35,972
Some people have claimed that celebrity popularity,

12
00:00:35,972 --> 00:00:39,838
like if you measure something like number of followers somebody has on Twitter,

13
00:00:39,838 --> 00:00:44,438
follows a power law graph distribution, and power law looks something like this,

14
00:00:44,438 --> 00:00:47,549
and if true, then this would mean that at any level of popularity,

15
00:00:47,549 --> 00:00:51,051
a roughly fixed fraction of people will be twice as popular.

16
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:53,658
Okay so in this case you might say that,

17
00:00:53,658 --> 00:00:55,925
"Oh, 80% of the people--

18
00:00:55,925 --> 00:01:01,267
20% of the people have twice as many followers as the remaining 80% of the people below the line,"

19
00:01:01,267 --> 00:01:06,100
and that becomes true, no matter where you draw the line, so that would be a power law.

20
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:08,972
And in a case like this, there's no real average case.

21
00:01:08,972 --> 00:01:13,340
A few very popular people have as many followers as the rest of the world combined.

22
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:18,170
There's an interesting discussion of this that I found online; I'll put it in the Instructor Notes.

23
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:21,835
Finally, is it true to say that regularization will likely have the most impact

24
00:01:21,835 --> 00:01:25,122
when the application can predict load imbalance at run time?

25
00:01:25,122 --> 00:01:28,567
In other words can predict where and how load imbalance will occur.

26
00:01:28,567 --> 00:01:32,925
So an example here is that it might be a lot easier to add up the number of cities in a grid cell

27
00:01:32,925 --> 00:01:35,366
and notice that there's going to be load imbalance

28
00:01:35,366 --> 00:01:43,933
than to actually perform some heavyweight computation on each city.
