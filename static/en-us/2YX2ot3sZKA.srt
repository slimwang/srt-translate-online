1
00:00:00,067 --> 00:00:05,475
So, broadly, as you and your team are thinking about what to put in the next 3,

2
00:00:05,475 --> 00:00:09,312
4, 5 generations of CUDA, you know, what's foremost in your mind?

3
00:00:09,312 --> 00:00:14,116
What are the sort of characteristics that you're thinking about to pick design features

4
00:00:14,116 --> 00:00:16,488
that are going to move CUDA forward?

5
00:00:16,488 --> 00:00:22,492
>>I'm really focused right now on the heterogeneity problem, that is,

6
00:00:22,492 --> 00:00:26,429
I've got this system where I've got processors which are good at one thing,

7
00:00:26,429 --> 00:00:30,581
serial processing, a processor which is good at another thing, parallel processing.

8
00:00:30,581 --> 00:00:35,605
They're 2 separate processors, and they live with their own separate execution spaces

9
00:00:35,605 --> 00:00:38,411
and memory and hardware and all that kind of thing,

10
00:00:38,411 --> 00:00:43,618
and bridging that gap to make it easier for the programmer to reason about what he wants to do

11
00:00:43,618 --> 00:00:47,215
and to express what he wants without having to fight the system.

12
00:00:47,215 --> 00:00:51,785
That's really where I think that the biggest advances need to be made.

13
00:00:51,785 --> 00:00:56,258
So I'm putting, I'm spending a lot of time thinking about memory models, for example,

14
00:00:56,258 --> 00:01:01,766
making life easier for people who, you know, you might not always know what memory you need to move,

15
00:01:01,766 --> 00:01:07,411
or you might find it inconvenient to figure out how do I move data while I'm computing on something else.

16
00:01:07,411 --> 00:01:12,342
All of those types of things that you have to think about in heterogeneous system.

17
00:01:12,342 --> 00:01:18,479
Anything I can do, and I am really not sure what that is yet, I am still working on it though.

18
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:23,102
I really see the direction such that whatever we can do to make it that easier

19
00:01:23,102 --> 00:01:31,575
will make the system easier to program, and I think inevitably in the future there is a place where

20
00:01:31,575 --> 00:01:36,881
you've got specialist processors working on the task for which they are ideally suited,

21
00:01:36,881 --> 00:01:39,869
because that gives you the best performance for the power that you've got,

22
00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:44,914
the best performance for the silicone that you've put in there, it probably will solve the problem faster.

23
00:01:44,914 --> 00:01:48,585
You know if you got a massively parallel processor, do your parallel work on it,

24
00:01:48,585 --> 00:01:53,628
but it now means you've got this space where the programmer's no longer thinking about one type of program,

25
00:01:53,628 --> 00:01:57,555
he has to think about 2 or 3 or 4 or however many disparate things he's got.

26
00:01:57,555 --> 00:02:01,555
And you know, I've not yet seen a great solution to this. But, you know, we're working towards trying to find one.
