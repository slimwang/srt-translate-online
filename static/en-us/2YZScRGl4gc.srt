Welcome to problem set 6.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Let's take a look at the shortest tour problem.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Now let's say we wanted to use a randomized algorithm

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
to solve the shortest tour problem,

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and how about we run it on an N-vertex graph.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Say we decided to run our randomized algorithm

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
a thousand times and we got the following results.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
We got a tour length between a 1056 and 1537.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Along with that, we got the number of times

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
each of those results were found.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Now we also have a known factor to approximation algorithm,

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
and we found an approximation of 1236 with this.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Now what I'd like to know is given the above information,

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
and we will copy that information in the instructor comments below

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
so that you can look at it during the quiz,

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
which of these statements are true?

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Does the shortest tour for the input graph have to have a length of 1056?

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Is the random algorithm likely a factor 3 approximation algorithm?

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Have we found a tour that is at most 1.71 times as long as the optimal one?

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Or similarly, have we found one that is at most 1.43 times as long as the optimal one?

21
00:01:10,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Check whichever of these you think are true.
