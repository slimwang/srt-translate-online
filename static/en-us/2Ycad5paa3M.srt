1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,220
Look at that a little more carefully in pqs space.

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:07,920
Let's assume that we've got some source pq that's right here, all right.

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:11,790
So if my surface normal were pointing right at that direction, so

4
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:17,550
the theta i is 0, cosine i is 1, then my value would be 1, all right.

5
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:21,570
But suppose cosine is 0.9, all right?

6
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:25,270
Well, that would be some, some curve.

7
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:26,380
Draw it around here, right.

8
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:29,020
This is some Iso-brightness contour, so

9
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:33,445
every one of those pqs would give a intensity of 0.9.

10
00:00:33,445 --> 00:00:37,099
Going out a little further 0.8, 0.7.

11
00:00:37,099 --> 00:00:40,260
Gets even further out, 0.6, 0.5, right?

12
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:43,030
Here's all the way down to 0.3.

13
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:48,290
And then finally, what happens when we get to a point where the surface normal,

14
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:50,230
is perpendicular to the light source?

15
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:53,970
Well if the surface normal's perpendicular to light source,

16
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:56,590
the cosine of theta i is 0.

17
00:00:56,590 --> 00:01:00,990
So no light is being ref, is hitting that surface, okay?

18
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:05,610
And so that would be this line here all right, right there.

19
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:07,758
Where it says 0 value,

20
00:01:07,758 --> 00:01:13,417
because that's the equation of a line in pqs phase, right?

21
00:01:13,417 --> 00:01:17,690
P times ps plus q times qs plus 1 equals 0,

22
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:22,530
that's like a x plus b y plus c equals 0 in the p, but it's in pq space so

23
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:27,710
it's ap plus bq plus c equals 0, so it's a line.

24
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:31,637
So the perpendicular situation is a line in pq space.

25
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:37,860
So, and notice by the way, that p, q is a, the R of p, q is a maximum, right

26
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:43,390
when the surface normal lines up with the light source, as you might expect.

27
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:46,710
So that's our reflectance map in the Lambertian situation.
