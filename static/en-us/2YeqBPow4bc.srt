Say you tilt the view a little and set the linear filter. As you increase the

2
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:08,450
resolution of the texture, the checker edges get less and less blurry. At some

3
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:11,857
point, the edges become sharp. If you now use the mousewheel to move in towards

4
00:00:11,857 --> 00:00:16,097
the texture, at a certain distance the edges suddenly become smooth again. This

5
00:00:16,097 --> 00:00:19,880
may not show up on the video, and the texture size it happens for you may vary.

6
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:23,370
But you should see the edges suddenly get sharp and then smooth. Go back to the

00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:24,530
demo and try it yourself.
