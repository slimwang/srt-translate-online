1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The one at zero is stable, the next one is unstable, and the last one is stable again.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Why is that the case?

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Assume that we are close to zero so that we have a small amount of fish

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and this harvesting rate is going to quickly reduce that amount to zero again, which makes zero stable.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
By the way, we can't approach zero from the other side.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
There won't be any negative amount of fish. The second equilibrium is unstable.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Imagine that we had a little less fish that we would harvest more than we gain in this specific period,

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
which means we are going to further drive down the number.

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
We are moving away from that equilibrium.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Similarly if you have a little more fish then the growth rate exceeds the harvesting rate.

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
We are going to have even more fish.

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:08,000
In both directions, we are moving away from the equilibrium It's unstable.

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
And now the third equilibrium, if we have a little less fish,

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:19,000
the growth rate being curve exceeds the harvest rate, more growth than harvest.

15
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
We are going to end up with even more fish.

16
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,000
We're moving up on the horizontal axis towards the equilibrium.

17
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
If we have a little more fish, the harvest rate exceeds the growth rate.

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
We are fishing more than we gain, which curves down the amount.

19
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,000
So from both sides, we are going to approach this equilibrium, which makes it stable.

20
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
If we are in this region, we are definitely over fishing.

21
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
The amount of fish is going down all of the time towards zero.

22
00:01:53,000 --> 99:59:59,999
The harvesting rate is way to large for the small amount of fish that we have in this region.
