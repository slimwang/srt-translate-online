1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:06,616
Now, I want you to help me think about all the abstractions that sit between

2
00:00:06,616 --> 00:00:11,124
these two extremes, Google Earth application that makes

3
00:00:11,124 --> 00:00:14,804
magic happen on the screen and the solid-state

4
00:00:14,804 --> 00:00:18,208
physics the electrons and holes enshrine in

5
00:00:18,208 --> 00:00:21,545
your computer system. What are all the abstractions

6
00:00:21,545 --> 00:00:25,853
that sit between these two extremes? What I want you to do in this quiz is

7
00:00:25,853 --> 00:00:30,858
to name as many abstractions as you can between these two extremes

8
00:00:30,858 --> 00:00:35,732
that I am showing you. To make room for you, let me clear

9
00:00:35,732 --> 00:00:40,750
some space. I put a box now for your answer. To give you

10
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:46,210
an idea of what is expected in this question,

11
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:51,480
as an answer, let me start you off with naming the abstraction

12
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:56,400
that sits right on top of the electrons and holes. This is of course your solid

13
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,840
state physics. And you rain in all the

14
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,920
randomness in the movement of the electrons and holes

15
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:05,519
in the solid-state physics, with this abstraction called

16
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,500
transistor. The transistor is akin to an on-off

17
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:16,810
switch. Now, what I want you to do is fill the rest of the box with all

18
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:21,530
the other abstractions that sits above transistors,

19
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:23,570
all the way up to the application.
