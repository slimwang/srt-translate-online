00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:04,000
Some research has shown an interaction between heart disease and depression.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,020
For example, depression can increase the risk of death from heart disease.

3
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:12,584
However, for many of the studies on the relationship between heart disease and

4
00:00:12,584 --> 00:00:18,008
depression, it's difficult to determine which came first. For example, was the

5
00:00:18,008 --> 00:00:22,520
person depressed first and then acquired heart disease, or is it the opposite.

6
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:27,067
In that the person had heart disease and then acquired depression. Here we can

7
00:00:27,067 --> 00:00:31,400
refer back to what we learned in the research methods lesson, lesson two. These

8
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:35,420
studies on heart disease and depression were correlation studies, and as such,

9
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:39,140
we cannot make causal statements regarding whether heart disease causes

10
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:45,906
depression, or depression causes heart disease. However, we can say that the

11
00:00:45,906 --> 00:00:47,280
two are related.
