1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,400
Now for question one,
we had to come up with a plan.

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:05,760
So I feel like adding audio is going to
be similar to adding images to the app

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:09,580
because we have additional pieces of
information for each word in the app.

4
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:11,960
So I read the steps that
we did in lesson 3 and

5
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:16,059
came up with this summarized list
of tasks for adding images the app.

6
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:17,900
And now I can modify those tasks.

7
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:21,850
So that instead of referencing
images the tasks apply to adding

8
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:23,090
audio to the app.

9
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:27,490
So our steps are, one, modify list
item layout to include a play button.

10
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:30,200
Second, handle clicking on a list
item to play an audio file.

11
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:33,180
And then we can add in
all the audio files.

12
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:36,900
After that, modify the Word class
to store an audio resource ID.

13
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:39,830
We can play the correct
audio file per word.

14
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:43,030
And lastly,
we can do the fun part of visual polish.

15
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:45,660
So let's go ahead and write that in for
the answer to question one.

16
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:49,200
All right, so we have a good plan for
what steps we need to do.

17
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,660
Of course, there will always be some
more steps that come up as we start

18
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:55,485
writing the code and realize there's a
lot more things we need to take care of.

19
00:00:55,485 --> 00:00:57,705
So this list may eventually evolve.

20
00:00:57,705 --> 00:01:00,605
Now let's move on to the next
question how do you play an audio

21
00:01:00,605 --> 00:01:02,025
file in Android?

22
00:01:02,025 --> 00:01:06,025
To find an answer you could either
ask a fellow Android developer or

23
00:01:06,025 --> 00:01:09,445
just search online for
something like play audio Android.

24
00:01:09,445 --> 00:01:13,290
Now our first result here looks good

25
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:16,350
because it's from
a developer.android.com website.

26
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:17,780
Let's click into that.

27
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:18,950
Now when I come across an article or

28
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:22,170
tutorial, I don't read
through all the details.

29
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:24,900
I know this page can look intimidating
because it contains a lot of words that

30
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,340
you may not recognize.

31
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:27,660
But don't worry,

32
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:30,650
we're just trying to get a high level
idea of what we need to use in Android.

33
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:34,110
So you can start off by
reading this first paragraph.

34
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:36,520
Which says that you can
play either audio or

35
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,717
video files using the MediaPlayer class.

36
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:43,060
If you scroll down a bit farther
we see this basic section

37
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:45,710
which talks about two classes
in Android that you need to use.

38
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:49,800
So it looks like we need
something called the MediaPlayer

39
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,690
which is the primary way
to play sound in Android.

40
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:54,130
There's something called
an Audio Manager.

41
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:58,610
And I am not sure what that does right
now, but we can figure that out later.

42
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:01,880
Now, scrolling down a bit lower it
talks about the manifest declarations.

43
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:06,340
So that's kind of a confusing and
unfamiliar phrase for now, so

44
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:07,290
let's skip over that part.

45
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:12,320
So below that we have the section
called Using MediaPlayer and

46
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,210
it contains some code snippet examples.

47
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:17,087
So all this looks pretty useful.

48
00:02:17,087 --> 00:02:19,300
So we might come back to that later.

49
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:22,240
Now scrolling through the rest the page
there's a bunch of other sections

50
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,320
that looked pretty detailed.

51
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,970
Some things are easy to recognize and

52
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:30,100
others are a little bit more
challenging and that's expected.

53
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:32,660
For now we won't read
through the rest of the page

54
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:35,280
there's a lot of good information
here that we can come back to

55
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,900
when we need the working
details of the code.

56
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:40,770
So we did a little bit of research and
found that in Android,

57
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:44,190
we can use the MediaPlayer class
to help us play an audio file.

58
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:47,020
So we don't need to know
everything about how it works or

59
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:50,390
even how to use it, but at the very
least we now know that it exists.

60
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:52,158
So we're off to a great
start with this feature.

61
00:02:52,158 --> 00:02:53,080
But let's keep going.
