Let me show you what happens when we run that. So I wrote to the file

2
00:00:04,302 --> 00:00:08,042
corpus.pkl. If we did a really long crawl, we'd want to make sure that file's

3
00:00:08,042 --> 00:00:11,800
protected, so we don't write it over again. And then if we ran the crawler the

4
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:15,930
second time, now we get an error, permission is denied and we catch that

5
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:20,792
exception and see the message. Let's take a little peek at what's actually in

6
00:00:20,792 --> 00:00:25,783
that file, and you can see that it's not impossible to make sense of. We don't

7
00:00:25,783 --> 00:00:30,760
really care what's in it as long as pickle load and does what pickle dub does,

8
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:35,974
what's in there could be anything, but we can see that it's stored the webcorpus

9
00:00:35,974 --> 00:00:41,030
object, and we can see some of the contents we expect in there and lots of other

10
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:41,584
stuff.
