1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,252
Let's walk through the tasks
you need to accomplish to take

2
00:00:03,252 --> 00:00:04,725
GIFMaker to the next level.

3
00:00:04,725 --> 00:00:08,550
You want to be able to save a GIF and
display it in a collection.

4
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:11,080
So you'll need to implement
a collection view.

5
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:14,760
You want the user to be able to view the
details of each GIF in the collection.

6
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:18,090
So you'll also need to set
up a detail view controller.

7
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:22,870
You want to be able to persist GIFs,
which we'll do with NSKeyedArchiver.

8
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:26,210
And then in the end, you'll want
to add some finishing touches,

9
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:29,360
including styling, and
the first time user experience.

10
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:33,120
Let's start by focusing in
on the first two tasks.

11
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,800
Save a GIF and
view GIFs in a collection.

12
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:39,760
In order to save a GIF, you'll need to
create the SavedGifsViewController and

13
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,350
configure the
PreviewViewControllerDelegate.

14
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:45,730
In order to view GIFs in a collection,
you'll need to implement the necessary

15
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:49,400
protocols, starting with the
CollectionViewDatasource protocol and

16
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:52,000
the CollectionViewFlowLayout protocol.

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,630
You'll also need to create a custom
class for the CollectionViewCell.

18
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:58,350
Let's get started by creating
the SavedGifsViewController.
