1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:02,600
We can see what looks like a almost linear

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:07,490
relationship between carat weight and price after doing some transformations,

3
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:10,420
but surely there are other factors that influence the price

4
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:13,350
of a diamond. When I was looking around at diamonds

5
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:16,770
I noticed that clarity seemed to factor into price.

6
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:19,680
Of course, many consumers are looking for a diamond of

7
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,900
a certain minimum size. So we shouldn't expect clarity to

8
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:25,820
be as strong a factor as carat weight. And I

9
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:28,010
must admit that even though my grandparents were

10
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:30,370
jewelers. I initially had a hard time discerning a

11
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:34,740
diamond rated VVS1 from one rated SI2. Surely, most

12
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:36,610
people need a jeweler's loop to tell the difference.

13
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:40,560
According to blue nile, the cut of a diamond

14
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,620
has a much more consequential impact on that fiery

15
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:46,150
quality that jewelers describe when they talk about diamonds.

16
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:51,440
On clarity, the website states many of these imperfections

17
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,460
are microscopic and do not affect the diamonds beauty in any discernible way.
