00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,244
So, we want to find the places where this lovely purple vertical line intersects

2
00:00:04,256 --> 00:00:08,495
each of these 3 other lines. But why? What is the point where 2 lines intersect

3
00:00:08,507 --> 00:00:12,603
actually represent? Is it a point that lines on both of those lines? Does it

4
00:00:12,615 --> 00:00:16,711
tell us values for x and y that satisfy the equations of both of the lines? Is

5
00:00:16,723 --> 00:00:22,610
it a point where one of the lines turns into the other line? Or is it a solution

6
00:00:22,622 --> 00:00:25,220
to both equations?
