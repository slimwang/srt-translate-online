00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,030
For this quiz, I want you to head over
to csstriggers.com and do some research.

2
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:08,710
I want you to find a CSS property
that triggers layout, paint, and

3
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:11,030
composite, and type it into this box.

4
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:14,220
Then find a CSS property that only
triggers paint and composite and

5
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:16,219
type it into this box.

6
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:20,470
And then lastly, find a CSS property
that only triggers composite and

7
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:21,910
type it into this box.

8
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:26,120
The reason you're checking out
csstriggers.com is because a, Paul made

9
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:30,750
it and he's forcing us to include it in
the course, and b, it's a super useful

10
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:34,560
resource for determining the amount
of work your CSS will trigger.

11
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,220
It's really important
to become familiar with

12
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:38,220
it if you want to write
performant websites.

13
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:39,250
Okay.
Well, good luck!
