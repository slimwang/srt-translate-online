00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,394
We can use our knowledge of canceling factors to help us simplify rational

2
00:00:03,394 --> 00:00:07,395
expressions. We simplify a rational expression the same way that we simply

3
00:00:07,395 --> 00:00:11,570
fractions. We just need to cancel the factors that appear in the numerator and

4
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:15,700
the denominator since the factors reduced to 1. We can use these steps for any

5
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:20,428
rational expression we encounter. So let's start off with this one. I want you

6
00:00:20,428 --> 00:00:25,493
to factor the numerator and the denominator in the set here.
