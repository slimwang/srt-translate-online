What we need in a certificate is something that communicates the public key of the server

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
to the client in a way that the client can trust.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Here's one way to do that.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
We'll make the certificate include the name of the domain and its public key.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Let's assume we're using RSA, so this would be an RSA key.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
That's the public key, and that means that the server knows the corresponding private key.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
This is encrypted using a private key of some certificate authority

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
that the client has to trust.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
The question is how should the client verify the certificate?

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Here are the possible answers. Select the best one.
