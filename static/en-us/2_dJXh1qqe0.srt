00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:02,410
So anyways, what's next in this class,

2
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:05,115
you're going to learn of what's an equivalent of Naïve Bayes.

3
00:00:05,115 --> 00:00:08,299
Bayes was a religious man trying to prove the existence of God.

4
00:00:08,299 --> 00:00:09,940
He wasn't very naïve.

5
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:12,320
But the algorithm is kind of naïve and

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,680
it's a very common algorithm to find at a certain surface, just like this
