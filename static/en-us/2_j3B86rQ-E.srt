1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:04,021
So now it's time to cover the building blocks to use when doing datestore

2
00:00:04,021 --> 00:00:08,581
modelling. They are kind, entity, and

3
00:00:08,581 --> 00:00:14,040
property. Let's start with kind shall we? A kind

4
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:15,780
is a name that defines a particular

5
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:19,500
structure. For our conference central application, two different

6
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:23,410
kinds are, for example, profile and conference.

7
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:25,460
A kind is similar to the concept of

8
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:29,230
classes in object oriented programming. Given a kind

9
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:31,650
you can create many entities of that kind, so

10
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:34,360
in this picture we can do three entities, one

11
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,710
for the profile kind and two for the conference

12
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:40,880
kind. And as you can see entities are very

13
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:43,990
similar to the concept of objects in object oriented

14
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:48,170
programming, and each entity holds a set of properties

15
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:50,570
which are highlighted by the red sections in this

16
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:53,460
picture, and by now you can see that

17
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:56,830
properties are very similar to the concept of fields,

18
00:00:56,830 --> 00:01:00,637
members, or attributes in object oriented programming. In

19
00:01:00,637 --> 00:01:03,257
fact, you can also find similarities with the relational

20
00:01:03,257 --> 00:01:05,620
of database modeling. Let's look at the table

21
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:09,820
that summarizes these things. So the kind in app

22
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:12,670
engine datastore can be thought of as a class

23
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:15,830
in object oriented programming and as a table in

24
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:19,405
relational database model, and an entity in app engine

25
00:01:19,405 --> 00:01:21,750
datastore can be thought of as an object in

26
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:24,780
object oriented programming or as a row in relational

27
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:28,890
database modeling. And finally, a property in Datastore can

28
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:31,140
be thought of as a field or attribute in

29
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:34,250
object oriented programming, and that's a colomn, in relational

30
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:37,920
database modeling. But, this is on a very high

31
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,060
level. Since there are many things that differ in Datastore

32
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:43,930
compared to the other technologies, you shouldn't consider these

33
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:46,590
as direct technology. It could help you out in the

34
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:49,200
beginning, but as we dig deeper into how data store

35
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,110
works, you will start to see more and more differences
