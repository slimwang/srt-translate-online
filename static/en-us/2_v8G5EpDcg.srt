00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:05,160
Well, we know the ladder is 17 feet long. So we'll have 17 for this distance of

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:09,400
the ladder. We know that the distance from the bottom of the ladder to the

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:13,060
house or the building is 7 feet less, than the distance from the top of the

4
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:19,134
ladder to the ground. So we know that this distance is 7 units less than this

5
00:00:19,134 --> 00:00:24,008
distance. Since we don't know this distance, we can use the variable x. And

6
00:00:24,008 --> 00:00:27,302
then we can write the expression x minus 7 for the distance from the base of

7
00:00:27,302 --> 00:00:32,374
the ladder to the base of the building. This is how we get this number and

8
00:00:32,374 --> 00:00:37,203
these two expressions. Great work if you found all 3.
