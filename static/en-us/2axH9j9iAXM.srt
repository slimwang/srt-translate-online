1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,580
The first thing to do here is to select the view controller by clicking on

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:04,818
this phone frame.

3
00:00:04,818 --> 00:00:08,050
Now, you may have to lean in a little bit to see this tiny blue

4
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:09,550
border around the phone.

5
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:13,200
By the way, I could have done the same thing by opening up Document Outline, and

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,240
selecting View Controller here.

7
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:18,760
Okay, let me close Document Outline, and get back to my storyboard.

8
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:22,430
Okay so notice that there is an arrow that is pointing to our view controller.

9
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:24,560
Now this arrow means that this is the first or

10
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,030
starting view controller of our app.

11
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:29,920
Now you can see more information about this if you slide open

12
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:30,520
the Utilities tray.

13
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:34,080
Tray, and go to Attributes Inspector, and

14
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:38,040
in here you can see an option called Is initial view controller.

15
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,870
And that option is checked, which means that this view

16
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:44,780
controller is the initial or the starting view controller for our app.

17
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:48,600
If I uncheck this box, notice that the arrow goes away.

18
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,130
Now if I try to run my app, Xcode gives me an error.

19
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:56,360
It says, perhaps the designated entry point is not set.

20
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,760
How cultured of you Xcode.

21
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:01,030
Yes, the entry point is in fact not set.

22
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:04,280
To fix this error, all I have to do is check this box again.

23
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:07,060
Alright, I'm going to manage screen space so you can see my

24
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:11,680
story board a little bit better, by sliding out Utility and the debug area.

25
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,200
So after I've selected the view controller, I can go to the Editor menu and

26
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:20,070
then select Embed In > Navigation Controller.

27
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:22,620
And voila, we have something new on our screen.

28
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:26,600
Let me use the pen gesture on my mouse pad to align this properly.

29
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:31,040
I can also use the pinch gesture, to zoom in and out of the storyboard.

30
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,095
So it seems like the initial view controller has changed.

31
00:01:34,095 --> 00:01:37,120
It is now this thing called the Navigation Controller.

32
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,360
Navigation controller, as its name suggests,

33
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,770
will help us navigate between two different screens on our app.

34
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:44,590
At this point however, I would love for

35
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:47,990
you to search for navigation controller in the documentation.

36
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:51,320
Read through the docs and identify somewhere between one to

37
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:54,200
three things that you've learned about this new idea.

38
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,020
Here is your challenge one more time.

39
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:58,770
You can share your ideas with us on the discussion forum, and

40
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:00,310
can check this box when you are done.
