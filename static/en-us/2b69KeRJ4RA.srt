1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:04,040
We have come across the notion of meta-reasoning earlier in this class.

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:07,000
You may recall this was the explanation that an agent had built,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,160
to decide why a particular object was an instance of the cup.

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:15,400
And we told it that it was an incorrect decision. The agent then,

5
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:18,230
reflected on its knowledge. Here was the knowledge.

6
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:21,560
Here was the explanation it had built. It is now reflecting on it and

7
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:25,270
trying to figure out what makes this particular explanation incorrect.

8
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:30,360
Where does the fault lie? That was an example where the agent was reflecting on

9
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:33,390
its knowledge, but has this knowledge was stored in the short term memory.

10
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:37,020
It had been pulled out of the long term memory. But just like there can be

11
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:40,430
error in the knowledge, there could also potentially be an error in reasoning.

12
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:44,400
Or potentially an error in the learning process. An example of an error in

13
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:48,270
reasoning occurred very early in this particular class. You may recall this

14
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:52,220
particular diagram from mean sense analysis. This was the blocks micro build.

15
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:56,470
The agents needed to take the blocks from this initial stage to this goal state.

16
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:59,850
However there were multiple goals here. D on table, C on D, B on C.

17
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:04,300
And as the agent tried to accomplish these goals. It ran into cul de sacs,

18
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:08,440
where no further progress was possible without undoing some of

19
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:13,130
the earlier goals. So, that was an example of metacognition over reasoning,

20
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:16,230
where the agent was trying to figure out, what was the error in my reasoning,

21
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:21,030
and how can I remedy it. We can similarly have metacognition over learning. So

22
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:23,460
an example of metacognition where learning occurred.

23
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:26,910
When we were talking about learning making mistakes. You recall this was

24
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:31,250
the explanation the agent had built, after it had remedied the explanation.

25
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:35,340
The remedy in this particular case was adding here that the handle is fixed and

26
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:38,630
relating it to the rest of the explanation. Given that the agent had

27
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:42,300
used explanation based learning to build this explanation in the first place,

28
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:46,890
we can think of the agent as, reflecting on this process of explanation based

29
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:51,530
learning and asking itself, what did I do wrong? And then deciding,

30
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:54,808
well I built the wrong explanation. I must change that explanation. And

31
00:01:54,808 --> 00:01:58,230
that's what learning by correcting mistakes did. We can consider this to

32
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:02,860
be a process of metacognition of learning in the sense that the agent may say,

33
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:04,760
how did I learn this particular knowledge. Well,

34
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,730
they learned it through explanationless learning. So

35
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:10,240
what was wrong in my process of explanationless learning that lead to this

36
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:15,090
incorrect explanation? How do I fix my process of explanationless learning so

37
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:16,750
that I do not make the same error, again?
