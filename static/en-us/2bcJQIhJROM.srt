Whenever we write an equation in this form, we say that it is in slope-intercept

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:08,742
form. We say that, because we can read the slope and the y intercept or the b

3
00:00:08,742 --> 00:00:13,240
directly from the equation. Let's try putting this knowledge to use. Which of

4
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:17,772
the following equations are in slope-intercept form? A word of warning. This is

5
00:00:17,772 --> 00:00:22,083
pretty tricky, but, I really want you to think about this. So, take your time

6
00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:23,679
and then go with the answer.
