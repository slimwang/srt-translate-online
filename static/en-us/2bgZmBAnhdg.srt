00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,260
So, more than half a century ago, Eugene Wigner wrote

2
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:07,110
about, The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences.

3
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:08,029
>> Yeah.

4
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:11,440
>> And, and, indeed one man can sit in one's living room and

5
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:15,330
do Duncan experiments and, maybe you know what that word means? I don't.

6
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:16,410
>> Duncan means thought.

7
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:17,560
>> Okay, thought experiments.

8
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:18,110
>> Thought experiments.

9
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:20,175
>> You can do these thought experiments and come up with something like the

10
00:00:20,175 --> 00:00:22,990
gene-, General Theory of Relativity. You discover

11
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:25,910
black holes and the curvature of space-time.

12
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:29,080
And why is that so? Could it be that we only perceive what we

13
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:32,140
can describe, without mathematics. And vice versa?

14
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:34,470
Because mathematics is co-evolved with our brain.

15
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:39,550
>> Look, Eugene Wigman made a big problem for every generation

16
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:43,270
that came after him. To answer that question, why mathematics works.

17
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:48,440
Why does mathematics? And sometimes I think

18
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:52,960
to myself, what, how could it not work?

19
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,050
The world has some coherence to it.

20
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:57,896
Things don't just randomly happen. How do you

21
00:00:57,896 --> 00:01:00,151
describe things that don't randomly happen? If

22
00:01:00,151 --> 00:01:03,310
they don't randomly happen, you have to have

23
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:07,522
some kind of quantitative framework for explaining what

24
00:01:07,522 --> 00:01:10,989
happens. So I can't imagine, on the one

25
00:01:10,989 --> 00:01:17,517
hand I can't imagine a world that didn't work according to some kind of laws

26
00:01:17,517 --> 00:01:22,530
and those laws being written mathematically. On the

27
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:25,040
other hand, I also can't quite understand why

28
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,080
mathematics works. So Eugene asked a very difficult

29
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,510
question. And he didn't know the answer. And

30
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:35,300
I think I, I, I don't know the answer, either. But here's what I would say.

31
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:41,120
Here's what I would say. Not, why does mathematics work, but why do we need

32
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:46,260
mathematics to explain physics, why is it

33
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:51,680
so hard to explain physics in the English language? And the reason

34
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:56,658
is, because, yeah, we may have evolved as a species

35
00:01:56,658 --> 00:02:02,280
on mathematical abilities, but we evolved them, in the context,

36
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,930
of rather ordinary things. The ordinary things would be,

37
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:10,030
how stones move when you throw them. When it comes

38
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:12,590
to waves, we have some perspective about what a

39
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:15,930
wave is because we see water making waves and so

40
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:18,380
forth. We have a good concept of what a

41
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:20,580
force is because if I give you a good shove,

42
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:22,900
you'll say, oh, don't force me. We know what

43
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:27,358
force means. But every time we enter into a new

44
00:02:27,358 --> 00:02:35,700
range of parameters We make things smaller than anything that

45
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:42,050
we were, than we grew up with. Other words, we go to the quantum world. Or we go

46
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:47,950
to the world of very, very heavy things and dense things. In other worlds,

47
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:53,800
we go to the world of black holes. We suddenly find that the intuitions and

48
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:57,770
the concepts that we evolved with are not sufficient

49
00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:03,360
to understand. An example, we use higher dimensional spaces all

50
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,950
the time. We think we sometimes think for example, that

51
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:11,299
the that space itself may be more than three dimensions.

52
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:20,020
You evolve. You and I evolved in a world of three dimensions. We can't visualize

53
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:23,770
more dimensions. And we can't because our

54
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:26,620
it, it's not that we're not smart enough.

55
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:29,220
It's that the neural architecture, the architecture

56
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:32,950
of the brain itself. Was purposefully built, well

57
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:35,610
it wasn't purposely built, but it evolved

58
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:38,950
in the world of three dimensions. The architecture

59
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:41,160
is appropriate for three dimensions and it's

60
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,510
not appropriate for four, five, six, seven

61
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:48,200
dimensions. If we think that we're interested

62
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,700
in a space with seven dimensions or whatever,

63
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:54,960
how would we describe it if we can't visualize it. We describe it by pure

64
00:03:54,960 --> 00:04:04,180
mathematics. We say a three dimensional world is described by a bunch of points

65
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:06,940
that are labeled by X, Y, and Z

66
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:11,471
that's an abstraction. I can visualize three-dimensions on

67
00:04:11,471 --> 00:04:17,800
my head, but I use x, y, an z to describe them mathematically. Now I go

68
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,810
to four dimensions, or five dimensions. I can't

69
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:24,250
visualize it anymore. I can't visualize it anymore.

70
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:29,290
I can't close my eyes an see a, a five-dimensional world. But I can add two

71
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:35,160
more letters to the alphabet. I can add the x, y, and z, w, and

72
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:40,760
v. And now I have a five dimensional space. How do I work with it? I work with

73
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:44,030
it using algebra. I work with it using

74
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:48,370
using abstract mathematics. And I don't try to see

75
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:51,260
it in my head. In trying to explain

76
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:54,820
it to people who don't have the mathematical background,

77
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:59,789
we get stuck. I can't say, now close your eyes and view in your head five

78
00:04:59,789 --> 00:05:05,002
dimensions, because I can't do it either. What I, all I can do is say, take

79
00:05:05,002 --> 00:05:09,940
x, y, and z and add v and w. Eventually if, eventually a

80
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:15,220
person with this kind of mathematical background begins

81
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:20,340
to develop mathematical intuitions for things.

82
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:27,370
They don't need the same kind of visualization. So, we are stuck. We're stuck

83
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:34,870
needing mathematics because evolution didn't equip us to be able to

84
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:40,950
visualize quantum mechanics. It didn't visualize us to be able to, there

85
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:47,368
sorry, it didn't equip us to be able to visualize 11 dimensional space-time.

86
00:05:47,368 --> 00:05:51,530
And tha, that's the reason. Evolution did it to us.
