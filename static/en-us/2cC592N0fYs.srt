00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:05,820
Let's look at the solution to our BTB and BHT quiz. The question this time is,

2
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:08,200
which BHT entry do we access for each

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:11,899
instruction? There are 16 entries in the BHT,

4
00:00:11,899 --> 00:00:14,356
and we said that we access the BHT

5
00:00:14,356 --> 00:00:18,619
using the lowermost bits of the instruction address.

6
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:21,340
That they are not the same for all

7
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:25,478
instructions. In this case, our instruction address has

8
00:00:25,478 --> 00:00:32,369
the following bits. For the move instruction here we have C000, because every

9
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:35,470
instruction is 4 bytes in size, the

10
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:39,770
lower most 2-bits are never changing; they're

11
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:45,580
always going to be 0 for our instructions. And now because

12
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:50,520
we have 16 BHT entries, we take the next 4 bits and this is the number of

13
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:56,775
the BHT entry. In this case we're accessing the BHT entry number 0. Now

14
00:00:56,775 --> 00:01:02,830
let's look at this other move instruction here whose address is C004. C00 are

15
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:10,292
not changing, what is changing is 4. Four in binary 0100. Again we discard

16
00:01:10,292 --> 00:01:13,148
these bits because they're never changing among

17
00:01:13,148 --> 00:01:15,664
instructions, and this is the number of the

18
00:01:15,664 --> 00:01:22,140
BHT entry. So the entry that we access here is 1. Now you can tell that for

19
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:29,033
instruction 8 here, this is going to be 10, so we are going to access the

20
00:01:29,033 --> 00:01:35,338
BHT entry number 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7. If we reached 15 we

21
00:01:35,338 --> 00:01:39,720
will then wrap around to 0, but we never reach it. So this is really what we get
