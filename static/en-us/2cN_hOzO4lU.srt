1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,350
Now that we have our table,
we can start adding rows to the table,

2
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:06,300
as well as reading and
then manipulating data within it.

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:08,770
So the basic actions to
be performed on the table

4
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:11,640
can be summarized into one word, CRUD.

5
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:13,360
Now when I say CRUD,

6
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,340
I'm not referring to the crud on
Tommy's paws when he came in today.

7
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:20,580
Instead, CRUD is a database
related acronym standing for

8
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:23,590
create, read, update, and delete.

9
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:29,050
So let's visualize how these actions
can be taken on the spreadsheet, and

10
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:32,509
then we can take a look at how we can
use them on the actual table later on.

11
00:00:32,509 --> 00:00:34,070
So starting off with the action create.

12
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:37,140
So say we have a pet come in,

13
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:39,820
it's a male seven kilogram
Terrier named Baxter.

14
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:41,730
He's brought into the shelter.

15
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:44,730
So to add him to the table,

16
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:48,130
we simply add another row to the table
containing all his information.

17
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,130
And so
this is considered a create action.

18
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:53,780
So next up is the read action.

19
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:57,800
So say the table has filled
up with quite a few pets, and

20
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:00,840
a client walks in wanting to know if
there are female pets in the shelter.

21
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:06,950
Well we can sort the column gender, and
then just search for the female pets.

22
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:11,280
So selecting the rows that we want,
with information that we want,

23
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,580
is considered a read action.

24
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:15,530
So next up is update.

25
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:20,440
Maybe we found out that
Baxter is not just a Terrier,

26
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,720
instead he's a Border Terrier.

27
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:27,470
So what we would do is go to his row,
change his breed entry,

28
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:28,410
updating that information.

29
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:30,410
And so this is an update action.

30
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:34,020
And lastly is our delete action.

31
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:38,450
If we find out that we've
added a pet by mistake, and

32
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:42,340
want to remove that pet from our current
list, we can simply delete that row.

33
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:46,340
So given that our table is
organized like this spreadsheet,

34
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:48,390
it can be easy to visualize the actions.

35
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:49,270
So next,

36
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:51,730
let's a quick look at the different
actions we'll take within our pets app.

37
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:55,720
And then we can decide which specific
SQLite actions we'll need to learn in

38
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,620
order to accomplish those.
