1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,100
The second of Kruchten's views is the developmental view, and

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:05,870
here we're concerned with the source code.

3
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:09,010
The logical view had to do with the system,

4
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:11,010
primarily with how it's going to execute.

5
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:13,340
The development view has to do with the source code.

6
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:16,980
And the units of source code which might be considered for

7
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:21,840
modeling in the development view include packages, classes, subsystems,

8
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,390
libraries, files, and so on.

9
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:30,670
UML package diagrams, UML component diagrams can convey this sort of thing,

10
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:37,416
as can the mechanisms provided by source control systems such as CVS or,

11
00:00:37,416 --> 00:00:43,222
or, or, or some of it's SVN or, or Github or some of the more

12
00:00:43,222 --> 00:00:49,910
modern modern systems allow the developers to break the system into modules.

13
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:52,650
Here is a reminder of some of the slides that we saw when we were

14
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:55,600
reviewing UML diagram types.

15
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:02,230
Here's a class diagram with packages, here's a package diagram, and

16
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:07,480
here's a component diagram where the rectangles correspond with the components.

17
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:11,740
The the arrows correspond to specific

18
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:17,120
dependencies among the components indicating that a component

19
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:22,040
supplies what is needed by a component at the other end of the line.
