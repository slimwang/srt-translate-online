00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,490
So here's another quiz.

2
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:05,410
What does that view,
I'll go back to that view,

3
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:08,765
that color space view, let us do.

4
00:00:08,765 --> 00:00:10,260
Okay, and here, so

5
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:15,040
one is, think about clusters of
pixels that are similar in color.

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,490
Understand the shape and
size of objects present.

7
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:21,670
Identify pixels that are different,
and separate them.

8
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:25,590
Count how many pixels of each

00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:26,820
