>> In all the problems so far, we've been setting up equations with words, and

2
00:00:04,064 --> 00:00:08,038
then solving them. >> We're going to try that same approach, but this time with

3
00:00:08,038 --> 00:00:11,776
geometry. >> We're going to look at angles. >> An angle is used to represent a

4
00:00:11,776 --> 00:00:15,632
certain amount of rotation. >> You might have heard doing a 360. >> If you're

5
00:00:15,632 --> 00:00:19,631
looking out in one direction and turn all the way around, you've gone 360

6
00:00:19,631 --> 00:00:23,878
degrees. >> So, some angle is only part of 360 degrees. >> We're not going to

7
00:00:23,878 --> 00:00:28,494
look at just any angle, we're going to look at some special angles that have

8
00:00:28,494 --> 00:00:29,830
unique relationships.
