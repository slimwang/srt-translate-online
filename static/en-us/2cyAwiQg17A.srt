00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,510
Now how about hardcoded
strings within our Java files?

2
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:07,090
Let's take a look at our
createOrderSummary method,

3
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:10,630
which has a bunch of English
strings hardcoded in.

4
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:14,057
Let's start by moving the phrase,
Thank you to the strings.xml file.

5
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:19,270
And here's the new string
resource with the name thank_you.

6
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:22,130
Then we can update the Java
statement to refer to the new

7
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:24,390
string resource by its name.

8
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:27,150
We're using the get string method
within the activity class,

9
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:31,080
which takes as input a string
resource and returns a string.

10
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,490
The thank you string is then
added on to this whole message.
