1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
This is fairly straight forward.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
We just take the square roots of each of these numbers.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:13,000
The square root of 2 is approximately 1.414.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
The square root of 4 is simply 2.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
The square root of 20 is approximately 4.472.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
What's interesting about this is that these tend to grow more slowly

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
than does the mean or the variance.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 99:59:59,999
They don't grow linearly with time.
