1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:01,960
So let's try it out.

2
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:08,570
We'll run an nc on port 2000 and then
in another window on the same machine.

3
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:12,260
We'll run another nc, also listening
on port 2000 and there we go.

4
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:16,868
We got an an error, nc,
address already in use.

5
00:00:16,868 --> 00:00:18,350
That's a networky way of saying,

6
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:21,350
some other process is already
listening on that port.

7
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:24,830
So the correct answer here is,
that nc gives you an error message but

8
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:26,490
the internet does not explode.
