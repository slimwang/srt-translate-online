1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,200
All right, so now we're going to
take what we just learned, and

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:05,170
think about what generalized
MDPs might need.

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,910
Generalized Markoff Decision Processes.

4
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:12,181
So the Bellman Equation for
generalized MDPs looks like this.

5
00:00:12,181 --> 00:00:16,712
Q*(s,a)=R(s,a)+Gamma times

6
00:00:16,712 --> 00:00:21,773
kind of a summish thing
over s prime of a maxish

7
00:00:21,773 --> 00:00:26,576
thing over a prime of Q
star s prime a prime.

8
00:00:26,576 --> 00:00:30,025
So basically all I'm trying to say here,
is that we can take out,

9
00:00:30,025 --> 00:00:33,251
we can substitute various things in for
this plus operator.

10
00:00:33,251 --> 00:00:34,961
And this times operator and

11
00:00:34,961 --> 00:00:39,650
we get different sequential decision
making problems that come out of it.

12
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:42,340
So just to make sure that you
understand what I'm talking about,

13
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:44,080
let's do the first one together here.

14
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:49,344
The first idea here is that
we're going to replace this plus

15
00:00:49,344 --> 00:00:54,610
symbol with a sum over all
s prime of the probability

16
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:58,410
of reaching s prime times then
whatever function we're plus-ing.

17
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:04,300
Which in this case is the X thing,
applied to Q star so the X thing here

18
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:09,650
is written to be the max operator,
so max over all next actions.

19
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:14,410
Well, it says F S primate prime, but

20
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:16,892
here we're going to be substituting
in the Q star s prime a prime.

21
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:20,770
So, if we were actually to do
the substitution in the first line,

22
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:23,900
put this summation thing
instead of the plus thing, and

23
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:26,930
this max thing instead of
kind of the times or X thing,

24
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:33,910
what decision process sort of
thing would we get from that?

25
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:36,741
>> That's just a regular MDP.

26
00:01:36,741 --> 00:01:38,539
>> Yes,
that's just how I would have said it.

27
00:01:38,539 --> 00:01:42,301
So, it just gives us back the ordinary
Bellman equation for MDPs.

28
00:01:42,301 --> 00:01:46,045
It's just, again, kind of a weird way of
writing it, but the point is that we're

29
00:01:46,045 --> 00:01:49,357
going to allow different kinds of
operators to be substituted in here and

30
00:01:49,357 --> 00:01:52,997
we're still going to get very reasonable
things out, things that we can run value

31
00:01:52,997 --> 00:01:56,510
iteration on, things that we can
run q learning on and so forth.

32
00:01:56,510 --> 00:02:00,470
So, if you think you get that let's
do the rest of this as a quiz.

33
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:02,240
Basically what I'd like you to do is for

34
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,680
each line here,
if we were to do the substitution,

35
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,050
where the plus operators define here and
the time operators define here,

36
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:12,480
what kind of decision process
would we get out of that?

37
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,620
>> I think I follow that.

38
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:19,580
I'm looking over these to make
certain it all makes sense to me.

39
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:20,980
I think I get what you are saying.

40
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:26,120
In the regular MDP we have
an expectation over maxes, and

41
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:30,280
so the first line is basically
an expectation over a max.

42
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:33,120
So that's what a regular MDP is.

43
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,850
So the next one is a min,
instead of an expectation, over a max.

44
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:43,861
And then in the third one's
an expectation over a peordida.

45
00:02:43,861 --> 00:02:44,801
>> Oh yeah, sorry.

46
00:02:44,801 --> 00:02:46,960
I just made up some notation there.

47
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,860
Let me explain what that means.

48
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:52,350
So, the basic idea is that we're
going to take a weighted combination of

49
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:57,300
all the actions and the weights
depend on the rank of the action.

50
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:00,510
And in particular we can have
a weight for the max and a weight for

51
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:03,340
the min and a weight for
the second largest,

52
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:06,400
the third largest, the fourth largest,
and those weights are consistent.

53
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,406
They're going to be just a constant.

54
00:03:08,406 --> 00:03:10,462
>> Oh, okay.

55
00:03:10,462 --> 00:03:13,013
Does that imply that we have,
no matter where we are,

56
00:03:13,013 --> 00:03:14,722
we have the same number of actions?

57
00:03:14,722 --> 00:03:16,428
>> Yes.

58
00:03:16,428 --> 00:03:17,148
>> Okay.

59
00:03:17,148 --> 00:03:18,656
Is there any relationship
between those weights?

60
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:21,185
They can be negative, they can be a
million, they can be anything you want?

61
00:03:21,185 --> 00:03:21,776
>> Oh, sorry.

62
00:03:21,776 --> 00:03:22,763
Yeah, good.

63
00:03:22,763 --> 00:03:24,934
So the row of the weight for

64
00:03:24,934 --> 00:03:29,682
a given rank should be It
should be a convex combination.

65
00:03:29,682 --> 00:03:32,596
They should all sum to one and
be non-negative.

66
00:03:32,596 --> 00:03:33,421
>> Okay, okay, okay.

67
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:34,002
Sure.

68
00:03:34,002 --> 00:03:38,739
So it's like doing an expectation but

69
00:03:38,739 --> 00:03:42,743
based on how good the action is.

70
00:03:42,743 --> 00:03:43,684
Sort of.

71
00:03:43,684 --> 00:03:45,216
>> Yeah where it falls in the list yeah.

72
00:03:45,216 --> 00:03:48,304
So this actually generalizes
the first line max.

73
00:03:48,304 --> 00:03:53,408
Because max is what we get if we put the
row of the largest rank to be one and

74
00:03:53,408 --> 00:03:55,978
the row everything else to be zero.

75
00:03:55,978 --> 00:03:58,381
But it also let's us get min right.

76
00:03:58,381 --> 00:04:02,974
Where we have the row of
the smallest rank equal to one and

77
00:04:02,974 --> 00:04:04,941
everything else zero.

78
00:04:04,941 --> 00:04:10,234
And everything in between, like
uniform waiting over all the actions.

79
00:04:10,234 --> 00:04:12,683
>> Okay, I think I've got it.

80
00:04:12,683 --> 00:04:13,195
And let's see.

81
00:04:13,195 --> 00:04:14,704
Let's double check the last one.

82
00:04:14,704 --> 00:04:18,976
The last line,
certification over minimax.

83
00:04:18,976 --> 00:04:19,858
I think I know what that means, okay.

84
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:22,459
>> Well, just to make sure.

85
00:04:22,459 --> 00:04:23,781
So it's a little bit weird.

86
00:04:23,781 --> 00:04:27,958
I'm kind of abusing notation here,
because minimax is usually defined when

87
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:31,898
you've got two different actors,
kind of a player one and a player two.

88
00:04:31,898 --> 00:04:35,055
And here I'm just writing
it as if it were one actor.

89
00:04:35,055 --> 00:04:37,275
But, you should think of it as,

90
00:04:37,275 --> 00:04:41,324
this a prime represents a joint
action by the two players.

91
00:04:41,324 --> 00:04:42,636
>> All right.

92
00:04:42,636 --> 00:04:46,456
Okay, I think I got it or at least
got it enough to work it through.

93
00:04:46,456 --> 00:04:47,001
>> All right.

94
00:04:47,001 --> 00:04:48,905
Why don't you give it a shot, and

95
00:04:48,905 --> 00:04:53,061
if you don't get exactly the way I
was thinking about it, that's okay.

96
00:04:53,061 --> 00:04:56,137
It's mostly to just sort of get you
thinking about how we're substituting in

97
00:04:56,137 --> 00:04:58,041
different pieces to get
this generalized MDP.

98
00:04:58,041 --> 00:04:58,878
>> All right, I like it.

99
00:04:58,878 --> 00:05:00,010
Okay, go.
