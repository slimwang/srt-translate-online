00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
In that last analysis of grid graphs,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,000
we ended up discovering that the number of edges is 2n - 2√n,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
which is such a terrible function, but the fact of the matter is

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
as these analyses get more and more complicted

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
getting detailed answers like this is more and more cumbersome.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Researchers have worked out a scheme for talking about functions in a much more

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
high level way while still being completely rigorous but without it getting bogged down

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
in all the details, and this is the notion of asymptotic growth.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
You may have heard it described in the form of Big Oh notation,

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
and we're going to get to Big Oh in a moment, but we need to start off with Big Theta.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Θ(g(n)) is actually a set of functions, specifically the set of functions that grow

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
equally quickly as g(n).

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
To be a bit more formal about it, we say that some function f(n) is in the set

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
of functions equally fast growing as g(n),

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
if and only if there are some constants c1 and c2 and some threshold n0

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
such that for any n bigger than n0, we have something that looks like this--

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
the function f(n) for all these values of n--all these big values of n--

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,000
is sandwiched between c1 * g(n) and c2 * g(n).

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
To illustrate this idea with a picture imagine we have some function f(n).

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
It grows. As n gets bigger, f(n) gets bigger.

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
We also have some function g(n) that we can multiply by c1 or we can multiply

22
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
by some bigger number c2.

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
What we find is that once we get out to the right of some threshold n0

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
f(n) is always between c2g(n) and c1g(n).

25
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
In the beginning maybe weird things happen, but once we get out far enough asymptotically

26
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,000
in the limit as things get really big, f(n) lies between c2g(n) and c1g(n).

27
00:01:54,000 --> 99:59:59,999
If that's the case, if such c1, c2, and n0 exist, then we can say that f(n) is in Θ(g(n)).
