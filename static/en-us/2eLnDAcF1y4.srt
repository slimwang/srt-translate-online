00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:02,450
What is a camera or an imaging system?

2
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:05,480
So simple definition is,

3
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:09,860
it's some device that allows the projection of light from three dimensions,

4
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:14,220
three dimensional points, to some medium that will record the light pattern.

5
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:17,560
That medium can be film or it can be a sensor, etc.

6
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:20,320
But actually the key word to all of this is projection.

7
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,260
So here's a projection.

8
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:22,640
Some people walking on a sidewalk.

9
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,070
And there's this globe like thing in the middle.

10
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:28,950
And something that might convince you that something is a little strange might

11
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:32,830
be there's a tiny little guy standing on top of the world this was

12
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:35,680
a pre-clip for the movie Titanic.

13
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:36,270
That was a joke.

14
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:37,030
Tiny little guy.

15
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:38,770
Leonardo DiCaprio's not so big.

16
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:39,690
Okay anyway.

17
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:42,240
What's really in that picture is that.

18
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:46,960
Okay? And the reality is this picture wasn't actually the projection that

19
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:47,810
you thought it was.

20
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:49,130
At least some of you.

21
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:51,820
So you thought maybe it was like this ball thing that

22
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:52,810
you were looking at in an image.

23
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:53,590
And no, actually,

24
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:57,170
it was a flat thing that happened to be projecting into the camera.

25
00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:00,390
And that gives you an idea that when you do projection somehow you're

26
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:02,940
losing information, you're losing three dimensions,

27
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:04,459
a third dimension you go from three to two.

28
00:01:04,459 --> 00:01:07,380
And we have to figure out what went on in that third dimension
