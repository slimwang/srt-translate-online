1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:03,370
So let's talk about differential operators.

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:06,560
Okay, so a differential operator, when applied to an image,

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,750
it returns some derivative, okay.

4
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:13,840
And we're going to model these operators as filters, as masks, as kernels,

5
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:18,260
that are going to compute that image gradient function, all right?

6
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:21,660
And then we're going to threshold this gradient function

7
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:23,840
to select the edge pixels.

8
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,970
All of which brings us to the question, what is a gradient?

9
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:32,729
All right, so, here you gotta go way back in your mind there somewhere, for

10
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:34,960
those of you, and I guess I, I make to little, I mean,

11
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,740
many of you are heavily involved in the, in the, getting your degree, or

12
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:40,990
your courses and you've been taking all these math courses.

13
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:42,920
If so, I apologize for being so pedantic.

14
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:47,660
For those of you who haven't looked at a calculus course in a while, we're

15
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:52,770
going to have to remind you a little bit about multivariate calculus, okay?

16
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:55,370
And multivariate is when you have a function that was a function of

17
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:56,350
more than one variable.

18
00:00:56,350 --> 00:01:00,390
So for example an image is a function f or i of two variables, x and y.

19
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:04,540
And when I have functions that are a function of more than one variable,

20
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:07,440
I can take what's referred to as a partial derivative.

21
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:11,760
The derivative in the x direction, or the derivative in the y direction.

22
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:17,080
And the gradient is the vector that's made up of those derivatives.

23
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,540
So let's take a look at this for images.

24
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:21,710
So I'm going to write this as the gradient of an image.

25
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:24,905
And this is that operator that I'm going to use to show the gradient.

26
00:01:24,905 --> 00:01:28,820
And an image is just a two vector, made up of the partial of f

27
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:32,440
with respect to x, the gradient of the image in the x direction, and

28
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:34,130
the partial of f with respect to y, okay?

29
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:37,675
So here's an image.

30
00:01:37,675 --> 00:01:42,530
And that, you can see in this image, it's only changing in the x direction.

31
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:46,055
So its gradient would be whatever the change is in the x direction and

32
00:01:46,055 --> 00:01:48,150
0 in the y direction.

33
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:51,220
Likewise, here's an image that only changes in the y direction.

34
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:55,180
Now in this case, I'm talking about, I was drawing the arrow in this way.

35
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:59,100
We could either think of y as going, more positive as you go down, we talked

36
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:02,940
about this, or you can just say that this is the direction of the gradient in

37
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:07,120
the sense that in this direction is where it's getting brighter, okay.

38
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:11,060
So in this image my gradient would be 0 partial of f respect to x, but

39
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,650
I would have partial of f respect to y.

40
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:16,080
And normally of course, I have change in both direction and

41
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,410
that's the gradient itself.

42
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:21,160
It's partial of f respect to x and the partial of f respect to y.

43
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:25,170
And it has both a magnitude, how quickly things are getting brighter.

44
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:27,510
And also you can see there's this angle,

45
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:30,640
which is sort of the direction of that gradient.

46
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,750
And the gradient of a function is the direction of

47
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:39,250
most rapid increase in intensity, and the magnitude of that

48
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:44,160
vector is how much it's changing as a function of a unit step in that direction.

49
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,530
Here we're just expressing all of this mathematically.

50
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:49,120
The gradient is given by the two partials.

51
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,720
The direction can be computed by just computing the arc tangent.

52
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,320
That is, the arc tangent of the change in y over the change in x.

53
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:59,310
Computer people amongst you, you should probably use a tan 2.

54
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:01,490
So, that if the partial of f with respect to x is zero,

55
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:03,040
that your machine doesn't explode.

56
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,890
And then we can also talk about the magnitude of the gradient which is

57
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:07,810
just the magnitude of these sums, and

58
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:12,240
that's telling you how rapidly the function is changing.

59
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,820
Which, of course, is clearly going to be related to something to do

60
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:16,720
with edges because remember we said that edges,

61
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,330
we get steep cliffs where things change tremendously, so we're going to look for

62
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:23,660
large magnitudes of gradients when we're finding edges.
