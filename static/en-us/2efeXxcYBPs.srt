00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:04,950
So now, let's look at what loop unrolling gives us. The first benefit it gives

2
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:10,320
us, is that it reduces the overall number of instructions we have to execute.

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,120
We started out with this code. And the overall number of instructions that we

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,670
execute in a thousand iterations that we had of this loop.

5
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:24,290
And the number of instructions that we had to execute in this loop was five

6
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:30,280
instructions in each iteration, times 1,000 iterations of the loop. For

7
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:36,170
a total of 5,000 instructions to do this loop. Now we unroll this loop once and

8
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:41,430
got this. Now the number of instructions is eight times.

9
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:45,140
In each iteration of this loop we are doing the work of two iterations. And

10
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:48,620
we are moving the pointer by two places. So

11
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:52,870
we only have 500 iterations as opposed to 1,000 here.

12
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:59,370
Which gives us only 4,000 instructions to do the loop, instead of 5,000. So

13
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:03,940
we have dramatically reduced the number of instructions it takes to do the loop.

14
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:08,610
And we did it by eliminating what's called the looping overhead. Basically this

15
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:13,290
is the work of the iteration and this is the looping overhead to go to

16
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:18,420
the next iteration. When we do two iterations at time we do twice the work, but

17
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:22,300
the overhead only applies to one of the new iterations. So

18
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:25,950
we get half the overhead per original iteration.

19
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:29,370
Remember the iron law where the execution time. Is the number of

20
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:34,310
instructions times the CPI times the cycle time of the processor.

21
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:38,860
The cycle time will not change. We still have the same processor. The CPI may or

22
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:42,670
may not change but definitely we have reduced the number of instructions. So

23
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:45,870
we can see that loop unrolling just by eliminating the looping

24
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:50,670
overhead can reduce the execution time, but let's look what happens to the CPI.
