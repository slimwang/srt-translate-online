00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:02,780
In this lesson, you learned how to conceptualize and

2
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:07,090
create a complex data model with relationships. you learned the

3
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:10,240
difference between a look-up relationship and a master detail

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,013
relationship. You also learn the difference between a one-to-many and

5
00:00:14,013 --> 00:00:18,020
a many-to-many relationship. Going forward. In the next lesson,

6
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:19,580
we're going to take all of the data we have in

7
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:22,710
our custom schema and create reports to summarize it.

8
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:25,840
Afterwards, we'll create colorful charts to give us real-time snapshot

9
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,950
views of the most interesting aspects of that data. See you next lesson.
