1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:02,000
So this is how I did it.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,700
Inside get I am just using fetch,
in fact,

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:09,940
this whole object here with
method get is totally optional.

4
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:14,100
If there are no options fetch
assumes that you're doing a get, so

5
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:15,850
you can just get rid of it.

6
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:21,138
Here in getJSON, I simply then'd off
the get and then return response.json.

7
00:00:21,138 --> 00:00:25,514
This whole response.json is
specific to the fetch API,

8
00:00:25,514 --> 00:00:28,986
but it's basically
the same as json.pars.

9
00:00:28,986 --> 00:00:33,991
To test I'm getting the json and then
if it's there, I'm adding the query to

10
00:00:33,991 --> 00:00:39,535
the SearchHeader, if it's not I'm adding
unknown and console.log and the error.

11
00:00:39,535 --> 00:00:45,550
Don't let me forget to console.log,
the response.

12
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:47,110
Let's see if it works.

13
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:50,150
So far so good,
I'm seeing earth-like planets.

14
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:51,450
And when I open up the console,

15
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:56,250
I see the response logged out with
the query and some more JSON files.

16
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:59,190
That's pretty cool but
I want to show you one more trick.

17
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:02,160
I just switched out the .catch for
another .then.

18
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,800
I could have left the .catch there,
actually but

19
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,330
I just got out of it to
keep this looking short.

20
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:11,290
Anyway, so from the original .then,
I am returning some results.

21
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:14,540
In fact, this is the first
URL in the search results.

22
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:19,720
Then, in this then, I am taking
the URL and console.logging it.

23
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,910
The cool thing here is
that I've got then and

24
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:26,020
then another then, which means
I'm chaining promises together.

25
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:27,960
So what happens here?

26
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:31,070
Now inside the console,
after the whole search object,

27
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:35,250
I'm seeing the URL of the first
planet in the response.

28
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:38,260
This whole idea of chaining
is incredibly important, and

29
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:39,850
that's what you'll be
doing next in the course.
