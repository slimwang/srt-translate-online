1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:04,820
Here are our solutions. 
This middle graph shows p plus q.

2
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:10,055
The far right one shows p minus q. 
And this furthest left one shows q minus p.

3
00:00:10,055 --> 00:00:14,411
Now, this is quite similar to what we did 
before, except that this time, as we can

4
00:00:14,411 --> 00:00:19,100
see, both of our original lines have non 
zero slope.

5
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:22,750
Adding the lines happens pretty much the 
same way as we did it before.

6
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:25,830
All of these additions and subtractions. 
Cna happen the same way graphically, as

7
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:28,970
we dealt with them before. 
It just feels a little bit more

8
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:32,299
complicated because our have non zero 
slopes.

9
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:34,710
Adding the two line, works just as it did 
before.

10
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:37,365
And we can see that connecting these 
lines gives us, what looks like the

11
00:00:37,365 --> 00:00:40,250
middle graph. 
Because we're adding different length

12
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:43,366
lines to all these different points along 
the graph of q.

13
00:00:43,366 --> 00:00:47,280
We're going to end up with a line whose 
slope is different from either p or q.

14
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,430
Now, of course, I could have done this 
the other way around and drawn lines up

15
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:54,150
to q and added those to p. 
Either way would give us the same result.

16
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:57,618
We can see, however, that switching the 
order of subtraction, changes the graphs

17
00:00:57,618 --> 00:00:58,919
that we get.
