00:00:01,548 --> 00:00:04,407
Here's a state space diagram for
a simple problem.

2
00:00:04,407 --> 00:00:07,294
It involves a room with two locations,

3
00:00:07,294 --> 00:00:10,960
the left we call A and
the right we call B.

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,910
And in that environment there's
a vacuum cleaner, and there may or

5
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:17,623
may not be dirt in either
of the two locations.

6
00:00:17,623 --> 00:00:20,500
And so that gives us eight total states.

7
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:26,283
Dirt is here, or not here, or not, and
the vacuum cleaner is here or here.

8
00:00:26,283 --> 00:00:29,960
So that's 2 times 2 times
2 is 8 possible states.

9
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:33,820
And I've drawn here the states based
diagram with all the transitions for

10
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:35,000
the three possible actions.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,619
And the actions are moving right, so
we'd go from this state to this state.

12
00:00:38,619 --> 00:00:41,309
Moving left,
go from this state to this state.

13
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:44,940
And sucking up dirt we go from this
state to this state, for example.

14
00:00:44,939 --> 00:00:48,579
And in this state space diagram,

15
00:00:48,579 --> 00:00:53,519
if we have a fully deterministic, fully
observable world, it's easy to plan.

16
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,360
Say we start in this state and

17
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:59,850
we want to end up in a goal state
where both sides are clean.

18
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:05,340
We can execute the suck dirt action and
get here, and then move right, and then

19
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:09,850
suck dirt again, and now we end up in
a goal state where everything is clean.

20
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:15,150
Now, suppose our robot vacuum
cleaner's sensors break down.

21
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:19,900
And so, the robot can no longer proceed
neither which location it's in or

22
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:21,670
whether there's any dirt.

23
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:24,680
So we now have an unobservable,
or centralist,

24
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,890
world rather than
a fully observable one.

25
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:29,980
And how does the agent then
represent the state of world?

26
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:33,350
Well, it could be in any
one of these eight states.

27
00:01:33,349 --> 00:01:38,729
And so all we can do to represent
the current state is drop a circle or

28
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:43,760
box around everything, and say,
I know I'm somewhere inside here.

29
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,950
Now, that doesn't seem
like it helped very much.

30
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:49,689
What good is it to know that we
don't really know anything at all?

31
00:01:49,689 --> 00:01:54,469
But the point is that we can search
in the state space of belief states

32
00:01:54,469 --> 00:01:57,590
rather than in the state
space of actual spaces.

33
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:00,990
So we believe that we're in one
of these eight states, and now,

34
00:02:00,989 --> 00:02:04,769
when we execute an action, we're
going to get to another belief state.

35
00:02:04,769 --> 00:02:06,104
Let's take a look at how that works.

36
00:02:06,105 --> 00:02:11,019
