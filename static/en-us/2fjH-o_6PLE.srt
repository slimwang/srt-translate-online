1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:01,769
We can use the power property

2
00:00:01,769 --> 00:00:07,599
to transform the first term we have here, 
3 ln of (x+4)

3
00:00:07,599 --> 00:00:11,851
to become ln of (x+4) cubed.

4
00:00:11,851 --> 00:00:16,018
Note that the cube here applies to the entire input 
of the log.

5
00:00:16,018 --> 00:00:19,184
It goes round the whole expression (x+4).
