1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,510
Now you may have heard of other
types of orders besides just buy and

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:05,590
sell, market and limit.

3
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:10,360
It turns out though that the exchanges
only execute these types of orders.

4
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:12,710
They don't execute those other types.

5
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:13,380
Well, you might wonder,

6
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:16,830
okay, how do those other types
of orders come into being?

7
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:19,950
These other types of orders
are implemented by your broker.

8
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:22,860
The way that works is you
enter this order type and

9
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:26,030
I'll give you a couple
examples in just a second.

10
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:30,330
The broker holds that order and watches
the market until the conditions that you

11
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:33,700
specified are met and
then when those conditions are met,

12
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,790
the broker sends your order
to the market accordingly.

13
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:38,250
So here's some examples.

14
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:43,430
Stop loss is a kind of order
where you say when the stock

15
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:46,030
drops to a certain price,
I want you to sell it.

16
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:47,330
Stop gain.

17
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:50,780
Similarly, when the stock
reaches a certain higher price,

18
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:52,690
I want you to sell it.

19
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:57,460
Trailing stop is a combination
of stop loss but

20
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:02,490
also an automatically changing value for
when that criteria is met.

21
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:06,635
So for instance, you might have
this trailing stop remain say,

22
00:01:06,635 --> 00:01:08,220
$0.10 behind the price.

23
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:12,730
So as the price goes up, the value at
which you would want to sell the stock

24
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:16,260
goes up along with the price,
but when it drops down below.

25
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:18,860
Then that stop loss is triggered.

26
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:24,210
But probably the most important and
most impactful kind of order

27
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:28,100
the brokers implement for
you is something called selling short.

28
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:33,260
What selling short allows you to do is
take a negative position on a stock,

29
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:34,320
in other words,

30
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,910
you sell a stock short if you believe
its price is going to go down.

31
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:42,930
Keep in mind here we're selling
stock we don't even own.

32
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:44,710
So how is that possible?

33
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:48,560
Well, again, it's possible because
the broker facilitates it for you, and

34
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,620
I'll explain how in just a minute.
