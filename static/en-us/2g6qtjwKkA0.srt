Ã¯Â»Â¿Student Chainsaw Riot asks what does it mean to be pythonic?

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:08,525
Wow, Chainsaw Riot. Okay.

3
00:00:08,525 --> 00:00:13,973
So, pythonic is a word that sort of describes the way you would do things in python,

4
00:00:13,973 --> 00:00:16,279
if you were an expert python programmer

5
00:00:16,279 --> 00:00:20,833
and we have mostly not tried to do things in the most pythonic way in this class

6
00:00:20,833 --> 00:00:24,739
because I want to keep the subset of python we use as small as possible.

7
00:00:24,739 --> 00:00:29,002
So many of things weÃ¢ÂÂve done, there are very clever ways to do them in python,

8
00:00:29,002 --> 00:00:31,929
which would take advantage of features we donÃ¢ÂÂt see.

9
00:00:31,929 --> 00:00:35,149
One that comes to mind was a student posted a solution to the Sudoko problem.

10
00:00:35,149 --> 00:00:38,305
That was a fantastic one line solution

11
00:00:38,305 --> 00:00:41,284
that used a few things we hadnÃ¢ÂÂt covered in the class

12
00:00:41,284 --> 00:00:44,105
but if you want to see the pythonic way to solve problems,

13
00:00:44,105 --> 00:00:48,217
I would encourage you definitely to take Peter NorvigÃ¢ÂÂs class, which is CS262.

14
00:00:48,217 --> 00:00:51,816
He is really a master at using python in a very clever way

15
00:00:51,816 --> 00:00:55,933
and finding a way that solves problems that you would think would require

16
00:00:55,933 --> 00:01:01,174
hundreds of lines of code and then both by mostly clever thinking

17
00:01:01,174 --> 00:01:06,142
and clever ways of solving it but also using features of python in the best possible way

18
00:01:06,142 --> 00:01:08,936
finds a way to solve it in two or three lines

19
00:01:08,936 --> 00:01:11,735
and so if youÃ¢ÂÂre getting more experienced as a programmer,

20
00:01:11,735 --> 00:01:14,462
you are going to be finding these very elegant short solutions

21
00:01:14,462 --> 00:01:18,462
that take advantage of more features in the language than we have used in CS101.
