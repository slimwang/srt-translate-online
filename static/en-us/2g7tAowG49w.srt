00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:04,860
In cycle 15, none of the results is broadcast.

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:10,420
But we will be looking at this instruction to commit it and we can commit it. So

3
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:15,890
we will update our processor accordingly. Three goes in R3. The mapping for

4
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:20,800
R3, we check if it's ROB3, yes it is. We make the RAT point do this three,

5
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,060
and we can free this Rob end. The final question of the quiz

6
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:30,340
is when does the last instruction commit. So, what will be in this entry here
