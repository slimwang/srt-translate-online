00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:02,340
When you have a complex project,

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:05,800
it's important to approach it
one small piece at a time.

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:08,870
We don't recommend that you jump
straight into writing meme.

4
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:11,550
It's easier to experiment
if you create a temporary

5
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:14,320
X code project that you
don't plan on keeping.

6
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,490
To learn to pick images, for
example, you might want to create

7
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:20,660
a one button app that picks and
displays a single image,

8
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:24,210
the smallest possible project that will
let you learn what you need to know.

9
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:26,510
Baby steps to the meme generator.

10
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:29,383
So here I've made a simple
project to experiment with, and

11
00:00:29,383 --> 00:00:32,427
since the meme editor has a toolbar
at the bottom of the screen,

12
00:00:32,427 --> 00:00:34,568
I'm going to go ahead and
drag one of those in.

13
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:41,575
And I'll position it and
set its constraints.

14
00:00:46,647 --> 00:00:50,183
The tool bar comes with this button,
but I'm going to go head and

15
00:00:50,183 --> 00:00:51,686
change its label to pick.

16
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:59,698
And you see I've already got an image
view, so you can go head and

17
00:00:59,698 --> 00:01:02,687
drag one of those in and
set its constraints.

18
00:01:02,687 --> 00:01:05,959
Now I'm going to close this
outline view for a minute and

19
00:01:05,959 --> 00:01:10,771
open up the assistant editor, and then
we can add an outlet for our image view.

20
00:01:21,716 --> 00:01:26,954
Now, let's go down to our button, and
we'll add an action for our button.

21
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:31,792
Let's call it pickAnImage.

22
00:01:35,062 --> 00:01:37,900
And that ought to do it for Storyboard.

23
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:40,180
So, we'll focus on our
view controller file.

24
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:43,388
I'm going to get rid of this
extra method for now, and

25
00:01:43,388 --> 00:01:47,639
here in the pick and image method
that we just added, we want to launch

26
00:01:47,639 --> 00:01:51,679
out UI image picker controller,
just like we did in lesson two.

27
00:01:51,679 --> 00:01:56,283
So we add these two lines to present
the image picker and let's run it and

28
00:01:56,283 --> 00:01:57,451
see how it looks.

29
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:01,622
And there we go.

30
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:03,250
We can choose from our outlets.

31
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:06,250
So we're making progress, but

32
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:10,788
when I choose a picture, I can't
really tell that it's being chosen.

33
00:02:10,788 --> 00:02:13,510
We still need to implement
the delegate pattern, and

34
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:17,040
set our view controller as
the delegate of the image picker.

35
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,650
Next step, we'll investigate
the delegate protocol so

36
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:22,850
we'll know what method will be called
when the picker has an image chosen.
