00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Here's a way to define find_second.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
So we're defining a procedure, giving it the name find_second.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,814
It has 2 inputs.

4
00:00:07,814 --> 00:00:10,000
One name for the input would be search and target.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
The names could be anything you want, but it makes sense to give them names

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
that tell us what we're doing.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
And then the first thing we need to do is find the first occurrence.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
So we're going to use search.find, passing in target to find the first occurrence.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
And now we're going to store them in a variable.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
To find the position of the second occurrence we have to do search again,

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
so we're going to call search.find.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
This time we need to have the second input, which is first + 1 to say find the first occurrence

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
after this position.

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
We'll store that in the variable second, and we'll return second,

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
and so that was the implementation that was used in the test.

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
We could make this a little simpler.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,231
One way to make this simpler--we don't need to actually have the variable second.

18
00:00:50,231 --> 00:00:55,662
We could return second right away, and so now we only have 2 lines,

19
00:00:55,662 --> 00:01:01,000
and we'll run the same test just to show that it still works.

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
We could even make it simpler than this.

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,185
We don't even really need the variable first.

22
00:01:05,185 --> 00:01:10,000
We could replace first here with the search to find the first occurrence.

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,662
Then we don't need the variable first.

24
00:01:12,662 --> 00:01:14,000
We only need 1 line.

25
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
It's a good question, which of these is the best?

26
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I think probably the one before this was actually better than this.

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
This is a complicated enough expression that it's hard to read.

28
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
We're separating it into the variable first, and then using first here

29
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
has exactly the same meaning, produces the same result.

30
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
This is a little bit easier to understand what's going on,

31
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
so I think I prefer this version of the procedure.

32
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
But either one certainly is okay, and either one works well.
