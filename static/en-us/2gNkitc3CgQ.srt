1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,776
So why do we need computer architecture? We

2
00:00:02,776 --> 00:00:05,428
need it if we want to improve performance

3
00:00:05,428 --> 00:00:08,704
for some definition of performance, which can be

4
00:00:08,704 --> 00:00:12,136
speed at which the computation is going on, battery

5
00:00:12,136 --> 00:00:15,100
life, the overall size of the computer, its

6
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:19,580
weight, energy efficiency, and so on. So we want

7
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:22,130
one or more of these to become better

8
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:25,426
than before. And another reason why we want computer

9
00:00:25,426 --> 00:00:28,162
architecture is to improve some abilities of

10
00:00:28,162 --> 00:00:31,402
the computer, such as adding 3D graphics support,

11
00:00:31,402 --> 00:00:34,858
adding debugging support so developers can develop more

12
00:00:34,858 --> 00:00:38,860
bug free programs, improving security, et cetera. So

13
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:41,530
this is about making computers faster, smaller,

14
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:44,520
and cheaper. And this is about making new

15
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,872
things possible. We do these by taking improvements

16
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:50,932
in fabrication technology and in circuit designs and

17
00:00:50,932 --> 00:00:55,216
figuring out how to translate that into faster, lighter, cheaper, more

18
00:00:55,216 --> 00:01:00,130
secure, et cetera. So this is where we need computer architecture.
