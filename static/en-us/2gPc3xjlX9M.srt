00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,447
Once again I have updated the graph class. So now it shows the old graph that we

2
00:00:04,447 --> 00:00:09,224
have this original problem, the orange one. And then above that, the new graph

3
00:00:09,224 --> 00:00:14,856
that we have of the equation, y equals negative 7x squared plus 14x. Thinking

4
00:00:14,856 --> 00:00:19,692
back to how we settle the problem at first, we say that we should let the base

5
00:00:19,692 --> 00:00:24,272
of the fountain be situated at the origin. This is why we wanted one of the

6
00:00:24,272 --> 00:00:28,591
roots of our equation to be 0. So you can see that we've got the fountain lined

7
00:00:28,591 --> 00:00:32,937
up right here. This is where the water is spouting out from. Now, my question is

8
00:00:32,937 --> 00:00:36,782
how far from the base of the fountain will the water land? Assume that

9
00:00:36,782 --> 00:00:41,011
everything here is measured in meters. So figure out what point on a curve

10
00:00:41,011 --> 00:00:45,565
corresponds to the place where the water from the fountain hits the ground, and

11
00:00:45,565 --> 00:00:49,400
then, figure out how far away from the base of the fountain that is?
