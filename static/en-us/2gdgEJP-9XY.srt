1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,400
Ok so what the candidate did well,

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:07,700
I think he when I asked about
the model view controller.

3
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:11,350
He got into more details that I
was really expecting that that's

4
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:12,970
perfectly okay.

5
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:17,150
But he did show that he understands
the basic principles of

6
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:21,930
the what are the responsibilities of
the model, the view and the controller.

7
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:24,830
So that's something
that he did quite well.

8
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:27,990
Something that I liked a lot, is that

9
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:33,690
he actually has he follows several
well known blogs or news letters.

10
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:38,420
He is planning to go to a conference,
and most important of all,

11
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:43,500
at least for me, is that he has his
own side project that he's working on.

12
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,552
He's learning things that
are from a different field in iOS

13
00:00:47,552 --> 00:00:50,940
developement development something
that is very specific to games that

14
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:52,410
not everybody is interested.

15
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:53,860
But he's looking to that and

16
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:58,240
finding ways to apply to whatever
application he is writing right now.

17
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:01,020
So that shows that he has
passion he's a total nerd,

18
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:06,950
so that's certainly a plus, that's the
kind of person that we're looking for.

19
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:12,070
What he couldn't prove well
when I asked about core data.

20
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:21,210
I asked about NS managed object and he
talked about NS manage object context.

21
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:25,720
Which is slightly different, so I'm
not sure if he understood my question.

22
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:30,380
Or if it was a clever strategy
to talk about something else and

23
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:32,650
hide that maybe you don't know that so
well.

24
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:36,610
If it is the latter,

25
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:42,330
I wouldn't worry too much about this,
it's a junior position,

26
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:47,880
so I'm not expecting him to know
everything about iOS development.

27
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:51,290
Maybe his knowledge of core
data is not as sound and

28
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:54,840
solid as it should, but that's workable.

29
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:59,080
That's something that you
can work on and you can fix.

30
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:04,190
But I believe that whatever code he
brings to our code base, should work.

31
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:08,080
It shouldn't break things and
it should be a useful contribution.
