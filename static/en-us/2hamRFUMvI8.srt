1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:02,674
So one very popular approach would be to

2
00:00:02,674 --> 00:00:06,192
combine the magnetic disks with Flash. The magnetic

3
00:00:06,192 --> 00:00:08,784
disk is very cheap per gigabyte compared to

4
00:00:08,784 --> 00:00:12,700
flash. We know how to build huge capacity magnetic

5
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:15,610
disks in a relatively small package, but it's

6
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:19,910
very power hungry. It spends and consumes power

7
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:22,830
even when not accessing data. And it's very

8
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:25,850
slow because it has to mechanically move things around

9
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:29,496
in order to access data. And another disadvantage of

10
00:00:29,496 --> 00:00:32,646
magnetic disks is that they are sensitive to impact.

11
00:00:32,646 --> 00:00:34,851
Like if they fall down and hit the ground,

12
00:00:34,851 --> 00:00:38,127
while they are spinning, because their heads are then likely

13
00:00:38,127 --> 00:00:40,773
to scratch the surface of the disk and permanently

14
00:00:40,773 --> 00:00:43,545
damage the whole track possibly, and maybe the head

15
00:00:43,545 --> 00:00:47,592
itself. Flash on the other hand, is fast, power

16
00:00:47,592 --> 00:00:50,870
efficient, and has no moving parts. So if it falls

17
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:57,140
down, it might get damaged, but it's very unlikely. So the idea is to have both

18
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:03,050
of them, and use the flash effectively as a cache for the disk. That way most

19
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:08,760
of the data is on the disk, but the data we're frequently accessing is on the

20
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:12,370
flash where it's fast, it can be accessed

21
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:16,180
without moving parts, and it can be accessed

22
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:19,774
very efficiently. Now of course the disk would still

23
00:01:19,774 --> 00:01:22,972
be spinning if we occasionally access it, but if

24
00:01:22,972 --> 00:01:25,546
we have enough flash to access data in it

25
00:01:25,546 --> 00:01:28,354
for even minutes at a time, we can actually

26
00:01:28,354 --> 00:01:31,006
power down the disk and spin it down, and

27
00:01:31,006 --> 00:01:33,658
only really access it once we have a flash

28
00:01:33,658 --> 00:01:37,816
miss. And because both of these can keep their

29
00:01:37,816 --> 00:01:41,864
data without power, if we turn off power suddenly,

30
00:01:41,864 --> 00:01:45,360
the data in the flash will still survive, and

31
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,813
so will the data on the disk. Unlike for

32
00:01:48,813 --> 00:01:51,091
example, if we use a magnetic disk with a

33
00:01:51,091 --> 00:01:54,080
DRAM cache to keep the most recently accessed data.
