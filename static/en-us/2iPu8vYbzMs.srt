1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,424
We know that this distance here is this distance on the number line. So if we

2
00:00:04,424 --> 00:00:08,288
go all the way to x2 and subtract off x1, we'll be left with the part in

3
00:00:08,288 --> 00:00:14,026
between them. For the vertical distance this part we want to look at the y

4
00:00:14,026 --> 00:00:19,280
values. We start at y1 and then we climb all the way up to y2. So if we want to

5
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:24,155
find this vertical distance, we really want to find this vertical distance on

6
00:00:24,155 --> 00:00:31,676
the number line. So, we'll go all the way up to y2, and we'll subtract off y1.

7
00:00:31,676 --> 00:00:37,298
This will leave us with just this distance here. So, this is how we know that

8
00:00:37,298 --> 00:00:42,034
the horizontal distance is x2 minus x1, and the vertical distance is y2 minus

9
00:00:42,034 --> 00:00:43,852
y1.
