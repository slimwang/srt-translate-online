1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
This looks like a pretty harmless differential equation.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:11,000
We want the derivative of x with respect to time to be exrep as 1/2 and the initial value--

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
you know we have to specify the initial value to get one single solution and the initial value should be 3.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Implement the forward Euler's method for that differential equation and then experiment

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:32,000
what setting the ends time of that simulation, try to find out what the time of explosion

6
00:00:32,000 --> 99:59:59,999
of that solution is and use that in here with two decimal places as you submit the solution.
