00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:01,230
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:04,990
I hope you were able to get your support vector classifier working, but

3
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:07,840
in case you need a little nudge, let me show you what I did.

4
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:08,990
So, starting from the starter code,

5
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:11,150
there's only actually two lines of code that I need to add.

6
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:14,390
The first one is that I have to fit my classifier, and

7
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:15,990
I have to fit it on the training table.

8
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:18,400
The first one is that I have to fit my classifier, and

9
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,430
I have to fit it on the training data, so

10
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:24,920
that means passing features_train, and labels_train to my fit function.

11
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:28,040
Then, the second thing is making a list of predictions.

12
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:31,050
So, I store to a list named pred, and that's just

13
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:35,390
the familiar predict function that we've seen with the Naive Bayes classifier.

14
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:37,190
Remember, when you're making predictions,

15
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:40,850
you're only going to be passing one set of information, now, the features.

16
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:43,740
Because the labels are what you're trying to predict.

17
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:44,610
And also, of course,

18
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:47,480
you want to do it on the test dataset, not on the training dataset.

19
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:50,890
So, with two lines like this you should be able to get your SVM up and running.
