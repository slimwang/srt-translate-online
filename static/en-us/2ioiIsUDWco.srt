Changing DOM element CSS classes is super useful.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:09,500
And likewise, sometimes you want to change attributes on DOM elements as well.

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:13,200
Take a look at this unordered list in the header at the top of the page.

4
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:18,390
Each of the list elements has an embedded a tag.

5
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:22,840
You can see that the first element at the top of the list is missing its href.

6
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:27,632
I want you to use jQuery to set its href to number 1 to match the hrefs of

7
00:00:27,632 --> 00:00:30,740
the other elements in this list.

8
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:34,785
You'll be using the .attr method to add an href.

9
00:00:34,785 --> 00:00:40,040
.attr is interesting in that it has two different method signatures.

10
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,230
With the first signature,

11
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:45,362
if you pass in the string of an attribute, you can get its value.

12
00:00:45,362 --> 00:00:49,890
And with the other, you can set the value of an attribute by passing in

13
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:51,300
a string for the second parameter.

14
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,668
This is a common pattern for

15
00:00:53,668 --> 00:00:56,438
methods that interact with data saved on a DOM element.

16
00:00:56,438 --> 00:01:04,164
So, using .attr, can you change the href of this a tag to be equal to number 1?

17
00:01:04,164 --> 00:01:05,250
Here's a hint.

18
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:08,590
You might need another method like .first to help out.
