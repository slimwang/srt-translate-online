00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,080
Welcome back. The goal of this course is to get you to level

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:04,970
up from an already awesome developer

3
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:07,750
to an even awesomer design minded developer.

4
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:10,750
>> Exactly. So let's start by reviewing what you learned

5
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:13,540
in Lesson 1. The first thing we learned in Lesson 1

6
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:17,500
was, we defined UX and disambiguated it from UI. Then

7
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:21,020
we gave you an awesome visceral example of great user experience.

8
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:22,650
>> I love that visceral example.

9
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:25,650
>> And we also use two examples of a sign

10
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:29,540
in form and a checkout form to illustrate why it's bad to

11
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:31,660
start with detail first thinking. It

12
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:34,960
basically causes you to only optimize locally.

13
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,310
>> Yeah, exactly. You end up creating some really awesome

14
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:42,010
forms, but the overall application might suffer, and if you zoom

15
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:45,700
out you actually get an idea what the application should do.

16
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:47,780
And then you might decide you don't even need those ones.

17
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:50,750
>> Exactly and then we also learned a technique called LO RES

18
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:53,560
wire framing, which helps you think about your application as a

19
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:56,050
series of steps that your user needs to go through to

20
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:58,850
accomplish a certain task. So now that we know that we're

21
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:01,420
supposed to think in this way, where do we go from here?

22
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:04,257
What do we do next? So in Lesson 1 we are

23
00:01:04,257 --> 00:01:07,960
really focusing on the smart phone. But now we're going to start

24
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:10,920
focusing on the person. So we need to ask ourselves, who

25
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:14,060
is our end user? Or who are we making this application for?

26
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:16,020
>> So Isabel, how do we focus on the user?

27
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:18,230
>> And that's a great question. And the answers all lie

28
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:21,030
ahead in Lesson 2, where we're going to talk all about how

29
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:24,150
to design for our end user. Before we get started, let's

30
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:26,775
go over a quick overview of what you're going to learn in Lesson

31
00:01:26,775 --> 00:01:30,140
2. We're going to discuss two things. The first is how to

32
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:34,140
design applications for a specific type of user, or a persona,

33
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:37,800
and their use cases. The second thing is, how to build

34
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:41,090
a feature list that's tailored for your persona and your use case

35
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:43,690
to make sure that your application will really delight your user.

36
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:46,970
>> Sounds great, Isabelle. Let's get started
