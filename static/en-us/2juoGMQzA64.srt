Hello and welcome to lesson Two of the programming in Java Course. We're

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:09,330
going to start a discussion with objects to understand why you might want to

3
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:14,060
know about objects. consider someone that is building a house. It used to be in

4
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:19,370
the olden days that a house was built from nothing but bricks and wood.

5
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:24,370
Nowadays, of course, a builder takes prefabricated components such as this

6
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:29,930
furnace or this water heater and puts them together. You can think of those as

7
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:35,500
the analogue of what an object would be in a programming language. An object is

8
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:39,520
a building block of a program. It is a component with some desired

9
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:44,150
functionality. Just as the water heater over here has some desired

10
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:48,610
functionality for the builder it heats water. In your programs you ask objects

11
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:53,690
to do work. You don't know how they do that and that's okay. Just like if you

12
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:58,190
really think about it do you actually know how a water heater does it's job? Or

13
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:01,810
for that matter, do you care? Here we have a different kind of water heater, a

14
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:06,020
solar water heater and it doesn't really matter how a water heater works as

15
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:10,090
long as it heats water. With an object what's important what it does, not how

16
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:13,700
it does it. That's all very abstract, and, the way one really learns about

17
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:17,508
objects, is to play with them. And I'll show you how you can play with some in

18
00:01:17,508 --> 00:01:18,268
BlueJ.
