Thanks, Rado.

00:00:01,370 --> 00:00:04,740
Now that we know the distinct
advantages of using a list view,

3
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:08,750
we can use a list view to display the list
of weather forecasts in our app.

4
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:13,140
Now which file in the layout folder
should we modify to accomplish this?

5
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:16,530
Well, we want to add the list view
directly to the fragment.

6
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:19,670
If you open up the fragment_main.xml file,

7
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:22,670
you'll notice that the layout includes
a RelativeLayout as a parent view,

8
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:25,096
as well as a child TextView.

9
00:00:25,096 --> 00:00:28,692
Modify this file so that we show
a ListView instead of a TextView

10
00:00:28,692 --> 00:00:33,840
and assign it an ID ListViewForecast
so we can reference it later.

11
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,010
Also, since this layout only contains
one child's view,

12
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:39,840
it would be more efficient
to actually switch to a FrameLayout

13
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,940
instead of a RelativeLayout.

14
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:45,020
After you make the changes,
compile and run your app.

15
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:49,200
You will be a little bit underwhelmed
with the blank screen, but that's okay.

16
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,030
That's because we haven't populated
the list view with data yet,

17
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:53,929
and that will come in a later step.

18
00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:55,559
Check the box when you're done.
