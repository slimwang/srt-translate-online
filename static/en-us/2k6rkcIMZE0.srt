1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:01,490
Okay, Michael, you ready?

2
00:00:01,490 --> 00:00:02,360
>> Yeah.

3
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:04,100
>> Alright, what's the answer?

4
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:07,110
>> So I was thinking about A before you threw in the B. So let me,

5
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:11,010
let me not think about B yet. I'll just think about A. So you had said

6
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:14,190
in state one, it can go either left or right. And in state four, it can

7
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:15,730
go either left or right. So boy, that

8
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:17,880
sounds a lot like two times two equals four.

9
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,830
>> Yes that's exactly right. But generally speaking, so actually walk

10
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:23,150
me through that again Michael. How did you get two times two?

11
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:25,360
>> So, well I, I had a little choice about how

12
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:28,770
to think about it. One is that in some sense, if you

13
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:33,000
go right from one, then you don't really have to make another choice.

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:33,500
>> Right.

15
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,670
>> But if you go left, then you have this other choice

16
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:40,410
to make of either left or right. So it's, you if, if

17
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:43,150
you're just writing it down as a mapping from state to action,

18
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:46,830
you've got two choices at state one, and two choices at state four.

19
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:47,380
>> Mmhmm.

20
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:50,310
>> And so that is two times two, right?

21
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:51,910
You can make, independently choose each of those.

22
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:53,790
>> Right, that's exactly right. So in

23
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:55,450
fact it's important there that even though

24
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:59,720
if I can gone right on one, I would never, have to make another choice

25
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:02,880
because I can't reach state four. In order to be a strategy, you have

26
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:06,800
to basically say what you would do, in all states where you might end up.

27
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,010
>> Okay, that's fair.

28
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:10,990
>> Okay, alright so what about B, using that incredible reasoning?

29
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:15,320
>> [LAUGH] So yeah, so B seems a little trickier because

30
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:20,320
here it can only ever matter whether you're in like if

31
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,450
player A sends us down to the left then we have a

32
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:25,670
choice of three. If player one sends us down the right, we

33
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:28,060
have a choice of one, which is really no choice at all.

34
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:28,710
>> Mmhmm.

35
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:31,060
>> You can have any color car you want as long as it's black.

36
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:32,500
>> Yeah, like my Tesla.

37
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:35,190
>> I was thinking the Model T, but maybe T stands for Tesla.

38
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:36,670
>> T does stand for Tesla.

39
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:38,760
>> So, by the definition of how

40
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,850
many different you know, sort of reachable strategies

41
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:42,840
it would be one answer but, if you're defining it the

42
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,550
way you're defining it, it's going to be three times one or, three.

43
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:49,610
>> Yeah. And that's exactly right. Good Michael.

44
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:52,230
So, let's actually write down what those strategies are.
