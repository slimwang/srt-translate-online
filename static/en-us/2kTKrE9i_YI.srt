00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,320
The domain of f of x equals 4x squared plus 6x is negative infinity to infinity.

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:10,360
In other words, we can plug in any real number, literally any real number, in

3
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:15,276
place of x, in this function, and we'll get a valid value for f of x. Another

4
00:00:15,276 --> 00:00:19,836
way we could express this interval is to say that the domain of f of x is all

5
00:00:19,836 --> 00:00:25,285
the real numbers. Remember that whenever we write an infinity sign, whether it

6
00:00:25,285 --> 00:00:29,429
negative or positive, we need to have an open parenthesis.
