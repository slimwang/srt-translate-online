1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:01,650
Good question.

2
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:04,210
I would have to say my
favorite food is pancakes.

3
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:05,389
How about you, Tommy?

4
00:00:05,389 --> 00:00:07,253
[SOUND].

5
00:00:07,253 --> 00:00:08,752
I really like cheese too.

6
00:00:08,752 --> 00:00:11,260
You know where they have
really good cheese?

7
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:12,900
The fridge at Udacity.

8
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:14,670
Don't worry, I can sneak you some later.

9
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:15,777
>> Catherine where have you been?

10
00:00:15,777 --> 00:00:17,280
I've been looking for you all day.

11
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,250
>> Sorry I was just talking
with my new best friend Tommy,

12
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:21,980
we have a lot in common.

13
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:25,494
>> Okay that's great but Sue and I
are ready to get started on lesson four.

14
00:00:25,494 --> 00:00:31,070
>> Yeah we still have to finish the app
sorry, what are we doing again?

15
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:33,620
>> In the previous lesson we
learned about content providers and

16
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:35,850
now we're getting ready
to start using them.

17
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:38,990
This lesson we're going to focus on
using CursorLoaders to load data from

18
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:42,180
the database on a background thread,
and this will keep our app responsive.

19
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,720
>> That kind of sounds hard.

20
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,310
>> Well, it won't be too bad.

21
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:49,960
Loaders remember Chris and Joe covered
them back with quick report app.

22
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:53,440
>> Yeah, so the student already
knows then that's fine.

23
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,824
>> Yep, and we'll also be covering
CursorAdapters to display results

24
00:00:56,824 --> 00:00:58,470
from a cursor into the list view.

25
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:02,130
And this will give us a properly
formatted list of pets.

26
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:06,040
>> Okay good that catalog activity
was a real eye sore to look at.

27
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:08,580
>> What Catherine I
thought you liked it?

28
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:12,720
Well we'll also use CursorLoaders in the
editor activity and so for an existing

29
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,100
pet we can load their details from
the database directly onto the UI.

30
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:18,518
>> So then you can update the pet and
then save it in the database?

31
00:01:18,518 --> 00:01:19,119
>> Mm-hm exactly.

32
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:19,790
>> Okay.

33
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:22,760
>> And lastly we'll figure
out how to delete a pet.

34
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,840
>> Nice, so then all of the features
of the app will be done?

35
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,060
>> Yep, that is the goal.

36
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:26,700
We have a lot to do.

37
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:27,730
Let's get started.

38
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:30,070
>> But I want to finish my coffee first.

39
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:30,570
>> Katherine.
