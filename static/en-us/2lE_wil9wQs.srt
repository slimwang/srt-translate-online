00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,670
Welcome to our fictional
company Twisted Threads.

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:06,840
Twisted Threads ships
cotton t-shirts on demand.

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:10,210
The founder started the company ten
years ago from her basement, but

4
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:13,560
it has since expanded
to over 200 employees.

5
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:19,970
There is a warehouse, several physical
stores, and an e-commerce site.

6
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:24,150
Customers love the high quality
materials and custom designs.

7
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:25,610
That's the good news.

8
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:27,065
Now for the bad news.

9
00:00:27,065 --> 00:00:31,446
[SOUND] Twisted Threads has a homegrown
inventory system separate for

10
00:00:31,446 --> 00:00:33,949
each physical shop and the warehouse.

11
00:00:33,949 --> 00:00:37,979
The demand varies per season in both
the quantity of t-shirts ordered and

12
00:00:37,979 --> 00:00:40,870
the type of items that customers want.

13
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:44,810
Because of this, the company has
supply and inventory issues.

14
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:46,890
Sometimes the company
runs out of stock and

15
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:50,305
customer order fulfillment is
delayed by a week or more.

16
00:00:50,305 --> 00:00:51,923
[SOUND] At other times,

17
00:00:51,923 --> 00:00:57,046
Twisted Threads has ordered way too
many T-shirts from its supplier.

18
00:00:57,046 --> 00:01:00,559
They have had to throw out
merchandise to make room for

19
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:02,445
newer more popular styles.

20
00:01:02,445 --> 00:01:07,193
Twisted Threads hosted servers for their
Internet shop in-house, but there was

21
00:01:07,193 --> 00:01:11,645
massive flooding in the city and their
servers were damaged beyond repair.

22
00:01:11,645 --> 00:01:14,777
[SOUND] They decided
to move to the cloud.

23
00:01:14,777 --> 00:01:18,833
Since making this decision, there have
been major issues with performance and

24
00:01:18,833 --> 00:01:20,470
cost on the cloud.

25
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:23,380
Customers complain about
the website being buggy.

26
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:27,300
The site has gone down several times
during periods of high traffic

27
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:28,425
like the holiday season.

28
00:01:28,425 --> 00:01:31,787
[SOUND] The product team
wants more features, but

29
00:01:31,787 --> 00:01:35,077
the rollout of new features
is painfully slow.

30
00:01:35,077 --> 00:01:38,409
The competition just launched
personalization on their site,

31
00:01:38,409 --> 00:01:41,140
which was a huge hit with customers.

32
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:44,770
Twisted Threads is falling behind
because their website is outdated.

33
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:49,540
Developers are unhappy because
deployment of new features

34
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:53,840
takes ages and operations does
not give them new servers.

35
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:58,760
Operations is too overwhelmed with
running the cloud in general and

36
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:01,710
worry about what will happen if
the cloud data center burns down.

37
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:02,210
