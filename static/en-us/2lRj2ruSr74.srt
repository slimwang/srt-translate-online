00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,140
Let's discuss something that it often jokingly called Lhadma's

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:07,400
Law. This is really Amdahl spelled in reverse. And, it

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:11,170
says, that although Amdahl's Law pretty much tells us to

4
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:14,635
make the common case fast. We should not mess up

5
00:00:14,635 --> 00:00:17,930
the uncommon case too badly while doing that. Let's

6
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:20,770
consider an example, in which we can achieve an improvement

7
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:23,460
of a factor of 2, or 90% of the execution

8
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:25,130
time. So, we can achieve a speed up of 2,

9
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:31,330
or 90% of the execution time. But at the cost of slowing down the rest by 10x.

10
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:37,100
Meaning the remaining 10% now gets 10 times as much execution time as before.

11
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:41,130
The overall speed up can be now expressed

12
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:43,890
as, both of these are affected by different

13
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:50,148
so called improvements. We have one of them, the 10%, is effected by a speed up

14
00:00:50,148 --> 00:00:55,400
of 0.1 because this is a 10 times slow down, this is a slow down

15
00:00:55,400 --> 00:01:00,289
of 0.1. And the other the 90% are

16
00:01:00,289 --> 00:01:05,476
sped up by a factor of 2 and we get 1 over 1 plus

17
00:01:05,476 --> 00:01:11,180
0.45 equal 0.7. So we actually got an overall slowdown.

18
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:15,970
In fact even with an infinite improvement on 90%, this will

19
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:18,754
become 0. We will still have a speed of

20
00:01:18,754 --> 00:01:23,478
1, meaning no improvement. So basically, if you have

21
00:01:23,478 --> 00:01:25,686
a huge worsening on even a small part of

22
00:01:25,686 --> 00:01:29,210
the execution time, the overall speedup will not be good.
