1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,120
So here we are in the heart of Silicon Valley at Google.

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,620
Machine learning is all over Silicon Valley.

3
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:09,140
>> Yeah, here at Google we're using machinery for, obviously for search, for

4
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:12,950
ranking the little pages that you going to see, for speech recognition, for

5
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:17,770
language translation and of course, for self driving cars.

6
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:20,880
>> One of my favorite examples is a little bit more trivial than that, but

7
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,394
I think it's really fun.

8
00:00:22,394 --> 00:00:25,362
There is a company in Silicon valley that I actually tell it what clothes I

9
00:00:25,362 --> 00:00:27,601
like, and then it'll figure out what my tastes are and

10
00:00:27,601 --> 00:00:30,394
it'll sell me new clothes so I don't ever have to go shopping gain.

11
00:00:30,394 --> 00:00:31,459
>> It is a machine learning algorithm?

12
00:00:31,459 --> 00:00:33,350
>> It is a machine learning algorithm.

13
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:34,005
It is. >> So how did you have to train it?

14
00:00:34,005 --> 00:00:36,067
>> It's really good, I didn't have to train it that long.

15
00:00:36,067 --> 00:00:37,977
>> Wow. So is there a 10% bonuses?

16
00:00:37,977 --> 00:00:39,574
>> I think, there probably, there should be, right?

17
00:00:39,574 --> 00:00:40,794
>> [LAUGH] Here we go.

18
00:00:40,794 --> 00:00:44,420
So machine learning reallyâ€¦ age of big data, yeah?

19
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:47,620
And, there is no company within a 10 mile radius that wouldn't use big data,

20
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:50,490
including Udacity, to optimize its products.

21
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:52,220
>> So, that's what we'll be learning about in this class,

22
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:54,360
there's all kinds of interesting examples here.

23
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:58,350
And, we'll go in great depth into a few questions in this class, but you should

24
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:01,060
always be thinking about interesting problems that you'd like to solve, and

25
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:02,550
how machine learning can help you out there.

26
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:04,500
>> And look, if you do a great job.

27
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,550
We do our best to find you a job here in Silicon Valley.
