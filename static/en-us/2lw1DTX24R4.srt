1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,620
Adding every item to the Linear Layout
within the Scroll View,

2
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:05,900
means that every view we create
sticks around, taking up memory,

3
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:07,686
even if it's never been seen.

4
00:00:07,686 --> 00:00:10,752
We want to try and create a way,
that we only need to use,

5
00:00:10,752 --> 00:00:14,990
as many views as are currently visible
in the screen plus one on either end,

6
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:17,230
to make sure we can scroll
without flickering.

7
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:19,072
To do that, Android uses ListView.

8
00:00:19,072 --> 00:00:21,182
So let's take a closer look at that now.
