00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,788
If you to take a box or a spherical clock hand from their previous exercisers

2
00:00:03,788 --> 00:00:07,609
and position it and rotate it, you'll get it something like this. [unknown] is

3
00:00:07,609 --> 00:00:11,806
doing the standard rotate then translate in a series of operations. The hands

4
00:00:11,806 --> 00:00:15,625
are rotated to the proper angles but the translations don't move that much along

5
00:00:15,625 --> 00:00:19,542
their axis but rather move them in world space. In this exercise, you are going

6
00:00:19,542 --> 00:00:23,492
to make proper clock hands. The positions and scales in the exercise are all

7
00:00:23,492 --> 00:00:27,069
correct. You shouldn't need to change those. You need to figure out how to

8
00:00:27,069 --> 00:00:32,080
rotate the hands so they are properly oriented. When you're done, you should see

9
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:33,303
the hands as shown here.
