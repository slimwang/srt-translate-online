00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,689
Grant has convinced Athena to help him out with some of the the Gleaming

2
00:00:02,689 --> 00:00:07,100
Glasses business stuff. He's given her yet another new equation, that he says

3
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:10,748
is going to describe the profit the company will make, if he invests x

4
00:00:10,748 --> 00:00:17,780
thousands of dollars in advertising. So we have P of x equals x cubed minus 20

5
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:23,660
x squared plus 118 x minus 164. Grant wants to figure out how much money he

6
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:26,604
needs to spend on advertising to make some sort of profit, but he also wants to

7
00:00:26,604 --> 00:00:29,456
avoid spending too much money, so much that it would drain all of his profit

8
00:00:29,456 --> 00:00:35,798
away. In other words, Athena needs to figure out, for what values of x does

9
00:00:35,798 --> 00:00:41,305
this equation P of x equals 0. In other words, Athena is looking for routes of

10
00:00:41,305 --> 00:00:45,402
this function. We're not quite ready to help her answer this question yet

11
00:00:45,402 --> 00:00:50,720
though. Let's backtrack for a second. First off, can you tell me what the

12
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:55,380
minimum number of real zeros this function has to have is? Think critically

13
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:57,863
about what kind of polynomial this is.
