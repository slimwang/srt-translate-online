00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,503
So, the first thing we do, is grab the body dom object using

2
00:00:04,515 --> 00:00:11,697
document.getElementById, with an id of body, and we create a div object, as well

3
00:00:11,697 --> 00:00:16,114
as a canvas object, and set their id's appropriately to div.id = "gameContent"

4
00:00:16,114 --> 00:00:24,687
and canvas.id = "gameCanvas" and finally, we append the div object to the body

5
00:00:24,687 --> 00:00:28,448
and the canvas object to the div. If we open this up into our browser, we can

6
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:34,568
see that we have indeed created a div element and inside that is our new canvas

7
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:36,998
element and both with a proper id.
