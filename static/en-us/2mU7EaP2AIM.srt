1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,500
Good imagery makes us form
a connection to the subject,

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:06,180
sympathizing with their joy,
pain, or delight.

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:07,380
Though only visual,

4
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:11,540
a good image might even make us
recall a familiar smell or sound.

5
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:15,270
Migrant Mother by Dorothea Lange
is the iconic representation of

6
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:17,791
the Great Depression
in the United States.

7
00:00:17,791 --> 00:00:22,273
In it, we see a mother with a steely
gaze into the future unsure of the end

8
00:00:22,273 --> 00:00:23,781
of her current crisis.

9
00:00:23,781 --> 00:00:27,939
It put a face and a feeling to what
migrant workers were experiencing during

10
00:00:27,939 --> 00:00:29,261
the Great Depression.

11
00:00:29,261 --> 00:00:33,984
Afghan Girl by Steve McCurry appeared
on the cover of National Geographic in

12
00:00:33,984 --> 00:00:35,031
June 1985.

13
00:00:35,031 --> 00:00:38,746
It's one of these most recognizable
magazine covers ever, and

14
00:00:38,746 --> 00:00:42,066
has become a symbol of the status
of refugees worldwide.

15
00:00:42,066 --> 00:00:46,989
So, what do these two moving photographs
have to do with Android design?

16
00:00:46,989 --> 00:00:48,150
A lot.

17
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:51,890
Though they come from different eras,
both tell an immersive and

18
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:54,686
compelling story and
can connect emotionally.

19
00:00:54,686 --> 00:00:57,960
Neither feels like stop imagery or
clip-art.

20
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:02,600
While every photo or illustration you
use need not be Pulitzer Prize quality,

21
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,850
you should seek to select imagery
that is relevant to the user,

22
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:08,270
provides contextual information,
or delights them.
