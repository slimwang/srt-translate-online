1
00:00:00,412 --> 00:00:02,913
[NOISE] This is the Earth.

2
00:00:02,914 --> 00:00:04,713
Okay, lesson over.

3
00:00:04,713 --> 00:00:07,047
Just kidding.

4
00:00:07,046 --> 00:00:10,487
You're going to render your own
map in your site in just a moment.

5
00:00:10,487 --> 00:00:13,637
Google Maps are made up of lots
of different types of data.

6
00:00:13,637 --> 00:00:17,865
Imagery, road networks,
points of interest, more things.

7
00:00:17,865 --> 00:00:20,961
You'll use pieces and
combinations of that data,

8
00:00:20,961 --> 00:00:23,559
to build a user experience
that has value.

9
00:00:23,559 --> 00:00:28,048
When you render a map, you can control
what type of information you get.

10
00:00:28,048 --> 00:00:31,992
One of the most basic things you can
control when you render your map,

11
00:00:31,992 --> 00:00:32,952
is the map type.

12
00:00:32,953 --> 00:00:35,429
We have four preconfigured map types.

13
00:00:35,429 --> 00:00:38,256
You're probably most
familiar with the road map,

14
00:00:38,256 --> 00:00:41,484
map type which you've seen as
the default in Google Maps.

15
00:00:41,484 --> 00:00:45,315
We also have satellite if you
want real images of the world, or

16
00:00:45,314 --> 00:00:50,192
hybrid in which we overlay features such
as roads on top of satellite imagery.

17
00:00:50,192 --> 00:00:54,067
And finally, we have terrain,
which emphasises shaded relief and

18
00:00:54,067 --> 00:00:56,317
other physical terrain information.

19
00:00:56,317 --> 00:00:59,037
Now that you understand
what you're seeing,

20
00:00:59,037 --> 00:01:01,139
let's load the map into your site.

21
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:04,131
I'm starting off with
just a basic HTML site.

22
00:01:04,131 --> 00:01:05,971
It’s blank right now.

23
00:01:05,971 --> 00:01:10,307
You can load a Google Map into your
site simply by adding three things into

24
00:01:10,307 --> 00:01:11,028
your code.

25
00:01:11,028 --> 00:01:16,126
The first is a script line into
your HTML to load the API.

26
00:01:16,126 --> 00:01:19,853
This loads the JavaScript definitions
when the page starts loading in

27
00:01:19,852 --> 00:01:20,616
the browser.

28
00:01:20,617 --> 00:01:24,353
We're loading the Java Script here
asynchronously which means that the rest

29
00:01:24,353 --> 00:01:27,054
of the page will render while
the Java Script API loads,

30
00:01:27,054 --> 00:01:30,637
and then our call back function will
execute when the API is done loading.

31
00:01:30,637 --> 00:01:33,956
If you're not immediately
using the API's functionality,

32
00:01:33,956 --> 00:01:36,826
you can put the same instruction
inside a function and

33
00:01:36,825 --> 00:01:38,760
call it only when you plan to use it.

34
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:43,006
Loading the API asynchronously gives you
more speed as it lets your page load

35
00:01:43,006 --> 00:01:45,471
without having to wait for
the JavaScript.

36
00:01:45,471 --> 00:01:50,783
Maps.Googleapis.com is the endpoint
that we're loading the JavaScript from.

37
00:01:50,783 --> 00:01:53,742
The parameter v=3 indicates
that we're calling

38
00:01:53,742 --> 00:01:57,466
version three of the api which is
the version that we want to use.

39
00:01:57,466 --> 00:02:01,611
Next, you must include the API
key that you just created.

40
00:02:01,611 --> 00:02:03,234
Use the key perimeter and

41
00:02:03,234 --> 00:02:07,643
simply paste in the browser key
that you generated in your project.

42
00:02:07,643 --> 00:02:11,764
Alternatively, you can use the client
ID if you're a Max API Premium Plan

43
00:02:11,764 --> 00:02:12,439
customer.

44
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:15,165
We’ll learn more about
that later in the course.

45
00:02:15,165 --> 00:02:19,850
The next thing that you need is
a div element in your html body

46
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:21,919
with the ID of map, easy.

47
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:26,238
I'm also adding some css to specify
that I want our map to be 100 percent of

48
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:27,599
the height of the page.

49
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:30,604
Finally, we'll need
some more JavaScript,

50
00:02:30,604 --> 00:02:35,240
a map variable and an initialized
JavaScript function to load the map.

51
00:02:35,241 --> 00:02:38,576
Something to note, I'm putting all of
this in one file, but you can also

52
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:41,649
separate out your JavaScript into
a separate file to keep it neat.

53
00:02:41,649 --> 00:02:45,182
This initialize function will contain
everything that will happen after

54
00:02:45,182 --> 00:02:48,099
the page loads, but
before the user interacts with the map.

55
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:52,260
For now,
its only job is to make a map appear.

56
00:02:52,259 --> 00:02:54,693
We're creating a new map instance here.

57
00:02:54,693 --> 00:02:59,861
And we must specify two things, where in
the HTML to load the map, which is going

58
00:02:59,861 --> 00:03:04,354
to be that map div that we created,
and what part of the world to show.

59
00:03:04,354 --> 00:03:06,111
We have to give it a center and

60
00:03:06,111 --> 00:03:10,233
a zoom value so it knows what imagery
to show and in how much detail.

61
00:03:10,234 --> 00:03:11,893
The center is a latitude and

62
00:03:11,893 --> 00:03:15,510
longitude in the form of what's
called a lat long literal.

63
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:18,141
We'll use this all the time
throughout the course.

64
00:03:18,141 --> 00:03:19,847
The zoom is just a number.

65
00:03:19,847 --> 00:03:22,242
The higher the number, the more detail.

66
00:03:22,241 --> 00:03:24,546
You can go up to level 21.

67
00:03:24,546 --> 00:03:29,097
All right, you've made a beautiful
dynamic map of your very own.

68
00:03:29,097 --> 00:03:33,700
This map is centered on the lovely
Google office in New York City.

69
00:03:33,699 --> 00:03:37,412
Notice that all classes live
within the google.maps namespace.

70
00:03:37,413 --> 00:03:42,256
We just saw an example of this when we
used the google.maps.map class to create

71
00:03:42,256 --> 00:03:43,133
a map object.

72
00:03:43,133 --> 00:03:44,907
As you learn more about the classes,

73
00:03:44,907 --> 00:03:47,377
you'll see this naming
convention over and over.

74
00:03:47,377 --> 00:03:48,419
Now you try.
