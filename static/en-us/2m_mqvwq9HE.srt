00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,851
So we just solve this inequality to come up with an interval of solutions for x.

2
00:00:04,851 --> 00:00:09,378
Negative 45 is less than or equal is less than or equal to 10. So to satisfy

3
00:00:09,378 --> 00:00:14,262
this inequality x can take on any values from negative 45 to ten, including both

4
00:00:14,262 --> 00:00:19,021
of those values. But remember, we're not just dealing with any numbers here.

5
00:00:19,021 --> 00:00:23,777
We're talking about Grant's expo booth. Remember that x is equal to the length

6
00:00:23,777 --> 00:00:28,472
that Grant should add to the booth dimensions in each direction. So my question

7
00:00:28,472 --> 00:00:33,230
is, does this solution make complete sense in the context of Grant's expo booth?
