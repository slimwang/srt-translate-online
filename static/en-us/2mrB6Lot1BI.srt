1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,469
The third method we have
is something you are.

2
00:00:02,469 --> 00:00:04,330
That's the biometric method.

3
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:06,450
So, what exactly is that?

4
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:08,860
So obviously,
there are a variety of biometrics and

5
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:10,430
it should be unique to you.

6
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:14,350
Somebody else shouldn't be able
to use a biometric feature or

7
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:17,950
set of features to impersonate you,
so what are some examples?

8
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:19,330
Fingerprints are one.

9
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:24,450
You swipe your finger for example, touch
ID and things like that and they look

10
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:28,680
for the pattern in your fingerprints and
based on that they say it's really you.

11
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:32,395
When it comes to keyboard if
nothing else, the way you type, or

12
00:00:32,395 --> 00:00:36,335
the keystroke dynamics,
how fast you are, how long you take

13
00:00:36,335 --> 00:00:39,635
from one key to the next depending on
what the keys are and things like that.

14
00:00:39,635 --> 00:00:44,455
Sometimes that is used as
a biometric features derived from

15
00:00:44,455 --> 00:00:47,560
this speed at which you type,
or pattern of your typing,

16
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,850
could be a biometric
that's unique to you.

17
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:53,700
Actually seeing devices that do
voice biometric authentication.

18
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:57,870
They extract a set of features from your
voice which hopefully is unique to you,

19
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:00,490
and that can be used when
you talk to the device,

20
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:02,100
it knows that it's really you.

21
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:06,760
And, of course, they're more intrusive
and fancier one like retina scan and

22
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:10,130
things like that, which look for
sort of unique patterns

23
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:13,670
based on the blood flow in your eye,
and things like that.

24
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:16,820
So these are basically what you are.

25
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:20,650
The way these work, is that you're
going to claim it's you and

26
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:24,140
you're going to swipe your finger,
or you talk in case of voice.

27
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:27,760
But the biometric measurement
should be the same each time.

28
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:32,240
If it's different then of course
we're going to have a false negative.

29
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,830
It's you but you're not able to
login because you have a cold and

30
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:37,420
your voice is a little different.

31
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:41,190
So maybe you don't have
exact of these measurements.

32
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:44,560
Maybe you have a probability
distribution for

33
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,690
your other features that we extract
from your biometric measurements.

34
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:51,050
And of course we're going to
have false positives and

35
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:55,560
false negatives, as we have with each
authentication method that we discussed.

36
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:59,050
Here, if your biometric measurements
change beyond a certain limit,

37
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:01,460
then of course you may
not be able to login.

38
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:04,340
Resulting in this false negative
that we were talking about.

39
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:08,532
So the basic way of implementing
biometric is there has to be

40
00:02:08,532 --> 00:02:13,610
a biometric sensor, there's some user
interface where you swipe your finger or

41
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:17,935
camera takes a picture of you or
where you talk to it, or wherever it is.

42
00:02:17,935 --> 00:02:19,940
That the interface, the sensor,

43
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:23,470
then from the biometric reading we're
going to extract a bunch of features

44
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:27,580
that actually describe the reading
that we just have from the sensor.

45
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:31,230
And that's passed to a biometric
database that stores these features, or

46
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:33,480
something that derives
from these features.

47
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:36,150
So PIN is here,
as sort of a separate thing we may have,

48
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:39,310
in addition too, PIN is something
you know, so that's the secret.

49
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:41,771
But say if you just sort
of going with biometric,

50
00:02:41,771 --> 00:02:43,639
you would not have the top line here.

51
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:47,420
So the biometric database seems
like a hash values for passwords.

52
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:51,230
We have something that describes
the biometric feature set and

53
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:53,010
feature values for a given user.

54
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:55,330
So once you extract
the feature we compare those.

55
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:59,660
If there's a match between these two,
then we allow authentication.

56
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:02,970
If there isn't a match then we're
going to say that authentication

57
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:03,990
is not allowed.

58
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:07,050
So the idea is that you still
have the enrollment problem.

59
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:09,766
Somebody has to have a description
of your biometric features,

60
00:03:09,766 --> 00:03:12,080
which is the database
where we'll be storing it.

61
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,100
The sensor has to read it, the features
have to be extracted, the comparison or

62
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,290
match has to happen.

63
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:19,460
And that's how biometric
authentication works.

64
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:22,650
So that when you're typing a password,
we sort of reading through the interface

65
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:25,840
and the sensor and then it's sort
of similar to what we had before.
