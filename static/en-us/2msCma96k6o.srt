00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Let's take a look at some value proposition examples.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,260
I've selected some to just give you an idea of how other startups

3
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:09,440
have approached articulating their value proposition.

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:14,310
Here was a company that was actually trying to develop a bio-based replacement

5
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:16,239
for surfactants.

6
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:19,730
They actually went out and understood the problem, came up with some solutions,

7
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:24,840
and were trying to explain the pains and gains of their value proposition.

8
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:29,730
Another example was a robotics agricultural weeding device.

9
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:32,390
You notice here they're not talking about their device at all;

10
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:34,220
they're talking about the problem.

11
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:39,010
Hand weeding of farm fields for organic crops is a nightmare.

12
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:41,970
Another example: a company that was actually trying to figure out

13
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:44,680
a better way to do cancer tests.

14
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:47,600
They actually tried to understand what the problem was.

15
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:53,800
And the problem was that cancer cells get detached and are circulating in the bloodstream,

16
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:58,160
and oncologists and pathologists are trying to figure out

17
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:02,250
whether their patients have circulating cancer tumor cells.

18
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:07,100
And their features match the pain and the gain.

19
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:12,240
The rest of the slides give you some examples of value propositions in medical devices,

20
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,590
in dental care, etc.
