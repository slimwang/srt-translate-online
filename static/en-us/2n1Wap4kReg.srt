1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:04,430
Now the final step in the My Favorite
Movies app is adding the ability to

2
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:06,580
add and remove favorites.

3
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:09,420
And this is what'll happen when we
click this favorite button here.

4
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:14,180
If it's not selected and we click it,
then a movie will be added as a favorite

5
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:17,250
and if it's showing up as blue like for
this movie.

6
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:21,460
And we click it, it should remove
it from our Favorites list.

7
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:25,630
And this is going to require us to
use our first HTTP post request.

8
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:28,280
In the code, the button that we've
been clicking is connected to

9
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:31,360
the toggleFavorite action in
the movieDetail view controller.

10
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:35,390
Here at the top of the method we have
a constant that's commented out.

11
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:36,720
So let's uncomment this.

12
00:00:38,882 --> 00:00:41,110
And it's called shouldFavorite.

13
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:44,060
This constant determines whether
the request that we're going to make

14
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:47,330
is going to set the favorite to true or
false, or add or

15
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:49,830
remove it from our favorites list.

16
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:52,670
Then we have the familiar seven
steps that you'll be implementing.

17
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:57,820
Also, at the bottom in a comment
section, I have the UI updates that

18
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:00,310
you'll want to perform after
the request is completed.

19
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:05,489
Now, because this is a post request,
some things are going to be different.

20
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:07,860
I highly recommend that you
look at the documentation for

21
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:13,360
the account id favorite method, and use
its example code as a starting point.

22
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,690
The changes aren't that drastic and
I think you'll be okay.

23
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:18,670
Also, I'll give you two other hints.

24
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:20,460
First, you'll need to use the movie

25
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:23,390
property of
the MovieDetailViewController.

26
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:26,745
This property is going to be important
as one of the parameters that you'll

27
00:01:26,745 --> 00:01:29,065
send in the JSON body.

28
00:01:29,065 --> 00:01:32,555
Second, when you parse the data for
this request, you'll need to check for

29
00:01:32,555 --> 00:01:33,305
th status code.

30
00:01:33,305 --> 00:01:36,145
And the status code is
returned in the results, and

31
00:01:36,145 --> 00:01:39,335
this will help you determine whether
the request was successful or not.

32
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:42,002
If you are favoriting a movie,

33
00:01:42,002 --> 00:01:44,800
then the status code you want
to see is either 1 or 12.

34
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:48,908
But if you're unfavoriting a movie
the status code you'll want is 13.

35
00:01:48,908 --> 00:01:51,963
If you want to find out more information
about status codes like these,

36
00:01:51,963 --> 00:01:55,328
I'll post a link in the instructor notes
because these are not the only status

37
00:01:55,328 --> 00:01:57,639
codes that could be returned
by the movie database.

38
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:02,420
When you're finished implementing the
toggle favorite method check this box.
