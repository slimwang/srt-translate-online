00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:23,280
>> That's a good point David. Remember that we're trying to store things,

2
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:25,940
because we want to retrieve things later. And

3
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:28,830
if our storage mechanism is such that it doesn't not allow for

4
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:33,150
efficient retrieval, then it's not a very good storage mechanism. And as

5
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:36,650
you correctly point out, David, as the number of entries increase in this table,

6
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:40,830
and the number of dimensions we are looking at increase also increases.

7
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:42,635
This is going to be coming an inefficient for

8
00:00:42,635 --> 00:00:47,110
retrieval. Therefore, let's look at a second method called discrimination trees

9
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:51,010
which provides an alternate way of storing these cases in memory.
