Should be obvious, that this first one, is the least likely to create an

00:00:03,987 --> 00:00:08,546
emotional response. Why? Because it's the only one that doesn't touch on

00:00:08,546 --> 00:00:13,277
something important to a person. We only experience emotion, when our personal

00:00:13,277 --> 00:00:18,366
goals and values are involved. Moods do sometime effect emotion, making certain

5
00:00:18,366 --> 00:00:22,765
emotions more likely than others. For instance, when you're in a good mood, you

00:00:22,765 --> 00:00:26,230
experience happiness or giddiness more easily, and anger and sadness less

00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:27,840
easily.
