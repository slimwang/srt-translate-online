00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:01,870
Welcome back to Computer Vision.

2
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:06,210
This is another lecture of mechanisms or
methods that are,

3
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:09,310
they're not sort of current
computer vision research, or

4
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:12,590
really the state of the art in Computer
Vision, but they are very important

5
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:16,810
methods that we make use of all
the time for a variety of operations.

6
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:20,625
And what we're going to talk about today
is really some binary image analysis.

7
00:00:20,625 --> 00:00:26,035
There are lots of times that we produce
images that are essentially zeros and

8
00:00:26,035 --> 00:00:26,770
ones.

9
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:30,490
One talks at zero is a background and
one is a foreground.

10
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:33,310
So, for example, I might be looking
in fact we talked about background

11
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:38,930
subtraction when we were doing,
detection of moving objects.

12
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:42,250
Right, and so basically the ones where
the stuff was supposed to be moving and

13
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,510
the zeroes were supposed
to be where it wasn't.

14
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:47,940
And in fact, there was this example that
I showed of people sitting on the steps

15
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:51,640
of the University, and we did a median
filter, and then we subtracted them off.

16
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,740
We did a thresholding,
then I did, I said,

17
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:57,330
we did something called morphological
operations to clean it up.

18
00:00:57,330 --> 00:00:59,790
Today, we're doing
the morphological operations, and

19
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:03,620
it's often buried deep within
any functioning vision system.
