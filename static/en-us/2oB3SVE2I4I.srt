00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,500
Here's an exercise intended to help
you solidify your understanding

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:05,990
of the relationship between
the original clause and

3
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:09,550
the set of three clauses that
the transformation produces.

4
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:12,180
I want you to extend
the truths table below so

5
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:14,730
that it satisfies
the given 3CNF formula.

6
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:18,600
This one is the image of this clause

7
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,550
under the transformation
that we've discussed.
