00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
[Narrator] Welcome to Homework 1.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
The way homework will work in this class is a little different from what you might expect if you took CS101 with me.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
There will be regular homework questions; these will mostly be multiple choice

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
or questions where you need to enter a number or a string.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
They might involve using programming to solve problems,

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
but you won't be expected to submit code.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
You'll be writing programs to be able to answer the questions that are provided in the homework.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
There will also be open discussion problems, and these will usually involve either

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
designing a solution to our problem, designing a protocol perhaps,

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
or analyzing a provided solution.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
There's no graded aspect to these discussions,

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
but I think it will be a valuable part of the course for you to think on your own

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
how to solve these problems, and then to join the discussions

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
and the forums to see other how people have solved them, and to see whether your solution is popular

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
or other people notice problems in it.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
The third kind of problem will be challenge problems.

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
These will be problems that you can submit answers to.

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
They'll be separate from the regular homework, and these are problems

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
that we expect to be quite challenging.

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
They'll probably require a fair bit of time to solve,

21
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
and they'll get more challenging as the course goes on.

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
It's not necessary to solve these to feel like you're following the course and getting a lot out of the course,

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
but if you do have time and enjoy challenges, I hope you'll tackle the challenge problems as well.

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
If you are able to solve a challenge problem,

25
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
please don't spoil the fun for other students in the class.

26
00:01:21,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Don't post your solution to the problem until after the deadline has passed.
