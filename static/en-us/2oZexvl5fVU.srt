1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
[Norvig] The answers are, in this case, only the second is a correct representation.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Any combination is possible to be dialed.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
It's not the case that it's only possible to dial the correct combination.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Now, here we said that the lock button works at any point.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Whether it's open or not, the lock button will always lock it.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
And so that's represented by the third option.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
True implies it's possible to lock.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
In this case the first one is a correct representation

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
of the successor state axiom for Open,

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
and the second one is not, because note what it says.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:49,000
If we already have the lock open and then we execute some dialing action

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
that's not dialing the correct combination, X, we want it to remain open.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 99:59:59,999
But this second axiom would make it be closed, which is not what we want.
