00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,280
Playing audio in the car is another
key feature of Android Auto.

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:07,870
You can use either the touchscreen to
select songs based on a variety of

3
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:11,730
criteria, or you can use your voice
to speak the name of a song or

4
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:14,610
artist using the voice button
on the steering wheel.

5
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:18,070
This is great because the user is
driving a car meaning they need minimal

6
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:21,380
distractions and they need to
keep their eyes on the road.

7
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:23,980
So let's take a quick look at
what it looks like to play

8
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:25,790
audio with Android Auto.

9
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:28,220
And then I'll show you
how to implement this.

10
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:32,080
So here's our universal media player
sample app, which is installed and

11
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:33,920
running on my phone here.

12
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,330
Android Auto is able to
connect to the app and

13
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:38,230
then browse through
the media collection.

14
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:40,219
The user can perform a search
using voice commands.

15
00:00:43,093 --> 00:00:44,591
Play music jazz.

16
00:00:44,591 --> 00:00:46,959
[SOUND]

17
00:00:46,959 --> 00:00:51,328
[MUSIC]

18
00:00:51,328 --> 00:00:53,708
You can also touch the screen
to browse as well.

19
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:57,976
So I'll pick something
in the rock genre.

20
00:00:57,976 --> 00:01:01,539
[MUSIC]

21
00:01:01,539 --> 00:01:04,486
And there you go, it's that easy to use,
and in this lesson,

22
00:01:04,486 --> 00:01:07,480
I'm going to show you how
we implement all of this.

23
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:11,058
We're going to explain how to use
the Android media browsing framework.

24
00:01:11,058 --> 00:01:11,780
We're going to walk you through

25
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:14,910
a short sample that implements
basic functionality, and

26
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:17,820
then, how to implement a full
featured media playing application

27
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:21,050
that works on Android Auto as well
as lots of other platforms as well.
