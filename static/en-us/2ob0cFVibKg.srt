1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,200
Okay, you're about to do some shorter
warm-up problems before we code an app.

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,110
While you're working on these problems,
you might want to copy over code

3
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:09,820
examples into an application and
actually try running it.

4
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:12,570
Now you might be thinking
about putting this sort of

5
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:16,320
random Java code that you're testing
out into your Just Java app, but

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,240
this could get a little bit messy.

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,800
So instead of potentially
messing up your Just Java app,

8
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,670
I humbly suggest making a new app.

9
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:26,720
Okay, so you'll want to click on the
Start a new Android Studio project, and

10
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,800
then you can use these specs
to create your new project.

11
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:32,100
If you get stuck,
you can watch the solution video, or

12
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,680
I'll quickly get up and run it.

13
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,800
If you want a slower moving video,
I've provided a link to the video from

14
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,860
practice set one, where you set
up the happy birthday project.

15
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:40,530
All right, get to it.

16
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:42,100
Don't worry, I'll wait for you.
