00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,010
So before I start today's class I'd like to take you on a trip that I recently

2
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:09,110
did to share some of the things that excite me in my life with all of you.

3
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:12,680
I actually went to Washington, D.C. and the highlight of the day for

4
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:15,930
me was to visit the National Museum of American History.

5
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:19,090
Some of you might know this.

6
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:24,378
In 1998 a team led by Wolfram Burgard and

7
00:00:24,378 --> 00:00:28,140
myself put a robotic tour guide into this museum.

8
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:32,920
This robot was in the museum for about two weeks and it led kids and

9
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,610
visitors of the museum through the exhibit.

10
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:38,900
It did localization similar to what I taught you before.

11
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:41,470
It used a learned map of the environment.

12
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:45,000
We programmed by hand the specific location of exhibits and

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,490
was also able to say something.

14
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:49,190
It was also able to smile and to frown.

15
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:53,080
And as you can see in this video, sometimes even kids climbed onto it.

16
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:57,490
But today I'm here to see Stanley.

17
00:00:57,490 --> 00:01:01,860
Stanley has been here for a couple of years now in exhibits our robot that won

18
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:07,230
the DARPA Grand Challenge, and it was really fascinating to see the thing

19
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:11,910
that we've built and visited in its own little room in the Smithsonian museum.

20
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:16,590
This exhibit has been made specifically to celebrate Stanley's victory.

21
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:20,580
And in exploring this exhibit again I found that the curators had

22
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:24,550
actually put some program code on the wall for people to understand.

23
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:25,540
Let's zoom in.

24
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:27,100
You can see common.

25
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:29,760
So, at the time you are already working with common faters and

26
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:33,530
in our parameter file, as shown here, the word common occurs many times.

27
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:37,660
So, what I've been teaching you last class about the common fater really had

28
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:42,500
a major role to play in making Stanley the robot win the DARPA Grand Challenge.

29
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:46,290
So these are deep emotional moments for me going back to the past and

30
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:48,990
seeing what we've done and how it's been preserved.

31
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:52,630
But I want to share with everybody here because it’s part of my life and

32
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:55,320
it’s part of what we’ve done in building self-driving cars, and

33
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:59,230
the methods I’m teaching you in this class are essentially the same methods as

34
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:01,880
we used back in Stanley and in Junior when we did the Urban Challenge.
