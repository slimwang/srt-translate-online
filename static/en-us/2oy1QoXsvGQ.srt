[Thrun] Here is a final gradient descent quiz.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Suppose we have a loss function like this

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and our gradient descent starts over here.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Will it likely reach the global minimum?

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Yes or no.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Please check one of those boxes.
