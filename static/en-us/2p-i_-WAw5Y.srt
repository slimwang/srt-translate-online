00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,631
Simplifying this expression is really just
2 instances of using the distributive

2
00:00:04,643 --> 00:00:09,498
property. Let's multiply each term inside
this 1st set of parentheses by 3. And we

3
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:14,035
want to multiply each term within the
2nd set of parentheses by 150. And now

4
00:00:14,047 --> 00:00:18,389
we just multiply within each term to
simplify. And last, but not least, we add

5
00:00:18,401 --> 00:00:24,505
like terms and we end up with a final
answer of 402w + 480n. This is

6
00:00:24,505 --> 00:00:28,700
interesting. We can see finally, now that
everything is simplified, how the number

7
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:31,123
of nozzles that have been ordered compares
to the number of wipers that have been

8
00:00:31,123 --> 00:00:36,176
ordered. Before, when we just had 84w +
60n, as Grant's total future earnings,

9
00:00:36,176 --> 00:00:40,396
there were clearly more wipers than
nozzles in demand. But now the situation

10
00:00:40,408 --> 00:00:44,884
is reversed. More novels have been ordered
than wipers. This is one of the many

11
00:00:44,884 --> 00:00:47,842
reasons why simplifying expressions is
really, really helpful when we're doing

12
00:00:47,854 --> 00:00:51,156
word problems. When we have things
simplified down as much as we can, we're

13
00:00:51,168 --> 00:00:54,561
able to see what real word situations are
reflected by the math.
