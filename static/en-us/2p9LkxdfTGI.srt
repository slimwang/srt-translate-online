00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:02,680
In the binary classification section,

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:06,580
we learned about decision trees which
were used to predict binary variables.

3
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:08,430
They do this by splitting the data and

4
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:12,360
creating the largest difference at
the percent between the target group.

5
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:15,712
Well guess what, they can also
be used to predict non-binary

6
00:00:15,712 --> 00:00:20,600
classification data and we'll be using
this for our new business problems.

7
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,480
Since we already learned
the foundation of decision trees,

8
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,710
let's flip over to Alteryx
to build this model out.

9
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,280
Now, what we are going to do is
build a decision tree over Alteryx,

10
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:33,250
interpret the results and
validate the model.

11
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:34,160
If you recall,

12
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:38,720
the goal of this analysis is to
predict what mode of transportation

13
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:43,130
the 40% of employees who did not
respond to this survey actually use.

14
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:46,300
Since we have already built out
a decision tree, go ahead and

15
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:49,500
bring in the data and
build this model out yourself.

16
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,320
We can then validate
the model afterwards.
