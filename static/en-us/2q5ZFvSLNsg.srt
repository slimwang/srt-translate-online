1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,380
So authentication helps
us answer the question,

2
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:05,810
who the request is coming from.

3
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:09,110
But then we have to check if
the source of the request is

4
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:13,110
actually authorized to access
the resource they're asking for.

5
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:16,490
Well, this is the access control,
or authorization problem.

6
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:20,670
The focus of this lesson is going
to be on access control and

7
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:23,040
how it can be implemented
in a computer system.
