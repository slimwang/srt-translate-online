00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,700
Let's discuss more about
network IDS deployment.

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:06,530
Here's an example enterprise
network configuration.

3
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:09,230
The internal network
has multiple subnets.

4
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:14,300
And the enterprise has public-facing
services, such as a public web server.

5
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:16,530
Recall our lecture on firewalls.

6
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:19,500
We typically want to place
an external firewall

7
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,280
to protect the entire
enterprise network.

8
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:22,929
In addition,

9
00:00:22,929 --> 00:00:26,740
we want to protect the internal network
from the public-facing servers.

10
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:31,640
These servers are put in what we
call a DMZ and we use internal

11
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:36,530
firewalls to monitor traffic between
the internal subnet and a DMZ.

12
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:40,560
The internal firewalls also monitor
traffic between its subnets.

13
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:44,470
So that's the deployment of firewalls,
but what about IDS?

14
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:49,550
A common location for an IDS sensor
is just inside the external firewall.

15
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:52,570
This position has
a number of advantages.

16
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:55,670
Obviously, you can see attacks
from the outside world.

17
00:00:55,670 --> 00:01:00,000
By comparing the logs of the firewall
and the IDS, we can also

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,430
find out whether the firewall had missed
an attack that it should have prevented.

19
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:08,410
The IDS at this location can also
detect attacks that are targeted at

20
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:10,240
the public facing servers.

21
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:14,290
In addition, because it can analyze
all outgoing traffic of the entire

22
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:18,510
enterprise network, it can also detect
attacks from a compromised server,

23
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:21,790
either from DMZ or the internal network.

24
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:26,420
A network IDS can also be placed between
the external network and the Internet.

25
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:30,710
The main advantage of this location
is that the network IDS can see

26
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:33,620
all attempted attacks to
the enterprise network,

27
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:37,334
including those attacks that have
been filtered by the firewalls.

28
00:01:37,334 --> 00:01:40,780
For example, if the firewall is
overloaded, you would not only drop

29
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:44,928
the incoming packet, it may not even
have resource to log this packet.

30
00:01:44,928 --> 00:01:48,600
But an IDS at this location
can see the packet and log it.

31
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,870
Therefore, the IDS can see
all attempted attacks.

32
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:54,980
In addition to deploying
network IDS at the perimeter,

33
00:01:54,980 --> 00:02:00,190
we can also deploy a network IDS to
protect a subnet or set of servers.

34
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:04,299
A network IDS at this location can
perform more detailed analysis of

35
00:02:04,299 --> 00:02:05,246
traffic data.

36
00:02:05,246 --> 00:02:08,156
Because compared with a network
IDS at the perimeter,

37
00:02:08,156 --> 00:02:10,370
it has smaller amount of traffic volume,

38
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:14,660
due to the fact that it only monitors
traffic to a subnet and the servers.

39
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:18,680
In addition, it can also detect
intrusions from inside the network.

40
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:22,680
In addition to protecting the servers,
a network IDS can also be placed

41
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:27,590
to protect the workstations or networks
of important personnels or departments.

42
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:31,900
A network IDS at this location can
focus on targeted attacks, for

43
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:35,990
example, attacks that are targeted
at financial transaction systems.

44
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:38,490
Compared with an IDS at
the network perimeter,

45
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:42,100
which must examine traffic to
the whole network, an IDS at

46
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:46,150
this location can instead focus on
traffic to these high-value systems.
