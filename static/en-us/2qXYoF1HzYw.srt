1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:04,450
So now you have a few more tools
to approach problems in your code.

2
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:06,390
But this is just the beginning.

3
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:09,930
When you really get into it,
debunking isn't just correcting errors.

4
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:13,400
Or even just figuring out
how you made a mistake.

5
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:16,630
It's a scientific process
of examining code

6
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:18,750
to discover things you
didn't expect in it.

7
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:22,600
Debugging is a really important
skill to learn if you want to do

8
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,110
software engineering.

9
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:26,070
In real-world computing systems.

10
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:28,790
Bugs cause problems that
are a lot bigger than just

11
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:31,120
getting a weird error on your screen.

12
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:35,180
Correctly locating errors is a big
part of writing reliable software.

13
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:39,650
In fact, we have a whole course on
a scientific approach to debugging.

14
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:41,260
After you've finished
your current projects,

15
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:42,850
you might want to take
a look at that next.
