1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The answer is as many times as he wants.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
There's no way when Cathy receives the coin from Bob

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
that she can verify he didn't already spend it to someone else.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
So in order for these coins to have some value,

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
they have to be scarce.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
That has to be the case that you can't spend them multiple times,

7
00:00:16,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and you can't just create them.
