00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,939
We will now dive into some of the specifics of how D3 works, and

2
00:00:04,939 --> 00:00:09,900
why it is becoming the go to tool for anyone who wants to visualize data.

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:14,180
Rather than obscure and hide the Document Object Model,

4
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:19,090
D3 embraces it by directly manipulating HTML modes and

5
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:23,760
SVG objects, Through common conventions like CSS selectors.

6
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,930
By doing so, D3 has enabled much more expressive visualizations and

7
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:32,350
allows designers to directly interact with developers,

8
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:37,140
by separating the style of a visualization from the mechanics of it.

9
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:43,540
D3 visualizations, Since they operate directly on HTML through the DOM and SVG,

10
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:48,600
can be styled in the exact same way as any other web page, such as with CSS.

11
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:54,650
And D3 code can actually manipulate already created and HTML documents.

12
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:58,040
We will see an example of this when we get to the live code portion of

13
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:01,660
this lesson and actually manipulate this very web page and

14
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:04,110
change some of the stylings and elements.

15
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:10,200
One example of leveraging this power might be to pre-render HTML and SVG objects

16
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:15,440
for a complex visualization on the server side, and then simply use JavaScript

17
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:19,880
for any sort of interaction or dynamics that we need on the client side.

18
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:24,500
If you have the libraries built on top of D3, actually do exactly this and

19
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:30,180
allow you to render on the server side D3 objects to static images or JSON.

20
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:33,840
The last benefit I will mention, though there are quite a few more, is that,

21
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:39,330
since D3 visualizations operate on the DOM and HTML directly, they can leverage

22
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:44,030
all the improvements and advances of the open web, such as browser enhancements,

23
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:48,170
JavaScript speed increases, and newer standards, such as HTML5.

24
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:54,650
And also, developers can use all of their familiar tools to work with D3.

25
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:58,460
Such as debuggers, text editors, existing libraries.
