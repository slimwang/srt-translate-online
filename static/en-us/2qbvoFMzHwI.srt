1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,302
And the answer is $50. We're looking for the peak of this parabola, which is at

2
00:00:05,302 --> 00:00:10,464
this point right here. We trace this down, the spot it corresponds to on the

3
00:00:10,464 --> 00:00:15,859
horizontal axis, you see it's directly between 40 and 60, so it should be 50, or

4
00:00:15,859 --> 00:00:16,219
$50.
