00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:04,390
So here's a more challenging quiz about find. This one will require you

2
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:09,170
to think pretty carefully about how find is defined. For any string, so

3
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:13,110
we're going to have a variable s that we've initialized to any string. Your

4
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:15,940
goal is to determine which of these will always have the value zero.

5
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:24,840
So the first choice, s.find (s). Notice there are no quotes around s. The

6
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:30,090
second one is s.find('s'). The third one is

7
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:35,295
's'.find('s'). The fourth one is

8
00:00:35,295 --> 00:00:39,930
s.find(''). And the final

9
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:44,840
one is s.find Passing

10
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:51,130
in s concatenated with the string. Three exclamation points, one of my favorites

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,368
plus one. So check all of the answers where the expression here

12
00:00:58,368 --> 00:01:05,390
evaluates to zero, no matter what value the string s starts with. So try

13
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:10,450
to answer this, just based on thinking, understanding the description of find.

14
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:12,890
You can always also try things in the Python interpreter

15
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:16,560
after that. And see if your interpretation is correct. But remember

16
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,170
our goal is to answer the question where no matter

17
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:22,170
what the string S is, the resultive expression is always zero.
