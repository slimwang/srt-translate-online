00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,905
Say you're given a mesh like this. Some statue standing on a platform that's

2
00:00:03,905 --> 00:00:07,811
some distance from the origin. You'd like to rotate it in place on its base so

3
00:00:07,811 --> 00:00:11,446
that it's facing like this. You know that if you just try to rotate it, it's

4
00:00:11,446 --> 00:00:15,161
going to rotate around the origin and it will swing wildly in position. You want

5
00:00:15,161 --> 00:00:18,624
it to stay where it is. You have a few matrices at hand to perform the task.

6
00:00:18,625 --> 00:00:22,331
You're given a translation matrix that would move the center of the model's base

7
00:00:22,331 --> 00:00:25,930
to the origin. You also have a rotation matrix that will rotate the model or

8
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:29,682
anything else around the y-axis. Finally, you can also invert the translation

9
00:00:29,682 --> 00:00:33,934
and rotation matrices. The question is, what series of transforms will rotate

10
00:00:33,934 --> 00:00:37,481
the model on its base? In other words, we want to end up with the object in the

11
00:00:37,481 --> 00:00:41,360
same position, but rotated around its own axis. Put the transforms in the usual

12
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,230
right to left order, rightmost being applied to the object first. If you don't

13
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:48,703
need all four slots for matrices, just leave the leftmost ones empty. For

14
00:00:48,703 --> 00:00:52,714
example, if you needed just a single transform, put it in this rightmost slot.

15
00:00:52,715 --> 00:00:55,960
To solve this one, you might want to remember the rule, once a transform is

16
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:59,463
applied, forget about it and just think about where the model itself is then.
