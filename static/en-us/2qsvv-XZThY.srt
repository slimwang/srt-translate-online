1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:03,545
So, some of these events that
we've been talking about and

2
00:00:03,545 --> 00:00:08,445
put in our list affect the different
concurrently executing

3
00:00:08,445 --> 00:00:10,840
sub-machines that we've
already modelled.

4
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:14,480
See if you can figure out which ones
of these, which ones these are and

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:18,210
label the transitions in the finite
state machine with their numbers.

6
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:22,260
So, pick a particular event and decide

7
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:27,230
which of the state machines are affected
by that particular event happening.

8
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:31,740
>> Starting with number one for
turning the dial for the frequency,

9
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:37,400
that would be affecting our
station finance statement.

10
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:42,480
>> So, we would now expect, as a,
in that particular machine,

11
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:47,540
the station of machine that the arc
that we have, the self arc that we have

12
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:52,750
is going to be labelled by a particular
event, which is event number one, okay?

13
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:54,030
Simple, right?

14
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:58,560
And we can do the same thing for
some of these other events and

15
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:02,880
come up with an annotated diagram or

16
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:07,953
a diagram in which the transitions
all have arcs on them.

17
00:01:07,953 --> 00:01:10,820
In our particular,
this particular exercise,

18
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:13,560
we don't have any
spontaneous transitions.

19
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:17,990
The spontaneous transition is
where you're in some state and

20
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:21,130
you go to the next state
without any event happening.

21
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:26,340
Okay, so we ultimately are going to see,
we're going to need to have for each

22
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:30,650
of the arcs that we have in the diagram,
some have been causing the transition.

23
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:35,580
Remember that our arrows with two heads
on them are really an abbreviation for

24
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:37,720
two arrows, one going in each direction.

25
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:40,820
>> So I think we meant event four for

26
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:45,500
the, event one I think's changing the
volume so that would be the volume dial

27
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,400
state machine but for
this one were talking about four.

28
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,920
>> Okay so with the transition
were putting on the station knob,

29
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,820
self transition is for event four.

30
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:57,374
Here are the additions to our machine
to handle events one, two, three, four,

31
00:01:57,374 --> 00:01:58,170
12, and 13.

32
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:03,167
So with respect to event one,
that's the volume knob that's similar

33
00:02:03,167 --> 00:02:07,960
to our station one, or
switching the band between AM and FM.

34
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:11,030
Those are events two and three,
one going to the left and

35
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:12,070
one going to the right.

36
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:17,679
And similarly sliding the mode switch to
the right and left are events 12 and 13.
