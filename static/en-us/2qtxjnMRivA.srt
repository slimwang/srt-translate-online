00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:03,150
The histogram looked like this graph.

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:05,460
Now, from what you've learned about statistics so

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:08,720
far, what kind of distribution does this graph show?

4
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:11,550
Is it a normal distribution,

5
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:16,340
an exponential, a poisson distribution, or a gamma distribution?
