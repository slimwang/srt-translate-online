1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:03,000
The correct answer is the first one.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,580
The first few minutes of
a game are the most important.

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:09,610
Because without that initial hook,
you won't have any interest in players.

4
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:12,260
And nothing else gets
a chance to matter.

5
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:16,160
The third option to design in-app
purchases to help with challenges

6
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,130
can be a good strategy for monetization.

7
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:23,180
And the other answers are more personal
preferences for your game design.

8
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:26,230
Color and letting a player
choose the level of difficulty

9
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:29,510
aren't as important as designing
the first few minutes of a game.
