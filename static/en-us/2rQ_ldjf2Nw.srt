00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,610
Now that you've seen the two other ways of declaring and

2
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:06,080
defining objects, let's give them a try by creating two objects,

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,830
one using dot notation and the other using bracket notation.

4
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:12,410
Using dot notation, create an object that contains some of

5
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:16,379
your work information, including your position, employer, the years worked and

6
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:17,429
the city of the business.

7
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,130
Then, using bracket notation, create an education object that

8
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:26,800
includes the school you attended, the years you attended, and the school's city.

9
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,230
>> And how will students know they've done it right?

10
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:32,679
>> Underneath your objects, append() work ["position"] and

11
00:00:32,679 --> 00:00:35,000
education.name to the resume.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,350
If you did it right, they should show up.
