1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:04,620
With a bank account balance, the total makes perfect sense. The balance can be

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:09,297
added to when you deposit money, and it gets smaller when you withdraw money.

3
00:00:09,297 --> 00:00:13,738
It's just a number that gets incremented and decremented in times. With friends

4
00:00:13,738 --> 00:00:18,067
in a social network, I probably wouldn't be using this pattern. Because in a

5
00:00:18,067 --> 00:00:21,895
social network, you don't just con, collect the number of friends that someone

6
00:00:21,895 --> 00:00:26,862
has, you want to collect the actual friends. And that would not be a variable

7
00:00:26,862 --> 00:00:31,818
that gets incremented or decremented. A car odometer? That again makes sense.

8
00:00:31,818 --> 00:00:38,911
As miles accumulate, this not total just gets bigger. Notice that this one here

9
00:00:38,911 --> 00:00:44,568
doesn't get smaller. that's fine. And finally, what were flag stripes. I don't

10
00:00:44,568 --> 00:00:50,408
know, it's, a flag has a constant number of stripes, they don't change. So,

11
00:00:50,408 --> 00:00:54,698
even though you may want to count the stripes, it's not the total pattern where

12
00:00:54,698 --> 00:01:00,600
you have a quantity that has some method that adds to it. And maybe some method

13
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:05,425
that subtracts from it. The point is that, once you've seen a couple of classes

14
00:01:05,425 --> 00:01:09,614
that keep a total of gas consumed, of miles driven, of money in the bank,

15
00:01:09,614 --> 00:01:15,640
whatever. Then you start recognizing that particular pattern, and it becomes

16
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:19,240
easy for you to put in a method that adds something to the total that takes

17
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:25,473
something away. So, let's look at a few other patterns that you haven't seen so

18
00:01:25,473 --> 00:01:29,621
much, but they are very useful in practice.
