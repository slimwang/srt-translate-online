00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:01,670
So, to conclude this sub-lecture,

2
00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:04,870
let's look at what we looked at in the last few minutes.

3
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:09,220
Basically, introduced how sines and cosines can be used to reconstruct a signal.

4
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:10,680
Used that to construct and

5
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:14,150
characterize the whole concept of a Fourier Transform, and

6
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:17,175
talked about terms like frequency, amplitude, and phase.

7
00:00:17,175 --> 00:00:20,838
Introduced the whole concept of frequency domain for a signal and an image.

8
00:00:20,838 --> 00:00:25,090
And then identified the whole concept of how similar types of things,

9
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:29,180
convolution, and being able to look at different frequencies can be used to

10
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:32,658
actually use a Fourier Transform, doing the kinds of things we want to do.

11
00:00:32,658 --> 00:00:36,750
Next, what we'd like to do is start looking at how we can merge and

12
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:38,160
blend different images together.

13
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,950
Remember our initial experiment with trying to do this?

14
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:43,518
We want to be able to take different images and merge and blend them together.

15
00:00:43,518 --> 00:00:48,600
What we want to also do is start looking for how to do this at different

16
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,500
frequencies, so we can merge the frequencies of the image correctly for two

17
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:56,710
images, again, based on similarities of the frequencies for those two images.

18
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:59,060
You'll see examples of this in the next lecture.

19
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:02,630
And just to conclude again, some more information is available on these sites,

20
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:05,620
and it'll be made available also on the class website.

21
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:06,120
Thank you.
