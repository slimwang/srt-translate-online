1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The answer here is 2/3 or 0.667 and is computed as follows.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
We have 1 message with 1 as spam, but we're going to add k =1.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
We're going to add k = 2 over here because there's 2 different classes.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
K = 1 times 2 = 2, which gives us 2/3.

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The answer over here is 7/12.

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Again, we have 6/10 but we add 2 down here and 1 over here, so you get 7/12.

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:49,000
And correspondingly, we get 61/102 is 60 + 1 over 100 +2.

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:56,000
If we look at the numbers over here, we get 0.5833

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
and 0.5986.

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Interestingly, the maximum likelihood on the last 2 cases over here

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
will give us .6, but we only get a value that's closer to .5,

12
00:01:09,000 --> 99:59:59,999
which is the effect of our smoothing prior for the Laplacian smoothing.
