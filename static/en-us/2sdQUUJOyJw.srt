1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,750
When the activity stops, you'll
want to disconnect your API Client.

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:07,130
Of course, you should only do this
if you are already connected.

3
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:10,005
So you should check if
Google API Client is connected.

4
00:00:10,005 --> 00:00:12,800
And you do that very
simply with this method.

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,255
This returns a boolean for you.

6
00:00:14,255 --> 00:00:18,910
So if mGoogleApiClient.isConnected
returns true,

7
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:21,400
then you want to be able
to disconnect your client.

8
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:24,880
And then you can do that very simply
by calling the disconnect method,

9
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:25,670
as you can see here.
