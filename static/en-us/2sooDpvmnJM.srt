1
00:00:00,095 --> 00:00:04,400
Now, what we are really interested in is finding within these two

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,590
images with all the transformations some features that

3
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:10,880
are common that would allow us to do any kind of matching.

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:16,300
So our goal is to find points in an image that can be found in other images.

5
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:18,550
Again, I've just showed you an example of this,

6
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:20,720
point being found in another one.

7
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,400
They need to found precisely, that means they need to

8
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:27,810
be well localized exactly where they would be across the two images.

9
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:30,710
But also, they need to be reliably found.

10
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:33,115
That they need to be, again, quite well matched.

11
00:00:33,115 --> 00:00:36,270
If I was to take all of this neighborhood around the circle here,

12
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:39,940
they need to have the same neighborhood here.

13
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:43,720
So if I was to run different types of operations on both of them

14
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,980
we'd basically get similar answers.

15
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:49,910
So again, they need to be reliable, they need to be easily detectable.
