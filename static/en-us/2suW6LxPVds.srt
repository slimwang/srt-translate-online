00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,949
Here are the conjugates and here are the products. Great work if you found at

2
00:00:03,949 --> 00:00:08,310
least four of those. We know for the conjugate we just change the sign between

3
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:13,366
the two terms so the conjugate of 1 minus root 11 is 1 plus root 11. Here we

4
00:00:13,366 --> 00:00:17,170
change the subtraction sign to a positive. And here we change the positive sign

5
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:20,659
to a negative. For the products we want to use our pattern for the difference

6
00:00:20,659 --> 00:00:25,536
of two squares. We know the product of two binomials with differing signs will

7
00:00:25,536 --> 00:00:30,856
be a squared minus b squared. So we can square a which is 1 here And squared b,

8
00:00:30,856 --> 00:00:37,520
which is the root of 11. One squared equals 1, and root 11 squared equals 11.

9
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,760
We find the difference of these squares, which is 1 minus 11, which equal

10
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:46,184
negative 10. For the second one, when we square the a term, we'll have 9 times

11
00:00:46,184 --> 00:00:52,528
2, we square the 3 and we square the root 2. For b squared, or square two which

12
00:00:52,528 --> 00:00:56,778
is four, and we square the square root of three, which equals three. We know

13
00:00:56,778 --> 00:01:01,887
nine times two is 18, and four times three is 12. This gives us a final answer

14
00:01:01,887 --> 00:01:06,470
of six. And for the last one, we have negative five squared for the a term and

15
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:12,766
six root two squared for the b. Negative five squared is 25 and 6 root 2

16
00:01:12,766 --> 00:01:21,260
squared is 36 times 2 or 72. 25 minus 72 equals negative 47.
