00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:04,040
Together we walk through how to add a
breakpoint for the increment method and

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:06,270
how to trigger that breakpoint.

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:09,360
Hopefully you were able to
reproduce that on your computer.

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,930
For the decrement method,
if we want to add a breakpoint,

5
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:15,510
I can just click here on
line 33 to add a breakpoint.

6
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:19,850
Then I click on this green bug icon
to launch the app in debug mode.

7
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:21,740
I'll see the Waiting For
Debugger message,

8
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:23,150
and then it will go away shortly.

9
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:27,200
To trigger this breakpoint,
I'm going to click on the minus button.

10
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:30,600
The app pauses at this line, and

11
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,480
I know that because the quantity
value hasn't updated to one yet.

12
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,730
I see the list of variables down here,
but

13
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:39,420
the quantity variable
hasn't shown up yet.

14
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:42,970
I click on this button to step over
this line to go to the next line.

15
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:46,990
Then I see that the quantity variable
shows up, and the current value is one.

16
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:50,740
At this point, I can step over this line
of code to the end of the method and

17
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:52,750
then just resume execution of the app.

18
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:57,420
Because I have two breakpoints in my
app, if I click on the plus button,

19
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:00,060
it triggers the breakpoint
in the increment method.

20
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,430
Then I can hit play to resume.

21
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:05,470
If I click on the minus button, it
triggers a breakpoint in the decrement

22
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:07,970
method, and I can hit play to resume.

23
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:10,340
If I don't want the app to stop
at either of those breakpoints,

24
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:13,390
I can just hit stop, and
it detaches the debugger.

25
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:17,060
Then the app just runs as normal where
it updates the screen immediately when I

26
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:17,770
click on the button.
