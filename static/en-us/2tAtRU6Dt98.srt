00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:04,640
Here's a sketch of SAAM. Assuming that we have already gone through

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:09,560
an architectural design process and if we produce some artifacts like diagrams.

3
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:14,420
So we generate that architecture. We also generate some scenarios.

4
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:20,050
Now these are not primarily usage scenarios, or we could think of them as,

5
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:25,630
as elaborated usage scenarios. Where instead of looking at it from the outside,

6
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:29,770
external view, we're looking for it internally. So for example if,

7
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:35,740
if the external request is by the user to compute some result,

8
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:38,960
the generated scenario here that we,

9
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:45,260
the team provides is which elements of the architecture are required. To,

10
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:50,600
be involved in providing that functionality. And in what order. That is,

11
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:55,780
we essentially are going to, walk through the diagram and

12
00:00:55,780 --> 00:01:01,370
see how that particular usage of the system impacts the architecture.

13
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:05,790
This is particularly important if what we're talking about is a new scenario.

14
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:08,850
That is imagine the system that was architected one way and

15
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:14,410
we want to add a new a new, a new functionality to it.

16
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:19,470
Imagine also that maybe there are thoughts on different ways of doing this. So

17
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:25,060
if we had alternative proposals. Each are provided

18
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:28,826
in the form of some kind of diagram, we could walk through the two diagrams and

19
00:01:28,826 --> 00:01:32,580
see which one, in which one, there's more impact of the change.

20
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:36,700
We might want to go with the solution which has the, the lesser impact. And

21
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:39,850
so imagine this all happening in some kind of design review meeting,

22
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:44,070
in which we systematically go through that proposed changes.

23
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:47,560
The proposed architectural responses to them. And use the gathered

24
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:51,470
information to come, to come to some kind of conclusion about the way forward.
