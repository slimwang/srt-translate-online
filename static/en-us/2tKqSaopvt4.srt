1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:01,980
Here we're talking about
project based learning.

2
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:02,830
And if you're in this class,

3
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:04,460
you're already familiar with
project-based learning,

4
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:07,020
because this entire class
is project-based learning.

5
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:09,025
We built it on that foundation.

6
00:00:09,025 --> 00:00:12,620
Project-based learning is a pedagogical
technique where students learn through

7
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:13,998
big long-term projects.

8
00:00:13,998 --> 00:00:15,690
Sometimes somewhat open-ended,

9
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:19,024
as opposed to through small written
assignments or quizzes or tests.

10
00:00:19,024 --> 00:00:21,638
There are a lot of real benefits
to project-based learning and

11
00:00:21,638 --> 00:00:24,260
one of my favorites is
the idea of authenticity.

12
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:27,720
Typically, when we go into the actual
fields that we're teaching about,

13
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,580
what were our work is,
is actually pretty project-based.

14
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:33,675
We do big long-term projects,
rather than small tasks each day.

15
00:00:33,675 --> 00:00:35,960
And so by teaching students
using project-based learning,

16
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,680
we're not only teaching them
the content we want them to know.

17
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:41,280
But we're also teaching them what
it's like to actually be a part of

18
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,470
that field.

19
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:45,760
And similarly, personalization is
a really big benefit of this as well.

20
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,190
Typically, when students do a project,

21
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:50,210
they actually feel some personal
connection to what they've produced.

22
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:53,560
And some of the projects we've done are
other OMS classes we've seen students

23
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:56,780
really develop the projects and
pursue them after the semester is over.

24
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:59,070
Some of them have gone so
far as to name their projects or

25
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:00,430
give them personalities.

26
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:02,550
There's really a personal
connection between the student and

27
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:04,459
the project that they develop.

28
00:01:04,459 --> 00:01:07,350
The longer term and more open-ended
nature of the project also

29
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:10,360
means that we can do some things
to facilitate real learning.

30
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,860
And the more important
learning strategies that we

31
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:13,250
want students to develop.

32
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:16,700
Things like planning what they're going
to do, monitoring how it's going and

33
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:18,835
adjusting it accordingly if
it's not going very well.

34
00:01:18,835 --> 00:01:20,910
Oftentimes in traditional education,

35
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:23,950
by the time a student recognizes that
what they're doing isn't working.

36
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:26,930
It might be too late to fix it,
if it's a test or a quiz or something.

37
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:30,170
But with projects, the longer term
nature of them gives students time to

38
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:32,550
recognize what I've been working
on isn't really working.

39
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:33,710
How can I evaluate it?

40
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:35,180
How can I recover?

41
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:37,590
So there are a lot of benefits
of project-based learning.

42
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:40,455
The difficulty is that they
aren't always easy to implement

43
00:01:40,455 --> 00:01:42,105
in a regular classroom.

44
00:01:42,105 --> 00:01:44,185
Projects are bigger and
they're open-ended and

45
00:01:44,185 --> 00:01:45,295
they're very personal to students.

46
00:01:45,295 --> 00:01:47,565
And that makes it very difficult
to give students feedback on them,

47
00:01:47,565 --> 00:01:49,355
it makes it difficult to grade projects.

48
00:01:49,355 --> 00:01:50,995
How do you grade two
students that did very,

49
00:01:50,995 --> 00:01:53,945
very different projects if it's
a very open-ended project?

50
00:01:53,945 --> 00:01:57,675
Presents a lot of difficulty, but that's
where technology can really play a role.

51
00:01:57,675 --> 00:02:00,445
Technology gives us
an environment in which we can

52
00:02:00,445 --> 00:02:03,390
allow students to produce
some open-ended projects.

53
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:07,640
And have built in functionalities
to develop their ideas and

54
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,460
construct whatever
they want to construct.

55
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:11,080
And through some
artificial intelligence,

56
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,870
we can actually start to build in
some of that feedback directly into

57
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:14,620
the environment.

58
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:17,920
We can give them feedback right in the
context of what they're doing without

59
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,940
requiring a teacher to be consistently
monitoring what they're doing.

60
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:23,690
So technology can really bring
project-based learning to life.

61
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:26,560
And so we'll talk about the different
ways in which project-based learning can

62
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,250
be done and how technology can help.
