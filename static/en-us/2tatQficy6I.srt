1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,922
So let's do a computer architecture quiz. So,

2
00:00:03,922 --> 00:00:06,846
computer architecture is about how to build faster

3
00:00:06,846 --> 00:00:09,294
transistors out of which we will then build

4
00:00:09,294 --> 00:00:12,558
computers, how to build faster computers, how to build

5
00:00:12,558 --> 00:00:16,570
larger buildings, how to design energy-efficient computers, how

6
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:18,814
to build buildings where we can fit more

7
00:00:18,814 --> 00:00:21,534
computers, and how to build computers that fit

8
00:00:21,534 --> 00:00:25,480
better into buildings. Select all answers that are true.

9
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:26,590
More than one can be correct.
