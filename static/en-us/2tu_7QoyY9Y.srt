00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:04,640
In the first lesson we discussed the
fact that there are two primary types of

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:07,110
experiments, randomized and
matched pair.

3
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:11,110
We covered randomized
experiments in detail, and

4
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:13,800
now we're going to dive into
matched pair design experiments.

5
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:19,180
Remember matched pair design experiments
are usually used when the volume of

6
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:23,290
observations or individuals is
fairly low, the concern for

7
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:27,320
bias is great, and the cost per
observation is high by comparison.

8
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:32,770
Matched pairing sets up treatment and
control groups for an experiment by

9
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:36,800
matching on a unit by unit basis
using a set of control variables.

10
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:41,930
The goal is to create two groups of
units that are as similar as possible to

11
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:46,390
each other, so that we can confidently
say that any changes during the test

12
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:48,840
are due to the introduction
of the experimental variable.

13
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:55,010
A mathematical algorithm is used to
create the treatment control groups

14
00:00:55,010 --> 00:01:00,240
where for each treatment unit, one or
more control units is selected.

15
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,230
Before we dive into this process,

16
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:04,940
let's first discuss how to
select treatment units.
