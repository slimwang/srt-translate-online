00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:03,270
We are beginning a lesson on network security.

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:05,750
Lets first talk about why we need network security

3
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:08,600
in the first place. The Internet is actually subject

4
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:12,390
to a wide variety of attacks on various parts

5
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:14,500
of the infrastructure. One part of the infrastructure

6
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:17,720
that can be attacked is routing. So the internet's

7
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:21,530
routing protocol, the border gateway protocol, is notorious for

8
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:26,220
being susceptible to different kinds of attacks. For example,

9
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:30,805
on April 8, 2010, China advertised about

10
00:00:30,805 --> 00:00:33,870
50,000 blocks of IP addresses from 170 different

11
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:36,850
countries. The event lasted for about 20 minutes.

12
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:39,050
In this particular case, the hijack appears to

13
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:42,710
have been accidental. Because the prefixes were long

14
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:46,100
enough such that they didn't disrupt existing routes.

15
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:48,550
But the fact that the route advertisements were

16
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:51,730
allowed to leak in the first place highlights

17
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:55,180
the vulnerability of the border gateway protocol.

18
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:59,200
Effectively, the border gateway protocol. Essentially allows

19
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:06,340
any AS to advertise an IP prefix to a neighboring AS, and that AS will

20
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:09,630
typically just believe that route advertisement and

21
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:10,870
advertise it to the rest of the

22
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:14,430
internet. These events that occur where an

23
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:16,740
AS advertises a prefix that it does not

24
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:22,740
own are called route highjacks. And they tend to occur more often than one might

25
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:28,930
expect. In addition to the event on April 8, 2010, another event in

26
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:32,610
2008 occurred where Pakistan hijacked the YouTube

27
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:35,660
prefixes, potentially as a botched attempt to

28
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:37,460
block Youtube in the country following a

29
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:42,000
government order. Unfortunately, the event resulted in disruption

30
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,140
of connectivity to YouTube for people all around the world. In January of

31
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:50,680
2006, ConEdison accidentally hijacked a lot of

32
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:54,270
transit networks, including level three Unet and

33
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:57,560
several other large ISPs disrupting connectivity

34
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:01,590
to many customers. And on April 25th

35
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:08,020
in 1995, one of the more famous route hijack incidents was the AS7007 incident,

36
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:15,240
where AS7007 advertised all of the IP prefixes on the entire internet. As

37
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:19,170
originating in its own AS, resulting in

38
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:22,360
disruption of connectivity to huge fractions of

39
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:28,090
the Internet. So we've surveyed some famous or, shall we say, notorious attacks

40
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:30,570
on Internet routing, but another part of

41
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:34,170
the infrastructure that's vulnerable Is naming or

42
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:40,720
the DNS. One very popular and effective means of mounting an attack on the

43
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,490
naming system is through something called reflection.

44
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:47,110
DNS reflection is a way of generating

45
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:49,900
very large amounts of traffic targeted at

46
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:53,010
a victim. In an attack called Distributed

47
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:56,950
Denial of Service, or DDos attack. Another

48
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:59,420
type of attack on the naming system is

49
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:02,730
Phishing, whereby an attacker exploits the domain

50
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:05,490
name system in an attempt to trick a

51
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:09,530
user into revealing personal information, such as passwords

52
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:12,450
on a rogue website. In general, denial of

53
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:15,810
service attacks are extremely common and can be

54
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:18,970
mounted in a variety of different ways. DNS

55
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:21,940
reflection is just one way that distributed denial

56
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:24,630
of service attacks are mounted. We'll explore some

57
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:28,330
others later on in this lesson. It's worth asking why

58
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:31,390
the internet is so vulnerable to different kinds of attacks.
