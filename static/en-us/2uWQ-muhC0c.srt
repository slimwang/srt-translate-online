00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,230
Say I'm trying to build a game that
lets people build their own robots but

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:06,050
I'm not sure what I want
the icon to look like.

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:11,012
Let's consider these three options for
an icon and decide on a best design.

4
00:00:11,012 --> 00:00:14,160
Our first choice,
is a picture of nuts and

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,120
bolts that says robot on it and
this one is not very good.

6
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:21,030
I don't think I'd be able to read
the label if it gets any smaller,

7
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:22,900
like if it's displayed on my phone.

8
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:25,290
And the colors aren't very eye catching.

9
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:26,980
The second is a picture of a large R.

10
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,660
This one is readable and
has a nice bold green background but

11
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:34,260
it doesn't really tell me
what the game's about.

12
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:38,740
Labels like this work for established
brands, think of the Facebook F but

13
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:40,960
otherwise, a person browsing
will more want more information.

14
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,960
And the last option is, a picture of a
robot with the screw going in his head.

15
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:49,290
It's colorful and descriptive.

16
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:53,775
We immediately know that the game Is
about robots, and there's no small text.

17
00:00:53,775 --> 00:00:55,755
So, this looks like the best choice.

18
00:00:55,755 --> 00:00:58,965
The next thing a person will see
in the app store after your icon,

19
00:00:58,965 --> 00:01:00,845
is the game screenshots and description.

20
00:01:00,845 --> 00:01:02,415
So, let's learn more about these next.
