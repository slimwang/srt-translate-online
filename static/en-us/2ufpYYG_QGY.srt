1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,070
Now we have looked at strategy selection a little bit, let us look at

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:07,000
strategy integration. Even if the agent selects a particular strategy,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,100
it is not necessarily stuck with that strategy. As the problem-solving evolves,

4
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:14,740
it may well decide to shift from one strategy to another strategy.

5
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:17,660
As an example, consider that for a given problem,

6
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:21,430
metacognition decides to select the strategy of case-based reasoning.

7
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:25,710
Now case-based reasoning spawns a number of sub-tasks. Retrieval, adaptation,

8
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:30,100
evaluation, and storage. Metacognition can now examine the requirements for

9
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:34,520
each of the sub-tasks. And then, with each of the sub-tasks,

10
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:38,770
it may decide on some strategy. For example, for the task of adaptation,

11
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:42,450
metacognition may pick the method of case-based reasoning recursively. Or

12
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:46,090
it may pick the method of rules to adapt a case. Or it may use models for

13
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:50,390
the case adaptation. If metacognition picks the method of rule based reasoning,

14
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:53,495
then note that metacognition has shifted from the method of

15
00:00:53,495 --> 00:00:56,571
case-based reasoning overall to the method of rule-based reasoning. For

16
00:00:56,571 --> 00:01:00,840
a sub-task of case-based reasoning. We can also use a similar analysis at

17
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:04,715
the next lower level. Suppose that metacognition decides to pick the method of

18
00:01:04,715 --> 00:01:08,720
rule-based reasoning for doing the case adaptation. Now the question becomes,

19
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:14,520
what rule to apply. Rule 1, 2, or 3. We can imagine meta-rules that select,

20
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:17,500
which rule to apply in any given condition.

21
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:21,300
We've come across a use of metacognition for strategy integration earlier.

22
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:26,934
And this blocks microworld, we saw how means [INAUDIBLE] can reach a cul-de-sac.

23
00:01:26,934 --> 00:01:31,340
When the cul-de-sac happens, metacognition may, set up a new reasoning goal and

24
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:35,370
select a strategy of problem reduction for resolving the cul-de-sac. Problem

25
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:39,610
reduction then, sets up four independent goals. We made it work back to mean

26
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:44,150
internal assist to achieve each goal independently. In this particular case,

27
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:47,050
we have integrated means and internal assistance and problem reduction and

28
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:50,420
the reasoning has shifted between these two strategies in a seamless way.
