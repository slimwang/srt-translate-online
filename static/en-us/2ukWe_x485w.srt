1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:05,810
So we mentioned that you could use
Lucas and Kanade between frames and,

2
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:11,000
and use the, the, the Shi-Tomasi way of,
of finding features small displacements.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,820
But what if there
are large displacements,

4
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:17,790
what if things have moved a lot
because they're moving quickly?

5
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:19,030
Well.

6
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:21,450
One thing we do is we do know
that we can build a descriptor.

7
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:22,650
Remember the sift descriptor.

8
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:25,300
So that if you found a matching point

9
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:27,730
I'd be able to say yeah I'm
pretty sure that's a match.

10
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:31,130
But the question was how would
I decide where to find it?

11
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:34,700
So when we were doing the ransack
method of finding those panoramas

12
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:38,540
you remember we essentially com,
compared all of these with all of those.

13
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:41,290
Found the putative matches,
selected a bunch, and

14
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:44,240
then tried to find something
that gave us a consistent model.

15
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:47,930
So you're doing a lot of work
in order to try to globally find

16
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:50,330
all of these kinds of things.

17
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:52,320
For tracking, what we want is, well,

18
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,060
first of all we typically
want real time methods.

19
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:57,050
Because we want this thing to
operate as things are moving along.

20
00:00:57,050 --> 00:00:58,720
And in particular, we,

21
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:02,090
we want this notion of
a coherent tract result, right?

22
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:04,019
So we're not going to try to
match everything in one frame

23
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:04,840
to everything in another.

24
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,420
And then do it again,
and then do it again.

25
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:07,710
And do it again, and do it.

26
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:09,070
See?
So, you just saw my head

27
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:10,660
rotating around.

28
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:12,070
I hope you're paying attention.

29
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:16,960
So they idea is that you have
this smooth, coherent trajectory.

30
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,340
And that's what we want to do for
tracking.

31
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:20,930
And in order to do that.

32
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:22,960
We have to worry about the dynamics.

33
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,490
That is, how are things moving,
how are they changing?

34
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:31,580
So, when we do tracking
with dynamics the key idea

35
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:34,440
is we've got some sort
of model of the motion.

36
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:38,830
Maybe we're updating that model, like
the velocity and acceleration, but using

37
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:43,920
that model we want to predict where the
objects will be in the next frame and

38
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,120
then we're going to look
around that area, okay?

39
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:52,910
And that prediction will allow us to
restrict where we're doing the search,

40
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:57,930
and the other thing is if we have a
noisy detection, that is our ability to

41
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:02,760
knowing where this thing is not perfect,
we should get a better overall estimate,

42
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:06,310
because we're combining a prediction
with the measurement, so

43
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:08,550
that's the idea of
tracking with dynamics.
