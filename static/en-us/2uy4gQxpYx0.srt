00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,150
Remember these four functions that we played with at the very beginning of our

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:07,007
discussion of Rational functions. Well, we're going to play with them a little

3
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:11,001
bit more right now, except I'd like to make one change to each of them. I want

4
00:00:11,001 --> 00:00:14,932
to add in some absolute value signs. Take a second right now to predict how the

5
00:00:14,932 --> 00:00:18,004
addition of these absolute value signs to each of these functions is going to

6
00:00:18,004 --> 00:00:22,690
change the way that their graphs look. Now that you've had a chance to make

7
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:27,091
your prediction, here are the graphs of our functions. You however, need to

8
00:00:27,091 --> 00:00:30,680
tell me which graph goes with each function. Pick some points to test out and

9
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:33,859
then put the letter of the graph next to the function it belongs with.
