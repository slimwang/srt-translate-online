1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,295
Pretty simplistic is how this comes forward. We pass in a unique identifier

2
00:00:03,295 --> 00:00:06,310
that represents the object, plus the guid that represents this unique identity

3
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:09,669
in the world, as well as a pointer to the this object.
