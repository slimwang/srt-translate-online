00:00:00,006 --> 00:00:04,093
Now you've seen that mathematicians like to name functions simple things, like

2
00:00:04,093 --> 00:00:08,048
the letter f. And we've also seen that the input of a function is some sort of

3
00:00:08,048 --> 00:00:12,224
independent variable, and we've seen that x can be that variable. But we don't

4
00:00:12,224 --> 00:00:16,378
have to use these names, f and x, for these functions and independent variables.

5
00:00:16,378 --> 00:00:20,672
We can actually use pretty much anything we want to use. Remember, variables are

6
00:00:20,672 --> 00:00:24,702
just placeholders for things that have different meanings in different real

7
00:00:24,702 --> 00:00:28,809
world situations. What if instead of f of x, we have g of u? In this case, what

8
00:00:28,809 --> 00:00:32,844
is the name of the function? And what is the independent variable that's being

9
00:00:32,844 --> 00:00:34,010
used in that function?
