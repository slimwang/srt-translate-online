00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:04,274
All of these Exception types we've seen are part of an Exception Hierarchy. They

2
00:00:04,274 --> 00:00:08,542
inherit from the Exception class. The Standard Error type is a sub-class of

3
00:00:08,542 --> 00:00:12,476
Exception. And they're many different sub-classes of Standard Error, including

4
00:00:12,476 --> 00:00:16,181
the Assertion Error. This is the one that gets raised when an Assertion fails.

5
00:00:16,181 --> 00:00:20,762
The Environment Error, and this gets raised when something in the execution

6
00:00:20,762 --> 00:00:24,894
environment is not as we expect. An example of an Environment Error, is the IO

7
00:00:24,894 --> 00:00:28,721
Error that we saw when we couldn't read a file. An IO Error is a subtype of

8
00:00:28,721 --> 00:00:32,942
Environment Error which is a subtype of Standard Error which is a subtype of

9
00:00:32,942 --> 00:00:37,885
Exception. This is why when we have Exception It handles an IO Error, as well as

10
00:00:37,885 --> 00:00:41,986
an Assertion Error. Another type of Error would be a Lookup Error. This happens

11
00:00:41,986 --> 00:00:45,193
when something we're looking for doesn't exist. And there are two kinds of

12
00:00:45,193 --> 00:00:49,639
Lookup Errors. An Index Error that happens when we access outside the bounds of

13
00:00:49,639 --> 00:00:53,888
a list, for example. And a Key Error that happens when we look for a key that

14
00:00:53,888 --> 00:00:55,793
doesn't exist in the dictionary.
