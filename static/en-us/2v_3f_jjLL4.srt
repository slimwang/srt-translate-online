1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,660
Virtualization has made
the lives of software developers

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:07,860
much easier by streamlining
the process to deploy software.

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:10,270
So what's virtualization anyway?

4
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:15,550
Virtual machines, also known as virtual
servers, are full-fledged computers with

5
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:22,160
CPU, memory, and storage, but it's all
virtual or simulated, not physical.

6
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,990
They have operating systems,
files, and applications.

7
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:31,010
They don't necessarily live inside
a physical server on a one-to-one ratio.

8
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:36,500
In fact, several virtual machines can
live within a single physical server.

9
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:40,630
To the outside world, there's really no
difference between a physical server and

10
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:42,400
a virtual server.

11
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:47,730
They both can serve up websites,
host applications, and contain data.

12
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:51,770
You can spin up a virtual
machine on a desktop PC,

13
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:54,400
on a server, or in the cloud.

14
00:00:56,930 --> 00:00:58,942
Why would you want to
use virtual machines?

15
00:00:58,942 --> 00:01:00,980
Let's look at a few use cases.

16
00:01:02,058 --> 00:01:04,599
Say you want to set up
a testing environment that is

17
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:06,160
a mirror image of production.

18
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:10,970
Virtual machines will allow you
to do this quickly and securely.

19
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:15,980
You can also run single purpose virtual
machines to support a database,

20
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:18,570
authentication services,
or log aggregation.

21
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:24,030
You can use virtual machines to
create high availability clusters and

22
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:24,940
minimize downtime.

23
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:30,580
By using virtual machines, you can
allow for the redundancy and failover

24
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:34,670
that was previously possible only with
the purchase of additional hardware.

25
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:39,175
And there are many other possible
applications, these are just a few.

26
00:01:40,715 --> 00:01:44,165
Now let's look at the similarities and
differences between servers and

27
00:01:44,165 --> 00:01:44,935
virtual machines.

28
00:01:45,985 --> 00:01:50,579
Both servers and virtual machines run
operating systems and applications,

29
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:56,820
serve up websites and respond to pings,
and they can be networked.

30
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:00,100
In contrast to servers,

31
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:05,350
virtual machines don't have
a one-to-one relationship to hardware.

32
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:08,400
You can run several virtual machines
on a single piece of equipment.

33
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:13,360
They allow you to add hard drive
space or memory much more easily.

34
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,290
You don't have to buy a new
server when you run out of space.

35
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:19,210
They boot faster and are easier to move.

36
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:23,600
They require more processing power and
memory.

37
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,140
This is especially true for
hosted virtual machines.

38
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:30,950
They're easier to troubleshoot, and
they have different requirements for

39
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:31,500
security.
