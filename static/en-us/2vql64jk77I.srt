1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:02,420
Strong correlations might not always be a good

2
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:05,270
thing. Let's hear from Mora about why we

3
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:07,630
look at correlation in the first place, and

4
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:09,630
what it can tell us about two variables.

5
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:12,450
>> So in addition to doing scatter plots where you can visually

6
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:16,940
see how related two variables are typically, I will actually measure their

7
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:19,520
correlation coefficient to really quantify how

8
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,910
correlated they are. This is really

9
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:25,500
important, because a lot of the data that I work with is correlated

10
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,380
with each other. So, for example, looking at Facebook

11
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:32,130
data, how many status updates someone posts in a month

12
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:35,640
is really highly correlated usually with how many days

13
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,430
in the last month they logged in, or how many

14
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:41,200
friends they have, or how many photos they uploaded

15
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,260
in the last Month. All of these variables are typically

16
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:47,230
very highly related, and it's usually because they all kind

17
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:51,850
of measure the same thing. It's how engaged someone is.

18
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:54,690
And so typically, when I'm working on a problem and I'm

19
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:57,590
going to be doing some kind of regression where I'm modeling something,

20
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:00,600
I'm going to be throwing some of these variables into the regression.

21
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,940
And one of the assumptions of regression is these variables are

22
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:05,740
independent of each other. And so if any two are too

23
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:08,620
highly correlated with each other, it will be really difficult to

24
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:12,630
tell which ones are actually driving the phenomenon. And so it's

25
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:17,070
important to measure the correlation between your variables first, often because

26
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:20,250
it'll help you determine which ones you don't actually want to throw in

27
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:23,358
together, and it might help you decide which ones you actually want to keep.
