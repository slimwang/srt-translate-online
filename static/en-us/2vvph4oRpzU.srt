1
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:05,040
Simone says for the footer can I just
call the display contact function and

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,162
append it to the footer,

3
00:00:06,162 --> 00:00:12,270
although the header already displays
the same contact information?

4
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:16,870
Yes you'll probably need a slightly
different function just because you're,

5
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:23,230
well or it could be this, it depends
on how you define it but if you write

6
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:26,960
something that adds the information in
the same way, just to a different div,

7
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,920
then sure, give that a shot,
reuse your code, that's great.

8
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:34,760
It is true that it's just repeating
the same information, but

9
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:38,750
that's just to sort of remind you at
the end that, by the way, here I am,

10
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:40,600
now that you finished
looking at my resume,

11
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,530
here's my contact information again,
thanks a lot.

12
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:46,540
Comment really from Simone
who says believe it or not,

13
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:49,930
I actually really like the colors
on the resume as it is,

14
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:51,355
would you recommend that
I change it anyway?

15
00:00:51,355 --> 00:00:54,060
No, if you love it you don't have to.

16
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,800
Thank you for saying that you like it.

17
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,590
We'll have to pass that
on to the designers so

18
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:03,600
don't feel like you have to change it.

19
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,180
But maybe for practice you might,
you might do it.

20
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:13,080
With data.otherfunction, function
declaration, I'll switch back over.

21
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:18,450
Do you still need the var other
function statement or is it okay,

22
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:22,290
is the data period other function
equal function statement sufficient?

23
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:23,980
Do you need var in that?

24
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:27,880
>> When you're adding a function
to an existing object, so,

25
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:30,787
in this case we have data,
which is our object, and

26
00:01:30,787 --> 00:01:36,460
then we added this function called
other function to data down here.

27
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:37,730
And we we went through that.

28
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:41,460
You actually don't need var in this
case because all we're doing is

29
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,600
adding something to
something that exists.

30
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,210
And because data had already
existed we're just adding to it and

31
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:52,000
not creating a new function or
a new variable or anything like that.

32
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,955
And because of that,
you actually don't need to use var.

33
00:01:55,490 --> 00:02:01,300
>> So she's asking in project two,
do we have to put all the info that is

34
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:06,570
named your education image
into resumeBuilder.js.file?

35
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:13,160
Does that mean that we do not do
any in line text in the html file?

36
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,705
So the html file is, yeah,

37
00:02:15,705 --> 00:02:21,260
I don't think you have to in
line anything in the html file.

38
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:26,548
Everything that you work on
is on the JavaScript file,

39
00:02:26,548 --> 00:02:32,840
so I think it's best practice
to sort of just do all your

40
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:38,510
processing and rendering the data
within JavaScript functions,

41
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:42,170
and then calling those functions
within your html file.

42
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:42,830
>> Yeah.

43
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:43,340
>> Yeah.

44
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:47,747
>> Everything, all the information
about your resume, all the information,

45
00:02:47,747 --> 00:02:50,954
everything goes into your
resumeBuilder.js.file.

46
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:53,600
>> Michelle Cry says,

47
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,980
how do you make a resume interactive
when they usually contain a static view?

48
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:58,135
>> Okay, yeah that's a great question.

49
00:02:58,135 --> 00:02:58,740
[CROSSTALK]
>> Good question.

50
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:00,310
>> So, in our instance,

51
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:06,170
we're actually adding the sort of
interactive component with map.

52
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:06,700
>> Yeah.
>> So

53
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:10,100
it's either going to be a map of where
you either worked or gone to school and

54
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:15,380
it'll be very similar to like a Google
map, any sort of map you see online.

55
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:19,390
Now that will sort of be the interactive
element that we're requiring.

56
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:25,060
But just sort of in general I mean,
you can take a look at, search for

57
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:29,250
resumes online of web developers or go
to any sort of web developer website and

58
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,120
their resume is usually on there.

59
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,710
And there's some interactive elements.

60
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:38,950
Sometimes it's just as simple
as the navigation menu bar

61
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:44,350
moving in a certain way, or disappearing
as you scroll down the page.

62
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:50,140
Or it could be as crazy as
something like parts of the resume

63
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:54,420
come flying into the page or there's
a background photo and the background

64
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:57,380
photo changes as you scroll through
the resume and stuff like that.

65
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:02,200
I've seen a lot of really interesting
and creative ones out there.

66
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:08,050
There's really no limit what you can do,
it's kind of like being an art student.

67
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:13,090
You're limited by how much you're
willing to put into the project.

68
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:17,510
>> I found a lot of JavaScript
codes online that I want to use.

69
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:20,690
Can I copy it and use it as long as I
understand it and can fully explain it?

70
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:22,680
Absolutely.
>> Yeah.

71
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:26,450
I mean that's 90 percent of what
a lot of web developers do.

72
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:30,119
I think, is they go online they
read code, they reuse code.

73
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:35,090
Gosh, I don't know where I would
be if I didn't have the internet.

74
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:38,416
>> Yeah, I would still be stuck
trying to learn CSS right now.

75
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:40,295
>> [LAUGH]
>> I would be like,

76
00:04:40,295 --> 00:04:42,326
how do I flush out a box?

77
00:04:42,326 --> 00:04:43,447
Do I need to look up the book?

78
00:04:43,447 --> 00:04:44,988
No.

79
00:04:44,988 --> 00:04:49,450
This one good thing about web
development, everything is open.

80
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:50,740
>> Right.

81
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:54,930
You can look at, if you find a cool
site or you found something really cool,

82
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:59,150
local function, you just open up
your code and see what did they do.

83
00:04:59,150 --> 00:04:59,800
>> Yeah.

84
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:05,185
>> Now it's like, as long as you
attribute that code, making sure that,

85
00:05:05,185 --> 00:05:08,855
okay, I just commented on it or
I found this little code here,

86
00:05:08,855 --> 00:05:10,755
this little snippet, this is what it is.

87
00:05:10,755 --> 00:05:13,735
People will usually find what that is.

88
00:05:13,735 --> 00:05:17,225
>> Yeah, that's what I usually do,
too, is when I find, a piece of

89
00:05:17,225 --> 00:05:20,205
code online and I'm like, this
pretty much knows what I want to do.

90
00:05:20,205 --> 00:05:22,865
And I don't want to fight it too much.

91
00:05:22,865 --> 00:05:27,005
I always leave a little comment and
I put the url in the comments.

92
00:05:27,005 --> 00:05:28,060
>> Exactly.

93
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:32,060
>> Cite the person just like you would
if you're writing an essay, right?

94
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:32,940
>> Yeah.

95
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:35,370
>> You mark it,
you put it in the footer.

96
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:39,880
And that way if I'm looking, going
back and looking through my code and

97
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:43,200
I'm looking at, how did I figure
this out, where did I get this from?

98
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:46,510
It gives me a chance to go back and
look at, yeah, that's right,

99
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:48,110
this person did this.

100
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:51,770
And on top of that it also kind of gets
me to kind of look at the other things

101
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:55,674
that maybe that person has done too, and
it sort of opens my eyes to some other

102
00:05:55,674 --> 00:05:59,300
ways of solving some different
problems I may not have thought about.

103
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,990
So it's a great way, I mean, looking for

104
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:05,790
ways that people have done certain
things online is a great way to learn.

105
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:10,020
An easy way to do this, I mean,
is just to go to any website.

106
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:13,710
And if you see something that is
really fascinating like I said,

107
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:17,078
maybe there's some moving part and
you're like, woah, how did they do that?

108
00:06:17,078 --> 00:06:20,530
You can usually go,
look at the dev tools,

109
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:23,320
look at the source code for the page and

110
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:27,670
kind of figure out what they did there
and try to mimic that on your site.

111
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:29,800
It's a really fun learning
experience doing that.

112
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:37,970
The one thing I will say though is if
you do you use something, make sure

113
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:41,590
it's stylistically good like it's under
the style guide that we're providing.
