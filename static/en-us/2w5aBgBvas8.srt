The answer is a large bacteria. Matt's going to tell you why.

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:09,420
>> Believe it or not, an Amoeba has more than 66 times more DNA than humans do.

3
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:16,128
While and Amoeba has 200 billion letters, humans only have 3 billion. So as you

4
00:00:16,128 --> 00:00:21,750
can see, it's not the amount of DNA that makes a species complex. Otherwise,

5
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:26,158
the Amoeba would be the most complex organism of all. Instead, it matters what

6
00:00:26,158 --> 00:00:30,903
the sequence of those letters in your DNA are, because they code very specific

7
00:00:30,903 --> 00:00:38,029
instructions. Next, we'll see how that code can be turned into flesh and blood.
