00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,730
So here's my version of the filterPlayground method.

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:05,350
You might have called your method something different,

3
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:07,240
that's perfectly fine it doesn't matter what you

4
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:10,804
called it. So I return, list of type conference.

5
00:00:10,804 --> 00:00:14,000
And here I create the initial query where

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,290
I'm loading all the conferences sorted by name. And

7
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:21,950
then I add the filter. To filter on

8
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:25,370
city equals London. And I add the second filter,

9
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:28,610
to filter on topics equals medical innovations. Then I

10
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:31,440
call list on the query and I return the

11
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:35,880
results. You can also string everything together into one

12
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:39,390
long statement like this, but I prefer the code

13
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:41,900
to be broken up into smaller chunks for readability.

14
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:45,930
Now you know how to filter queries by property.

15
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:48,190
Obviously this function we just wrote is very hard

16
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:50,560
wired, and you would more typically let user pick

17
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:53,720
which values to filter on. And you'll learn how to do that soon.
