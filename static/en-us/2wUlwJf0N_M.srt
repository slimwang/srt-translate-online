1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:04,460
Now, I'll run git log on my new repository to see what commits it has.

2
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:08,710
I get the error message, fatal: bad default revision HEAD.

3
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:11,180
Now, head is git's name for the current commit.

4
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:14,840
So, this error message is letting me know that I can't view my commit history,

5
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:17,120
because there aren't any commits yet.

6
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:21,260
To see that this really is a git repository, I can run git status.

7
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:23,320
Status is a command I like to run frequently,

8
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:26,620
because it shows which files have changed since the last commit.

9
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:29,390
Right now, I can see that I'm on the master branch.

10
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:31,880
We'll discuss what that means later in this lesson.

11
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:34,800
Now, git would ordinarily show the most recent commit.

12
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,770
But since there isn't one, it says initial commit here.

13
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:39,600
And git says that my three files are untracked,

14
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,560
because its not tracking the history of those files yet.

15
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:45,570
Now, go ahead and follow the same steps to create a repository for

16
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:46,830
your reflections.

17
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:48,530
Run the commands git init and

18
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:51,590
git status in the directory where you've created your reflections.

19
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:54,510
When you're finished, paste the output of git status into this box.
