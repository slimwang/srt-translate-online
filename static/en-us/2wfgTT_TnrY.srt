Thanks for
getting back to me on that one.

00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:04,919
The issue here is the level
of nesting that we see.

3
00:00:04,919 --> 00:00:08,150
For example, everything is
pretty much in the user mode.

4
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:11,257
Meaning that, when we need to download
the information about Walter,

5
00:00:11,257 --> 00:00:14,810
which is all stored within here,
you also download all of Walter's lists.

6
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:17,770
And Walter's lists, in turn,
include shopping list items.

7
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:21,399
So, let's say that you wanted to at
any point display a list of users that

8
00:00:21,399 --> 00:00:22,183
are in the app.

9
00:00:22,183 --> 00:00:24,508
You'd have to download all
of this extra data for

10
00:00:24,508 --> 00:00:27,468
every single user just to display
something like their name.

11
00:00:27,468 --> 00:00:30,468
[MUSIC]

12
00:00:30,468 --> 00:00:32,140
It sounds like JP is calling.

13
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:32,960
Let's see what he has to say.
