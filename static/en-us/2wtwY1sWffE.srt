1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,920
Up until this point we've been computing
statistics about individual stocks.

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:09,258
We're going to shift now to
computing statistics on portfolios.

3
00:00:09,258 --> 00:00:12,860
We're going to focus on some of the most
important statistics that are used to

4
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:17,950
evaluate the performance of portfolios
and accordingly portfolio managers.

5
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:22,590
We'll define a portfolio as an
allocation of funds to a set of stocks.

6
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:27,025
For the moment, we're going to follow a
buy-and-hold strategy where we invest in

7
00:00:27,025 --> 00:00:29,335
a set of stocks with
a certain allocation and

8
00:00:29,335 --> 00:00:32,320
then observe how things
go moving forward.

9
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,234
We'll assume the allocations sum to 1.0.
