1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:04,786
There are quite a few materials that are nearly diffuse reflectors such as rough

2
00:00:04,786 --> 00:00:09,191
wood, newspaper, concrete, and mouse pad. However, a considerable number of

3
00:00:09,191 --> 00:00:13,755
surfaces are shiny or glossy. We call these specular materials. Examples include

4
00:00:13,755 --> 00:00:18,263
polish metals, plastics, polish wood, glass, glazed ceramics, and enamel paint.

5
00:00:18,263 --> 00:00:23,015
These materials look different when you view them different angles, so we need

6
00:00:23,015 --> 00:00:27,754
to take into account the direction from the surface to the eye. One standard way

7
00:00:27,754 --> 00:00:31,780
of simulating specular materials is called the Blinn-Phong Reflection Model

8
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:35,656
named after its inventors, Jim Blinn and Bui Tuong Phong. The full model has a

9
00:00:35,656 --> 00:00:38,971
number of terms in it for self-shadowing and for a shininess factor called the

10
00:00:38,971 --> 00:00:43,760
Fresnel coefficent. But the simplest and most common form is this. Specular

11
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:50,163
equals the maximum of N dot H or 0, whichever is larger, raised to a power. N is

12
00:00:50,163 --> 00:00:55,275
the surface normal, same as with diffuse material. H is called the half angle

13
00:00:55,275 --> 00:00:59,452
vector. Say, you're given a surface, a light source direction, and a viewer

14
00:00:59,452 --> 00:01:04,998
direction. How would you point a mirror so that the light reflected directly

15
00:01:04,998 --> 00:01:09,398
toward the viewer? The answer is the half angle vector, which is the vector

16
00:01:09,398 --> 00:01:13,920
halfway between these two directions, so that these two angles are equal. If the

17
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,616
surface normal and the half angle are identical, then the surface is perfectly

18
00:01:17,616 --> 00:01:21,670
aligned to reflect light to the eye. So, N dot H would be 1, and all light is

19
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:27,080
reflective. As the normal and the half angle diversion direction, N dot H

20
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:32,274
becomes smaller. Once the angle between these vectors is 90 degrees, the

21
00:01:32,274 --> 00:01:37,474
contribution goes to 0. The maximum function here limits the inputs so that this

22
00:01:37,474 --> 00:01:41,075
value is never negative. We want to avoid it being negative because we're about

23
00:01:41,075 --> 00:01:45,126
to raise it to a power. The S factor here is the shininess or specular power,

24
00:01:45,126 --> 00:01:49,094
and has a range from 1 to infinity, though anything above 100 is not too much

25
00:01:49,094 --> 00:01:53,960
different. When you raise a fraction to a power, the result is smaller, and

26
00:01:53,960 --> 00:02:00,098
smaller still the higher the power. For example, 0.5 squared is 0.25, cubed, is

27
00:02:00,098 --> 00:02:04,978
0.125, and so on. By raising this term to a higher power, the object appears

28
00:02:04,978 --> 00:02:09,247
shinier. We can see this in the graph of N dot H versus the specular intensity.

29
00:02:09,247 --> 00:02:13,408
As the cosine power rises, the slope becomes tighter and tighter and gets

30
00:02:13,408 --> 00:02:17,442
sharper. What the half angle represents is the distribution of microfacets on a

31
00:02:17,442 --> 00:02:21,836
surface. A microfacet is a way of thinking how a material reflects light. For

32
00:02:21,836 --> 00:02:26,230
example, a fairly smooth surface may look like this. Light coming in from one

33
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:30,038
direction will bounce off the surface mostly in the reflection direction. A

34
00:02:30,038 --> 00:02:34,068
rougher surface will a lower shininess has a distribution of facets more like

35
00:02:34,068 --> 00:02:37,974
this and the light will still go in the reflection direction, but with a much

36
00:02:37,974 --> 00:02:41,850
wider dispersal. At this point, it's best for you to try out the specular power

37
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:45,688
function and see how it responds. An example program that follows, you control

38
00:02:45,688 --> 00:02:49,760
the ambient, diffuse, and specular contributions. Try playing with the shininess

39
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,843
and other controls to see their effects.
