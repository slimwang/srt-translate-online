00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,764
Let's try adding these two rational expressions together an see if we can get

2
00:00:03,764 --> 00:00:07,708
the correct answer. We're not going to do all of the steps at once instead we're

3
00:00:07,708 --> 00:00:11,734
going to break it down into three pieces let's start with the first one. What do

4
00:00:11,734 --> 00:00:16,254
you think would be the lowest common denominator for these two fractions? Write

5
00:00:16,254 --> 00:00:17,761
your answer here.
