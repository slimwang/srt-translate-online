00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The Euler forward method is pretty simple again and the time

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
that you should find for the explosion should be 0.64.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
This is a diagram resulting from that setting and this really makes it obvious that the solution

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
is escaping to infinity and a finite amount of time.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Actually, this behavior is not that much of a surprise.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
X always has to grow because the right hand side is always positive.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:30,000
The square is always positive and if you're adding to it and dividing by a positive number,

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
but as x grows, the square is going to become really huge,

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:41,000
so the rate of change becomes really huge, which leads to x become even higher and so and so on.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
This is going to escape to infinity in a finite amount of time.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Footnote for the mathematically proficient, what we're getting here

12
00:00:50,000 --> 99:59:59,999
is actually the shifted version of the tangent function.
