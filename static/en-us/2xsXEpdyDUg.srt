00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Now let's see how we can compute the value of a state using these

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
two innovations to work on b and m.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I've modified our routine for value in two ways--

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
one, I've introduced a new line that says if we decide to cut off the search

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
at a particular depth then apply the evaluation function to the state and return that.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Then I've also added some bookkeeping variables.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
One for the current depth, which will get increased as we go along,

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
and then two values called alpha and beta, which are the traditional names,

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
where alpha is the best value found so far for Max along the path

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
that we are currently exploring, and beta is the best value found so far for Min.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Then since we have these extra parameters when we start out,

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:57,000
we would make the call value of our initial state S0 and we're currently at depth zero

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
in the search tree, and we haven't found the best for Max yet so that would be minus infinity,

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:10,000
and the best for Min similarly we haven't found anything there so that would be plus infinity.

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
We call that and then each node we would chose one of these four cases.

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Here's the new definition of maxValue taking the depth

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
and the alpha and beta parameters into account.

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
It's similar to what we had before.

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
We go through all the successors.

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
We take the maximum, and in this case we're incrementing the depth

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
as we call recursively for the value of each node.

22
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
We get the cutoff here if we exceed beta,

23
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
and otherwise we retain alpha as the maximum value to Max so far.

24
00:01:44,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Then we return the final value.
