00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,075
Now let's briefly talk optical disks. An optical disk

2
00:00:04,075 --> 00:00:06,625
is very similar to a hard disk in that

3
00:00:06,625 --> 00:00:09,515
it has a platter that rotates and we store

4
00:00:09,515 --> 00:00:12,776
the bits on the surface of the disk. The

5
00:00:12,776 --> 00:00:16,219
difference is that, instead of there being a head

6
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:18,926
that needs to be placed very close to the

7
00:00:18,926 --> 00:00:21,714
disk surface, we can shoot a laser to the

8
00:00:21,714 --> 00:00:25,486
surface and the reflection from the material here will

9
00:00:25,486 --> 00:00:30,574
tell us whether we have a zero or a one. But many of the other properties of

10
00:00:30,574 --> 00:00:34,350
the optical disks are very similar to hard disks.

11
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:37,818
They have tracks and so on. Unlike hard drives

12
00:00:37,818 --> 00:00:40,889
that tends to be closed units, so you don't

13
00:00:40,889 --> 00:00:44,126
just insert a new hard drive into the machine,

14
00:00:44,126 --> 00:00:47,695
and you don't carry one with you usually, optical

15
00:00:47,695 --> 00:00:50,849
drives don't need the laser to get that close

16
00:00:50,849 --> 00:00:56,821
to the surface so the smudges or dust are less of a problem for it. Basically if

17
00:00:56,821 --> 00:00:59,656
there is a speck of dust here, it doesn't

18
00:00:59,656 --> 00:01:02,653
scratch the laser as it rotates, but a speck

19
00:01:02,653 --> 00:01:05,407
of dust will scratch the magnetic head as

20
00:01:05,407 --> 00:01:08,566
it rotates and probably glue itself to the head

21
00:01:08,566 --> 00:01:12,282
and then the head no longer works. So hard

22
00:01:12,282 --> 00:01:15,778
drives have much more of a problem with dirt,

23
00:01:15,778 --> 00:01:19,027
so they need to be an enclosed case. Because

24
00:01:19,027 --> 00:01:22,310
optical disks suffer less from this problem, we often see

25
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:24,253
them in the form of CDs and DVDs that

26
00:01:24,253 --> 00:01:27,134
we can carry around and even though they get dirty,

27
00:01:27,134 --> 00:01:30,170
we can still read data from them. But as

28
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:34,540
a result of them being portable, they need to be

29
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:37,090
standardized so that we can put a CD or

30
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:40,804
a DVD into any drive that we want. And this

31
00:01:40,804 --> 00:01:45,196
standardization helps improve portability and their usefulness, but

32
00:01:45,196 --> 00:01:48,076
it limits the rate of improvement, because the

33
00:01:48,076 --> 00:01:51,388
technology improves but then that technology needs to

34
00:01:51,388 --> 00:01:54,700
make it through a standards process, where companies

35
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:57,292
agree that something will be a standard and

36
00:01:57,292 --> 00:02:00,190
only then make it into products. So really,

37
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:03,205
the technology can improve relatively rapidly. But we

38
00:02:03,205 --> 00:02:05,830
don't see any of that progress until a new

39
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:08,755
standard is decided on at which point products

40
00:02:08,755 --> 00:02:12,426
are released. In contrast, with hard drives, the whole

41
00:02:12,426 --> 00:02:15,419
enclosure needs to obey some standards about how

42
00:02:15,419 --> 00:02:18,047
to connect to the rest of the computer, but

43
00:02:18,047 --> 00:02:20,748
what happens inside the enclosure can be the

44
00:02:20,748 --> 00:02:25,145
latest and greatest technology in magnetic disks. So usually

45
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:27,745
optical disks are used for pretty much carrying

46
00:02:27,745 --> 00:02:30,630
the data around, storing music, movies and so on.
