00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:05,570
Here the solutions are, negative 23, positive 5 and negative 4x squared minus

2
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:11,174
6x plus 5. Excellent thinking, if you got all those correct. For this first

3
00:00:11,174 --> 00:00:16,430
one, we'll start by finding the f of 2. We'll take 2 and plug that in, for x in

4
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:23,715
the function f. Doing so, we get an output of positive 12. So, when the input

5
00:00:23,715 --> 00:00:30,786
of f is 2, the output is 12. So, we just replace f of 2 with 12. Now we just

6
00:00:30,786 --> 00:00:36,622
need to find g of 12. We let g's input be 12, so negative 2 times 12 is

7
00:00:36,622 --> 00:00:44,256
negative 24, plus 1 is negative 23. This is how we get our first value. For the

8
00:00:44,256 --> 00:00:49,840
second problem, we want to find g of f of 0. So, we start by finding f of 0.

9
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,313
You let x equals 0 for the function f, and then when we solve this, or simplify

10
00:00:54,313 --> 00:01:01,123
it, we get negative 2. So, we know f of 0 equals negative 2. So, we just

11
00:01:01,123 --> 00:01:07,104
replace this value with negative 2. So, letting x equal negative 2 for g, we

12
00:01:07,104 --> 00:01:14,216
get an output of positive 5. This is our second solution. And finally for g of

13
00:01:14,216 --> 00:01:18,548
f of x, we simply take the entire function f of x, and we plug it in as the

14
00:01:18,548 --> 00:01:26,604
input for g of x. So, wherever we see f of x, will replace that with 2x squared

15
00:01:26,604 --> 00:01:33,104
plus 3x minus 2, distribute the negative 2 will have negative 4x squared minus

16
00:01:33,104 --> 00:01:40,810
6x plus 4. And then we'll have plus 1 on the end. Combing these two like terms

17
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:43,270
will have our final composite function.
