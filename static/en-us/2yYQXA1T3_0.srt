1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,570
So how do we do Radiometric Calibration?

2
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:06,490
Again, we're interested in this
pipeline of going from L towards I,

3
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:10,400
but we also want to be able to
model the inverse phenomenon of it.

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:15,875
So let's start off with a Color Chart,
that we know the reflectances of.

5
00:00:15,875 --> 00:00:20,720
What basically means is a color chart
like this comes in predefined and

6
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,200
here basically, just I'm showing
you the gray values here.

7
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:26,818
It shows what are the intensities,
90, 59.1%.

8
00:00:26,818 --> 00:00:30,870
So somebody had sat down and
calibrated this color chart as a perfect

9
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:33,940
color model or gray scale values
that we're interested in.

10
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:37,830
What we want to do is we want to
take multiple exposures from this

11
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:39,000
co, color chart.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,600
Which basically means is I'm
going to take images of this.

13
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,440
What I can do of course is I can take
them at different exposure values.

14
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,240
That basically means I can, you know,
do things like ep, epsilon photography.

15
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:52,060
I can take images at different
exposures, shutter speeds, and

16
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:53,230
all that kind of stuff.

17
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:56,390
That would of course change how,
what kind of intensities for

18
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:59,070
the same image that is out there.

19
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:02,830
Of course, we're basically playing
around on this parameter here to oh,

20
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:05,590
different types of parameters
to get to this value.

21
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:07,120
I'm just showing you an example of this.

22
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,330
So, again,
my pixel values go from zero to 55.

23
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:11,942
This is my scene irradiance.

24
00:01:11,942 --> 00:01:15,950
I'm going to look at irradiance, because
we know scene radiance to ir, irradiance

25
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:19,510
is a linear things and actually we're
more interested in trying to get there.

26
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:21,300
This mapping is something
which is linear.

27
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:23,640
Of course, when done,
we know what's going on.

28
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:27,190
Of course, this basically means is now
everything's projected on a 2D surface,

29
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:29,300
which the information is coming from.

30
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:33,220
So, of course, if I know the scene
irradiance I can plot a point,

31
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:35,460
as I go at different scene irradiance.

32
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:38,900
And of course I can figure out from
this one what is the intensity at each

33
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:39,950
and every pixel.

34
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:43,870
So next part that we can do now, of
course, is after I've drawn this curve,

35
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:50,260
for a specific device or a sensor,
and imaging device like the camera

36
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:53,730
I've done this on by taking in this
case, one image, two image, three, four,

37
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:57,040
five, six, seven images and
I can basically fill in the curve.

38
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,110
Now I can do the opposite, right.

39
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:02,550
If I know a pixel value, or I want to,
curious about a pixel value,

40
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:05,635
can I actually now compute
the scene irradiance?

41
00:02:05,635 --> 00:02:08,520
And that's what this
exercise basically shows.

42
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:13,110
Once I can model this, I can always
come back and I say, okay, what's here?

43
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:15,330
I can figure out the scene
irradiance at this point.

44
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:18,670
Again, scene irradiance here
is going from zero to one.

45
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:21,170
Now, this will allow me to
pick up any values I want.

46
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:24,677
So, of course,
there are few assumptions here, in,

47
00:02:24,677 --> 00:02:27,160
when we play around
with images like this.

48
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:30,310
It assumes constant lighting,
and all patches,

49
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:32,540
basically, are equally well lit.

50
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:34,706
So it can't be a focused light source.

51
00:02:34,706 --> 00:02:38,260
The assumes of light source
is really far away, and

52
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:40,140
is equally lighting the whole scene.

53
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:42,900
So, you know, for example,
something like natural sunlight.

54
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:45,590
When you light with this kind of
stuff we're allowed to do this.

55
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:47,990
A unique inverse exists for

56
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:52,760
g because in this case g is monotonic
and smooth for all types of cameras.

57
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:55,140
And again we will model this for
different cameras and

58
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:56,460
this allows us to compute this.
