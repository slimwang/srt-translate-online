00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:06,322
You're going to create what we call a frequency table. In other words, we count

2
00:00:06,334 --> 00:00:12,832
the frequency of occurrences from each country. One way that I would do this is

3
00:00:12,844 --> 00:00:18,903
to tally it. Starting from here, we have 1 US, 1 Canada, 1 China, US, India,

4
00:00:19,034 --> 00:00:24,279
England, etc. And then, convert each tally to the number. So, go ahead and fill

5
00:00:24,291 --> 00:00:26,132
in each of these frequencies.
