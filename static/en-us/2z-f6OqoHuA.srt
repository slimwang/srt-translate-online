00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:02,009
You may be asking yourself, or

2
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:07,070
at least, I hope you're asking yourself, hey, but what about error handling?

3
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:09,480
I didn't see a .error method on the end of that call.

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,140
And you're right.

5
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:14,750
Because unfortunately, error handling isn't actually built into JSONP.

6
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:20,010
This is a technical limitation because of what's happening behind the scenes.

7
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:22,520
But there are workarounds, like what we're doing here.

8
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:26,960
We can use setTimeout to stop the request if it runs for too long.

9
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,280
Before we run this AJAX request, we'll create this setTimeout function.

10
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:36,940
When we bind wikiRequestTimeout to this setTimeout function, we automatically

11
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:41,770
start a timer that will end 8000 milliseconds later, which is eight seconds.

12
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:44,720
When eight seconds are up, we'll go ahead and change the text of

13
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:49,080
the wiki element on the page to failed to get Wikipedia resources.

14
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,420
This is a nice fall back.

15
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:53,250
This says that if after eight seconds have gone by,

16
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:55,570
change the text on the page to this.

17
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:57,300
But of course there's a problem.

18
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:00,260
If this is all we did we would

19
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:04,860
no matter what overwrite the text inside the Wikipedia element with failed to

20
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:08,060
get Wikipedia resources after eight seconds.

21
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:11,960
In other words, even if this AJAX request came back successful,

22
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,910
this timeout would still occur.

23
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:16,030
These eight seconds would still pass by, and

24
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:20,500
the text of the wiki element would change to failed to get Wikipedia resources.

25
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:24,380
So, we have to add this line here, called clearTimeout, and then pass it

26
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:29,150
the variable of the timeout we created up here, which is wikiRequestTimeout.

27
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:33,700
This clear timeout will clear or stop this timeout from happening.

28
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:36,280
So inside our success method we go ahead and

29
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:41,270
pinned all the articles to the page and then say hey, stop that timeout.

30
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:43,280
We don't need that timeout anymore.

31
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,090
And then, it's all good.

32
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:48,590
There are a few different ways we can handle errors with JSONP requests, but

33
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:50,560
I thought this is a pretty easy way of doing it.
