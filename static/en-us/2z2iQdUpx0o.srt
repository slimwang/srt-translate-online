1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
All right, so to do the last little bit of this proof to show that 3-colorability is NP hard,

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
we're going to show that if we had the ability to solve 3-colorability problems in polynomial time,

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
then we could solve three SAT problems in polynomial time as well,

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
and so what we need to be able to do to show that is if you walk up to me with any 3-CNF formula,

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I can quickly turn it into a 3-colorability problem, which is going to be a graph

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
such that that graph is 3 colorable if and only if the original formula

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
the 3-CNF formula that were given is satisfiable.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
So CNF here just means conjunctive normal form.

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:52,000
It's just that form that I showed you before where the formula is the n of a bunch of clauses

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
and each clause is the or of three literals and each literal is either variable or its negation,

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
not the variable, so you walk up to me with 3-CNF problem,

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I turn that into a 3-colorability problem that can be colored if and only if the formula is satisfiable.

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Sounds like an interesting challenge. So let's get to it. What we're going to be doing is building a graph.

14
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:20,000
We'll start off by creating some nodes with one node for every possible literal in the formula.

15
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
So that's the k different variables of let's say this, just to be concrete.

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:32,000
This formula that we come to has k variables and s clauses and we're going to add three more nodes.

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
We'll call them true, false, and slack. I'm going to connect up the nodes initially as follows.

18
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Each literal will be connected to slack including true and false

19
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
and we're going to connect true and false to each other.

20
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
What that means because there's a little triangle here and

21
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
we're trying see whether or not it's 3-colorable.

22
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,000
The only way that this thing could be 3 colorable is if these three are given three different colors.

23
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,000
So just for concreteness, let's say that the color that slack gets is red.

24
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:15,000
The color that true gets is blue, true blue and the color that false gets is black, black. False won.

25
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:22,000
All right, so the graph that we have so far has the property that each of these literals is

26
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:29,000
going to have be colored either true or false, blue or black, if we're going to 3 color the whole graph.

27
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
So that's good, that kind of make it seem like they're actually getting truth assignments.

28
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,000
We have to be a little careful though because literal Vâ and literal not Vâ can't both be true

29
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
and they can't both be false but that's an easy thing to fix in a graph colorability problem.

30
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
We just connect them with an edge.

31
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,000
So we add one edge for each variable connecting the pair of literals

32
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
that can't both be true and both be false.

33
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Now what happens is the only way that we can 3 color this is if each variable is given a blue for

34
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
either the variable and black for its negation or black for the variable

35
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
and blue for the negation and that's like a truth assignment.

36
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
A true/false assignment to that variable..

37
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
So any possible truth assignment, corresponds to a 3 coloring.

38
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Any possible 3 coloring, corresponds to the truth assignment.

39
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:28,000
So far we're in really good shape as far as capturing the idea of the physics of a SAT problem.
