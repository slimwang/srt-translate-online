00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Let's actually just draw the environments to make it a little easier.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Here's our global environment. x is 11, y is 22.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Here's our new environment. It points up here. x is 33, z is 44.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
A little abbreviated, but you get the idea.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
So if I look up x in the new environment, the answer is right here: 33.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
If I look up y in the global environment, the answer is similarly right there: 22.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Now I'm going to update x in the new environment, and our procedure is,

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
do we have a binding for x in the new environment?

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
We do, so we update that one.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Now when I go to look up x in the new environment, there's an answer right here: 55.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 99:59:59,999
When I go to look up x in the global environment, there's an answer right here: 11.
