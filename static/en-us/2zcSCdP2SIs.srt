1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,960
The only independent set
of size 3 is this one here.

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:07,350
Clearly, we can only include one
vertex from this triangle over here.

3
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:11,800
And the best we can do from these three
over here, is to select these two.

4
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:14,530
And this combination
allows us to do both.
