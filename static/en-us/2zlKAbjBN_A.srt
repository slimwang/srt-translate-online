00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:03,290
You're almost ready to get started. The last thing I'd

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:05,280
like you to do is to read over the rubric, which

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:07,970
is linked in the instructor notes. You can use this rubric

4
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:11,270
to self-assess your work, and to gauge the quality of it.

5
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:14,060
For students enrolled in the full course experience, this is

6
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:16,730
the same rubric that Udacity will use to evaluate your final

7
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:20,070
project. I'm excited to see what all of you can do,

8
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:24,040
and remember, be curious, be sceptical and have fun exploring data.
