1
00:00:00,282 --> 00:00:01,897
And the answer is 1.25.

2
00:00:02,116 --> 00:00:03,732
That’s still a significant number,

3
00:00:03,749 --> 00:00:06,080
but NASA had now all reason to believe

4
00:00:06,172 --> 00:00:07,987
cold temperatures are good for you.

5
00:00:08,246 --> 00:00:10,857
I should say there’s another kind of flaw here,

6
00:00:11,266 --> 00:00:13,081
one we will discuss in a second,

7
00:00:13,295 --> 00:00:14,470
but one that’s kind of often is

8
00:00:14,516 --> 00:00:16,178
the only looked at data with failures,

9
00:00:16,647 --> 00:00:18,508
so that would give us a number

10
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:20,862
that is by definition larger than 1

11
00:00:20,923 --> 00:00:22,738
But most flights had no failures.

12
00:00:22,969 --> 00:00:25,449
So the actual expectation should be even lower.

13
00:00:25,523 --> 00:00:27,624
So NASA was even more confident

14
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:29,516
that this thing could be flown safely.

15
00:00:29,709 --> 00:00:32,000
How wrong they were.
