1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:01,310
At this point,

2
00:00:01,310 --> 00:00:06,160
we now have a basic VR Camera System
that we can throw into any VR scene.

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:07,710
But what's missing?

4
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:10,900
If we look at our app,
versus a normal Google Cardboard app,

5
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:13,140
you'll notice there's
a lot of black space and

6
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:15,970
the images for
each eye are not perfect rectangles.
