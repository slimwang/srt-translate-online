1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,570
A running process is already executing, so

2
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:04,515
it should be marked as a correct answer.

3
00:00:04,515 --> 00:00:10,047
Any of the processes that are in ready state, the CPU is able to execute them.

4
00:00:10,047 --> 00:00:11,510
They're just waiting for

5
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:15,109
the operating system's scheduler to schedule them on the CPU.

6
00:00:15,109 --> 00:00:19,204
You should remember that as soon as a ready process is scheduled on the CPU,

7
00:00:19,204 --> 00:00:23,689
it will continue its execution from the very first instruction that's pointed by

8
00:00:23,689 --> 00:00:25,880
the process program counter.

9
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:29,650
It is possible that this is the very first instruction in the process,

10
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:32,049
if the process entered the ready queue for

11
00:00:32,049 --> 00:00:35,170
the first time after being newly created.

12
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:40,070
And the other option is that it's some other random instruction in the process

13
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:45,300
binary, depending on when the process was interrupted last time.

14
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:49,490
Either when it was interrupted by the scheduler or because it had to stop

15
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:54,550
executing since it had to wait on an I/O or some kind of external event.
