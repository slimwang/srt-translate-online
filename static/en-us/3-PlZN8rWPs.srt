00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,878
This ellipse would be centered at the origin and it would have an a value of 6

2
00:00:03,878 --> 00:00:08,160
and it would have a b value of 4. Great thinking if you got each of these

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:13,132
correct. We know the center is 0,0 since this fits the general formula for our

4
00:00:13,132 --> 00:00:17,230
ellipse. There's no number next to the x inside parenthesis and there's no

5
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:22,752
number next to the y inside our parenthesis. So we know our ellipse is centered

6
00:00:22,752 --> 00:00:26,725
at 0, 0. To find the a value we want to take the square root of this

7
00:00:26,725 --> 00:00:31,668
denominator of 36. And the square root of 36 equals 6 which means we go 6 units

8
00:00:31,668 --> 00:00:37,106
in the left direction and in the right direction. Remember the a term indicated

9
00:00:37,106 --> 00:00:41,632
which way we move in the x direction. Since the a number is directly underneath

10
00:00:41,632 --> 00:00:46,588
the x squared term. For b, we just need to take the square root of 16, which

11
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:51,510
equals 4. So, to get two other points on our ellipse, we move 4 units up from

12
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:56,605
the center, and 4 units down from the center. This gives us four easily

13
00:00:56,605 --> 00:01:01,350
identifiable points, and we can connect our ellipse. Remember that this was our

14
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:05,782
general formula for an ellipse centered at the origin. So we need to find the

15
00:01:05,782 --> 00:01:10,254
square root of 36 and the square root of 16. I think it's always more helpful

16
00:01:10,254 --> 00:01:14,110
to write these as perfect squares if you can. Comparing the equations like

17
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:18,326
this, we can quickly see that the value of a equals 6 and the value of b equals

18
00:01:18,326 --> 00:01:20,020
4.
