00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,103
You've looked at the behavior of f of x equals 4 over x minus 1, around x

2
00:00:04,103 --> 00:00:09,990
equals 1, right in the middle of the graph. But what's the behavior doing far,

3
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:14,960
far to the left, and far, far to the right? It doesn't look like any other

4
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,871
curve we've seen before in the course. Which of these statements right here

5
00:00:18,871 --> 00:00:22,237
probably describes the behavior of this function, as we move far, far away from

6
00:00:22,237 --> 00:00:27,516
the y axis? Does the curve approach the line y equals o, the x axis, from above

7
00:00:27,516 --> 00:00:30,938
but never touch it, as x goes either to positive infinity, or negative

8
00:00:30,938 --> 00:00:36,440
infinity? Does the curve approach y equals 0 from above but not touch it, as x

9
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:41,106
goes to infinity. And does it approach y equals 0 from below as x goes to

10
00:00:41,106 --> 00:00:46,344
negative infinity? Does the curve approach Y equals 0 from below, as x goes to

11
00:00:46,344 --> 00:00:51,721
positive infinity, and from above as x goes to negative infinity? Or does the

12
00:00:51,721 --> 00:00:55,320
curve approach Y equals 0 from below, as x goes to positive infinity and to

13
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,460
negative infinity?
