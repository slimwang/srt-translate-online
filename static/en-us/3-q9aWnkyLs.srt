1
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:04,059
This is the second part
of the two-parter quiz.

2
00:00:04,059 --> 00:00:07,330
In the first part, you created
a store app with static content.

3
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:08,610
In this second phase of development,

4
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:11,220
you'll need to convert
the app to a dynamic one.

5
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:14,790
To do that, you'll need to create a JSON
file with all of the cookie data.

6
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:16,710
Make sure to store it
in the public folder so

7
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:18,820
that the route file can access it.

8
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:21,370
Once the JSON file exists
with the correct data,

9
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:24,020
update the cookies route
file to retrieve that data.

10
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:27,510
It should return an array of objects,
one for each cookie.

11
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:30,180
In the last step, you'll want to update
the cookie template to remove all

12
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:31,690
the hardcoded data.

13
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:34,590
The link to the starter code for
this project is in the instructor notes.

14
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:37,270
When you've finished, the feedback
extension will give you a code.

15
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:38,820
Enter that code on the next page.

16
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:41,285
Ember uses the QUnit testing framework,
and

17
00:00:41,285 --> 00:00:44,110
I've created a number of tests
that you need to satisfy.

18
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:46,960
These tests help guide you through
completing the assignment.

19
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,430
Once all the tests have passed, the
feedback extension will give you a code.

20
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:52,200
Enter that code on the next page.

21
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,057
You can find a link to this project's
test page in the project's readme file.
