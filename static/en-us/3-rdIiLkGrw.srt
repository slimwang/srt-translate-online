00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,610
But suppose you actually wanted to like do something useful.

2
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:06,040
What would be the easy way of doing that?

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:08,400
Well the easy way is I just give you the formula.

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:15,090
So, if M is equal to Q b as I said before, then, the center

5
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:19,920
is just found by taking this quantity above that quantity in a vector.

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,040
So this is a,

7
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:25,360
remember Q is a three by three, so minus Q inverse is a three by three,

8
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:30,960
b is a three by one, so this is a three by one, and then I add the one there,

9
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,580
that is the vector that is the camera center in the world coordinate frame.

10
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:39,380
So if I made, you know, the corner of that table that you can't see,

11
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:43,550
there's really a corner over there, if I said that's the origin, right, and this

12
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:50,450
way is x, and, this way is y, and that way is z, and then I have a camera here.

13
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:53,150
And I, took a look at a bunch of points here, and

14
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:57,370
I gave you the value of those points in this coordinate system, and

15
00:00:57,370 --> 00:01:01,650
then I located those points, in my image plane.

16
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:05,016
And then I did all that math to compute that M vector, and that,

17
00:01:05,016 --> 00:01:07,460
that M matrix, and then I pulled out the three by three and

18
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:10,440
called that Q and three by one and called that b.

19
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:16,890
And then I took minus Q inverse times b over one, that, vector would

20
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:22,080
be the actual location of this camera in that coord, world coordinate system.

21
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,420
Pretty, pretty cool.
