1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:02,540
And actually that ends this lesson.

2
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:07,500
Essentially we're using filters to localize interesting areas in

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:12,640
the image that have some sort of property that makes the filter respond well.

4
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:15,930
So what we're going to do going forward is we'll use some special filters to

5
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:18,810
compute some functions, like smoothing, but

6
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:23,090
also to sort of find strong responses just like the templates.

7
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:25,610
And we'll do that actually in the next couple of lessons.
