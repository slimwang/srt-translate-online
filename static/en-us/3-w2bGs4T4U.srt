>> Now that we have our equation in this form, factored and everything, I'd like

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:08,429
you to tell me at what values of x does this parabola cross the x-axis. I'll

00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:12,781
write an x equals here outside of the box to remind you that we just want values

4
00:00:12,781 --> 00:00:17,028
of x or x-coordinates of the points where this happens. Now, I'd like you to

5
00:00:17,028 --> 00:00:21,035
write all the different values you get in this box, separated by commas.
