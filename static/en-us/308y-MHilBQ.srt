1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,480
Now you needn't prefix
yourself to just sums.

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:09,180
Consider this example, imagine this as
a gorgeous terrain of hills and valleys,

3
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:13,890
and I'm sorry, Georgia Tech and Udacity
only pay me to do eight bit landscapes.

4
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:17,770
Now suppose at each point in the terrain
you actually know the elevation.

5
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:19,230
Here are labeled as integers.

6
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,330
Now, suppose you have a friend,
who stands here and

7
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:27,680
looks straight ahead, what will he or
she be able to see without occlusion?

8
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:32,759
I claim one way to figure it out
is to do a prefix-max computation.

9
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:37,370
The input array to a prefix max
would be the list of elevations.

10
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:39,790
A prefix max computation would ask for

11
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:44,410
each point in the terrain, what is
the largest elevation I've seen so far?

12
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:47,990
Your friend could see as long as the
elevations in the terrain were no higher

13
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:50,020
than his or her position.

14
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:53,370
Let's compute the cumulative
max at each point.

15
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:56,360
Now to figure out whether your friend
could see this awesome landmark in

16
00:00:56,360 --> 00:01:00,190
the distance, just look at the maximum
elevation at that point and

17
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:01,490
compare it to your friend's height.

18
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:05,970
In this case is 4 is
a lot bigger than 1.5, so

19
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:09,600
your friend has no hope of seeing
my beautiful Eiffel Tower.

20
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:15,020
Now the generalization of a prefix sum
is sometimes called a scan operation.

21
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:16,840
To use a scan in an algorithm,

22
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:21,170
all you have to do is say that you're
doing it and say what the operator is.

23
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:24,100
For example if we were doing
a prefix sum then we would say we

24
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:29,440
were doing an add-scan, that's
a scan and the operator is a plus.

25
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:34,240
Or as in the previous example we did a
max scan, you could have product-scans,

26
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,860
logical add scans, or-scans,
whatever your heart desires.
