00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:08,420
To optimize the CSS [UNKNOWN] construction we want to remove

2
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:13,500
unnecessary styles, minify, compress and cache it. Is that right?

3
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:17,960
>> Yep, those are all good ones, but if I remember correctly, I think when you

4
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:22,300
run PHP on your site it also recommended that we look in to render blocking CSS.

5
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:24,330
>> Oh yeah. What's that about?

6
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:26,940
>> Well, let's take a look. Let's say we have

7
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:30,460
a simple page with one CSS file. The browser downloads

8
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:34,850
the HTML, and then this covers and fetches the CSS. What is

9
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:38,010
the earliest point where the browser could paint the page? Is it

10
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:41,650
a, once the browser has built a DOM? Or ist it B,

11
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:46,720
once the Browser has downloaded the CSS and built the CSS object model?
