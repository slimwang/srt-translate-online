1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,460
So why is DNS vulnerable in the first

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:05,900
place? So the fundamental reason is that the resolvers

3
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:09,350
that issue the DNS query trust the responses that

4
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:12,620
are received after they send out a query regardless

5
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:16,360
of where that response comes from. So sometimes these

6
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:19,350
responses can be forged. When a resolver sends out

7
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:21,780
a query, it typically generates what's called a race

8
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:26,190
condition And if the attacker replies before the legitimate

9
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:29,060
responder, then the resolver is likely to

10
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:31,830
believe the attacker. DNS responses can also

11
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:34,420
contain additional DNS information that's unrelated to

12
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:37,310
the query. The fundamental problem. Is that the

13
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:40,360
basic DNS protocols have no means for

14
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:45,280
authenticating responses. This allows an attacker to forge

15
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,980
responses after a resolver sends a query.

16
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:51,570
A secondary reason that these types of spoofed

17
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:55,130
replies are possible is that DNS queries

18
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:58,340
are typically connectionless unlike BGP where routing messages

19
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:02,190
are transmitted. Over a reliable TCP connection, UDP

20
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:06,190
queries are sent over a connectionless UDP connection.

21
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:08,720
Therefore, a resolver does not have a way

22
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,310
of mapping the response that it receives for

23
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:16,610
a query other than the query ID. Which can be forged by the attacker. Let's look

24
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:20,350
at how the combination of the lack of authentication and the

25
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:26,460
connectionless nature of a DNS query allows the possibility of cash poisoning.
