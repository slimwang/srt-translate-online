The outcome after a few months was dramatic. Babies who are touched gained

00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:07,688
weight faster, left the hospital sooner, and also had less cognitive and

00:00:07,688 --> 00:00:13,396
physical deficits. They also had higher IQ's at age three. All this was just

00:00:13,396 --> 00:00:18,586
because of touch. We now know that touch stimulates neural development. So it's

00:00:18,586 --> 00:00:21,576
now common practice for hospitals to allow newborns to rest on their mother's

00:00:21,576 --> 00:00:24,612
chest immediately following birth unless there's a serious reason to believe

00:00:24,612 --> 00:00:27,340
that the newborn is in trouble.
