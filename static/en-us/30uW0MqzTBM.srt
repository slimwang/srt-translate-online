00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,880
Now before we go on, let's actually talk
a little bit about video stabilization.

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:07,270
Video stabilization is
an extremely important field and

3
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:10,260
anybody who's been doing work in video
knows that basically what we want to

4
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:14,020
do is try to keep as stable of
number of shots as possible.

5
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:17,442
This has actually resulted
in variety of innovations.

6
00:00:17,442 --> 00:00:22,555
The most well known and most established
is the steady cam invented about 1975 by

7
00:00:22,555 --> 00:00:24,750
you know, cameraman Garrett Brown.

8
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:29,130
He actually did some of this work
when the early Star Wars movies were

9
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:33,038
being filmed and in fact some of
the shots that were taken in the,

10
00:00:33,038 --> 00:00:35,830
in the forest with the Ewoks and stuff.

11
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:39,739
If you notice lot of motions that were
going on were all relatively stabled,

12
00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:41,700
captured by a camera like this.

13
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:44,160
I've had the privilege of meeting
Garrett Brown, he's an amazing person.

14
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:47,760
>> This is a steady cam.

15
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,560
Mine is a Master Series Elite.

16
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:52,940
The steady cam was invented
back in the 70s, and

17
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:59,390
it's revolutionized film and video,
by freeing the camera from the jib,

18
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:04,819
and the tripod and the dolly without
the bouncing and shaking of hand held.

19
00:01:04,819 --> 00:01:07,220
Many people think it
works by gyroscopes but

20
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:11,610
in reality it's just balance and
the physics of the steady cam's arms

21
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:14,470
to isolate the body
movement from the camera.

22
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:17,930
While it makes the camera seem
weightless the rig is anything but,

23
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:22,850
and the operator needs a strong
back as well as a creative mind.

24
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:25,430
>> So I just showed you a small
video from YouTube about

25
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:28,020
what this whole steady cam is all about.

26
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,390
And if you notice one the interesting
things is basically it's got

27
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:34,800
a counterweight and it's the balance
of this counterweight on this you know,

28
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:38,400
counterlever from the camera that
basically keeps it stable and

29
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,120
of course removes it from
the motion of the user.

30
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:44,248
Widely used moti,
widely used camera system.

31
00:01:44,248 --> 00:01:46,900
Of course, for those of you that
are interested you can look around on

32
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:49,900
the web and
you'll find even DIY versions.

33
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:53,470
Where you can actually make your
own setups to do something.

34
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:54,540
Not as well as this,

35
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:58,540
because this is a professional one, but
similar types of things yourselves.

36
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:00,820
Again, just like any
concept in photography and

37
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:04,710
videography there is a huge DIY
culture on these kinds of things.

38
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:06,950
I encourage you to look at that and
there are other solutions too.
