1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:02,880
Two sources of difficulty, when using your

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:05,920
product, are due to the lack of discoverability

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:08,930
and feedback, knowing what to do, then

4
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:12,620
wondering what happened. These two difficulties result from

5
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:18,310
the huge gulf between a person's goal and the means of achieving them, this is

6
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:21,330
called the gulf of execution. There's also the

7
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:25,370
gulf between assessing the state of the world,

8
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:27,670
and trying to determine if that state

9
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:30,710
matches the initial goal, and this is called

10
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:34,220
the gulf of evaluation. Figuring out what

11
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:39,080
actions are possible, during the gulf of execution,

12
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:42,060
is all about discoverability. And knowing what

13
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:45,400
just happened during the gulf of evaluation is

14
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:50,940
about feedback. Ever buy a new product and then not know how to work it?

15
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:54,560
Well, likely because it lacks discoverability. Ever

16
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:58,230
stand at an elevator or pedestrian traffic light?

17
00:00:58,230 --> 00:00:59,910
Pushing the button, but not knowing if the

18
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:02,520
system noticed, so you push over and over

19
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:07,700
again, that's because of lack of feedback. The role of the designer is to help

20
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:10,980
people bridge the two gulfs, making the possible

21
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:14,920
actions discoverable and providing feedback along the way.
