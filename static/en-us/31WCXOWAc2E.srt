1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,300
The answers are pretty straightforward.

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:06,240
For the first question,
we know each machine can hold 100 files

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,430
in the replicated case, all files
are present on every single machine, so

4
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:13,250
regardless of the fact that
we have three machines,

5
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:14,470
we still can only hold 100 files.

6
00:00:15,568 --> 00:00:20,180
In the partitioned case however, every
single machine can hold 100 different

7
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:24,490
files, and therefore the total
size of the file system is 300.

8
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:27,890
This illustrates one benefit
of the partitioned design,

9
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:31,900
because it can support larger
number of files in the file system.

10
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:36,270
For the second question, if we lose
one machine in the replicated case,

11
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:40,910
we will still have two other
machines that have all the files, so

12
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:43,515
we will lose zero percent
of the total files.

13
00:00:43,515 --> 00:00:49,560
In the partitioned file system however,
33% of the files will be lost.

14
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:52,830
This is because when one machine fails,

15
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:57,180
all the files that were stored on
that particular machine will be lost.

16
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:02,730
This data point illustrates one case in
which the replicated design is better.

17
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:06,910
It provides greater fault tolerance
versus in the previous example,

18
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:11,010
the partitioned distributed file
system providing greater scalability

19
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:13,210
in terms of the number of files.

20
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:17,500
Also this is why a mixed approach
of using both replication and

21
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:21,980
partitioning types of techniques
will provide greater flexibility

22
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:24,800
in terms of achieving both size and
resiliency.
