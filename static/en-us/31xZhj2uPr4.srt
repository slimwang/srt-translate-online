00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The very first problem I'm trying to solve is called localization.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,292
It involves a robot that's lost in space.

3
00:00:07,292 --> 00:00:10,277
It could be a car. It could be a mobile robot.

4
00:00:10,277 --> 00:00:15,000
So here is the environment, and the poor robot has no clue where it is.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,738
Similarly, we might have a car driving on a highway,

6
00:00:19,738 --> 00:00:22,492
and this car would like to know where it is.

7
00:00:22,492 --> 00:00:25,815
It is inside the lane or is it crossing lane markers?

8
00:00:25,815 --> 00:00:29,169
Now the traditional way to solve this problem is by using satellites.

9
00:00:29,169 --> 00:00:33,385
These satellites emit signals that the car can perceive.

10
00:00:33,385 --> 00:00:37,692
That's known as GPS, short for "global positioning system,"

11
00:00:37,692 --> 00:00:41,108
and it's what you have in your dashboard if you have a car with GPS

12
00:00:41,108 --> 00:00:43,938
that shows you the maps and shows you where you are.

13
00:00:43,938 --> 00:00:49,000
Now unfortunately, the problem with GPS is its really not very accurate.

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
It's really common for a car to believe to be here but it has

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,431
2 meters all the way up to 10 meters of error.

16
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:59,262
So if you try to stay in the lane with 10 meters of error,

17
00:00:59,262 --> 00:01:04,792
you're far off, and you're driving right over here, and you crash.

18
00:01:04,792 --> 00:01:10,000
So for our self-driving cars, to be able to stay in lanes using localization,

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,231
we need something like 2-10 centimeters of error.

20
00:01:14,231 --> 00:01:17,631
Then we can drive with GPS in lanes.

21
00:01:17,631 --> 00:01:23,000
The question is, how can we know where were are with 10 cm accuracy?

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,862
That's the localization question.

23
00:01:26,892 --> 00:01:31,985
In the Google self-driving car, localization plays a key role.

24
00:01:31,985 --> 00:01:37,923
We record images of the road surface and then use the techniques

25
00:01:37,923 --> 00:01:42,062
I'm just about to teach you to find out exactly where the robot is.

26
00:01:42,062 --> 00:01:45,031
It does so within a few centimeters of accuracy,

27
00:01:45,031 --> 00:01:50,385
and that makes it possible to stay inside the lane even if the lane markers are missing.

28
00:01:50,385 --> 00:01:54,969
So localization has a lot of math, but before I dive into mathematical detail,

29
00:01:54,985 --> 00:01:58,631
I want to give you an intuition for the basic principles.

30
00:01:58,631 --> 00:02:01,000
I want to tell you the story of how we will localize this,

31
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,031
and then we can go through the math together so you can understand it.

32
00:02:04,031 --> 00:02:06,981
I also want to let you program your own localizer

33
00:02:06,981 --> 00:02:18,000
so you can program a self-driving car.
