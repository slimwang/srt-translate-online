00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,500
Going back to our browser, we'll refresh the page and

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:06,840
see here that only a single chart was drawn.

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:10,700
And before we finish with this bar chart, I just wanted to point out some of

4
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:13,370
the benefits of using a high-level library like Dimple.

5
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:18,400
If you notice, by hovering over a bar, we can see both the date and

6
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,180
attendance of the game.

7
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:23,350
And we get this horizontal bar that gets animated out.

8
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:24,600
The tooltip's great,

9
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:29,730
because it gives us a much finer look into the actual values of our data.

10
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:35,150
And the horizontal bar the projects out is useful if we want to compare

11
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:39,730
one bar to all the others and see if its value's greater or less than.

12
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:43,600
Are there any things that look off with this plot?

13
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,640
Or possibly things that could be improved?
