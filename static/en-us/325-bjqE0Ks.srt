00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Let's have another look at the SIR Model to learn about

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
an important phenomenon and that's Herd Immunity.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
On the right-hand side of the I equation, the factor I appears in every term.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
If we factor it out, this is what happens.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
This helps us to investigate what happens when a huge percentage of all persons is vaccinated.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
We model vaccination by taking persons from susceptible to recovered,

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
which means that the number of susceptible person decreases

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
if the size of the population says constant.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
When the number of susceptible persons shrinks, the first term in the left parenthesis decreases

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
and eventually if you vaccinate enough people, the complete expression is going to become negative.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
The rate of change is negative, this means that the number of the infectious persons

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
is decreasing over the cause of time, more susceptible people get infected.

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:58,000
The number of susceptible person decreases which means that this first term here gets even smaller

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
which means that the expression in the right parenthesis gets even more negative.

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
The number of susceptible persons can only decrease

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
when enough people have been vaccinated, we can never have an epidemic.

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
This is called Herd Immunity.

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Not everybody is vaccinated, but if the number of people who are vaccinated is large enough,

19
00:01:19,000 --> 99:59:59,999
we can not have an epidemic nonetheless.
