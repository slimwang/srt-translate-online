1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:04,370
Long is, is normally an adjective of some sorts, but that doesn't mean that

2
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:10,250
every adjective is going to necessarily contribute to this list of attributes.

3
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:14,640
So, it's fine to have one and then discard it as not being relevant.

4
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:18,470
Okay? You had single leaf, you have leaf counter.

5
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:24,530
We have this one set modify sub trees. There is another,

6
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:30,340
call it a trick, another way of getting modifiers that aren't directly,

7
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:34,780
that don't correctly come from adjectives, and that is if you've got

8
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:39,990
a prepositional phrase, such as parts of the tree, or count of the leaves,

9
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:46,930
you could think of tree parts. Okay? And leave counts and so on. So once again,

10
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:51,190
the, the, the simple rule of saying adjectives doesn't quite get you all the,

11
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:55,240
all the way where you want to go. So, some of the issues that arise when you,

12
00:00:55,240 --> 00:01:02,370
when you try this technique. Okay? As we said, parts of the tree doesn't appear.

13
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:06,280
In, in the natural language to be an adjective. However we still want to

14
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:10,520
recognize that the word part signifies an attribute of tree. Same for

15
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:17,090
count of leaves. As you indicated the use of the word long even though it's,

16
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:21,560
nominally a, an adjective doesn't really contribute here in the sense of

17
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:27,060
being a modifier for one of these classes. The phrase single leaf,

18
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:32,360
if we think about it for a minute, has to do with the count of the leaves.

19
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:38,080
This is a one, of a, of a potential different number of counts that leaves

20
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:44,690
could have. That is, there's a count attribute that has a value of one.

21
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:49,290
Okay, single being, single meaning one.

22
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:52,550
Similar to the phrase two sub trees can be interpreted as a count of

23
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:59,460
the number of a sub trees, in the tree class. Having a value of two
