00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,300
There a few key considerations
to consider when setting

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:05,460
up a randomized experiment.

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:10,640
These are the unit of diversion,
population, duration and size.

4
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:14,360
The unit of diversion refers to how you
will assign units to the control or

5
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:15,099
treatment groups.

6
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:20,640
You could randomly assign each visit to
the site to either control or treatment.

7
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,900
But then you may have the same user
seeing both versions of the site,

8
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:25,800
which could be confusing to them, and

9
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,850
complicate the interpretation
of the results.

10
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:33,040
What most experiments do is try
to split units at the user level.

11
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,130
So even if the user leaves the site and

12
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:37,140
comes back,
they'll see the same version.

13
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:42,150
This can be difficult with web data, but
most companies will use either a cookie,

14
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:46,770
device ID, IP address or
some other identifier as a proxy.

15
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:50,660
To learn more about the specifics of
how web experiments are designed,

16
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:52,840
see the link to the lesson below.

17
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:56,210
Next, you need to
determine your population.

18
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:57,470
In our website example,

19
00:00:57,470 --> 00:01:01,750
this would be all visitors to the site
that don't already have the app.

20
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:04,090
Next, you'll want to
select the duration and

21
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:07,300
size of experiment in a way that
ensures that your control and

22
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:10,990
treatment groups are representative
of your population.

23
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:13,570
This is where the control
variables come in handy.

24
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:16,310
Let's take a look back at the three
control variables we identified.
