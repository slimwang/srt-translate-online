1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:04,160
When I look at this graph, one of my takeaways is just sort of,

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:06,170
just looking at the, the slopes and

3
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:09,680
I can see that, you know, five of the seven categories are doing really well.

4
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:12,060
And so, the team's doing really well in those.

5
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:14,240
>> Yeah. >> Compared to the company, let's say overall.

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,608
But, for two of them.

7
00:00:15,608 --> 00:00:19,408
Looks like management and career development not so much.

8
00:00:19,408 --> 00:00:23,380
so, I think it's really interesting how you mention that there's so

9
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:27,822
few data points, yet the rankings are there and it's really easy to see sort of

10
00:00:27,822 --> 00:00:31,170
like how the team is doing in comparison to the company.

11
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:33,433
>> Yeah, there's actually a whole lot of information.

12
00:00:33,433 --> 00:00:35,338
>> Yeah. >> In a relatively straightforward manner.

13
00:00:35,338 --> 00:00:35,838
>> Yeah.
