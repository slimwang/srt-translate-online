1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,510
Let's go ahead and give our student
user access to pseudo themselves.

2
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:08,610
I'll first copy the vagrant file and
name it student.

3
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:11,290
I'll then need to make
a small edit to this file and

4
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:13,030
I'll just use nano to do that.

5
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:16,007
This second line here is actually
what's doing all of the work.

6
00:00:16,007 --> 00:00:18,564
The file name doesn't mean anything,

7
00:00:18,564 --> 00:00:21,905
so we'll change the word
vagrant here to student.

8
00:00:21,905 --> 00:00:23,587
There are a few more options here.

9
00:00:23,587 --> 00:00:25,315
And if you'd like to
understand them all,

10
00:00:25,315 --> 00:00:28,011
I've placed a link in the instructor
notes for more information.

11
00:00:28,011 --> 00:00:32,572
For now, we just want student users
pseudo access to function exactly as

12
00:00:32,572 --> 00:00:34,825
the vagrant users currently does.

13
00:00:34,825 --> 00:00:39,666
After saving that file, I've switched
back to my terminal where I'm logged in

14
00:00:39,666 --> 00:00:43,510
as the student and we'll try to
run this pseudo command again.

15
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:45,507
And there we go, we see the results.

16
00:00:45,507 --> 00:00:48,280
Our student user now has
access to use pseudo.
