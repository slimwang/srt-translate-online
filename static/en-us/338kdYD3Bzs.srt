Hi! How can we survive without overusing nature's resources?

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
It's of vital importance here to maintain a balance.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
This is what we examine in this unit, focusing on fishing--

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
trying to find the best strategy that serves both humans and nature.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
On the way there, we encounter some fundamental concepts of differential equations

6
00:00:20,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and in the larger fleet of simulation.
