1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:01,859
So now let's do a quiz on this.

2
00:00:01,859 --> 00:00:04,980
So what we're going to do is I want
you to pick one of each type of

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:07,830
notification, regular activity,
always on activity or

4
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:10,480
watch face for
each of the questions here.

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:13,070
First question is how would you
implement an app that helps

6
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:13,760
the user go for

7
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:17,820
a run, in showing the current number of
steps in distance that they've covered?

8
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:21,450
The next question is what about helping
the user find out when the price of

9
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:23,750
a stock or commodity has
exceeded a threshold value?

10
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:27,710
Next, what about viewing a graph
of the history of the weather at

11
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:29,430
a particular location?

12
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:32,780
What about finding out if there
are any incoming emails or messages?

13
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:36,380
And tracking the number of steps and
distance walked each day by the user?

14
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:38,800
And finally, tracking the calendar
entries that you have

15
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:39,830
upcoming in the day?
