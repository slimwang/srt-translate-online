00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:03,740
Someone poses a question to you. What percentage of

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:07,830
the guest operating system code may need modification with

3
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:10,720
para virtualization? I just want you to give a

4
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:13,710
guesstimate as to what you think may be needed

5
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:17,310
in order to make a guest operating system run

6
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:20,324
on top of a hypervisor in a para virtualized

7
00:00:20,324 --> 00:00:22,990
environment. You think 10% of the code base has

8
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:25,570
to be changed, 50% of the code base has

9
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:29,340
to be changed, 30% of the code base of the native

10
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:33,713
operating system has to be changed, or is it less than 2%?
