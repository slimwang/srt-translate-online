1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,560
Propositional logic, it's a powerful
language for what it does.

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:07,550
And there are very efficient inference
mechanisms for determining validity and

3
00:00:07,549 --> 00:00:10,559
satisfiability, although
we haven't discussed them.

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:13,870
But propositional logic
has a few limitations.

5
00:00:13,869 --> 00:00:16,949
First, it can only handle true and
false values.

6
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:22,980
No capability to handle uncertainty
like we did in probability theory.

7
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,750
And second, we can only talk
about events that are true or

8
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:26,614
false in the world.

9
00:00:26,614 --> 00:00:32,368
We can't talk about objects that
have properties, such as size,

10
00:00:32,368 --> 00:00:37,509
weight, color and so on, nor can we talk
about the relations between objects.

11
00:00:37,509 --> 00:00:40,189
And third, there are no shortcuts

12
00:00:40,189 --> 00:00:44,339
to succinctly talk about a lot
of different things happening.

13
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:47,470
Say, if we had a vacuum world
with 1,000 locations, and

14
00:00:47,469 --> 00:00:50,799
we wanted to say that every
location is free of dirt,

15
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:54,609
we would need a conjunction
of 1,000 propositions.

16
00:00:54,609 --> 00:00:57,530
There's no way to have a single
sentence saying that all

17
00:00:57,530 --> 00:01:00,149
of the locations are clean all at once.

18
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:03,019
So, we will next cover
first order logic,

19
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:05,920
which addresses these two limitations
