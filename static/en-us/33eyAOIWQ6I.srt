1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:02,080
Welcome back.

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:05,952
In this session we're going to take a
look at our first Ruby Data Structures.

3
00:00:05,952 --> 00:00:10,320
These data structures will allow us to
store more complex and interesting data.

4
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:15,320
Up until this point we've seen how
we can use variables to store single

5
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:16,700
pieces of data.

6
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:19,680
A single number, string, or bullion.

7
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:20,690
Here's a string variable.

8
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:27,500
This variable stores a single adorable
puppy named Kareem Abdul Jabark.

9
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:28,100
He's lonely.

10
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:33,080
In this session, we'll see how we
can cure our puppy's loneliness

11
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:35,400
by storing a collection of other dogs,

12
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:39,070
together in the same variable,
using what's known as an array.

13
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,310
See?
Now he has a couple of friends.

14
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:46,270
We will also see how we can
use Ruby hashes to store

15
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:48,900
more detailed information
about each dog.

16
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,226
Dogs are more than just a name.

17
00:00:51,226 --> 00:00:53,910
We can add in an age for each dog.

18
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,130
Let's also give them a breed.

19
00:00:57,170 --> 00:00:59,240
We now have a collection of dogs,

20
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:03,560
where each dog consists of
multiple pieces of information.

21
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:06,740
By the end of this session we'll
be able to use Ruby arrays and

22
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:10,240
hashes to store this type
of complex data in code,

23
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:14,820
whether we're working with dog data or
real product data.

24
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:16,340
Let's get started.

25
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:17,650
Hip, hip, array.
