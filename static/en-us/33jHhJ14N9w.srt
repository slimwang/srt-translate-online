1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,560
So how can we tell if a game
is actually engaging?

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:06,200
Well, we can usually look
at how popular the game is

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:10,670
by finding out if the game is downloaded
a lot and if the reviews are good.

4
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:14,680
For example, here we can see
game apps in Amazon Appstore.

5
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:19,920
And we can see the number of reviews and
the star rating from one to five stars.

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,190
And this gives us a good idea
of how engaging our game is.

7
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:26,970
If the game has a rating close to
five stars, it's probably pretty fun.

8
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:30,410
And if it's lower, then maybe there's
something the users don't like about it.

9
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:34,270
We can also look at how long and
how often players use our game, and

10
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:36,060
measure engagement.

11
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:38,760
Here are some terms we
used to measure it.

12
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:42,310
Session count, session length,
and retention.

13
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:46,110
Session count is the number
of times an app is launched.

14
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:51,690
So any time a player opens the app,
whether that's once a week or

15
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:54,290
ten times a day,
the session count goes up.

16
00:00:55,670 --> 00:01:00,210
And if we look at the average session
counts for a player over a day.

17
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:03,690
We can get a pretty good idea
of how addicting our game is.

18
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:07,840
But some games are designed for
longer sessions instead of multiple

19
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,240
short sessions, so
the session length is also important.

20
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:16,325
Session length is the amount of
time that the app is in use for

21
00:01:16,325 --> 00:01:18,295
a particular session.

22
00:01:18,295 --> 00:01:23,745
So whether that's a few minutes or
going on and on to a length of hours.

23
00:01:23,745 --> 00:01:28,495
And again for this to be a useful metric
we would usually look at the average,

24
00:01:28,495 --> 00:01:33,275
the average person length across users
to see how long a typical user plays

25
00:01:33,275 --> 00:01:34,940
once they open the app.

26
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:37,140
And we also look at retention.

27
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:40,530
Which is a measure of how many
users continue to play your game

28
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:42,270
as time goes on.

29
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:47,308
Usually game retention is measured a day
after your game is first launched and

30
00:01:47,308 --> 00:01:51,680
downloaded, a week after, and
the month after just to see

31
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,530
how many of your original
players you keep over time.

32
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:59,370
Say you want to measure retention
over week for the game Fruit Ninja.

33
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:04,490
That means you want to see how many
people who start at the beginning

34
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:07,420
of the week are still around
at the end of the week.

35
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:11,770
During the week some of these early
users will leave Fruit Ninja.

36
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:13,330
And new ones will join.

37
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:16,410
But we don't want to take
into account the new ones.

38
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:19,790
We just want to see who started
at the beginning of the week and

39
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:21,300
stayed throughout the whole week.

40
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:27,720
To calculate this, you need to look
at the users at the end of the week

41
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,550
minus any of the newcomers who
joined in the middle of the week,

42
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:35,189
all divided by the number of users that
started at the beginning of the week.

43
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:39,990
Then multiply all this by
100 to get a percentage and

44
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:42,000
this is going to be your retention for
the week.

45
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:46,390
So let's look at some numbers for
Fruit Ninja.

46
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:50,970
Let's say we had 400 people download
the game at the start of the week and

47
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:54,780
there's 700 total by
the end of the week.

48
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:56,150
That looks pretty good.

49
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:59,670
But we also know that 500
of these people are new.

50
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:01,720
They joined in the middle
of the week and

51
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:05,180
they are part of our 400
original starting players.

52
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:06,930
So let's calculate the retention.

53
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:09,230
First we have 700 from
the end of the week,

54
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:14,040
minus the 500 new players
that joined mid-week.

55
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:18,730
So we are only accounting for our
original 400 to see who stuck around.

56
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:21,000
All divided by our 400 original players.

57
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,960
Then times 100 to get a percentage.

58
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:30,240
This is going to be 200 over 400 or
half times 100%

59
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:35,970
which is going to give us 50% retention
over this week, which is pretty good.

60
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,800
Ideally we'd want 100% retention,

61
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:44,410
which means everyone who downloads your
game keeps playing it and never quits.

62
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:46,380
But no game has perfect retention and

63
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:50,160
even really great games have around 50%
retention after just the first day.

64
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:55,380
That means that half the players leave
during the first 24 hours of playing.

65
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:58,610
This seems like a lot of people leaving,
but it's considered pretty good or

66
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:03,090
a tension especially for a game that as
good at getting new players over time.

67
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:04,890
It won't matter that a lot
of older ones leave.

68
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:09,820
Lots of developers use a 40,
20, ten rule as a guideline for

69
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:14,220
good retention over a day a week and
a month.

70
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:18,232
So after a game is downloaded by a bunch
of people we have 100% of people.

71
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:22,470
Forty percent of those users
stick around after the first day.

72
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:28,690
Twenty percent of those stay for
a week and only ten percent stay for

73
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:32,150
a whole month and even longer usually.

74
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:35,450
If you have retention at these
time points a day, a week or

75
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:37,150
a month that's higher that's great.

76
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:40,260
If it's any lower that's
considered bad retention
