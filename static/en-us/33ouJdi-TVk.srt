1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:04,980
I'm glad you bring up the idea of
the work factor and the resources.

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:09,640
I guess we hear people saying
adversity is going to prevail, or

3
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:12,920
we need to be paranoid or
hyper-paranoid.

4
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:17,350
How do we strike a balance
between how paranoid we are and

5
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:19,340
the price we pay for it?

6
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:22,730
>> Well, one I think,
typically we aren't paranoid enough.

7
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:26,060
Actually, I would say first we need
to we design things we need to assume

8
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:26,930
there's an adversary.

9
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:29,390
Which a lot of people don't do.

10
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:33,490
Particularly when products
are rushed to market.

11
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:38,570
And then I don't think that we
assume an adversary is as powerful.

12
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:40,530
We assume the adversary is stupid.

13
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:42,940
Which is, again, a bad, bad idea.

14
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:47,390
And then, I think we can even really
be a little more paranoid than that and

15
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:49,400
assume they can do a little
bit more than we think.

16
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:53,520
Maybe a lot more, depending on how
important the information the system

17
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,580
you're trying to protect actually is.

18
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:58,350
When it comes to trade off, though,

19
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:03,320
you could put an infinite amount of
resources making something secure.

20
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,830
And conventional wisdom says, and

21
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:09,990
actually I would say best practice from
industry, is to form a calculation.

22
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:12,740
So the amount of money you're
putting into securing a system

23
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:16,080
shouldn't exceed the value of
the item you're actually protecting.

24
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,170
If you're building a vault to hold
a $10 item, something's wrong.

25
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:22,050
So that's part of the calculus.

26
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:23,240
The other calculus,

27
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:27,740
I think, is I personally I don't want to
live in a world with perfect security.

28
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:31,700
The amount of pain involved
in our day to day lives

29
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:35,990
makes an overwhelming amount of security
very, very unpleasant place to be.

30
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:38,190
So it really comes down to risk.

31
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:40,060
Life is about risk.

32
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:41,370
Banking is about risk.

33
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:43,570
Crossing the street Is about risk.

34
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:47,880
So each organization has to determine
how much risk they're willing to take.

35
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:52,490
Understand its security cost
in terms of time and money and

36
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:56,380
resources and
frustration of your actual user base.

37
00:01:56,380 --> 00:02:00,520
There have been times that I haven't
been able to get into the building

38
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:04,080
where I work because of some
glitch in the security system or

39
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:07,360
I forgot my ID card or
my pass card in another place.

40
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,710
So it comes at a cost.
