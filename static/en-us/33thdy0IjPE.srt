1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:01,400
Congratulations.

2
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:03,160
You've reached the end of the lesson.

3
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:06,000
You went through the data analysis
process from start to finish,

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,620
starting with posing a question, all
the way through sharing what you found.

5
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:12,040
I'm sure you made some
fascinating discoveries.

6
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:15,000
In the next lesson you'll learn some
additional libraries that can make

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,300
writing data analysis code a lot easier.

8
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:17,870
I'll see you then.
