We know that we want to find the inverse of B of t equals 1,000 e to the -.5t.

2
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:12,037
Which we know is going to be the reflection of that graph line y equals x. So,

3
00:00:12,037 --> 00:00:16,280
that means we're looking for the equation this graph right here. This is B of t

4
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:20,851
and this is B inverse of t. Well let's think about how we might want to do

5
00:00:20,851 --> 00:00:25,294
this. While we could divide both sides by 1000, and then maybe we could take

6
00:00:25,294 --> 00:00:29,877
the t root, of both sides. That will get rid of the t on the right hand side,

7
00:00:29,877 --> 00:00:34,726
in the exponent. But we would still have an exponent of t over here. since we

8
00:00:34,726 --> 00:00:38,984
know that the t root is the same as taking this to the one over the t power. So

9
00:00:38,984 --> 00:00:42,985
that's not going to help without that at all. We actually need a totally new

10
00:00:42,985 --> 00:00:48,031
idea to solve this problem. And that ideas named by a Scottish mathematician

11
00:00:48,031 --> 00:00:53,691
named John Napier discovered in 1614. His discovery was something called a

12
00:00:53,691 --> 00:00:58,405
logarithm or just a log. We'll look at some simpler examples first log and then

13
00:00:58,405 --> 00:01:01,744
come back to this example about bacteria once we have all the tools we need to

14
00:01:01,744 --> 00:01:03,989
deal with it.
