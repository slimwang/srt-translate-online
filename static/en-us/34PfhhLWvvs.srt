1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,715
So it, it sounds like we want to, since we have two, two maybe big buckets.

2
00:00:05,715 --> 00:00:07,200
>> Mm-hm. >> That we want to sort things.

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:07,735
Maybe three.

4
00:00:07,735 --> 00:00:08,620
>> Mm-hm.

5
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:10,076
>> misinformation, panic mongering.

6
00:00:10,076 --> 00:00:10,657
>> Mm-hm.

7
00:00:10,657 --> 00:00:12,107
>> Reliable sources.

8
00:00:12,107 --> 00:00:12,690
>> Mm-hm.

9
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:13,815
>> Maybe political stuff.

10
00:00:13,815 --> 00:00:14,530
>> Mm-hm.

11
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:19,290
>> So each of those would be a separate sort of output bolt, is that?

12
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:22,970
>> Yes, because I, I think like because each set of

13
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:27,095
words that is characteristic, this computational bucket is different.

14
00:00:27,095 --> 00:00:28,570
>> Mm-hm, right, yeah.

15
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:31,720
>> So, you might need a different kind of bolts for that.

16
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:36,749
So probably like you might you might have one single spout.

17
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,085
A spout which takes all the Twitter data, right.

18
00:00:40,085 --> 00:00:40,710
>> Mm-hm.

19
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:41,970
>> Then,.

20
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:48,325
So then you might have one bolt that might be doing your panic stuff, right?

21
00:00:48,325 --> 00:00:49,460
>> Mm-hm.

22
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:54,122
>> Then a little bolt which is doing that on this information.

23
00:00:54,122 --> 00:00:57,132
And bolt with the current resources.

24
00:00:57,132 --> 00:00:57,770
Right?

25
00:00:57,770 --> 00:00:58,472
>> Mm-hm.

26
00:00:58,472 --> 00:01:02,125
>> So now in the credible sources you might want to say, like,

27
00:01:02,125 --> 00:01:07,115
now which data, so, this bolt is going to send the data [INAUDIBLE], right?

28
00:01:07,115 --> 00:01:10,205
So now let us state the correct credible in bolt.

29
00:01:10,205 --> 00:01:13,013
In this case, you must have [INAUDIBLE] credible accounts, right?

30
00:01:13,013 --> 00:01:13,685
>> Right.

31
00:01:13,685 --> 00:01:15,042
>> Mm-hm.

32
00:01:15,042 --> 00:01:17,820
>> And this credible accounts are the ones that's going to.

33
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:21,570
I mean, if a lot of credible accounts are there, are probably,

34
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:26,400
if the accounts are too small, then all the bolts can carry those accounts.

35
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,453
>> Okay. >> All right, so

36
00:01:27,453 --> 00:01:31,047
then you can use that survey by which, okay, I'm getting all these tweets and

37
00:01:31,047 --> 00:01:34,760
the status from this account, okay, this is a credible source, right?

38
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:37,532
Then on the credible source, whatever you have to do, you have to,

39
00:01:37,532 --> 00:01:41,200
if it requires further stage processing, yes, you need another bolt.

40
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:41,830
Right.

41
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:45,590
You can stage it and finally you can say something of a credible score or

42
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:46,950
whatever it is, right.

43
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:48,920
That is the output going to be right.

44
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:52,140
>> Yeah. >> And this information you already have whatever,

45
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:57,840
you can break up those words and like, like the credible accounts,

46
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,150
you have already input some kind of a, panic words, right?

47
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:06,590
>> Right. >> And then the you have to include the logic of

48
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:11,160
how many times this for a particular tweet you want to attach a score.

49
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,968
So the whole panic that tweet this.

50
00:02:13,968 --> 00:02:15,181
>> Uh-huh. Yeah.

51
00:02:15,181 --> 00:02:17,138
>> So, so like if more panic words are out,

52
00:02:17,138 --> 00:02:20,782
again, then the degree of panic is much more higher than this one, right?

53
00:02:20,782 --> 00:02:21,516
>> Right.

54
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:22,452
>> Come up with a score.

55
00:02:22,452 --> 00:02:26,460
And, each tweet is assigned a certain code like that, right?

56
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:31,690
Then, at some point, then you would make another bolt, which is aggregating

57
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:36,790
those scores of the tweet, and slowly aggregating and coming up with one score.

58
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:40,861
So that you can have a, what is the panic score, or whatever that is, right?

59
00:02:40,861 --> 00:02:41,844
>> Uh-huh, yeah.

60
00:02:41,844 --> 00:02:43,343
>> That is another one, right?

61
00:02:43,343 --> 00:02:44,466
So similarly here.

62
00:02:44,466 --> 00:02:48,645
Then I think the misinformation.

63
00:02:48,645 --> 00:02:50,208
How much is the degree of misinformation.

64
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:51,580
Again, for each tweet, what are the words that carry the misinformation.

65
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:56,404
Because let's say that you accumulate some characteristics of what Ebola is

66
00:02:56,404 --> 00:03:00,402
not as compared to, and people are saying those things.

67
00:03:00,402 --> 00:03:03,810
Compare it with Ebola, then find out how much is the degree of misinformation.

68
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:06,410
Then give the misinformation code.

69
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:09,190
Except having this, to follow the same pattern.

70
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:11,925
>> Yeah. >> Except the, the way you compute it will be different.

71
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:12,640
>> Mm-hm.

72
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,640
>> Okay. >> So because this is encapsulating computation logic, right?

73
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,330
So it will be very different in terms of this one.

74
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:23,300
So once you compute them, then all of the scores you can make available to

75
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:27,810
that is, then you over the dashboard and the dashboard will pick that from

76
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:30,500
where it is or whatever, and then display those scores.

77
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,940
And update the scores continuously.
