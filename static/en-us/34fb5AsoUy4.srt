1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:01,230
Okay, excellent.

2
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:04,010
You've started to find and fix issues.

3
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:05,730
Now, hopefully,
you're JavaScript is behaving well,

4
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:08,550
but remember that it's only
a small part of making a frame.

5
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:13,862
>> In this lesson, you'll be tackling
styles or, as it's labeled in DevTools,

6
00:00:13,862 --> 00:00:15,550
recalculate styles.

7
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:17,930
By the end of this lesson,
you'll be identifying and

8
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:21,050
solving performance issues
from style calculations.

9
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:23,520
But bear in mind that JavaScript
can often be the trigger for

10
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:24,770
the issues we're going to cover.

11
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:27,490
But it's not necessarily
JavaScript's fault.

12
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:30,670
Also, remember from the first
lesson that stout calculations will

13
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:31,820
take the DOM and

14
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:36,050
then for each element, figure out
what its visual properties should be.

15
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:39,710
>> Right, so the browser ends up with
a Render Tree which is like the DOM.

16
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:42,210
Only it's, the elements,
too, just need to be drawn.

17
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:44,660
So anything that shouldn't
be drawn won't be in there.

18
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:47,590
So if you set something to display-non,
it won't be there, but

19
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:50,040
if you have something like
pseudo-elements, like before or

20
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:53,250
after, they will be in this tree,
even though they don't exist in the DOM.
