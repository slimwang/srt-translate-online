1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,090
Why is this hard?

2
00:00:01,090 --> 00:00:04,840
Well because unlike some early
computer vision data sets

3
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:08,140
we don't typically take an object
put it on a piece of black felt, or

4
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:12,590
velvet on top of a table and
say okay, that is a fire truck toy.

5
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:13,200
Right?

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,230
Pictures show up more like this,
and I think this also comes from

7
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:20,090
Kristen cause she has a thing for pandas
and I think also for koalas, all right.

8
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:24,780
You get great variations in how things
are illuminated, the pose of objects.

9
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:27,940
The objects are sort of seen in
the background with a bunch of clutter,

10
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:31,290
they get occluded so here, you know,
there's trees in the way, you know,

11
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:34,790
the viewpoint, and then, oh, isn't
this a really cute face of a koala.

12
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:38,030
Yeah, but you know what to another koala
he may not really like this guy because

13
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:40,586
he, like, ran off with his poker chips,
or something, I don't know.

14
00:00:40,586 --> 00:00:43,350
The idea is that you know, they,
they look different one to another so

15
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:46,770
the idea that we have these
variations in appearance.

16
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:50,000
The other thing is that these objects
don't show up again in isolation.

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,330
They show up in these cluttered
overlapping environments.

18
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:57,030
You know, here's this picture of these
two motorcycles one behind the other,

19
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:58,660
people, of course, walking pedestrians.

20
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:02,510
We don't get to look at objects
in isolation typically.

21
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:06,420
Another thing that makes this hard
is the importance of context.

22
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:08,720
And let me show you three pictures,
okay?

23
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,750
So you take a look at these pictures and

24
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:15,980
you probably see a person here
talking on his cellphone.

25
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:19,080
You probably see here an outdoor
scene here with a building and

26
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,300
like some people standing et cetera,
whatever.

27
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:24,360
You probably see some guy, I don't know
exactly what he's doing, bending down,

28
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,970
maybe picking something up and
here's his shoe over there.

29
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:28,448
Right?
Right.

30
00:01:28,448 --> 00:01:32,750
Well, hm, you see these regions so
that the phone,

31
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:37,460
the person, the shoe,
see this single picture here?

32
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:40,790
Let me blow up that picture
a little bit more, okay?

33
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:47,760
This patch of intensities is the same
patch here, as here, as here, as there.

34
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:53,690
So what's a cellphone in one image,
is a shoe in another image.

35
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:56,560
And that can only be done by
the contexts of everything else

36
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,500
that's around it.

37
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:00,600
This also makes recognition difficult.

38
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,680
Another challenge is the complexity.

39
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:06,770
That is, we need to able to compute
things and do it relatively quickly,

40
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:12,200
because you know, there are thousands
now, now millions of pixels in an image.

41
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:17,210
We've got, I don't know, 3 to 30, some
tens of thousands of object categories.

42
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:20,230
We have all sorts of
degrees of freedom of pose.

43
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:21,730
Yeah, that was cute, I know, right?

44
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:25,930
So even though it's just a person,
a person can move in many shapes,

45
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:28,720
although I can move in many fewer
shapes than I used to be able to move.

46
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,510
And there's so many pictures, right?

47
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:32,710
There are billions of images
indexed by Google Search.

48
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:35,850
The last number I could
find was that in 2011,

49
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:40,679
six billion photos were being
uploaded to various things per month.

50
00:02:40,679 --> 00:02:41,570
Okay?

51
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:44,690
There was a billion camera
phones sold last year.

52
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:46,510
Okay?
So they all take pictures.

53
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:51,470
And another interesting indication of
the complexity of recognition, and

54
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:55,650
of vision in general,
is how much of your brain and

55
00:02:55,650 --> 00:03:01,150
my brain too by the way,
is devoted to visual processing.

56
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:02,440
There are different estimates,

57
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:07,350
anywhere from a, a quarter of your
entire cerebral cortex to a half.

58
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:10,440
And it's the cerebral cortex
that sort of distinguishes you

59
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,420
from an awful lot of other mammals.

60
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:17,740
So the recognition, the ability for you
to manipulate things so well visually,

61
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:21,630
seems to be two things, very intense.

62
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:25,680
It takes a lot of wetware in order for
you to do it.

63
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,400
But I guess evolutionarily it
must have been very useful.

64
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,980
Because you devoted an awful
lot of wetware to handling this
