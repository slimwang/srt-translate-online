1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,900
All right, so
now we need to modify the word adapter

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:05,340
to store the background
color information.

3
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:09,810
So over here in the numbers activity
where we create a new word adapter in

4
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:13,770
this line, the third input will
need to be the color resource.

5
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:18,000
So R.color.category_numbers.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,210
So go ahead and
modify your code to reflect this change.

7
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:25,510
Then go ahead and finish making
the code changes so that this works.

8
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:28,040
We'll need to modify
the WordAdapter constructor

9
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:30,930
to accept color as its third input.

10
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:35,600
And next, we'll also want to update the
WordAdapter logic to use the appropriate

11
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,770
color when setting up
the individual list item views.

12
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:42,810
So we'll make the WordAdapter change the
background color of the vertical in your

13
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:47,010
layout that contains the two text
views in the list item layout.

14
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:50,160
So once we've made those changes
to the WordAdapter constructor.

15
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,820
We'll need to make sure
our category activity

16
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:56,050
correctly calls this new
version of the constructor.

17
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:58,630
And lastly,
in the visual polish coding task.

18
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:00,810
We use the orange color
as a placeholder for

19
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:03,560
the background of the text
in each list item.

20
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,519
So once this new code is working,

21
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:11,190
we can remove that placeholder
color in the list_item.xml file.

22
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:15,180
So take a look at the notes provided
below the quiz for some hints as well.

23
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:17,960
Now this is the last coding task for
this lesson.

24
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:22,020
So good luck and when you're done,
check these boxes and continue on.
