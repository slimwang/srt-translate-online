Thanks Lauren. First let's look at delusions. Delusions are often bizarre and

2
00:00:04,939 --> 00:00:08,645
grandiose and they are part of a patently false belief system that is

3
00:00:08,645 --> 00:00:12,870
maintained in spite of its irrationality, for example a person may believe he

4
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:16,900
is Jesus Christ and moreover these appear to be very real to that person, so

5
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:24,750
that person would actually believe that he was in fact Jesus Christ. We also

6
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:29,580
have hallucinations and these are convincing sensory experieneces that occur in

7
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:36,406
the absence of an external stimulus. Auditory hallucinations are the most

8
00:00:36,406 --> 00:00:40,010
common and involve hearing voices inside their head often telling them negative

9
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:43,561
things about themselves or even sometimes telling the person to injure another

10
00:00:43,561 --> 00:00:49,586
individual. However, some people with schizophrenia have reported that there

11
00:00:49,586 --> 00:00:54,424
are sometimes more positive voices in their heads, in terms of intentions. We

12
00:00:54,424 --> 00:00:58,502
can also have a visual hallucinations. This involves seeing things that aren't

13
00:00:58,502 --> 00:01:03,238
really there. There can be tactile hallucinations. And this involves feeling

14
00:01:03,238 --> 00:01:07,019
something that isn't there. And finally, we can even have olfactory

15
00:01:07,019 --> 00:01:11,691
hallucinations, which is smelling something that isn't there, either. Delusions

16
00:01:11,691 --> 00:01:15,723
and hallucinations are considered positive symptoms because they are not

17
00:01:15,723 --> 00:01:18,310
present in people in general.
