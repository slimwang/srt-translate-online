1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,360
So to find out what happens when we run this

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:04,910
line of code, we will go back in time and

3
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:07,180
look at a video from a previous lesson when we

4
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:10,570
were drawing shapes. For now, you can think of a class

5
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:13,940
as a neatly packaged box that puts things together really

6
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:17,602
well. And it allows us to write code like turtle.turtle

7
00:00:17,602 --> 00:00:21,860
with these strange-looking brackets as if we were calling a

8
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:25,870
function. In fact, when we do run this piece of code,

9
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:28,210
we are, in fact, calling a function, a function

10
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:32,590
called init, which is defined inside the class Turtle. Init

11
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:35,530
stands for initialize. And what it does is it

12
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:38,480
creates space in memory for a new instance or a

13
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,470
new object of the class Turtle. This instance, we

14
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:44,010
called Brad. Okay, so we are back to the present

15
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:47,310
time. Now, we started out by defining a file

16
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:49,800
called media.py. Let me place it up on the board.

17
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,540
Notice that I place this file outside the Python standard

18
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:58,920
library. Inside that file, we then defined a class called Movie.

19
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,360
After that, we wrote a line of code

20
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:07,610
that said media.movie. And what that did, was that

21
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:10,380
it called the init function Define inside class

22
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:14,590
Movie. And that created a new instance. That instance

23
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:17,820
we called Toy Story. So to summarize, this

24
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:21,530
function init initializes or creates space and memory for

25
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:24,150
the new instance Toy Story. By the way,

26
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:27,330
this new function init, is also called a constructor

27
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:29,810
because it constructs space and memory for the new

28
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:32,630
instance, which in this case happens to be Toy Story.

29
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:35,510
So thus far, we've encountered two new words that we

30
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:38,710
can add to our new word list. The first one

31
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:41,470
is instance, which in this case, happens to be Toy

32
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:44,650
Story. And the second one is a constructor, which in

33
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:47,560
this case, is the function init. Now, we will

34
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:51,215
revisit these words soon. But for now, let's define init.
