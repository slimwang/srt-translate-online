1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
And of course the answers is 0, if p=0, the coin comes up tail all the time

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
and as a result it won't vary, therefore there is no variance.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
The same as to for p=1. Once again we know the variance is 0.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:21,000
So if we were to draw the variance as a function of p, we already know it's 0.25

5
00:00:21,000 --> 99:59:59,999
when the count is most random, and it goes down in someway all the way to 0.
