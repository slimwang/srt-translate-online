1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
For the second final exam problem, we're looking at something that set the outside boundaries

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
of the material that we've looked at so far.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
We're going to investigate the decay chain of Uranium-238.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
This chain contains a number of different steps from one isotope down to the next.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Say for example we have Uranium-238 to a string of other things

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
that we're not going to think about right now until eventually we got to Bismuth-210

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
plus some radioactive radiation over here that we're not going to be concerned about.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Bismuth-210 has a half-life of 5 days and eventually decays to Plutonium-210 plus again some radiation

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
and this has a half-life of 138 days.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:42,000
After sometime, it decays to Lead-206 and you can see that in general, the average lifetime

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
of the given isotope is equal to its half-life divided by the natural log of 2.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
If you want to figure this out, you're welcome to or you can just trust me that it's right.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
It'll be useful for us to think about how the number of atoms at any given sample changes every time.

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
If you think that the initial amount of atoms is equal 100% of that amount

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
and then t equals the half-life, we have half of those atoms left.

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Over here, well we see the atoms lifetime worked out.

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Of course, there are still some atoms left, but many of them are already decayed.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Looking at the supplied code, we can see that they are actually ignoring the part of the chain

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
that starts with Uranium-238.

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
In the beginning, I set it with the Bismuth isotope.

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
All initial values showed up all of the atoms are Bismuth at first

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
and later the Plutonium and then the Lead.

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
What we would like you to do is to the backward Euler--

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
remember backward Euler is not the same as forward Euler--to show how this

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
decay process happens for each population of atoms.

26
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Now more hint, think about how the ideal logistic growth applies to the situation

27
00:01:38,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and how it's going to affect the different rates of change of these populations.
