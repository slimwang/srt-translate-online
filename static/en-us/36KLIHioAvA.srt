00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,590
As I'm sure you've guessed this is the probability

2
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:05,010
for a single coin flip. This is the formula we

3
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:08,340
can use for multiple coin flips and as we

4
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:10,720
go to very large numbers, the [UNKNOWN] is often a

5
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:14,330
good approximation for the outcome of many coin flips.

6
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:16,370
I should warn you, if the coin flip is zero

7
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:17,710
to one, then the mean is always in the

8
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:20,960
positive. This can assume negative values, but it's an approximation
