1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:02,960
All right, so here we are back
in the shelter database and

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:07,790
I'm taking a look only at the ID, name
and weight columns from our pets table.

3
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:11,920
So say we get a word that Garfield has
been eating a little bit too much and

4
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:16,190
instead of being 14 kilograms,
he is now 20 kilograms.

5
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:19,220
So, how do we update that
information in our pets table?

6
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:21,958
Well, as the name implies,
we'd be using the UPDATE command.

7
00:00:21,958 --> 00:00:25,241
So first off,
we start off with the UPDATE keyword,

8
00:00:25,241 --> 00:00:30,105
followed by the name of the table which
is pets, followed by the SET keyword.

9
00:00:30,105 --> 00:00:33,240
And after that, we want to set
the columns that we're interested in.

10
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:37,464
So, here we want to set
the weight column to 20.

11
00:00:37,464 --> 00:00:41,706
Now, before I go ahead and enter here,
I need to pause and mention that if I

12
00:00:41,706 --> 00:00:45,550
hit Enter now, this would set
the weight of all the pets to be 20.

13
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:49,550
So, in order to specify that we
only want Garfield to be updated,

14
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:52,220
we have our special WHERE clause.

15
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:52,990
So WHERE.

16
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:56,684
Afterwards we specify the id to be 2.

17
00:00:56,684 --> 00:00:59,500
And that's because Garfield has id of 2.

18
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,280
So now I go ahead and hit Enter.

19
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:06,070
And if I want to see that it's been
updated, I can use SELECT again.

20
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:10,430
And notice here, the weight of Garfield
has been updated from 14 to 20.

21
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:13,810
So this UPDATE statement is
clearly pretty powerful, so

22
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:15,280
I'll be adding that to
our cheat sheet as well.

23
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:20,550
All right, so now we have the SQL
commands we need to view all our pets

24
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:22,930
as well as to be able to add new pets.

25
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:25,000
Well in our app, we'll also need
to be able to check on a pet,

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,460
and then change or
update their status if needed.

27
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:31,260
So this would be useful,
say if a pet gains weight, or

28
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:36,040
if maybe some DNA tests come back and we
finally know the exact breed of the dog.

29
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:39,385
So let's take a look at how exactly
we can update a single pet.

30
00:01:39,385 --> 00:01:43,630
All right, so now is your chance to
practice using our update SQL command.

31
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:45,820
So try out these two scenarios.

32
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:49,810
So in this first situation, our
knowledgeable vet has identified that

33
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:55,200
Tommy isn't just a Pomeranian, but
in fact he's a Pomeranian Terrier mix.

34
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,900
So go ahead and write that SQL
statement that would update his breed

35
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:00,610
to be the correct breed.

36
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:04,010
And remember,
don't leave off the semicolon.

37
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:07,450
In the second scenario, so the scale of
the shelter was discovered to be broken.

38
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:11,420
And in order to mark all the pets
that need to be re-weighed,

39
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:15,270
the shelter wants to go ahead and just
set all the pets to have a weight of 0.

40
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:17,410
And then update them
one at a time later on.

41
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:19,930
So what I want you to do,

42
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:22,980
is you write the code that would
set all the pets weights to be 0.

43
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:26,490
And once again,
remember this punctuation at the end.

44
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:27,200
All right, best of luck.
