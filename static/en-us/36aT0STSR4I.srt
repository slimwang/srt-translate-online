1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:02,080
Okay, so now you have an image.

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:02,650
Now what?

3
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:04,580
This is where Vagrant comes in.

4
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:07,420
The tagland for Vagrant is
development environments made easy.

5
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:09,450
And, that's what we want it to have,
right.

6
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:11,000
Vagrant allows you to create, run and

7
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,050
connect to development
environments in a very easy way.

8
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:17,620
We've provided a configuration file for
Vagrant or a Vagrant file.

9
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:19,770
For convenience it's in
the virtual box directory,

10
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:21,950
where packers saved its artifact.

11
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:25,850
You just have to register with Vagrant
the artifact that you just created.

12
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:28,260
You can do that with
the Vagrant box add command.

13
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:31,320
You just specify name parameter.

14
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,400
Which I'm just having
be devops-appserver.

15
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,340
Now that it's successfully added,

16
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:39,080
since there's a vagrant
file in this directory.

17
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:42,900
You can do vagrant up, and
it will bring up the dev environment.

18
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:46,420
It'll also mount shared folders, so you
can easily use your favorite editor or

19
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:48,175
IDE for for development.

20
00:00:48,175 --> 00:00:50,315
By default, only the host's
current directory share to

21
00:00:50,315 --> 00:00:51,985
the target/vagrant directory.

22
00:00:51,985 --> 00:00:54,685
But, we have provided some
additional configuration.

23
00:00:54,685 --> 00:00:59,415
And once the machine is up,
you can type vagrant ssh to log into it.
