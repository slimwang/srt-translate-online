00:00:00,252 --> 00:00:03,570
All right, so we got some practice
in how to use a bunch of different

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:07,510
user interface controls,
like how toggle buttons work in Android.

3
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:09,150
Let's keep building on that.

4
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:12,220
This section is all about menus.

5
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:14,800
We will practice how to
make an options menu.

6
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:17,940
You've probably accessed it previously
on your Android phone by tapping

7
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:20,100
the three dots on the top bar.

8
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:23,860
We will also learn how to make
a pop-up menu and a few other things.

9
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:25,670
So here's the drill.

10
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:30,560
We've found the best tutorials on the
Internet on how to use menus in Android.

11
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,590
What we want you to do is to read
the tutorials, follow the instructions

12
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:38,870
therein, and then create new apps to
learn more about how to use these menus.

13
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:39,370
Here we go.
