00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,788
>> Here, the correct answer was b. Great job if you got that one right. First,

2
00:00:05,788 --> 00:00:11,890
let's solve this inequality for y. I can subtract 10 from both sides to get 5 y

3
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:17,938
on the right, and 2 x minus 10 on the left. Then, I divide each term by 5. So, 2

4
00:00:17,938 --> 00:00:23,313
5th x minus 2 is greater than or equal to y. We're used to seeing y on the left

5
00:00:23,313 --> 00:00:28,336
side of the inequality, so let's rearrange this inequality. So, I have y is less

6
00:00:28,336 --> 00:00:32,969
than or equal to 2 5th x minus 2. Notice this inequality symbol is pointing

7
00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:37,558
towards the y in both inequalities. That's a great way that you can check to

8
00:00:37,558 --> 00:00:42,454
make sure you wrote it correctly. First, we plot our y-intercept at negative 2.

9
00:00:42,454 --> 00:00:47,808
And then, we use our slope, 2 5th. We rise 2 units and run to the right 5 units.

10
00:00:47,808 --> 00:00:53,039
So there's the next point. I use a solid line here because that could be equal

11
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:57,741
to the line. We have y is less than or equal to, so points on this should

12
00:00:57,741 --> 00:01:03,824
satisfy this inequality. Again, I'm going to use the origin as a test point, and

13
00:01:03,824 --> 00:01:09,378
I get 0 is less than or equal to negative 2. This statement's not true, so I

14
00:01:09,378 --> 00:01:14,545
don't want this region. I need to shade below. And here's our graph.
