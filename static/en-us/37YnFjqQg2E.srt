1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,210
The example for that decision making.

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:07,180
We did, I think couple years ago yeah,
almost like two years ago.

3
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:09,870
I went off to my clients
when I was the co-anchor.

4
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:14,531
I was helping one of
the biggest ticket app.

5
00:00:14,531 --> 00:00:19,714
And then they want to run
the campaign in the middle of August.

6
00:00:19,714 --> 00:00:23,134
So and then I start work
with them I think June, and

7
00:00:23,134 --> 00:00:27,776
we start work on what's happening
in app, what is the takes

8
00:00:27,776 --> 00:00:32,810
tools we're using them,
what is the finals we're tried to build.

9
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:36,400
I asked him what is your ideal customer
profile, they told me that you know what

10
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:42,900
over 25, male dominant,
the users who are really buying tickets.

11
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:44,580
I said this is not the right audience,

12
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:48,550
because you should definitely
tell me okay, 25, 55,

13
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:53,520
who has a car, and lives in the US and
they went to vacation last two weeks and

14
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,905
they are buying the coffee
every day from 7/11.

15
00:00:56,905 --> 00:00:58,870
So that's what I want to hear, and

16
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:04,220
then I can redefine either those
are the finals or I can make a decision.

17
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:08,325
Obviously they didn't have any expert,
for it so it took me the two months,

18
00:01:08,325 --> 00:01:11,420
16 hours per day, looking for
a different dashboard.

19
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:16,705
And then they told me that this is
like the money we'll want to give you,

20
00:01:16,705 --> 00:01:20,060
around million dollar to
make art more visible.

21
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:25,020
But the problem is that, the time they
choose, because one of the marketing

22
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:28,140
guy, he really want to do
it in the middle of August.

23
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:30,680
I ask her,
what is the reason you want to do it?

24
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:34,280
Because she said, you know what,
it's the time for the people,

25
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:38,950
they really enjoy the summer and
they're probably going to buy tickets.

26
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:45,245
I said, is there any data is tell
us okay this is going to work out?

27
00:01:45,245 --> 00:01:47,725
She said, I don't know, I felt it.

28
00:01:47,725 --> 00:01:52,595
So I should think at that time
marketing should be based on data, and

29
00:01:52,595 --> 00:01:54,115
the numbers and metrics.

30
00:01:54,115 --> 00:01:56,845
So then I figured out
a instead of middle of August,

31
00:01:56,845 --> 00:02:00,401
we should do the second
week of September.

32
00:02:00,401 --> 00:02:05,115
And then at that time in the middle
of August, it was like Thursday I

33
00:02:05,115 --> 00:02:09,340
said we should be do the campaign
on Saturday, the second Saturday.

34
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:15,690
And then they aren't choose any time
zone, I said 7 AM in Eastern Time.

35
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:19,950
And then after that,
I figure out it our user profile, and

36
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:21,560
I redefined the channels.

37
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:27,310
Because before my decision they
were running in ads in every place,

38
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:30,890
and then try to monetize those users.

39
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:33,390
But if you know what the right time,

40
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:37,640
right place, you probably going to save
a lot of money instead of spending.

41
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:42,000
You just figure out the right time, your
right audience, and the right moment.

42
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,500
So the second week of the September,
we spent I think 2% or

43
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,920
3% of the entire campaign and
the budget.

44
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,080
And then we successfully
hit the top charts, and

45
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,000
we stay couple months
without spending any money.

46
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,610
If we did that campaign August, we're
probably going to spend a lot of money.

47
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:04,810
And never going to hit
the right places or

48
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:10,180
right audience because we didn't
know who's going to be our buyer, or

49
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:16,580
who's going to be right user, can stay
and then can keep buying those tickets.

50
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:21,505
So I'm feeling that every marketers,
even indie developers who

51
00:03:21,505 --> 00:03:27,060
are like doing everything as a fun,
they are the product owner.

52
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:30,700
They should be able to know,
okay, the timing,

53
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:35,110
building the right profile or
seasonality.

54
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:40,220
Which is another way you
can get more downloads and

55
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:45,320
more engaging loyal user pretty much for
free, because you're able to know

56
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:49,740
when it's the right time, for example,
send a push notification, right?

57
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:54,210
If it is a rainy day in Seattle you
should probably not say to people okay,

58
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:56,840
this is the best time for

59
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:00,750
buying the sun cream because
probably it's not going to work out.

60
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,280
But some companies they do,

61
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:07,400
because they don't really focus
on the specific user profile.

62
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,650
They just do the very general,
because they have a huge file.

63
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:11,950
They are huge users.

64
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:13,060
They don't really care.

65
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:14,030
But in the mobilizing,

66
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:19,360
it changed because mobile is getting
smarter every time, every day.

67
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:24,640
And then, I feeling that If
you are sending someone 11 PM

68
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:28,920
push notification, it sounds
like crazy but it can work out.

69
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:32,420
And I know some companies,
they're sending that time and

70
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:34,025
they're saying you know what?

71
00:04:34,025 --> 00:04:37,670
A 20% discount for the night shoppers.

72
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:42,580
Because they know those user
keep checking their app

73
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:45,020
every night before going to sleep.

74
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:48,020
So then it is probably the best time for
sending push notification.

75
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:53,500
This old metrics, it tell you you don't
need to rediscover the United America,

76
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:58,450
you should only look at it, this is
the numbers and this is the user and

77
00:04:58,450 --> 00:04:59,900
they are looking for something.
