Lucid dreaming is being conscientiously aware that you're dreaming. So, how can

2
00:00:03,997 --> 00:00:07,910
we lucid dream? Well, Steven L'Burg, an expert in the field, says that lucid

3
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:11,260
dreamers actually develop a mindset that allows them to recognize that they're

4
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:15,912
dreaming. And once they recognize that they're dreaming they can actually

5
00:00:15,912 --> 00:00:17,908
change the content of their dream.

6
00:00:17,908 --> 00:00:22,614
>> That's right and proponents of lucid dreaming tell a variety of benefits. For

7
00:00:22,614 --> 00:00:27,150
example, in one pilot study, they looked at an individual who had nightmares.

8
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:30,222
And the idea was, if you could teach the person to lucid dream and become aware

9
00:00:30,222 --> 00:00:33,438
when they're having a nightmare, they could actually change the outcome of that

10
00:00:33,438 --> 00:00:38,820
dream. In this example, the person did actually experience fewer nightmares,

11
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:43,065
although the mechanism of action, or how it happened still remains unclear.

12
00:00:43,065 --> 00:00:46,278
There are lots of great tips and tricks on how to engage lucid dreaming, and I

13
00:00:46,278 --> 00:00:50,978
really suggest that you try. I myself have been able to lucid dream on a few

14
00:00:50,978 --> 00:00:55,950
occasions. It usually happens when I have this dream that I'm chewing glass.

15
00:00:55,950 --> 00:01:00,070
For some reason, I'm able to realize that I wouldn't chew glass in real life.

16
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:03,170
And it's at this point that I usually wake up, however some people have been

17
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:06,320
able to lucid dream such that they're able to change the content and even fly

18
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,102
away.

19
00:01:08,102 --> 00:01:10,667
>> That's really cool Susan. I'm really glad you don't eat glass when you're

20
00:01:10,667 --> 00:01:11,460
awake. >> [LAUGH]

21
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:14,404
>> That's good but now that I have you here why don't we move on to the drugs and

22
00:01:14,404 --> 00:01:18,382
consciousness part of this lesson since that is area of expertise?

23
00:01:18,382 --> 00:01:22,016
>> That sounds great Lauren, but first we have to say, or define what is a drug.
