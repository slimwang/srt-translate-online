00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,761
We're going to backtrack, for just a second,
to make sure that you understand the steps

2
00:00:03,761 --> 00:00:08,229
that are required to multiply two
polynomials together. So we're just going

3
00:00:08,241 --> 00:00:11,689
to incrementally build up to getting the
final answer for this. So for the purposes

4
00:00:11,689 --> 00:00:16,143
of this quiz, I want you to act like
you're only doing step 1 of solving this

5
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:20,654
problem or of simplifying this expression
rather. So for now, please just treat this

6
00:00:20,666 --> 00:00:24,911
first factor, the x+5, as a block, so as a
single unit, and then distribute it to

7
00:00:24,923 --> 00:00:29,063
each of the two terms inside the second
set of parentheses and then write out what

8
00:00:29,075 --> 00:00:30,955
you would have in the slots over here on
the right.
