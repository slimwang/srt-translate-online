00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Here is a quick quiz on diminishing returns.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Say if we have an execution time that's this long

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:18,000
and function A takes up 90 seconds, and function B takes up 10 seconds

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
for a total of 100 seconds execution time.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Let's saw we're able to make an improvement to our code.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
We speed up B by a factor of 10.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
We make B ten times faster.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The question is how much faster do we make the overall execution

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
of our whole program if B is made 10 times faster?

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Do we make the whole program 9 times faster,

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:53,000
5 times faster, 2 times faster, or 1.1 times faster?

12
00:00:53,000 --> 99:59:59,999
These are approximate number, not exact numbers.
