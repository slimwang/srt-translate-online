>> Basically, all we have to do is once we have the map object, we go through

2
00:00:03,375 --> 00:00:07,262
and cache width, height, tile width, tile height. And then, we actually compute

3
00:00:07,262 --> 00:00:10,682
the pixel size of x and y by multiplying the number of tiles times the tile

4
00:00:10,682 --> 00:00:14,331
size. Once this is done, we can actually set fully loaded to true allowing any

5
00:00:14,331 --> 00:00:16,486
external processing to work on this object.
