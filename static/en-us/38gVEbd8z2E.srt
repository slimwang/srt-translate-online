00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:05,459
The correct answers were negative 2 3rds and positive 3 halves. Fantastic work

2
00:00:05,459 --> 00:00:10,050
if you found these two answers. Factoring is one of those important skills that

3
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:13,600
will come up again and again, so let's make sure that we know how to do this.

4
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:18,738
I'm going to subtract 5x from both sides and 6 from both sides. I perform this

5
00:00:18,738 --> 00:00:23,642
same operation on both sides and I'm just showing these two steps I want. This

6
00:00:23,642 --> 00:00:29,109
leaves me with 0 on the left and 6x squared minus 5x minus 6 on the right. I

7
00:00:29,109 --> 00:00:33,387
also know I want to subtract on both sides here since I want the x squared term

8
00:00:33,387 --> 00:00:37,952
to have a positive coefficient. It's generally easiest to factor when this term

9
00:00:37,952 --> 00:00:42,920
is positive. So, I've taken my equation and I've rewritten it up here to factor

10
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:47,912
this part of the equation we need to find the factors of negative 36 that sum to

11
00:00:47,912 --> 00:00:52,544
negative 5. These numbers are negative 9 and positive 4, so we can rewrite our

12
00:00:52,544 --> 00:00:58,208
middle term and factor it by grouping. This gives us factors of 3x plus 2 and 2x

13
00:00:58,208 --> 00:01:02,544
minus 3. Now that the right-hand side of our equation is factored, we can use

14
00:01:02,544 --> 00:01:06,911
the zero product property and set each factor equal to 0. Solving for x in this

15
00:01:06,911 --> 00:01:11,990
equation will get x is equal to negative 2 3rds. And summing for x in this

16
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:16,346
equation will get x is equal to 3 halves. The last thing we want to do for our

17
00:01:16,346 --> 00:01:20,654
solution set is to make sure we check the excluded values. We know for these

18
00:01:20,654 --> 00:01:25,757
denominators, x cannot equal 0 or else we would have fractions that would be

19
00:01:25,757 --> 00:01:30,282
undefined. Since both of these values are not 0, we can rest assured that this

20
00:01:30,282 --> 00:01:31,599
is our correct answer.
