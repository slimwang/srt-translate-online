00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,710
if there's one thing that any good meme needs, it is an awesome picture.

2
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:07,970
If we were doing this in HTML, we could make an image appear on the screen by

3
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:12,840
using the img tag and setting a source to something this fake image.

4
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,790
But we're doing this with canvas, so let's get rid of this line.

5
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:19,170
So, we'll start by creating a new image, which we'll call image.

6
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:20,270
because why not?

7
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:22,910
And we'll set it equal to a new Image object.

8
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:27,830
Down here, we'll set this source property of the image object to this file,

9
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:30,130
which I've got saved to my local machine.

10
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:33,330
This is part of the power of using the canvas to draw on the screen.

11
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:37,010
We can use a local file as well as any file on the Internet, so

12
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:41,150
if you've found a cool image online, you could put that URL right here or

13
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:44,180
just use a link to the file on your local machine.

14
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:46,930
Images in JavaScript get loaded asynchronously,

15
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:49,610
which means that we need to do work after it's loaded,

16
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:54,460
so we'll set the onload function on the image object to what we've got here.

17
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:58,900
In this case we'll console.log Loaded image, and then we'll doSomethingElse.

18
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:00,460
Let's be a little bit more specific about what we

19
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:02,270
want to happen after the image is loaded.

20
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:06,555
We'll go ahead and grab the ctx again that we created up here and

21
00:01:06,555 --> 00:01:09,770
call the drawImage method on the ctx of the canvas.

22
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:13,640
Into the drawImage method, we'll pass the image itself along with its

23
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:18,480
starting coordinates, x and y, and its width and height, which in this case

24
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:22,730
we're setting to the same width and height as the canvas itself inside the DOM.

25
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:24,670
Let's go ahead and see if this works.

26
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:26,190
So we've got the file saved over here.

27
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:29,930
And inside my browser, I'll go ahead and open up this HTML file.

28
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:33,650
And we can see it's saved right here on my local machine in the same directory

29
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:38,210
as that fry_fixed image that we set the source of the image to right here.

30
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:39,730
So let's go ahead and open it up.

31
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:40,450
And voilÃ !

32
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:41,820
We see the image appear.

33
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:44,590
