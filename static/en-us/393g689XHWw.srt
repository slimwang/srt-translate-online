1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:04,890
To add Google Services you use a
meta-data tag in your app manifest.xml.

2
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:06,050
Here I've pasted it in and

3
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:09,380
you can see it's a meta-data tag
as a child of the application tag.

4
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:13,070
You're specifying that the name
is the gms.version and

5
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:16,580
the value is this
integer/google_play_services_version.

6
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:20,590
This will get replaced for your actual
run time or whenever you compile.

7
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:23,510
But just leave
integer/google_play_services_version,

8
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:24,780
and Android studio will do the rest.

9
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:29,320
In addition to that,
we want to specify find location, and

10
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:32,170
we do that using
the user's permission tag.

11
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:35,440
So the user's permission tag goes
here under the application and

12
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:36,640
above the closing manifest.

13
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:39,540
And again, we're just saying,
uses permission, and

14
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,825
the permission that we're going to
use is access find location.

15
00:00:42,825 --> 00:00:46,227
If you're asked to do so, like I've
been asked here to do a grade all sync,

16
00:00:46,227 --> 00:00:47,205
go ahead and do that.

17
00:00:47,205 --> 00:00:50,525
And that's, once we're done,
we'll if everything compiles okay.

18
00:00:50,525 --> 00:00:52,475
If you look closely at
the bottom of the screen,

19
00:00:52,475 --> 00:00:56,705
that's where Gradle provides its
update of what it's actually doing.

20
00:00:56,705 --> 00:00:58,755
We can see that it's synced and
everything worked.

21
00:00:58,755 --> 00:01:01,485
We have no errors, so
let's go ahead and write our code.
