00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,469
And that is for Pseudo-classical subclasses.

2
00:00:02,469 --> 00:00:03,650
Congratulations.

3
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:05,960
At this point, if you've been following through these chapters,

4
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:09,990
you've learned a lot of different code reuse patterns, including functions,

5
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:14,190
decorators, and all the major class patterns provided natively by JavaScript,

6
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:16,430
as well as their corresponding subclassing techniques
