1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:03,310
We covered a lot in this lesson.

2
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:06,770
Now you know how to send specific
hits to Google Analytics for

3
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:11,440
screen views, events, steps in
the shopping process, and timing data.

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,090
I also talked about
tracking exceptions and

5
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:18,310
crashes, as well as tracking
how users download your app.

6
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:22,200
But what if you want to send
completely different kinds of data that

7
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,670
the amazing engineers
at Google Analytics

8
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:28,400
hadn't thought of when they
created the dashboard and API?

9
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,680
Well, they're ahead of you.

10
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:34,100
They knew they couldn't anticipate
every possible use case, so

11
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:35,360
they added the ability for

12
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:40,070
you to add your own custom metadata
when you send hits to Analytics.

13
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:43,750
You'll need to configure custom metrics,
or dimensions, in the Analytics admin

14
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:48,620
dashboard and then attach the custom
data when sending the hit in your code.

15
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:51,690
I'll leave you to read about that
in the developer documentation

16
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:52,840
when you are ready to try it out.

17
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:56,360
But, now,
let's go learn about Tag Manager.
