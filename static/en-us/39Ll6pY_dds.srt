1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
So please take a while and familiarize yourself with this algorithm

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,750
and then tell me some of its properties.

3
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:08,150
Does this algorithm eventually find

4
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:10,390
any combination of program and input

5
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:13,590
that halts, or are the some that this algorithm might be missing?

6
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:17,110
Is this algorithm feasible or infeasible in practice?

7
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:20,170
And finally, could we modify this algorithm here

8
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:23,930
so that it doesn't only find program and input combinations

9
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:25,540
that do halt,

10
00:00:25,540 --> 99:59:59,999
but also those that don't halt.
