00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:05,464
At age two, doctors told Genie's parents that she had mild retardation. Now her

2
00:00:05,464 --> 00:00:08,453
father, who was not mentally stable, thought that this meant that she was

3
00:00:08,453 --> 00:00:13,270
severely retarded and that she needed protection. Now what happens next is

4
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:17,038
quite tragic. Throughout her life during the day, her father tied her to a

5
00:00:17,038 --> 00:00:22,638
chair, and in the evenings he caged her in a crib. Moreover, whenever Genie

6
00:00:22,638 --> 00:00:27,560
tried to speak, her father beat her and barked at her like a dog. Now this

7
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:30,860
happened to her throughout her life until she was about thirteen years old when

8
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:35,232
her mother ran away and took Genie with her. Now when the social worker first

9
00:00:35,232 --> 00:00:39,788
met Genie, she though she was only six or seven years old. And this is because

10
00:00:39,788 --> 00:00:44,630
Genie was only four foot six inches tall and fifty nine pounds. Not what you

11
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:47,902
would expect from a typically developing thirteen and a half year old. In

12
00:00:47,902 --> 00:00:53,415
addition Genie had very limited language abilities. She could only say things

13
00:00:53,415 --> 00:00:58,365
such as no more or stop it. Intestingly, after four years of lanuages training,

14
00:00:58,365 --> 00:01:03,620
Genie still had limited language abilities. She could meet simple demands in

15
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:08,390
terms of speaking simple sentences but she could not speak grammatically.

16
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:11,782
Interestingly though, her language comprehension was much better than her

17
00:01:11,782 --> 00:01:15,772
language production. Meaning that she was able to understand much of what

18
00:01:15,772 --> 00:01:17,060
people said to her. [BLANK_AUDIO]
