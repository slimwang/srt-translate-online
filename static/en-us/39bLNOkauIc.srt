1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,520
And there answer here of course is yes,

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:04,300
so as long as the program stops

3
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:06,660
and after a certain finite amount of time,

4
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:08,390
we will get the answer yes,

5
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:10,030
simply due to the fact that the program has terminated,

6
00:00:10,030 --> 99:59:59,999
so you know for sure that this a program that halts.
