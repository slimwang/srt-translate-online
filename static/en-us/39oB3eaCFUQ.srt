1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,600
Okay, so let's suppose that the domain name service

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:06,070
says that 72.14.248.239 is an IP we can use

3
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:11,300
for Udacity. Great. Now the OS is ready to

4
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:14,750
establish the connection with Udacity. The actual application data

5
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:16,350
will be empty at this point, so I'll just

6
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:19,370
leave this slot empty. This gets the TCP and

7
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:22,050
header attached to it, which includes the port numbers.

8
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:25,140
And this then gets the IP header attached to it,

9
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:28,880
which will include the source and destination IP addresses. The

10
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,210
routing table on my machine will point me toward the IP

11
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:34,850
address of my modem/router. If my computer doesn't have the

12
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:37,540
MAC address for the router cached, it could acquire it through

13
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:40,620
an ARP request. But this MAC address It is now

14
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:43,580
ready to put the IP packet in an ethernet frame, and

15
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:46,950
send it over the wire to the modem/router. When this

16
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:50,640
router receives the packet, he unpacks it from his ethernet frame.

17
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,900
Looking at the destination IP, he recognizes that

18
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:54,260
this packet is meant for the wide area

19
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:57,240
network. So he strips off the source IP

20
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,410
and the source port, and replaces them with

21
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:03,830
his own IP. And a new port number. This changing of the IP address and port

22
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:07,470
number, that the router does, is called what?

23
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:09,190
There's a three letter acronym for this too.
