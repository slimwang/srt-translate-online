I'm actually making the table, because here at Udacity we have a micro-kitchen

2
00:00:03,534 --> 00:00:07,048
where we keep shared snacks. And I want to find out where all of the cookies

3
00:00:07,048 --> 00:00:10,978
are going. So I'm compiling data and I want to print it out in a table, like

4
00:00:10,978 --> 00:00:15,970
this. Can you complete the code in MicroKitchenTable? To print out this table,

5
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:19,682
a couple quick hints, this vertical bar character on an American keyboard is

6
00:00:19,682 --> 00:00:25,208
right below the Delete key, right here. You'll need to hold down Shift to make

7
00:00:25,208 --> 00:00:30,483
it work. Also, make sure to print a row for me and a row for Cay. I've started

8
00:00:30,483 --> 00:00:35,155
you off with some variables for cookies per day, cereal boxes per day for Sara

9
00:00:35,155 --> 00:00:37,302
and for Cay.
