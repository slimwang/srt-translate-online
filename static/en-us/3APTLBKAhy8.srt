00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:03,638
Since we've been adding and subtracting functions so much, this time why don't

2
00:00:03,638 --> 00:00:07,971
we multiply. I'd like us to keep using the same functions we've been working

3
00:00:07,971 --> 00:00:12,230
with, p and q. Instead of jumping right into graphing though, why don't we

4
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:16,340
start by filling out a table. For each value of x I've listed here, please tell

5
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:21,110
me the value of each of these functions. We have p of x in this column, q of x

6
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:27,806
in this column, and pq of x in this column. Remember that for every value of x,

7
00:00:27,806 --> 00:00:32,689
the value of this function is just the product of p and q.
