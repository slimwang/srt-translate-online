00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:01,810
Let's quickly review the difference between the

2
00:00:01,810 --> 00:00:03,960
Control plane and the Data plane. The

3
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:07,490
control plane is the logic that controls

4
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:11,340
forwarding behavior. Examples of control plane functions include

5
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:14,300
routing protocols as well as logic for

6
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:18,290
configuring network middle boxes. Now, a routing protocol

7
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:21,660
might compute shortest paths or a topology.

8
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:25,550
But ultimately, the results of such computations must

9
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:27,650
be installed in switches that actually do

10
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:30,280
the forwarding. The forwarding table themselves and

11
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:34,590
specifically the actions associated with forwarding traffic

12
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:38,360
according to the Control plane logic is

13
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:41,370
what constitutes the data plane. So examples

14
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:45,160
of data plane function include forwarding packets

15
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:50,530
at the IP layer, and doing things like switching at layer two. So to reiterate,

16
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:53,720
routing protocol functions that compute the paths

17
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,990
are control plane functions. Where as, the act

18
00:00:56,990 --> 00:01:00,210
of actually taking a packet, on an input

19
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:03,660
port, and forwarding it, to an output port,

20
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:08,190
is a data plane function. So why is separating the data and control planes a

21
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:12,290
good idea? The first reason, is independent evolution

22
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:16,050
and development. Thus, software control of the network,

23
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:19,700
can involve independently of the network hardware.

24
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:21,800
The second reason that separating data and control

25
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:27,298
plan is a good idea is the opportunity to control the network behavior from a

26
00:01:27,298 --> 00:01:31,100
high-level software program. Controlling the network from

27
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:34,690
a high-level program in theory allows network operators

28
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:38,650
to debug and check network behavior more easily.

29
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:41,360
Then in the status quo, where network behavior

30
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,100
is determined by the distributed low level

31
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:48,830
configuration across hundreds of switches and routers.

32
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:50,660
The separation of data and control provides

33
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:53,890
opportunities for better network management and data

34
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:56,450
centers by facilitating such network tasks as

35
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:59,310
virtual machine migration to adapt to fluctuating

36
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:03,200
network demands. In Routing, the separation of

37
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,490
data and control provides more control over

38
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:13,620
decision logic. In Enterprise networks, SDN provides the ability to write

39
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:16,830
security applications such as applications

40
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:20,010
that manage network access control. In

41
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:25,320
Research networks, the separation of data and control. Effectively allows to

42
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:28,220
virtualize the network, so that, research

43
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:31,670
networks and experimental protocols can co-exist

44
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:35,970
with production networks on the same, underlying network hardware.
