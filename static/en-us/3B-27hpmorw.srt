To find the set of C Union E, you want any elements that are in set C or in set

2
00:00:04,917 --> 00:00:09,710
E. So, I list the numbers, usually in order, with curly braces on the ends and

3
00:00:09,722 --> 00:00:14,713
with commas in between. For the 2, 4, and 6, I don't need to list them twice. I

4
00:00:14,725 --> 00:00:19,422
know that they're in set C and in set E, but I only need to list them once in

5
00:00:19,434 --> 00:00:20,056
the Union.
