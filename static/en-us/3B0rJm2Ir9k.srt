1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:02,890
I'll walk you through
my implementations.

2
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:05,689
For getting the session ID we start
by specifying a dictionary of

3
00:00:05,689 --> 00:00:07,420
parameters with just the RequestToken.

4
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:10,450
And then the API key will be
added by taskForGetMethod.

5
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:15,600
Then to make the request we'll use
the AuthenticationSessionNew constant.

6
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:18,360
From this point the rest of
the code is much like before.

7
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:19,590
We check for an error here.

8
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:22,800
Otherwise we're looking for
the session ID.

9
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:27,870
if we successfully find the sessionID,

10
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:29,850
then we return it as part
of the completion handler.

11
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:34,980
Okay, now let's look at get userID, it
takes the session ID as a parameter so

12
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:37,020
we've specified it here.

13
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:41,440
And we're going to call the task FerGET
method using the APIs account method.

14
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,120
Then in the resulting data,
we look for the ID key.

15
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:45,140
Let's check.
Is that ID?

16
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:47,983
Yeah, so the ID key, and
that'll give us the user ID, and

17
00:00:47,983 --> 00:00:50,770
then we pass this back in
the completion handler, and for

18
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:54,810
this to work you may notice that we
need to cast this into an integer.

19
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:57,464
So let's go ahead and run this and
see if we make it to the main screen.

20
00:00:59,824 --> 00:01:02,900
I'll click to authenticate,
and I'll click Allow.

21
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:06,260
And after everything
runs behind the scenes,

22
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:08,510
our main tab view controller appears.

23
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:09,840
Nice.

24
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,820
Now I know this may not seem
like a huge breakthrough,

25
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:14,650
but the big payoff is back in the code.

26
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:16,870
If we go back to
the LoginViewController,

27
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:20,810
look how nice the API client hides
away all the networking code.

28
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:23,510
This is literally all our log-in
view controller needs to see.

29
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:28,124
And we can go ahead and remove all
the existing functions that we had.

30
00:01:33,904 --> 00:01:35,070
So let's get rid of those.
