Here's our third problem on solving quadratic inequalities. What do you think

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:07,910
would be the solution set here? Again, for this problem here, we have a union.

3
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:11,186
So you should have two intervals. When you think you have the values of y, that

4
00:00:11,186 --> 00:00:15,550
make this inequality true, type your intervals in here. Good luck.
