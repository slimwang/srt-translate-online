1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:04,610
We're given two points, so we can start by finding the slope. I'm going to label

2
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:11,114
this point x1, y1, and this point x2, y2. For y2, I plug in 5. For y1, I plug in

3
00:00:11,114 --> 00:00:16,774
negative 1. And for x2, I plug in negative 2. And finally, for x1, we plug in 3.

4
00:00:16,775 --> 00:00:22,862
5 plus 1 makes 6 and negative 2 minus 3 is negative 5, so we have negative 6

5
00:00:22,862 --> 00:00:27,425
5ths as our slope. Now that we have the slope, we can use our slope formula

6
00:00:27,425 --> 00:00:31,492
again and fix one of the points to be x and y. These two variables will appear

7
00:00:31,492 --> 00:00:36,233
in our equation. We can plug in negative 6 5ths in for the slope and then we can

8
00:00:36,233 --> 00:00:41,294
use our other point 3 and negative 1 for x1 and y1, that's this point here.

9
00:00:41,295 --> 00:00:47,009
Simplifying the y minus negative 1, I get y plus 1. Now that we're here, we want

10
00:00:47,009 --> 00:00:51,041
to find an equation in slope intercept form, so we want to solve this equation

11
00:00:51,041 --> 00:00:56,691
for y. I can multiply both sides by 5 times x minus 3. We do this as 5 times x

12
00:00:56,691 --> 00:01:01,222
minus 3 is a common denominator for these two fractions. Notice that we just

13
00:01:01,222 --> 00:01:05,239
have factors that appear in the numerator, and also in the denominators. This x

14
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:10,324
minus 3 is just one factor. We use these factors to help us simplify. We know 5

15
00:01:10,324 --> 00:01:16,284
divided by 5 makes 1, and x minus 3 divided by x minus 3 also makes 1. So we

16
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:22,207
have x minus 3 times negative 6 equals y plus 1 times 5. We could have gotten to

17
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:27,243
this step just by cross-multiplying. Negative 6 times x minus 3 on the left. And

18
00:01:27,243 --> 00:01:32,657
5 times y plus 1 on the right. Pretty cool. I distribute the negative 6 to the x

19
00:01:32,657 --> 00:01:37,480
and the negative 3. And I distribute the 5 to the y and the positive 1. Our goal

20
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:42,336
here is to get y by itself. So let's isolate this 5y term. We can subtract 5

21
00:01:42,336 --> 00:01:46,683
from both sides to get negative 6x plus 13 equals 5 times y, and then we divide

22
00:01:46,683 --> 00:01:52,756
both sides of our equation by 5. So I have negative 6 5ths times x on the left,

23
00:01:52,756 --> 00:01:57,200
but 13 5ths equals 1y. It's probably best to continue solving down the page, I

24
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:02,070
just wanted to show our work all in one place. I can rewrite this fraction as

25
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:06,420
negative 6 5ths times x. We know multiplication and division have the same

26
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:09,911
priority in the order of operations. I could do multiplication, and then the

27
00:02:09,911 --> 00:02:14,314
division. Or I could do division, and then the multiplication. These two are

28
00:02:14,314 --> 00:02:18,520
exactly the same. Finally, we can just flip our equation around to get our

29
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:22,050
answer in slope intercept form. We can check one part of our answer. We

30
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:26,163
calculated the slope to be negative 6 5ths earlier in our problem. Well sure

31
00:02:26,163 --> 00:02:30,148
enough, we get negative 6 5ths in our answer. We know that this part of the

32
00:02:30,148 --> 00:02:34,523
problem should be correct so long as our calculation from above was correct.
