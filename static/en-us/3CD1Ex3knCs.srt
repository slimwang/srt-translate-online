00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:04,070
One of the great things about reading
the Material Design specification

2
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:06,689
is that it is presented
using Material Design.

3
00:00:06,689 --> 00:00:09,850
I was immediately struck
by the vivid use of color.

4
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:13,900
The spec says that color should be
unexpected and vibrant with bold

5
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:19,030
hues juxtaposed with muted environments,
deep shadows, and bright highlights.

6
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:23,050
To help designers, the developers of
Material Design provide a sample palette

7
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:26,060
of primary colors for
app developers to choose from.

8
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:29,160
Using these colors isn't some sort of
requirement, especially Especially if

9
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:33,890
your brand already has established
colors, but it's a great starting point.

10
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:38,740
Material uses the number 500 to
represent the base color for the theme.

11
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:41,872
500 is in approximately the middle
of the Material palette,

12
00:00:41,872 --> 00:00:42,979
as in these examples.

13
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:47,350
You should pick a lighter version of
your color from the same palette in

14
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:50,574
the 100 range, and
a darker color in the 700 to 800 range.

15
00:00:50,574 --> 00:00:53,759
I picked the 100 and 700 light blue for

16
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:58,700
the update to Sunshine, which is
similar to our original palette.

17
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:01,280
Then you'll want
the contrasting accent color.

18
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,460
To make things easier,

19
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:06,260
the Material palette definitions
mark accent colors with letter A.

20
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:08,730
You want to pick an accent
color that contrasts with and

21
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:11,500
harmonizes well with
your primary colors.

22
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,760
I chose a shade from the amber palette
because it harmonizes nicely and

23
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,330
matches our icon color.

24
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:19,880
After all, blue skies and
golden suns are not only friendly,

25
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,940
they are evocative of
our application name.

26
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:26,610
So, this is the final short color
palette for our application.

27
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:29,030
Using the support library,

28
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:32,070
we can easily alter our color
palette to use these new colors.
