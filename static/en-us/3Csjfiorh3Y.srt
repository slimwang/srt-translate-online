00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,547
So you're used to the idea of bulk parallelism.

2
00:00:02,547 --> 00:00:05,775
This is where you break down a problem, an array for example, like this,

3
00:00:05,775 --> 00:00:11,248
into a series of threads each operating independently and simultaneously on the data.

4
00:00:11,248 --> 00:00:17,996
So imagine I've got a series of numbers, and I want to scale everything by a factor of a quarter.

5
00:00:17,996 --> 00:00:20,163
So then I would take each of these numbers,

6
00:00:20,163 --> 00:00:23,759
each thread would operate on them independently, and I would end up with my result.

7
00:00:23,759 --> 00:00:29,096
This is bulk parallelism because everybody is operating at the same time without any dependencies.
