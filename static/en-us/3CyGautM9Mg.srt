00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:17,380
>> Yes, so I started at Georgia Tech and ended up getting my PhD there in

2
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:22,310
computer science. Did work in software architecture, software engineering.

3
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:26,740
User interface design and kind of the intersection of those, those three.

4
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:30,130
After I got my PhD I was a faculty member at Michigan State University for

5
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:37,050
about 12 years. Did research in, in formal modeling of software architecture.

6
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:40,770
For the past I guess about six years, I've been working at a local company

7
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:45,915
called Logic Blocks. That specializes in smart databases, and uses a lot

8
00:00:45,915 --> 00:00:50,845
of the modeling ideas and formal methods ideas that I've been working on in,

9
00:00:50,845 --> 00:00:54,100
in my research, in, in practice. So it's been very interesting.
