00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:03,260
Welcome to the front-end
web developer Nanodegree.

2
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:06,370
I'm Mike Wales, the director for
this Nanodegree program.

3
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:07,550
And I'm Cameron Pittman.

4
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:10,030
I'm a Senior Content Developer
here at Udacity.

5
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:11,680
Along with a few other folks, Mike and

6
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:14,110
I are here to help you become
a front-end web developer.

7
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:16,520
In fact you are already
on your Your way.

8
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:17,330
>> That's right.

9
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:18,170
>> From this point forward,

10
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:20,610
we want you to call yourself
a front end web developer.

11
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:23,250
Congratulations, tell your friends.

12
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:25,760
>> I think it makes sense to not just
give you an idea of where you are in

13
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,060
the web development world but
when you are.

14
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:29,460
>> Like a history lesson?

15
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:30,030
>> Well yeah.

16
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:33,080
Mike, you know this better than anybody
else, the web's been around for a while.

17
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:35,140
You've been doing this since what, 92?

18
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:38,360
>> Pretty much, although, back then
technically it wasn't called the web.

19
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:41,170
>> But yeah.
Early 90s >> Well I remember AOL and

20
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:42,280
dial up modems.

21
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:45,420
Funny thing is technology has
changed quite a bit since then.

22
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,810
But the technology
behind browsers has not.

23
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:51,390
In fact today's modern web browser
still support the same technology that

24
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:55,060
the original Netscape Navigator
had back in 1994.

25
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:56,320
>> That's right.

26
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,480
You were joining a crazy world.

27
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,700
One that simultaneously
stays the same yet changes.

28
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:04,360
In fact is changing faster
today than it ever has before.

29
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:07,999
Let's see how.
