00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:01,913
Onto the world of JavaScript.

2
00:00:01,913 --> 00:00:04,960
Concatenation here solves
two problems at once.

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:06,200
First and foremost,

4
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:10,650
it reduces a number of HTTP requests
needed to load your page in production.

5
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:13,450
Which is a big deal, especially
if you're on a mobile connection

6
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:16,950
with up to 300 milliseconds
of latency per request.

7
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:20,730
Secondly, it's the most basic
variant of dependency management.

8
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:23,110
You put all your script
into a folder and

9
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:26,300
instead of having to add script blocks
to load them one by one into HTML,

10
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:29,500
you simply add a single script
block that points to the generated

11
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:32,090
output file,
including all of them concatenated.

12
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:36,430
I say most basic variant because it
obviously isn't smart enough to detect

13
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:39,140
dependency chains and
the required load order.

14
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:41,910
But solving these problems
is a much harder task.

15
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:42,750
Lets keep it simple for now.
