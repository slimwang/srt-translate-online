00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:05,790
We'll be experimenting with D3 on the Udacity course page for this class.

2
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:10,570
Since D3 is a client side JavaScript library you can load it onto any web

3
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:15,150
page that you're on and start playing around with the elements of HTML or

4
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:17,230
SVG contained on that page.

5
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:21,240
If you're on any of the web pages of the data visualization class.

6
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,010
D3 should already be loaded.

7
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:26,080
But if you're on a web page that does not have D3 loaded,

8
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,870
you can simply copy the D3 source and paste it in the web console.

9
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:34,110
I will be using the Google Chrome browser throughout this course.

10
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:37,680
But, any modern browser should have all of the same functionality of

11
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,980
a JavaScript console and an HTML inspector.

12
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:46,660
To open the JavaScript console, we can go to the Tool bar of Chrome accessed

13
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:51,410
from the upper right corner of the browser window, scroll down to the sub menu

14
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:57,000
of Tools, and from Tools you can see here that we can view source,

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,320
access the Developer Tools or go into the JavaScript Console.

16
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,440
As you notice here it pops up a window on the bottom of

17
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,780
my browser that lets me enter and execute JavaScript.

18
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:11,760
Unfortunately at Zipfian Academy we do not have the engineers or

19
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,000
great production team that Udacity has to create such

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,330
a compelling online education platform.

21
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:21,160
What we do have, however, is a knowledge of D3 and JavaScript.

22
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:25,450
So instead of building our own platform, let's usurp Udacity and

23
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:28,340
pretend that we have their own platform as well.

24
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:32,600
We can do this by changing the branding of Udacity's logo,

25
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,990
maybe some elements with the course, and

26
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:38,490
actually change anything else on the webpage that we may want to.
