1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,460
We know from the last question that the y-intercept of the function y equals 1

2
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:11,014
half to the x is 0,1 as we can see right here. What if I wanted a function

3
00:00:11,014 --> 00:00:19,340
identical to this one, but with a y-intercept of 0,4 instead? Which of these

4
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:24,142
function do you think that is? Here's a little hint. Think about what

5
00:00:24,142 --> 00:00:30,970
transformation you'd have to do to move the point 0,1 to the point 0,4 instead.

6
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:35,310
Then, think about what substitution you need to do in this equation to make

7
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:37,360
that transformation happen.
