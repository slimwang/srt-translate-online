1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,140
All right, Michael.

2
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:06,130
So I'm going to deal with your request
by trying to go through an exercise

3
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:09,170
with you, where we try to figure out
what these options are, and there's

4
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:13,800
going to be a secret point here that
has to do as always with abstraction.

5
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:14,450
So here's what to do.

6
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:17,885
So we've got the same little grid
world that we had before up here but

7
00:00:17,885 --> 00:00:19,930
I've introduced another grid world.

8
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:22,490
Do you recognize this grid world?

9
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:25,340
>> It looks like a very tiny,
little game of Pac Man.

10
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:28,260
>> It is exactly a tiny,
little game of Pac Man.

11
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:32,860
So what I want to do with this tiny,
little game of Pac Man,

12
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:36,350
which again is just a grid world, is I
want to explore this notion of options

13
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:38,750
and see what we can
figure out about them.

14
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:40,620
So everybody remembers Pac Man.

15
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:43,430
So Michael, for the benefit of the
audience that has never played Pac Man,

16
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:46,960
all zero of them, why don't you
explain to us how Pac Man works.

17
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:52,428
>> Sure, so in the game where
a little Jewish guy named Pac Man and

18
00:00:52,428 --> 00:00:56,200
we're running around in the grid, we're
the yellow guy and we chomp, chomp,

19
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,290
chomp, chomp, chomp.

20
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:58,840
We can't go through the blue walls.

21
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:04,587
We're being pursued by [LAUGH]
it looks like a sort of-

22
00:01:04,587 --> 00:01:05,423
>> Careful.

23
00:01:05,423 --> 00:01:05,976
>> Yeah.

24
00:01:05,976 --> 00:01:11,410
[LAUGH] I'm going to go with
the french fry goblins from McDonald's.

25
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:15,569
So as we move around in the grid,
we consume those little dots,

26
00:01:15,569 --> 00:01:18,478
little pellets, and
that gives us points.

27
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:22,849
If we can actually clear all the little
dots and the big dots from the screen,

28
00:01:22,849 --> 00:01:25,787
then we have successfully
completed the screen and

29
00:01:25,787 --> 00:01:28,980
we get an even more
exciting challenge next.

30
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:29,640
>> Yes.

31
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:34,210
>> But I want to say that there's one
other important thing is that if we

32
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:36,590
eat one of those power pellets,
the big fat dots,

33
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:42,450
then the tables are turned
on our ghost friends.

34
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:45,600
And we can actually,
if we touch them, consume them.

35
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,360
We get points.

36
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:51,132
And then they have to, I believe their
eyeballs run away and regenerate.

37
00:01:51,132 --> 00:01:53,210
>> Yes, that's exactly what happens,
just like in real life.

38
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:53,840
So, yeah.

39
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,790
>> [LAUGH]
>> So the ghosts touch us, we die,

40
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:59,540
unless we've had the power pellets, and
then they allow us to eat the ghost but

41
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:02,498
only for limited amount of time,
that doesn't last forever.

42
00:02:02,498 --> 00:02:06,240
Once I get a big fat pellet, I don't
get to do it for the rest of the game

43
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,419
it last for some amount of time which-
>> For limited time only.

44
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:10,470
>> Limited time only.

45
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:14,220
And I don't remember if that time
is fixed or that time is random,

46
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:16,870
I think it's fixed but maybe not.

47
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:20,270
And there are different versions of Pac
Man that have slightly different rules,

48
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:21,630
but those are the basic rules.

49
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:23,578
So, here's the exercise
I want to go through.

50
00:02:23,578 --> 00:02:27,070
Now obviously, and when I say obvious,
I'm saying that to beat down anyone

51
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:30,900
who doesn't think it's obvious,
there are four atomic actions, left,

52
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,780
right, up and down,
north, south, east and

53
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:37,080
west just like in any other grid world,
and that's pretty much what we're given.

54
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,520
So here's the exercise I
want you to go through.

55
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:43,990
It's got sort of two parts to it and
this is actually an exercise that we

56
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:47,240
have done with other people as
a part of studies we've done.

57
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:52,000
I want you to think about options
that you might create here.

58
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,170
If you were going to
describe to a human being,

59
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:58,930
here are the things you
need to accomplish,

60
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:03,280
here are the things you need to do
in this game in order to play it and

61
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,200
play it well presumably, what kind
of action would you come up with?

62
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,580
So, I'm asking you do the same thing
that I asked you to do before.

63
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:14,093
Where you said, well go to the doorway,
and you know that kind of thing.

64
00:03:14,093 --> 00:03:16,120
So, I'm asking you do the same
thing here but in Pac Man land.

65
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,320
>> Sure, I can give that a try.

66
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:22,140
I mean, I feel like in some ways this is
is harder than the other example because

67
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:25,546
it was nice to be able to just
navigate to that plus one and

68
00:03:25,546 --> 00:03:28,060
know that our task was complete.

69
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:30,690
Here, there's a lot of things going on.

70
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:35,190
>> Yeah, but you have to simplify it for
me and so abstract away.

71
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:35,870
Simplify it for me.
