1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Well, let's get started.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Taking a look down here at the bottom, one of the first things we print

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
out is funone x is Hong Kong.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The only Hong Kong we ever see in the program

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
is the first argument to funone

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
so that means that this must be x.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Funone y is outside y,

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
which means that we can't have overwritten it here.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
If we put y in this box,

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
we would mistakenly get out 1997,

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
and we don't see that.

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
So it can't be x because we just used x; it can't be y,

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
so let's try z.

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
If we pass in 1997 as z, then y will still refer to this old value of outside y,

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
we'll get the printout that we expect.

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Then we call funtwo, and down here

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
if we take a look at the printout, x remains unchanged.

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,000
X is still outside x, but y is funone y.

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The place we see that is right here, it's the parameter being passed in.

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
So in order from funone y to the flow here,

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
we have to fill in this box with y.

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Note that the way scoping works,

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
funone and funtwo are independent,

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
so even though funone has overwritten x,

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
funtwo still sees the old outside value.

26
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Well, let's test this answer and see if it's right.

27
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I will just add a little more information,

28
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
and we get exactly the output we were expecting.

29
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Some actual information that Hong Kong is a

30
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
special administrative region in China,

31
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
was controlled by the UK until 1997,

32
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
and then down here,

33
00:01:29,000 --> 99:59:59,999
just the output we had hoped to get for this puzzle.
