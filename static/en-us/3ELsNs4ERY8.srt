1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:01,660
So now let's look an an example.

2
00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:02,814
Same peppers image.

3
00:00:02,814 --> 00:00:05,230
And look at the output of the median filter.

4
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:08,060
Here I have applied an 11 by 11 median filter.

5
00:00:09,084 --> 00:00:13,747
If you notice, yes it is a little bit blurred out, but

6
00:00:13,747 --> 00:00:16,140
the edges look quite good.

7
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:18,756
Again, because it didn't just take the average and

8
00:00:18,756 --> 00:00:20,367
replace it by a new pixel value.

9
00:00:20,367 --> 00:00:23,599
It basically took the one in the neighborhood that basically was the best,

10
00:00:23,599 --> 00:00:25,396
the median score of that neighborhood and

11
00:00:25,396 --> 00:00:28,160
replaced that central value with that one.

12
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,880
Just to compare, this is the average, and this is the median.

13
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:33,499
Average, median.

14
00:00:33,499 --> 00:00:36,870
Average, blurry edges.

15
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,270
Median, sharp edges.
