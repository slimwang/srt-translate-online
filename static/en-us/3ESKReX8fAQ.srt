00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Here's a quick exercise.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Why don't we just define two functions--

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
path_states, which takes a path and returns a list of the states,

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
and path_actions, which takes a path and returns a list of the actions.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
The path is interleaved--it contains both--and we want to pull just the states or just the actions.
