00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:05,000
So, now that we've come to a close in this first lesson, we hope you can see

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,910
that psychology answers all of these questions and more. How deep, rich, and

3
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:16,100
broad psychology is as a discipline. In fact, it's as much about lab coats and

4
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:23,590
children, courtrooms, learning and memory. Our personalities and how other

5
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:28,790
people influences as much as it is about cultures and therapists. So, in the

6
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:32,610
coming lessons, we're going to focus in more detail on some of the kinds of

7
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:39,140
questions that psychologists ask and then attempt to answer. And, in doing so,

8
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:44,180
we hope to stimulate you to ask your own questions about human nature. Who

9
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:50,574
knows? Maybe one day you'll be providing us with answers as a psychologist.
