1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Okay, so here we are in our editor, and we've got our form handling code,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
and right now, it just prints, thanks, everytime.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Let's actually use our new verification functions.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
So I've added a line here. I'm calling the valid_month function that we just wrote.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'm sending in as the first argument to that function the 'month' parameter

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
that was included in our request.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
So this will indicate whether our response was valid or not.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I'm going to go ahead and add this for the day and the year as well.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Okay, so we've got these 3 variables, and now let's actually check them.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,000
If not (user<u>month and user</u>day and user_year),

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
we're going to rerender the form again.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
If all 3 of these aren't true, we're going to render our form.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Else if they are all true, we're going to say, thanks,

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
which we have down here.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
So to recap, we're getting our 3 parameters from the request.

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
We're running them through our valid_month, day, and year functions,

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
and if they are not all true, we rewrite the form,

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
and if they are all true, we say, "Thanks! That's a totally valid day!"

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Alright, let's give this a shot in our browser.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Okay, so here we are on our browser. I'm going to type in a day again.

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Okay, so I typed in what I think is a valid month, day, and year,

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
and when I hit submit, our browser says, "Thanks! That's a totally valid day!"

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Let's go to the form again, and this time, we're going to type in something invalid.

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Okay, now I've got an invalid month and normal day and year,

25
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
and when I click submit, the form just clears because we sent back the form again.

26
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
We can improve this a little bit, and let's start doing that now.
