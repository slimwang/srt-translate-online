1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:04,880
Service workers implies some subtle
changes and application architecture.

2
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:10,290
Rather than squashing all of your
application into an HTML string,

3
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:13,210
we need to do things AJAX style.

4
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:16,740
Request the data asynchronously
from the server and

5
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:18,960
then update the local DOM to match.

6
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,790
This is where you have a shell
that's always cast and

7
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:26,780
can always boot up without the network.

8
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:30,740
And the content that is refreshed
regularly and managed separately.

9
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,950
So, what goes into
the application shell?

10
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:40,700
The first step is to break the design
down into it's core components.

11
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:44,365
Ask yourself,
what needs to be on screen immediately?

12
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,910
What other UI components
are key to our app?

13
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:53,210
What supporting resources are needed for
the app shell?

14
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:55,680
For example, JavaScript, Styles, etc.
