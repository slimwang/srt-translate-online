1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:04,800
There are two memory technologies,
SRAM and DRAM.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:08,790
SRAM stands for
Static Random Access Memory.

3
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:13,560
DRAM stands for
Dynamic Random Access Memory.

4
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:16,450
The random access part in both names

5
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:20,060
simply refers to the fact that we
can access any memory location

6
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:23,370
by address without needing to go
through all the memory locations.

7
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:27,370
So random access is as opposed to
sequential access like a tape,

8
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:30,730
where you have to actually scan through
the whole tape to get somewhere.

9
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:35,240
With memory, we can arbitrarily
access any part of the memory

10
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:38,050
without really needing to get to it.

11
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:43,630
So the only difference between SRAM and
DRAM is this static or dynamic behavior.

12
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:48,480
Static, in this realm,
refers to the fact that SRAM

13
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:53,310
retains its data while the power is
supplied, so as long as you connect it

14
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:58,320
to a power source, it's going to
retain the data that you wrote to it.

15
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,488
It's not going to lose it.

16
00:00:59,488 --> 00:01:04,640
Dynamic, in DRAM,
means that it will lose data,

17
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:09,280
even while connected to a power source,
unless we refresh the data.

18
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,720
So, pretty much, we need to read out
the data and write it back in, and

19
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:17,090
keep doing that on a regular basis,
otherwise,

20
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:19,770
DRAM will simply lose our data.

21
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:22,880
Note that both of these types
of memory will lose data

22
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,210
when the power is not supplied,
such as when we turn them off.

23
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:29,420
So it seems like SRAM is better.

24
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:32,440
We like it, because we don't
have to do anything in order for

25
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:37,330
it to keep the data, whereas with DRAM,
we actually have to access the data and

26
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:40,200
write it back in in order for
it to not lose it.

27
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,820
So why do we want to have DRAM?

28
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:46,950
The answer is that for SRAM,
several transistors are needed for

29
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:52,540
each bit of SRAM, whereas for DRAM,
we only need one transistor per bit.

30
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:57,110
So obviously we can get a lot more
DRAM per unit area, than we can SRAM.

31
00:01:58,228 --> 00:02:03,520
So SRAM is good because it retains data,
but bad because it's more expensive.

32
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,350
Here we have to refresh
the data to keep it alive, but

33
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:09,880
we can cram a lot of
these bits on a chip.

34
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,630
It turns out there is
another difference,

35
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:16,820
which is SRAM is typically faster and
DRAM is typically slower.

36
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:21,980
So we get speed, and
simplicity, at more cost.

37
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:28,450
Or, we can go slower and
need to work at it, but have more bits.
