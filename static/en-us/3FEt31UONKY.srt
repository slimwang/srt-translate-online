1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,570
An attacker correctly
guesses Alice's password.

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:08,270
So the method here is something you
know in particular you know, a password.

3
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:13,350
So he was able to guess Alice's password
and is able to login to the system.

4
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:16,379
So is this a false positive or

5
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:18,970
a true negative is the option
that you have to pick?
