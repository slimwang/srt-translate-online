00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,721
Now that we've found one zero, which we know is now at x equal 2, let's see if

2
00:00:03,721 --> 00:00:08,724
we can find some more. In order to do that, we're going to need to divide this

3
00:00:08,724 --> 00:00:13,794
polynomial by some factor that's associated with this route we just found. So

4
00:00:13,794 --> 00:00:19,304
please tell me then, what linear factor produces a zero at x equals 2? Type

5
00:00:19,304 --> 00:00:21,930
your answer in this box.
