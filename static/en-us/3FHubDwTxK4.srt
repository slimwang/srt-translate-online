00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:03,969
>> We often talk about classical and operant conditioning separately. However,

2
00:00:03,969 --> 00:00:08,372
they can be used together to change behavior. A perfect example of this is the

3
00:00:08,372 --> 00:00:13,052
story of Callie the sea lion. Let's go talk to Dr Zeligs about this. She can

4
00:00:13,052 --> 00:00:13,635
tell us more.

5
00:00:13,635 --> 00:00:18,635
>> Callie's back story is both heartbreaking and inspirational. So, she's the

6
00:00:18,635 --> 00:00:23,679
youngest of my group, and she is, I believe, eight years old at this point. She

7
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:27,711
was one of the youngest surviving premature baby sea lions that has ever made

8
00:00:27,711 --> 00:00:33,035
it. She was born more than one month premature. And her mother died of demolic

9
00:00:33,035 --> 00:00:37,768
acid poisoning. Which is a type of toxic algae, it's a neuro toxin. Callie was

10
00:00:37,768 --> 00:00:41,872
exposed to that toxin in utero, and has a huge range of neurologic and

11
00:00:41,872 --> 00:00:46,624
gastrointestinal problems as a result of this exposure, so it's been touch and

12
00:00:46,624 --> 00:00:51,160
go her whole life and one of her big problems is because of this really sort of

13
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:59,208
form of brain damage, she doesn't like food. So her natural instinct is to

14
00:00:59,208 --> 00:01:03,433
starve herself and we have had to use classical conditioning actually to keep

15
00:01:03,433 --> 00:01:07,593
her alive, because what she does like is behavior and people, because how she

16
00:01:07,593 --> 00:01:13,932
was raised. So we used behavior and people to reward her for eating, which is

17
00:01:13,932 --> 00:01:17,962
the opposite of what you normally think, but it's a great testimony to what

18
00:01:17,962 --> 00:01:24,785
classical and operant conditioning can do, and today she's alive and healthy.

19
00:01:24,785 --> 00:01:26,855
>> So learning saved her life.

20
00:01:26,855 --> 00:01:27,163
>> [LAUGH]

21
00:01:27,163 --> 00:01:29,979
Learning saved her life and, and she has learned to like fish.
