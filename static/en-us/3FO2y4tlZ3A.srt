00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:04,710
I'd say the way I articulated sunny vs. rainy, it's actually discrete, but

2
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:07,080
in reality, weather is a continuous phenomenon, it turns out.

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:12,230
So, if you, articulated weather as the amount of light that hits a given

4
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:16,370
area on the ground in a given period of time, that's a continuous measurement.

5
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:19,800
So, you can actually really measure weather continuous effect, I would

6
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,660
argue that most things we consider discrete are actually somewhat continuous.
