00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,610
So, this may come as no big surprise by
now, but the first thing we must do is

2
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:07,730
register our app on Facebook in order to
create a client ID and client secret.

3
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:12,000
Go to developers.facebook.com and follow
the steps to create a web application.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,965
Once the app is registered, I'm
going to manually create a file called

5
00:00:14,965 --> 00:00:18,240
fbclientsecrets.json to
store these secrets.

6
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,733
I will provide a skeleton.json file,
where you can place your app id and

7
00:00:21,733 --> 00:00:23,520
app secret in the instructor notes.
