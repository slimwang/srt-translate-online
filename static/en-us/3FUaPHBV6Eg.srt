1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:02,880
So let's take a look at
the solution to that exercise.

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:03,570
So first,

3
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:07,050
since we'll be using the database helper
throughout this catalog activity,

4
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:10,710
let's start by making an instance
variable for the database helper.

5
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:14,450
Let's do that up here, right,
under the catalog activity declaration.

6
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:18,040
So I might create a private
PetDbHelper instance.

7
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:21,350
I'm going to call that MdbHelper.

8
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:26,020
Now I need to instantiate it and
let's do that in the OnCreate method.

9
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:33,240
So down here,
let's have mdbHelper = new PetDbHelper.

10
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:40,208
And we'll pass in the context which will
be this, which is our current activity.

11
00:00:40,208 --> 00:00:44,290
Now step 2, is I need to go ahead and
call both insert pet method and

12
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:47,250
our display database info method.

13
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:52,240
And I want to do that down here in
our onOptionsItemSeleted method.

14
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,694
So I already have the first
one inside this case and

15
00:00:54,694 --> 00:00:56,930
then let's add the second one.

16
00:00:56,930 --> 00:01:00,210
So that means when the user clicks
on the insert dummy data option.

17
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:02,540
Both of these methods will be triggered.

18
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:05,300
Now to actually build out
our insertPet method.

19
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:08,520
I'll start by getting
a writable database.

20
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:13,210
So what I've done here is create an
object of the SQLite database class and

21
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:19,120
we do so by calling this instance of
PetDbHelper and using this method.

22
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,480
Now next I'm going to
make the content values.

23
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:24,940
But first off let me create
a content values object.

24
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:29,250
So content values,
let's name the object just values.

25
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:31,540
And then call that instantiator.

26
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:32,240
Now next,

27
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:37,380
let's use the content values put method
to store each of the key value pairs.

28
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:41,470
As we discussed earlier, remember
that the key is the column header and

29
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:44,510
the value is whatever the correct
value information is for

30
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:46,030
the pet we want to enter.

31
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:49,080
In our case, notice here we're
hard-coding information specifically

32
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:54,560
about Toto our pet, so information about
his name, breed, gender, and weight.

33
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,970
After we've created our content values
object, we will actually insert

34
00:01:57,970 --> 00:02:00,730
the information into database
by using the insert method.

35
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:05,345
So down below,
let's use our SQLite database object,

36
00:02:05,345 --> 00:02:07,342
DB calling the insert method.

37
00:02:07,342 --> 00:02:11,015
And the first parameter will
be the name of the table,

38
00:02:11,015 --> 00:02:14,710
followed by null and
then the content values object.

39
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:19,017
Now I want to capture the value that's
returned by this insert method and

40
00:02:19,017 --> 00:02:22,053
I want to capture it in
a variable called newRowId.

41
00:02:22,053 --> 00:02:25,450
And let's have that be of type long.

42
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:29,320
So creating this variable allows
us to add an optional log message

43
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,460
at the end of our insert pet method.

44
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:34,500
And doing so
can help us catch any potential errors.

45
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,790
So with those steps completed,
let's run it on our device.

46
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,890
So with the app running on our device,

47
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:42,380
here in our catalog activity,
let's test it out.

48
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:44,105
Click on the overflow menu.

49
00:02:44,105 --> 00:02:46,512
And then click
the Insert Dummy Data option.

50
00:02:46,512 --> 00:02:47,474
[BLANK_AUDIO]

51
00:02:47,474 --> 00:02:48,360
Woot!

52
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:51,730
So notice here the number
of rows increased by one.

53
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:56,160
And in our log, we should be able to
see all the totals that we've added.

54
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,340
So the log message here that we put
into our insert pet method shows up.

55
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:01,420
Let's see if we can add a couple more.

56
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,920
So now I should have three
Toto's in my database.

57
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,440
All right, so if I click my heels three
times, let's go on to the next quiz.
