2
00:00:04,389 --> 00:00:07,675
This course is about software design focusing on high level

3
00:00:07,675 --> 00:00:12,950
architectural design rather than detail design. It is not a programing course.

4
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:15,570
In particular, you should already know how to program in

5
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:18,960
at least one programing language in order to succeed in this course.

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:24,130
It is also not an introductory software engineering course. A prerequisite of

7
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:27,880
the course is that you have already been introduced to this subject,

8
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:31,910
even by another course or because you have worked as a developer in a software

9
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:37,300
development organization. This course focuses on object-oriented design, and

10
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:41,440
the projects make use of the Java programming language. Experience with these

11
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,470
topics is not strictly required, but familiarity will help.

12
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:48,790
If you want a refresher, the class resources page linked to

13
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:53,390
from the instructor's notes points to video lectures I prepared on these topics.
