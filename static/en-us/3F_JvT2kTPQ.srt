1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Here are the definitions I came up with.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Note that I decided here to define plus and opt in terms of things that we had already defined--

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
sequence and alt and star and lit.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
You could've just defined them to be similar to the other ones if you prefer that representation.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
It's just a question of whether you want more work to go on here

6
00:00:20,000 --> 99:59:59,999
in the constructors for the patterns or here in the definition of match set.
