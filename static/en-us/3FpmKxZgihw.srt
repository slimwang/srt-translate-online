00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,530
As an entrepreneur,
when you start working with an investor,

2
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:05,650
there are some compromises that
are going to have to be made.

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:09,780
And one way of thinking about that
is when you make your first pitch to

4
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:12,900
an investor,
the investor starts formulating in their

5
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:17,410
mind what they think this company should
become, what the product should be.

6
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:19,950
And that may not be
the same idea that you have

7
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:21,810
in your head as the entrepreneur.

8
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:24,102
And actually,
part of picking the right investors is,

9
00:00:24,102 --> 00:00:25,908
is there alignment
between these visions,

10
00:00:25,908 --> 00:00:29,920
the vision that the investor shares and
the vision that the entrepreneur shares?

11
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,619
And no matter how close
those two visions are,

12
00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:35,220
sometimes there's going to
be some differences.

13
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:38,260
And as an entrepreneur,
what you have to decide is

14
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:41,830
when the investor's vision is slightly
different, are you going to adjust?

15
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:43,710
Are you going to course correct?

16
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,310
And when you're thinking
about doing that and

17
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:48,470
you're thinking about those compromises,
it's important to take a step back and

18
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:50,690
think about it from
the investor's perspective.

19
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:52,020
They're not in the weeds.

20
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:53,200
They're not in the detail.

21
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,800
Maybe they're looking
at the bigger picture.

22
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,390
Maybe they're looking at other
companies in the marketplace.

23
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:01,140
And you have to constantly evaluate,
should you course correct or

24
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:03,400
should you really remain on your vision?

25
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:06,030
Ultimately though,
if you're taking money from investors,

26
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:08,612
there are going to be
compromises you have to make.

27
00:01:08,612 --> 00:01:11,430
They're going to ask you to do
things that may not have been your

28
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:15,560
first priority and, sometimes you're
just going to have to do that.

29
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:21,450
And it comes down to making sure
that your investors are really good

30
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:23,150
and that their ideas are sound.

31
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:23,790
And if they are,

32
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:25,980
sometimes they're going to tell you
something that you didn't think of and

33
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:26,940
you're going to have to correct.
