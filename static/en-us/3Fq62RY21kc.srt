00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,975
Now that you know what a polynomial is, we're going to talk briefly about a word

2
00:00:04,987 --> 00:00:09,810
that we use to characterize a given term in a polynomial. The degree of a term.

3
00:00:09,917 --> 00:00:14,745
Now, the degree of a term is equal to the sum of all the exponents of all of the

4
00:00:14,757 --> 00:00:19,395
variable that are in that term. So if we have a term like negative 4x cubed,

5
00:00:19,502 --> 00:00:24,726
then the degree of this term is 3. Since we have an exponent of 3 for the only

6
00:00:24,738 --> 00:00:30,074
variable that's in the term x. Another way we could say this is that this is a

7
00:00:30,086 --> 00:00:35,260
3rd degree term. Now if, in contrast, we have a term like 6y to 7th, z to the

8
00:00:35,272 --> 00:00:40,584
4th, the degree is 11 or we could also say this is a 11th degree term. Now the

9
00:00:40,596 --> 00:00:45,027
degree is 11 here, because for a first variable we see we have a power of 7 and

10
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:49,534
for the second variable we have a power of 4. y and z are the only two variables

11
00:00:49,546 --> 00:00:54,041
in this expression, so the degree is equal to the sum of their powers, 7 plus 4

12
00:00:54,053 --> 00:00:54,603
equals 11.
