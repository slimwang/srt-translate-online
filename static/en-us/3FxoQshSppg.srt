1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
As you can see the optimal path for this diagram over here,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
which determines what is occlusion and what is a bad match,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
really is a function of those penalties,

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
the costs that we associate with poor matches or the occlusion assumption.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
So running dynamic programming through this grid over here will give you

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
the best alignment that gives you the best possible total cost

7
00:00:24,000 --> 99:59:59,999
that assumes an optimal trade off between occlusion costs and the cost of matching 2 pixels.
