This is a good time to bring up a quiz for you. This question is asking you, why

2
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:12,800
did Mach take roughly 800 or more cycles than L3 microkernel for doing this

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,520
border crossing between user and kernel? Is it

4
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:19,920
because L3 uses faster processor? Is it because

5
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,750
Liedtke is smarter? Liedtke, as you know, is

6
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:26,490
the author of the L3 microkernel. Is it because

7
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:29,980
Mach's design priorities are different from L3

8
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:34,580
microkernels? Or is it because microkernels are

9
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:37,190
slow by definition? Those are the four

10
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:39,230
choices. You had to pick the right choice.
