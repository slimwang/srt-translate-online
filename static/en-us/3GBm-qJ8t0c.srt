Since we've been talking about points on these curves, let's graph them. Here's

2
00:00:04,454 --> 00:00:08,957
the graph of f of x equals 10 to the x and here's the curve of g of x equals

3
00:00:08,957 --> 00:00:14,290
log base 10 of x. Since these two functions are inverses, there's a link

4
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:18,620
between their domains and their ranges. Using interval notation, I'd like you

5
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:22,220
to find the domain of f and the range of g and the range of f and the domain of

6
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:23,949
g.
