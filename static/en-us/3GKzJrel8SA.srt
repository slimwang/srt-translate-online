1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:05,260
The answer is this first expression
here, unless ui is positive, we can make

2
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:09,740
gamma as big as we want without
running into the constraint here.

3
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:13,890
And of these constraints, we hit the one
where this ratio is lowest first.

4
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:19,700
Setting gamma to this value makes
one of these constraints tight and

5
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:24,060
sends the corresponding
entry of xB to zero.

6
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:30,540
Remember that this equation came from
the constraint that xB be non-negative.

7
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:34,400
We can then bring dq into our basis, and

8
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:38,570
kick out the column corresponding to
the constraint that became tight.

9
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:42,950
We then want to repeat this process
over and over, getting better and

10
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:44,490
better basic feasible solutions.
