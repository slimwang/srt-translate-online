00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,335
My answers would be that
the advantage is that providers

2
00:00:03,335 --> 00:00:07,510
are more likely to participate,
since it's at their site.

3
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:10,040
And securing the data is
obviously simplified,

4
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:12,130
since it doesn't leave their site.

5
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:18,120
My disadvantage is the need to deal
with the specifics of each EHR.

6
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:21,540
This is, essentially, the curly
braces problem, yet, once again.

7
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:27,750
And the need to update the on site
software should that EHR design change,

8
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:28,750
which often happens.
