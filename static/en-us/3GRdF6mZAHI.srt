>> So I said that there'll be three potential general models left after

2
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:06,760
specializing and pruning. Those three models are going to be

3
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:10,120
that I could just be allergic to everything at Kim's, I could just always be

4
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:13,070
allergic to breakfast, or I could just be allergic to eating on Friday.

5
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:17,150
I would prune the ones based on cost and whether or not the meal is vegan,

6
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:21,150
because although I've had bad reactions to cheap, non-vegan meals in the past,

7
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:24,690
here I didn't have a reaction to a cheap, non-vegan meal. So it's not sufficient

8
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:27,930
to say I'm allergic to everything non-vegan or I'm allergic to all cheap food.
