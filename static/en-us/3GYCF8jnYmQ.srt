1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,410
Naturally, with great power
comes great responsibility.

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:08,320
Invoking a method that doesn't
exist is not usually a good idea.

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,540
Let me show you what I mean.

4
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:12,500
Here's an array,
similar to the last one,

5
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:16,890
but this time I swapped out
the dealer object for a string.

6
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:20,320
Now let's see what happens
when we call the method play.

7
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,995
No compiler errors, so far so
good, and we press run.

8
00:00:23,995 --> 00:00:26,350
Uh-oh!

9
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:29,000
Of course,
we knew that was going to happen because

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,280
ns string obviously has
no method called play.

11
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,780
Let's take a look at
what this error says.

12
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:39,220
So, we'll scroll up to the top
of the console and it says

13
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:44,410
unrecognized selector sent to instance
and then there's a string of numbers.

14
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:47,070
You've probably seen in
an error like this before, but

15
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:51,760
you may not have realized that that
word selector comes from Objective C.

16
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,050
In Objective C,
selector is another name for method.

17
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:58,520
So when you see this unrecognized
selector sent to instance,

18
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:02,500
start debugging by investigating
objects with the type ID.

19
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:05,360
It's possible that the class
of the offending object

20
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,920
is not what you think it is at run time.

21
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,680
And to defend your code
against the perils of ID,

22
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,300
you can also use introspection.

23
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:17,090
You can ask if the object at hand
responds to the selector in question.
