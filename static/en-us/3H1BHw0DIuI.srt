00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,650
To give your app permissions,

2
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:06,689
you'll use the user's permission
tag within AndroidManifest.xml.

3
00:00:06,689 --> 00:00:10,770
The user's permission tag should be
a child of the manifest tag, and

4
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:12,890
a sibling of the application tag.

5
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:15,890
It should not be within
the application tag itself.

6
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:17,750
Here's what it should look like.

7
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:20,210
Here, you can see I've set
user's permission, and

8
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:23,640
I've specified that I'm
using ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION.

9
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,450
This means that I've specified my
application will use FINE LOCATION.
