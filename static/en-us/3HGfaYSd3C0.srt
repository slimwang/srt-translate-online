1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,930
Let's look at the example
of image intensity.

2
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:06,850
Now most of the time, again, if you
remember our earlier work on looking at

3
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:10,022
image intensities in images,
mostly, if in fact, an image

4
00:00:10,022 --> 00:00:14,090
intensity changes because we have more
bright pixels or less bright pixels.

5
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:18,315
So in essence, mostly this would require
us to be invariant to additive and

6
00:00:18,315 --> 00:00:21,560
multiplicative changes
in image intensity.

7
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:24,000
And most of the time
the competition we're looking at,

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,830
since it's dependent on the gradient
information, would be invariant as long

9
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:32,900
as at any point within the neighborhood,
irrespective of the brightness at that

10
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:36,980
point, the invariance or the gradients
at that point are the same.

11
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:40,340
So again, essentially what
happens at any point in an image,

12
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:44,660
as long as we are working with
derivatives, we should be able to kind

13
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:49,670
of compute the information, the response
function, response function's purely

14
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:54,200
being dependent on the derivatives,
would not care if the image intensity of

15
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:58,470
the region that we're looking at is
much larger from one to the other.

16
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:01,550
So in essence,
what we're just repeating here is,

17
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:04,610
it would be invariance to
any kind of intensity shift,

18
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:08,250
if you add a constant derivatives
actually still won't care.

19
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:11,530
And similarly, if there was a scale
again the derivatives would not

20
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:15,820
be impacted, and all of that actually
still same results would appear.

21
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:18,835
And this is demonstrated by again,
our example.

22
00:01:18,835 --> 00:01:21,469
Basically I look at
the response function r, and

23
00:01:21,469 --> 00:01:23,740
depends on where our threshold, right.

24
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:25,650
Because if my threshold at that level,
and

25
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:29,900
if these two points are the ones that
I'm looking for, I'll still detect them.

26
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:31,400
But if I choose a threshold and

27
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:36,960
now somebody has scaled my intensity
variations, which will impact this.

28
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,920
Then it might actually cause a problem.

29
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:42,500
So then we basically would have to
have an adaptive threshold that

30
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:46,880
knows more about the scaling of
the intensities in an image.

31
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,903
But otherwise we still should be able to
find, because the shape of the response

32
00:01:50,903 --> 00:01:54,220
one, response over the whole
sequence should still be the same.
