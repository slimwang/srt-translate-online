1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
If we apply this higher amount of friction, it's going to take 3.4 seconds to bring the car

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
to a complete stop and for the smaller amount of friction, it's 4.9 seconds,

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and now let's look at how to compute this.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
We have to take two different forces into account.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
The force due to friction, biking that is, and the force due to gravity.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Newton says F=m*a.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
The force due to friction equals the mass of the car

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
times the deceleration as we are breaking off the car.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
But the force exerted due to friction is amountable of the force exerted by gravity

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
with the proportionality constant µ and what's force the exerted by gravity?

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
It's the mass of the car times the gravitational acceleration of the earth.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
You see that's Newton law applied in the reverse direction.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
If you look closely, you'll see that mass cancels from both sides of the equation

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
and the deceleration equals the constant of friction times the gravitation acceleration.

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
This is one funny consequence for astronauts.

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
When you try to break a car on the moon, the gravitational acceleration is far less than on earth

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
and so the deceleration is far less than on earth.

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Breaking is far more ineffective on the moon than on earth.

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Now we can use this result to look at how speed depends on time.

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
The deceleration is constant so the velocity decreases

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
by a certain fixed amount of meters per second.

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The relationship between velocity and time is linear

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
and the slope of this line is given by the acceleration.

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
This side has a length of 1, this side has a length of a, the acceleration,

25
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,000
which is, as we now know, the constant of friction times the gravitational acceleration.

26
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
You'll see two similar triangles in here.

27
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,000
We have the time it takes to come to a complete stop divided by the initial velocity

28
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
equals 1 divided by the deceleration.

29
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:08,000
The time it takes to come to a complete stop equals 120 km/h divided by our deceleration

30
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
which is the constant of friction times the gravitational acceleration.

31
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
We have to go from kilometers per hour to meters per second.

32
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:24,000
The gravitation acceleration equals 9.81 m/s² .

33
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
To make this work, we should be using m/s for the velocity as well.

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:39,000
One kilometer is 1000 meters and 1 hour amounts to 3,600 seconds.

35
00:02:39,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Now you can do the math.
