1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,660
Learning to code is hard and

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:05,520
you will feel confusion and
you will feel frustration.

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,920
But that is okay, that's to be expected.

4
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:11,989
What isn't okay is
when these confusion or

5
00:00:11,989 --> 00:00:17,447
frustration is allowed to turn into
something worse like disappointment,

6
00:00:17,447 --> 00:00:22,080
or anger, or terror, or
whatever, whatever that guy is.

7
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,800
Certainly doesn't look happy.

8
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:27,470
And since you're watching this right
now, you want to learn to code.

9
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:30,420
But if you start feeling
anything like this,

10
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:32,400
you're probably going to want to quit.

11
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:37,130
So, you should try your best to
avoid letting this, turn into this.

12
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:40,590
So, let me tell you some strategies for
how to stick with it.

13
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:41,670
When you start feeling frustrated or

14
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:44,030
confused, there are a few
things you can do.

15
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:46,180
First, you should always ask for help.

16
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,930
Typing your problem into a Google
search bar, will often solve it.

17
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:54,950
And, you can also go to
the Udacity discussion forums.

18
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:56,690
Your classmates
are an incredible resource.

19
00:00:56,690 --> 00:01:01,130
The second thing you can
do is just take a break.

20
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:02,610
Press that pause button.

21
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:06,010
Try to learn when you're frustrated
can be really counterproductive.

22
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:08,700
Don't hesitate to stop and
come back the next day.

23
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:11,970
The third thing you can do, and this is
something a lot of people have trouble

24
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:16,950
with, but which is really useful,
is you can just keep going.

25
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:18,540
Look at answers when they're available.

26
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:19,690
Try to learn from them.

27
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:21,720
Go on without them if they're not.

28
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:25,040
Remember, you are not meant to be an
expert in this nanodegree, so sometimes

29
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,730
the best move will be to just go on and
accept a little temporary confusion.

30
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:31,912
To help you know when you should
feel comfortable continuing,

31
00:01:31,912 --> 00:01:35,970
I'm going to occasionally be asking you
to rate yourself on the spectrum of

32
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:38,770
expertise from ignorance to fluency.

33
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:39,830
And then based on your responses,

34
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:43,020
I'm going to give you feedback
about what you should do next.

35
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:43,920
Let's try that out right now.
