1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
This unit is all about variance

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
and one of its very close cousins, the standard deviation.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Say you are a beginning college student,

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
so your friends might be of the following ages:

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
17, 19, 18, 17, and 19.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:25,000
And you also have 5 close family members of ages 7, 38, 4, 23, and 18.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Now for both you can compute the mean.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Please enter the mean on the right side.
