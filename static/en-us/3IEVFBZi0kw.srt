1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:04,170
These days, we understand
a lot about human behavior.

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:06,970
For example,
our eyes are naturally drawn to motion.

3
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:11,760
If something is moving while
everything around it stays the same,

4
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:14,750
we're naturally drawn to
the thing that's moving.

5
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:19,220
This is a powerful tool in UI design,
really useful for directing

6
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:23,970
your user's attention to an important or
immediately relevant UI element.

7
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:25,580
But that's just the beginning.

8
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,920
We saw in lesson two, that shadows
can tell you a lot about a surface.

9
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:33,570
Well, how that surface moves can
actually tell you a whole lot about

10
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:34,810
it as well.

11
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:37,340
More specifically, an object's motion

12
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:40,960
can provide important cues about
how you could interact with it.

13
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,430
Let's take a look.

14
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:44,890
Take a look at this example of tabs.

15
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:46,280
Okay, now take a look at this one.

16
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,850
Can you tell the difference?

17
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:51,230
Here they are side by side.

18
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:55,530
In both cases pressing on the tab
at the top changes to that tab.

19
00:00:55,530 --> 00:01:00,200
But, in the second example, a little
slide animation is used to switch tabs.

20
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:04,860
This subtle animation helps communicate
that you can actually swipe the tabs

21
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:06,410
to switch between them.

22
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:09,580
We call this instructive motion.

23
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:11,380
Without this kind of instructive motion,

24
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:15,350
it would be less likely that users
would discover this behavior,

25
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:20,000
as the spatial relationship
between pages would be less clear.

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,960
In this example, as the music
player controls move into view,

27
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:28,170
notice how the volume
control slides into place.

28
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:31,950
This animation provides a subtle cue
that the user can move the slider,

29
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:33,690
horizontally, along the track.

30
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,610
And remember in Lesson 2 how we talked
about the elevations of surfaces and

31
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:42,405
how they can imply what
happens upon scrolling?

32
00:01:42,405 --> 00:01:46,898
Well changes in elevation could help
communicate changes in interaction.

33
00:01:46,898 --> 00:01:51,430
When two surfaces are adjacent like here
at the same elevation they might move

34
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:56,420
together, but at some point one
surface might change its elevation

35
00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:00,490
to communicate that it now moves
independently of the other one.

36
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:05,120
The way that content enters the scene
can also imply ways to interact with it.

37
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:09,669
In this example, the bottom sheet enters
from the bottom of the screen, implying

38
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:14,160
that it can be dragged upward or
dismissed by dragging it back downward.

39
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:18,900
In all these examples of instructive
motion, you can see that how something

40
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:22,220
moves can give you plenty of hints
about how you can interact with it.
