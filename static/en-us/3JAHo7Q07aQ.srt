1
00:00:00,444 --> 00:00:03,980
Assume this application is strongly memory bandwidth bound

2
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:09,545
whereas memory bandwidth is the performance bottleneck for this problem.

3
00:00:09,545 --> 00:00:12,050
If we run the same application

4
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:16,601
on a different GPU with half as much memory bandwidth

5
00:00:16,601 --> 00:00:19,859
and twice as many SMs,

6
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:23,859
which curve best represents the performance that you might see?
