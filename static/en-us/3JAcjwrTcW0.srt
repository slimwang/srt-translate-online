00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
[Evans] There's one last type of memory in your computer that I want to talk about,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
which is the hard drive.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
This is what a hard drive looks like.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
You can see that this hard drive has 1 terabyte of data.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
If you turn it upside down, you can maybe get a little better sense of what's going on here.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
It's a little hard to see.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
My wife drew the line at opening the hard drive,

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
so I'm sorry I can't show you inside it.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
But inside here there's a bunch of disks that are spinning,

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
and the disks are storing data in a magnetic way,

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
and there's a read head that can read data from the disk

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
as well as write new data from the disk.

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
So this is a very slow way of storing data compared to what we have in the DRAM,

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
but it can store a lot more data with a lot less cost.

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
There are 2 important properties that the hard drive has.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
The hard drive is a lot bigger than the DRAM. It stores a lot more memory.

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:58,000
This was 2 gigabytes. This is 1 terabyte, so that's 500 times as much memory.

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
And a terabyte is close to a trillion bytes, so that's 8 * 2 to the 40 bits,

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
which is equivalent to 8.8 trillion bits.

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
This is enough memory to store about a quarter million songs.

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The latency for a hard drive is much worse than the latency for the DRAM memory.

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
And the reason for that, if you think about what you have to do

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
to get data out of the hard drive, you've got these disks that are spinning

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
in a physical thing, so you've got to wait until it spins to the point in the read head

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
where you can read it.

26
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
If it's not in the right place, the read head also has to move across this.

27
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
You're moving real physical things, so that takes time.

28
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
The latency for a hard drive is about 7 milliseconds,

29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
and a millisecond is 1/1000th of a second.

30
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
And that's the average time. The time varies depending on where the data is.

31
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
So if you have to wait for it to spin all the way around and move to the head,

32
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
that can take a lot longer.

33
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
If you're lucky, the data is in the right place and it doesn't take that long.

34
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
The cost of this hard drive is about $100 US dollars.

35
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
So let's add the hard drive to our data table.

36
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:13,000
For the quiz it's up to you to figure out the values for the hard drive in the data table.

37
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:21,000
As a reminder, we said it was $100 US for a 1.0 terabyte hard drive.

38
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Your goal is to figure out the number of bits.

39
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I've told you the latency is 7 milliseconds. That's a milli, not a nano.

40
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
You should be able to compute the latency distance.

41
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
The units to use for this are kilometers.
