00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:04,462
Given two screens of identical
resolution, like the two you see here,

2
00:00:04,462 --> 00:00:09,810
why would text look different
on the different screens?

3
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:14,070
In this case, we can see that the
resolutions are identical, and we also

4
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:19,290
know that they have the same source, so
the HTML and CSS are also identical.

5
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:22,600
Is it because CSS styles
aren't rendered predictably?

6
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:27,160
Is it because the device pixel ratio
differs between the two devices?

7
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:30,950
Is it because the meta tag's
initial-scale property on the content

8
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:35,500
attribute is causing inconsistent
zooming, on different devices?

9
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:38,220
Or is it because
the viewport was never set?

10
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:39,150
Check all that apply.
