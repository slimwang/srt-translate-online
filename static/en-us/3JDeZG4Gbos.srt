00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,995
Let's look at a more complicated case of powers of powers. Here, I don't just

2
00:00:04,995 --> 00:00:10,774
have one base, I have two I'm multiplying 4 cubed and 3 squared. And this

3
00:00:10,774 --> 00:00:15,514
quantity will be raised to the 4th power. If I want to simplify this problem and

4
00:00:15,514 --> 00:00:20,123
in particular the exponents, I would need to rewrite this. First, I write 4

5
00:00:20,123 --> 00:00:24,560
cubed times 3 squared four times, that would be this. Notice that I have

6
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,980
multiplication between every single term, so this is really just a product of

7
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:33,583
factors, and I don't need to list the parenthesis. We can rearrange the product

8
00:00:33,583 --> 00:00:37,459
of our factors and I can group the 4 cubes together and the 3 squared's

9
00:00:37,459 --> 00:00:41,892
together. If I expanded all this out I would have 12 4s and 8 3s. So I know my

10
00:00:41,892 --> 00:00:46,001
final answer is 4 to the 12th times 3 to the 8th. So I know my final answer

11
00:00:46,001 --> 00:00:50,259
would be 4 to the 12th and 3 to the 8th. Again, I don't want to have to list all

12
00:00:50,259 --> 00:00:54,588
these factors out when I'm doing this work. There must be a shorter way. If I

13
00:00:54,588 --> 00:00:59,052
look at how these exponents changed, what did I really do? Well it turns out

14
00:00:59,052 --> 00:01:03,392
that I distributed this exponent of four to each of the factors 4 cubed and 3

15
00:01:03,392 --> 00:01:08,311
squared. So I have 4 to the 3rd raised to the 4th power and 3 squared raised to

16
00:01:08,311 --> 00:01:12,704
the 4th power. Now we just apply the rule that we learned before. When we raise

17
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:17,263
a power to a power, we multiply the exponents together. So I get 4 to the 12th

18
00:01:17,263 --> 00:01:19,242
and 3 to the 8th. Pretty neat.
