1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,250
Privacy actually is not a new problem.

2
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:06,580
We have had it forever.

3
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:11,020
Now people have always worried
about what others know.

4
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:14,940
Others could be your friends,
could be your family,

5
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:18,740
could be your adversaries,
your competition.

6
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:21,860
It could be government agencies
when we talk about Big Brother,

7
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:23,900
when we talk about the government.

8
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:27,730
So what do they know about us,
in particular our activities and

9
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:30,000
what we do, or who we are?

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,580
So we always have worried about this.

11
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:36,520
So what's new in the online context?

12
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:37,440
Well the scale and

13
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,380
magnitude at which information about
what we do can be collected, okay?

14
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:46,970
Our activities online and someone's
ability to collect information about

15
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:51,740
what we do, and
then be able to share it and use it, and

16
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:57,150
even sold, sold for and
monetize that information.

17
00:00:57,150 --> 00:01:01,525
The scale at which this can
be done now is unprecedented.
