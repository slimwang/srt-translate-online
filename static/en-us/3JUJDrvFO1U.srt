1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:01,984
We've come a long way in this course.

2
00:00:01,984 --> 00:00:03,510
>> Yeah.
>> Some of our students may be feeling

3
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:05,345
ecstatic that they built
these couple of apps.

4
00:00:05,345 --> 00:00:07,150
>> Yeah.
Although some of them may be feeling

5
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:11,250
a little bit pensive because they
realize that there is a lot to learn.

6
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:13,550
>> There is, and
I can empathize with that feeling.

7
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:17,130
When I first started at Google,
I felt out of place.

8
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:18,650
I didn't know why they hired me.

9
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:20,670
I just felt like an impostor.

10
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:22,020
>> Like impostor syndrome?

11
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:26,130
>> Exactly, but then I realize that
other people also feel the same thing,

12
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:27,720
and that made me feel more at ease.

13
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,810
>> Wow, thanks for sharing.

14
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:31,350
Let's do the same thing for
our students next.

15
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:31,970
>> Okay.

16
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:34,790
>> Here are some Googlers sharing
their stories of feeling out of place.
