1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,240
All right.
Enough of that, but

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:05,230
this idea of which
categories are best for

3
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:11,590
visual identification is a challenge for
doing this labelling.

4
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:13,010
So, let's assume for

5
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:16,400
a moment that we're going to have
some set of visual categories.

6
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:21,140
A question you might ask is,
about how many of them are there?

7
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:23,130
It's kind of a weird question to ask,
you know,

8
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:25,000
how many types of things are there?

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:25,660
But you know, look,

10
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:28,660
we've got a finite amount of gelatinous
stuffed between our ears, and

11
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:31,900
there's this question of sort of, how
many different labels do you deal with?

12
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:36,150
So Irv Biederman, a psychologist and
does work in cognitive vision and,

13
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:40,010
and mental models for doing vision,
back in the, in the 80s,

14
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:45,890
he came up with this number of
about 10 to 30 thousand, okay?

15
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:48,590
Now, big range, but
it's an interesting idea,

16
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:52,320
because it's also related if you take a
look at the number of nouns people know.

17
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,190
That is, you could ask how
many nouns do you know?

18
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:56,890
Well, it's not going to be 2 million and
it's not going to be 11,

19
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:59,730
at least I hope if you're watching this,
it's not 11.

20
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:00,640
Okay?

21
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,740
It's in the tens of thousands of range.

22
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:04,310
Okay?
So it

23
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:09,410
gives you some idea of sort of
the scale of the recognition problem.

24
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:10,360
There are, by the way,

25
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:13,500
other types of categories other than
just sort of natural categories.

26
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,360
So, for example,
you think about functional categories.

27
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:21,220
So, here's a set of chairs, and yes,
you can sit in all these things,

28
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:23,900
although some of them look
like they would be kind of

29
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:28,160
stunningly uncomfortable, but they
don't really share a visual property.

30
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,900
So you can imagine that semantically,
in your head,

31
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:31,860
you know that they have
a certain relationship.

32
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:36,620
But from a recognition perspective,
it's not clear that the same process

33
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:40,920
that recognizes this as a chair,
should also recognize that as a chair.

34
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:46,510
Another type of category which is valid,
but not perceptually relevant might be

35
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:51,170
the sort of ad hoc categories of things
you find in an office environment.

36
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:52,760
That's a perfectly natural category.

37
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:56,235
In fact, it's even a category which you
can think about probabilistic reasoning

38
00:01:56,235 --> 00:01:57,101
as biasing things.

39
00:01:57,101 --> 00:01:59,830
Right?
If I tell you you're in an office,

40
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:03,335
you're much more likely
to find a stapler, right,

41
00:02:03,335 --> 00:02:05,630
than to find a horse whip.

42
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:07,360
So maybe that would
bias your recognition.

43
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,350
But the notion of it being
a single visual category

44
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:12,970
as you can see from these objects
doesn't make a lot of sense.
