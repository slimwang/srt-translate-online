1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,160
All right, so
do you have an answer for this quiz?

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:03,880
>> I don't but
I think I know how to get one.

3
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:04,880
>> Let's go for it.

4
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:08,029
>> Okay, so basically your
asking me to estimate from data.

5
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:12,370
So you really, what your really doing is
asking me to do an expectation, right?

6
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:13,700
>> Right.
because that's what we're trying to

7
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:14,815
estimate is an expectation.

8
00:00:14,815 --> 00:00:15,710
Uh-huh.
>> Right, and

9
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:18,500
the way you do that is
you just average things.

10
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,570
>> Yeah.
>> So I should just be able to do that.

11
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:24,724
So I can look at episode one and
I can see what the value for

12
00:00:24,724 --> 00:00:26,325
S1 turned out to be.

13
00:00:26,325 --> 00:00:28,658
And because you were so
nice and made gamma equal to 1,

14
00:00:28,658 --> 00:00:31,730
I can basically just add up
the numbers on the arrows, right?

15
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:33,680
>> Yeah.
>> So the value to S1 in episode

16
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,660
one is 2.

17
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:36,210
>> Good.

18
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:39,870
>> And
the value to S1 in episode 2 is 11.

19
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:40,370
>> Good.

20
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:45,670
>> And
the value to S1 in episode 3 is 2 again.

21
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:47,970
>> Good.
>> All right.

22
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:50,820
So then if I wanted to know what
an appropriate estimate was after

23
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:52,900
3 episodes, I would just
average those three numbers.

24
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:56,050
I would get 5.

25
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:57,290
>> Is that right?

26
00:00:57,290 --> 00:01:00,430
>> Yeah, so 15 over 3 which is 5.

27
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:02,087
>> Nice.

28
00:01:02,087 --> 00:01:10,130
Okay, so then for 4 I see 2 again and
so that would be 17 over 4.

29
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:10,700
>> Good.

30
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:11,435
>> Which is a number.

31
00:01:11,435 --> 00:01:15,109
[LAUGH] 4.25.

32
00:01:15,109 --> 00:01:15,750
>> Good.

33
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:18,710
Yeah, that's what I was looking for,
nicely done.

34
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:22,020
>> Oh, so in fact I could do this for
one episode, or two episodes.

35
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:24,530
>> That's right, in fact what we're
going to work up to next is how we can

36
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:27,920
incrementally compute an estimate for

37
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,440
the value of a state,
given the previous estimate.

38
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,790
Given after 3 episodes, how do we get 4.

39
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:35,160
And 4 how do we get 5?

40
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,250
And 5 how do we get 6?

41
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:39,783
And then 10,000 how do we get 10,001?

42
00:01:39,783 --> 00:01:41,433
>> Well, can I ask you a question?

43
00:01:41,433 --> 00:01:44,190
>> Sure.

44
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:46,440
>> I'm curious how close we came.

45
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:49,890
You go from episode 3 to episode
4 you went from 5 to 4.25.

46
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:52,290
That's kind of a big jump.

47
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:56,200
So, do your remember from the last quiz,
what the last value of S1 was?

48
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,680
I think it was 2.

49
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,228
something.

50
00:01:58,228 --> 00:02:00,326
>> 2.9, that's right.

51
00:02:00,326 --> 00:02:01,890
>> Oh, it was 2.9.

52
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:04,780
>> Yeah, so in principle,
with an infinite amount of data,

53
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:05,770
that's what we should get.

54
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:07,600
We should get 2.9 as our estimate for
S1.

55
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,840
In this particular case,
we're actually a little bit high.

56
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,820
Why do you suppose we're
a little bit high?

57
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:14,910
>> Because we just haven't seen
enough data yet, we saw 11 once.

58
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:17,950
And, so it looks like for 3 episodes,

59
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:23,220
11 happens a third of the time
instead of a tenth of the time.

60
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:24,000
>> That's right.
Yeah, so

61
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,920
we have kind of an over-representation
of the higher reward.

62
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,050
So our estimate ends
up being skewed high.

63
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:32,460
>> Okay, that makes sense.

64
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:34,000
In the limit it should
all start to work out and

65
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,520
we'll get one-tenth plus elevens.

66
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,110
But in this case we got, I don't know.

67
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:37,940
Let's call it lucky.

68
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:41,290
We got a higher reward than
the expectation would predict.

69
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:42,180
>> Hm.

70
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:42,680
Okay.
