00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Now for the answer--if I undo the failure-inducing change as returned by delta debugging,

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
can I actually build the program.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Yes, I can because this actually tested by delta debugging that the alternative

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
makes the program passed, so the program should build normally

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
and also the failure should no longer occur.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Whether the problem is properly fixed though is another thing.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I may have fixed the failure in question, but by undoing these changes,

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I may have introduced new bugs.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
In particular, these changes appear they're probably made with some specific feature in mind

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
and the very least that will happen is that I'll lose the new feature that would be introduced

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
by these changes, so I can't really say that the problem is properly fixed.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I need to come up with a change that includes the new features or at least the effect

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
or at least the intended effect of these original changes,

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
but avoids the bad effect mainly the failure--so this is the final answer..
