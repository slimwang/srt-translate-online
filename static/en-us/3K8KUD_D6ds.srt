00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:21,710
in. >> That's good David, and to builder's example, what do we actually do,

2
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:25,610
when we have to? Plan a navigation route to go from one location,

3
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:30,390
to another location, in an urban area. We use knowledge of the goal.

4
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:34,400
The goal tells us, what turn to take at every intersection? We want to take

5
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,670
a turn, that helps us get closer to the goal. So one thing we are learning here,

6
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:42,170
is there are different kinds of knowledge. There is knowledge about the world,

7
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:46,090
the intersections and the turns, the states and the operators more generally.

8
00:01:47,428 --> 00:01:52,230
There's also asset knowledge about how to do the operator selection, how to

9
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:56,740
select between greatest terms at any intersection? This knowledge is tacit, and

10
00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:01,010
is sometimes called control knowledge. Goals provide us with the control

11
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:05,487
knowledge, of deciding how to select between different operators. Let us

12
00:02:05,487 --> 00:02:10,485
recall how means-end analysis work. How goals poetic control knowledge, and

13
00:02:10,485 --> 00:02:14,160
means-end analysis heuristic method, if you would compare the Current State and

14
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,330
the Goal State and enumerate the differences between them.

15
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:19,910
Then we'll select the operator that will help us reduce,

16
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:23,350
the largest difference within the Current State and the Goal State. That's one,

17
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:28,540
way of using goals as control knowledge to select between operators. Planning,

18
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:32,200
provides more system mathematics matters for selecting between different

19
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:36,870
operators. So the real problem now becomes, how to do operator selection,

20
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:41,040
which is the same problem as, how to do action selection. Recall with me,

21
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,350
we're talking about intelligent agents. We define intelligent agents,

22
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:48,800
as agents that map perceptual history into actions.

23
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,250
Action selection was a key problem, was a central problem. This is

24
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:56,880
where planning is central, because it deals starkly with action selection, or

25
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:01,070
with operator selection. Operators simply mental representations of actions,

26
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:05,870
that we live with in the world. So, let us look at what a plan might look like,

27
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:07,500
in the language we have been developing for

28
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:11,750
planning. A plan might look like this, here is the Initial State, and

29
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:17,970
a set of successor states. A series of states, punctuated by an operators

30
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:22,420
that transform one state into another. Here we have expanded this operative,

31
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:27,570
paint ceiling, to specify its peak conditions and post conditions, and there's

32
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:31,940
several things not worthy here. Note that the preconditions of this operator,

33
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:37,470
exactly match the predecessor's state. So, we have on robot ladder, here,

34
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:41,730
and we have on robot ladder, here. So, some assertions of the world are true,

35
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:44,370
here. And those assertions match the precondition,

36
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:48,720
which is why this operator is applicable. Similarly, the post conditions of this

37
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:53,870
operator, directly match the assertions about the world in this successor state.

38
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:56,470
So I have painted ceiling here, there is painted ceiling there.

39
00:03:56,470 --> 00:04:00,540
There is not dry ceiling here, there is not dry ceiling here.

40
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:04,510
So this provides a very precise way, of specifying the states, and

41
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:07,190
the operators, and t he exact connections between them.
