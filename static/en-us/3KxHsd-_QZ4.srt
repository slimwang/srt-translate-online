Let's see if we can use our concept of working together to solve this problem.

00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:08,039
Vanessa and Tim want to repaint a room. Tim's painted the room alone before,

3
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:12,020
and done it in 4 hours. While Vanessa's painted the room alone, and done it in

4
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:15,334
3 hours. If they're working together, how long would it take them to paint the

5
00:00:15,334 --> 00:00:19,992
room? Try setting up an equation, and then solve and write your final answer

00:00:19,992 --> 00:00:20,920
here.
