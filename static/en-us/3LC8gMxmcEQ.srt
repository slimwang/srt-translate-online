1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,414
Well, to get the first term in both of our answers, we just squared the first

2
00:00:04,414 --> 00:00:08,719
term, x times x is x squared, and 3x times 3x is 9x squared. So again we're

3
00:00:08,719 --> 00:00:13,158
going to start off with a, a squared. We square the first term. This middle term

4
00:00:13,158 --> 00:00:18,162
is just like from before except instead of being positive they're negative. So I

5
00:00:18,162 --> 00:00:23,972
take the first term, multiply it by the second term, and then multiply it by 2.

6
00:00:23,972 --> 00:00:29,723
X times negative 4 is negative 4x times 2 is negative 8x. 3x times negative 1 is

7
00:00:29,723 --> 00:00:35,551
negative 3x times 2 is negative 6x. So, we take the first term,a, multiply it by

8
00:00:35,551 --> 00:00:41,380
the second term, negative b, and then multiply it by 2, and we get negative 2ab.

9
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:46,896
This last part is simply this last term squared. Negative 4 times negative 4 is

10
00:00:46,896 --> 00:00:52,300
positive 16. Negative 1 times negative 1 is positive 1. So we know negative b

11
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:56,640
times negative b is positive b squared. There's our pattern.
