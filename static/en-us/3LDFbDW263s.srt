1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,490
As you just saw on the quiz, there's three kinds of view we can take with regard to running time.

2
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:12,220
We can take a best-case view and assume that all the inputs that we're getting are the ones that

3
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:16,930
make our algorithms run the fastest or we can take the very opposite view

4
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:23,460
and say that the running time of our algorithm is going to be determined by the worst possible input

5
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:29,980
that it can receive or we can define running time as the average time that our algorithm will take

6
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:32,040
over a number of inputs.

7
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,660
Which one of the three are we going to choose in this course?

8
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:42,090
Best-case running time as you've seen in the previous quiz is often rather trivial or meaningless.

9
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:48,700
So for example, if we use best-case running time for our algorithm that counts the number of As,

10
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:53,370
it would only be valid for strings that contain no A at all so we're not going to take this.

11
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:58,870
For the average-case view, actually that could be a very interesting view and practice

12
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:03,810
because when we run the algorithm a couple of times we might not care about

13
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:07,860
how much that algorithm runs on a single run but over many inputs.

14
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:13,000
But as you've just seen in the quiz, it's actually quite hard to define what an average input looks like.

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,220
And also when we do the analysis of an algorithm

16
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:20,460
sometimes we might not even know what kinds of input the algorithm receives.

17
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:24,540
Average-case analysis is very interesting sometimes.

18
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:29,870
But here, it's actually not that suitable. Now, worst-case analysis.

19
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:33,640
Well we always assume that the algorithm receives an input that

20
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:38,450
makes it run as long as possible might seem a bit pessimistic to you.

21
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:44,520
It's almost like we had a mean adversary who was trying to give us the worst possible inputs.

22
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:51,000
But on the other hand, the advantage of worst-case analysis is that it offers guarantees.

23
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,690
What I mean by that is when we take a worst-case view we know that our algorithm

24
00:01:55,690 --> 00:02:00,640
will not run longer than the worst-case analysis suggests no matter what happens.

25
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:06,860
And this is actually what we're interested in in this course so we are going to use worst-case analysis.

26
00:02:06,860 --> 99:59:59,999
Meaning, we're always going to state the time of our algorithm for the worst possible input.
