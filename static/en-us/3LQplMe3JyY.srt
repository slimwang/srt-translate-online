1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,469
We want you to understand that you may
have to outsource your development

2
00:00:03,469 --> 00:00:04,560
to a developer.

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:05,200
As part of that,

4
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:09,000
you should have a solid understanding
of what it takes to build an app.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,800
Having a good foundation will
allow you to make sound business

6
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:13,630
decisions over time.

7
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:16,870
You may also have big ideas for
what you want your app to accomplish, so

8
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:19,780
we want you to understand what
comes standard in a platform

9
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:22,150
versus what would need
to be custom built.

10
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:24,970
The latter will take a lot
more work to implement.

11
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:26,870
We should probably go
over some vocabulary.

12
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:29,890
Our next two text nodes will
cover some basic vocabulary

13
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:32,189
you should be familiar with
before you talk with an engineer.
