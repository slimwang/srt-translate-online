1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:02,340
Here's how to get the solution.

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:06,939
In any iteration of the for loop
the only data communicated is B hat.

3
00:00:06,939 --> 00:00:10,620
It's size is n over p
words by n columns.

4
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:15,150
So that's n squared
over p words in total.

5
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:19,250
Now there are p rounds of communication
because of the loop bound.

6
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:23,120
Therefore, you have to pay for
p sends each of sides n squared over p.

7
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:27,000
So that would be a total
communication time of alpha times p

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,910
times beta times n squared.
