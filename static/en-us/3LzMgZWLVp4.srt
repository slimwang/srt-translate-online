00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,380
What is everyone think? Is 2 the right answer here? Well,

2
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:09,080
lets look at the choices. First note, that both 2 and 4 are legitimate answers.

3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:14,640
2 is legitimate because we can think of the transformation from

4
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:19,130
A to B as a reflection around the vertical axis. And so

5
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:23,090
if we think of the transformation from C to D, again as a reflection of

6
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:27,390
the vertical axis, we'll get 2. 4 is also a correct answer, because we

7
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:32,430
can think of the transformation from A to B as a rotation of 180 degrees, and

8
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:36,480
if we rotate C by 180 degrees we'll get 4. However, if we look at our

9
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,120
weights again, we gave reflection a higher weight than we gave rotation. And

10
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,970
therefore, David is right, 2 indeed is the correct answer.
