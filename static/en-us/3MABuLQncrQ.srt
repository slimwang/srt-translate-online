1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,339
At this point you
should have two things.

2
00:00:02,339 --> 00:00:05,790
The first is the Droid Terms Example
app, downloaded onto your phone.

3
00:00:07,089 --> 00:00:09,660
You're not downloading the code,
just the APK.

4
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:14,259
This app, which you did not create, will
just by downloading it onto your phone,

5
00:00:14,259 --> 00:00:16,670
store all of this data onto the phone.

6
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:20,550
The second thing that you have is
code with which to create quiz app.

7
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:23,769
And right now that
code has a probation to

8
00:00:23,769 --> 00:00:27,570
access the content provider
connected to Droid Terms Example.

9
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:30,876
And this is where it gives you the
ability to access Droid Terms Examples

10
00:00:30,876 --> 00:00:32,350
app data.

11
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:35,628
Okay, so there are five steps to adding
content providers access to the app.

12
00:00:35,628 --> 00:00:37,619
Like you've done the first one.

13
00:00:37,619 --> 00:00:41,250
The next three steps are shown
here in these two lines of code.

14
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:45,719
This code accesses the correct content
provider and grabs some data from it.

15
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:48,259
We've got some new concepts
of vocabulary here, so

16
00:00:48,259 --> 00:00:49,789
I'm going to break it down.

17
00:00:49,789 --> 00:00:52,789
The first new concept
is the ContentResolver.

18
00:00:52,789 --> 00:00:56,155
So our original diagram
is fairly simplistic.

19
00:00:56,155 --> 00:00:58,295
Let's look at this drawing
that we saw before.

20
00:00:58,295 --> 00:01:01,565
The more accurate version
of this drawing is this.

21
00:01:01,564 --> 00:01:04,265
And this drawing involves
a content resolver.

22
00:01:04,265 --> 00:01:07,034
So what's the purpose of having
this class sit between your app and

23
00:01:07,034 --> 00:01:09,304
direct access to the content provider?

24
00:01:09,305 --> 00:01:11,975
If you think about it, there
are multiple content providers on your

25
00:01:11,974 --> 00:01:14,814
phone, and
you add more content providers

26
00:01:14,814 --> 00:01:17,948
when you download apps that store local
data, which use content providers.

27
00:01:19,069 --> 00:01:22,069
Besides the DroidTermsExample
content provider, you have a content

28
00:01:22,069 --> 00:01:26,369
provider for contacts, your device
has one for user files of the device,

29
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:30,890
one that keeps track of user alarms,
the calendar provider, and some others.

30
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:34,320
Also, your app is not the only
app running on the device.

31
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:38,009
There are other apps that might also
be using content providers in parallel.

32
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:40,820
Managing what content providers
are talking to what apps, and

33
00:01:40,819 --> 00:01:44,759
keeping all the data in sync,
could turn into a huge traffic jam.

34
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,850
That's where the content
resolver comes in.

35
00:01:46,849 --> 00:01:50,259
The content resolver acts as
an intermediary between each app and

36
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:53,270
the content provider, or
providers, it wants to access.

37
00:01:53,269 --> 00:01:56,629
It handles inter-process communication
and keeps everything in sync and

38
00:01:56,629 --> 00:01:57,879
running smoothly.

39
00:01:57,879 --> 00:02:01,619
Even if you have five processes
accessing two content providers.

40
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:03,780
So wherever you want to
use a Content Provider,

41
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:06,340
you'll need to do it
through a ContentResolver.

42
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:08,599
Okay, so now you know what
this first line is doing,

43
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:11,310
getting us a reference to
the system's Content Resolver.

44
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:13,370
This is the next step for
accessing the Content Provider.
