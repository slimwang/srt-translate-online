00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,097
Zero is not a natural number. For example,
when we think back to the kindergarten

2
00:00:05,109 --> 00:00:09,948
teacher example, she does not start
counting her children starting with zero.

3
00:00:10,058 --> 00:00:15,420
She begins with one. You can think of the
natural numbers as counting numbers, and

4
00:00:15,432 --> 00:00:21,503
when we count, we usually begin with the
number one not zero. But zero does have

5
00:00:21,503 --> 00:00:25,199
some things in common with the natural
numbers. We can talk about there being

6
00:00:25,211 --> 00:00:30,827
zero of some kind of object like cupcakes.
When considered as a single group, zero

7
00:00:30,827 --> 00:00:35,818
and the natural numbers make up what we
call the whole numbers. So let's go over

8
00:00:35,818 --> 00:00:40,898
the two groups we have so far. First, we
talked about the natural numbers or the

9
00:00:40,898 --> 00:00:48,137
counting numbers, which are one, two,
three, and so on, all the way up to

10
00:00:48,137 --> 00:00:59,646
infinity. So this includes a ton of other
numbers, too, like 89, 560, and 9,345,760

11
00:00:59,646 --> 00:01:04,959
as well as every other number that we
could count from one up to infinity. The

12
00:01:04,974 --> 00:01:09,973
whole numbers include all of these numbers
but also zero. So you can see that our

13
00:01:09,973 --> 00:01:14,735
sets of numbers are starting to build on
each other. Which of the following

14
00:01:14,735 --> 00:01:18,868
sentences accurately describe the
relationship between the natural and the

15
00:01:18,868 --> 00:01:23,030
whole numbers? Please select as many as
you think are correct.
