00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,951
>> Factoring this just gives us x plus 6 times x plus 2 equals 0. We know that

2
00:00:04,951 --> 00:00:10,075
we'll make this equation true if either x plus 6 is equal to 0 or if x plus 2 is

3
00:00:10,075 --> 00:00:15,002
equal to 0. So we can solve for x in both of those cases. So x can either be

4
00:00:15,002 --> 00:00:17,356
negative 6 or it can be negative 2.
