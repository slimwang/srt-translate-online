1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,029
Run your app on local host and

2
00:00:02,029 --> 00:00:05,230
then use the API's explorer
to create a conference.

3
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:08,530
And then go to the Admin console to
check that the conference was created

4
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:09,710
as expected.

5
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:13,190
You can also use the create conference
page in the app to create and

6
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:14,350
save a conference.

7
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:17,010
The conference will be created
because the conference page sends

8
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:20,120
a call to the Save Conference function
which you've now implemented.

9
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,290
But the Show Conferences
page will not yet

10
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:25,305
work because you have not yet
implemented the function that it calls,

11
00:00:25,305 --> 00:00:28,310
the functions to query
an output conference records.

12
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:31,700
So no matter whether you create your
conference in the API's explorer or

13
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:34,800
in the Create Conference page, you'll
need to use the data store viewer and

14
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,140
the Admin console to check that
the conference got created.
