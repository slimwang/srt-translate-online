1
00:00:00,271 --> 00:00:02,752
So the two questions we’re going to talk about now

2
00:00:02,752 --> 00:00:06,666
are what are my revenue streams? And next, within

3
00:00:06,666 --> 00:00:10,751
the revenue streams, how do I price the product.

4
00:00:10,751 --> 00:00:12,667
So let’s take a look, what exactly is a revenue

5
00:00:12,667 --> 00:00:17,065
stream. A revenue stream is the strategy the

6
00:00:17,065 --> 00:00:21,215
company uses to generate cash from each

7
00:00:21,215 --> 00:00:23,808
customer segment. So if you have multiple

8
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:26,608
customer segments, you may have multiple

9
00:00:26,608 --> 00:00:29,494
revenue streams. We’ll go into this in some

10
00:00:29,494 --> 00:00:33,258
detail. But let’s define pricing. Pricing are

11
00:00:33,258 --> 00:00:37,391
the tactics you use to set the price. How

12
00:00:37,391 --> 00:00:39,944
many dollars or pounds or is it free in

13
00:00:39,944 --> 00:00:42,609
each of these customer segments.

14
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:44,427
So now let’s go back and look at the revenue

15
00:00:44,427 --> 00:00:47,460
stream in some detail. First couple of questions

16
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:50,391
you need to answer is number one what

17
00:00:50,391 --> 00:00:54,275
value are customers willing to pay for. How

18
00:00:54,275 --> 00:00:56,939
do you know this? Well on day one you’re

19
00:00:56,939 --> 00:00:58,872
just sitting in your building or in you

20
00:00:58,872 --> 00:01:01,463
class room or in your lab, and you are guessing.

21
00:01:01,463 --> 00:01:03,109
You’re going, hey these are my customers,

22
00:01:03,109 --> 00:01:05,642
guess. You know, these are the features they

23
00:01:05,642 --> 00:01:08,391
care about. Guess. This the value they’re going

24
00:01:08,391 --> 00:01:11,576
to pay for. Guess. But by now you’ve been in

25
00:01:11,576 --> 00:01:13,824
front of a ton of customers. You’ve talked

26
00:01:13,824 --> 00:01:18,280
to them just extensively, and you understand

27
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:20,863
what it is they value. And that’s what we’re

28
00:01:20,863 --> 00:01:22,818
going to use to figure out what the revenue

29
00:01:22,818 --> 00:01:25,147
streams and pricing are. The next thing that

30
00:01:25,147 --> 00:01:27,846
you actually found out outside the building

31
00:01:27,846 --> 00:01:32,499
was how do customers pay for products today.

32
00:01:32,499 --> 00:01:36,378
Also you want to understand how much are

33
00:01:36,378 --> 00:01:39,330
they paying. So, how do they pay and how

34
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:43,462
much do they pay. So, well, for big picture,

35
00:01:43,462 --> 00:01:46,533
let’s go take a look at the revenue stream

36
00:01:46,533 --> 00:01:49,042
choices at the highest possible level.
