00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
And the answer using our product rule is

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
heads, heads comes out to 0.6 * 0.6, which is 0.36.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Heads followed by tails is 0.6 * 0.4, which is 0.24.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Tails followed by heads is, again, 0.24.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 99:59:59,999
