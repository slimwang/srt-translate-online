1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
One weakness of the encrypted key exchange is that passwords have to be stored.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
One possible improvement would be to encrypt using a hash of the password

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
instead of the password itself.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
In the first step, the client sends some identifying information

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
along with the first part of the key exchange, but this time it's encrypted with the hash of p.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Likewise, in the second step, the server response is encrypted

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
with the hash of p instead of p.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
We want to know does this work?

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
The options are, yes, it provides further protection against a dictionary attack.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Yes, but it doesn't provide much advantage since now an attacker who learns

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
the hash of p doesn't need to learn p.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
No, it prevents the client and server from establishing a shared key,

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
since the server can't invert the hash.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Or, no, it has a serious security vulnerability.
