1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:01,550
Let's assume that we have a single

2
00:00:01,550 --> 00:00:04,630
autonomous system with static link weights as shown.

3
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:07,190
In such a setup, routers will flood

4
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:10,710
information to one another to learn the network

5
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:14,560
topology, including the link weights on, links

6
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:18,730
connecting individual routers. An operator can affect how

7
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:21,950
traffic flows through the network. By configuring the

8
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:25,900
link weights. By changing the link weight configuration,

9
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:28,970
an operator can affect the shortest path between

10
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:32,290
two points in this graph. Thus, affecting the

11
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:35,280
way that traffic flows. In the link weight

12
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,560
settings shown here, traffic would flow along the green

13
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:42,660
path. Suppose that the operator would like to

14
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:46,080
shift traffic off of a congested link in the

15
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,580
middle of the network. Such as this one.

16
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:51,870
By changing the link weight from one to three.

17
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:54,407
The shortest path between this node and this node,

18
00:00:54,407 --> 00:00:56,970
now takes an alternate route. So we can see

19
00:00:56,970 --> 00:01:00,530
from this simple example, That, by adjusting the link

20
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:05,160
weights in a intra-domain topology, the operator can affect

21
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:09,500
how traffic flows between different points in the network,

22
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:12,280
thus affecting the load on the network links. In

23
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,600
practice, network operators set these link weights in a

24
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:17,150
variety of ways. One could set the link weights

25
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:21,760
inversely proportional to capacity. Proportional to propagation delay, or the

26
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:25,920
operator might perform some network wide optimization, based on traffic.
