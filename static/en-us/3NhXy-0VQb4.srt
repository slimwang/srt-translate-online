00:00:00,006 --> 00:00:04,559
Okay, that makes sense. When we see a vowel, that means it's the start of a new

2
00:00:04,559 --> 00:00:09,292
vowel group, which would mark that we have another syllable. Any time we see a

3
00:00:09,292 --> 00:00:14,420
vowel that doesn't have another vowel before it, we want to increment count.

4
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:18,704
Now I want you to keep stepping until letter is o, and deposit this line where

5
00:00:18,704 --> 00:00:24,990
we set letter to text.substring. If you keep stepping after that line, what

6
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:29,520
happens? Is the first if statement entered? If so, is the second if statement

7
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:34,580
entered, is count incremented, is inside vowel group set to true?
