1
00:00:00,318 --> 00:00:04,890
Assuring privacy, and security and
trust is a necessity for digital patient

2
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:09,040
records and sharing these records
over a health information exchange.

3
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:12,560
As a result, it's an ONC Standards and

4
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:16,230
Interoperability Framework
workgroup priority area.

5
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:20,040
Weâ€™ll be looking at many S&I
workgroups as we proceed.

6
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:23,370
So it's a good idea to first
look at how they operate.

7
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:27,962
The process is intended to be grounded
in real-world issues, called use cases,

8
00:00:27,962 --> 00:00:31,302
that are first identified
through an Environmental Scan.

9
00:00:31,302 --> 00:00:35,582
And then molded into a consensus
document which drives

10
00:00:35,582 --> 00:00:38,118
the development of standards.

11
00:00:38,118 --> 00:00:42,480
Here's the workflow that surrounds the
use case of a provider ordering a lab

12
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,410
test, and the return of preliminary,
final, and

13
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:48,900
then corrected results back
to the ordering provider.
