Consider a block row
partitioning of a matrix for

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,930
a sparse matrix-vector multiply.

3
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:07,610
Recall your two computational goals.

4
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:09,990
The first is to achieve load balance,
and

5
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:12,230
the second is to reduce communication.

6
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:13,820
So this is where we started,

7
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:16,320
then I introduced the graph
partitioning problem.

8
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,610
For this problem I said you want to
divide up the vertices into partitions

9
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:22,300
so that the partitions
are approximately balanced.

10
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:24,940
I also said you want to
minimize the edge cuts.

11
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:26,560
Here's my question.

12
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,510
Is the graph partitioning
problem as I formalized it,

13
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:33,570
the same thing as the goals for
a sparse matrix vector multiply?

14
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:34,870
Choose your answer, yes or no.

15
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:37,450
And then explain yourself in this box.
