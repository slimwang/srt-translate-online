00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Big Θ is just one of a bunch of different functions that we can define,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
and there's a set that essentially corresponds to all the different ways you might

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
want to compare a function.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
If f(n) is in little o(g(n)), that's kind of like saying f(n) is strictly less than g(n).

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
It grows less slowly asymptotically.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:24,000
F(n) is in O(g(n))--there's our friend O--that's really like saying f(n) ≤ g(n).

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
It might grow as fast as g(n), but it might be small.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Θ is the one we just looked at, which kind of like equality--they grow roughly at the same rate.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Ω--f(n) is in Ω(g(n)) means that it is an upper bound.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
F(n) is bigger than or equal to g(n).

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
G(n) is a lower bound on f(n).

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
The ω, analogously, is kind of like strictly greater than.
