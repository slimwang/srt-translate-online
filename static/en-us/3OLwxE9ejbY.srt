00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:03,430
How many modes do you think the minimax
algorithm will need to visit

2
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:04,800
in the game tree?

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:08,140
Here's some choices where b is
the average branching factor and

4
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:09,650
d is the average depth.

5
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:16,519
So we have b times d, d to the power of
b, d squared, and b to the power of d.

6
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:19,019
Pick what you think is the best answer.
