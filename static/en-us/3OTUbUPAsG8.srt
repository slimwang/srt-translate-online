00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:06,374
Here, the solution is 7 6ths, or 1 and 1 6th. Nice thinking if you found this

2
00:00:06,374 --> 00:00:11,260
fraction. Basically, we're just going to evaluate our inverse function at x

3
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:18,620
equals 2. So we just plug in the value of 2, and for x. So 2 plus 5 equals 7.

4
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:25,284
And I still have 6 for my denominator. So 7 6ths or 1 and 1 6th. Now, there was

5
00:00:25,284 --> 00:00:30,295
another way to solve this problem. If we remember that the x and y coordinates

6
00:00:30,295 --> 00:00:36,216
switch for the inverse function, then we can make the y coordinate be 2. In

7
00:00:36,216 --> 00:00:41,419
other words, we know the input for the inverse function would be 2. This means

8
00:00:41,419 --> 00:00:46,743
that it must be a y value for the original function. So, we could take our

9
00:00:46,743 --> 00:00:53,380
original function and let this output or this y value equal 2 and solve for x.

10
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:59,479
Letting this f of x equal 2, we can now solve for x. We'll have 6x equal to 7

11
00:00:59,479 --> 00:01:06,094
and then we'll divide both sides by positive 6 to get x equals 7 6ths. Since x

12
00:01:06,094 --> 00:01:10,190
is the input for the original function, we know this will be the output for our

13
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:16,300
inverse function. Remember that the x and y coordinates will always switch for

14
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:21,086
the function and it's inverse. Now, I know the second method is a lot longer

15
00:01:21,086 --> 00:01:24,626
for finding our answer, since all we really needed to do was plug in 2 into

16
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:30,321
here. But it's worth conceptually noting, so that way we can understand that

17
00:01:30,321 --> 00:01:35,440
the inverse and its function always have the x and y coordinates switched.
