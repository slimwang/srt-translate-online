1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,250
And there are two correct answers here.

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:08,530
So the first one is if we were able to show that P=NP, well then, each single class here

3
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:12,530
would lie in P because these are all problems that lie in NP as we said.

4
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:15,619
So, all of these classes here would become P,

5
00:00:15,619 --> 00:00:18,860
which means that if we were indeed able to show that P=NP,

6
00:00:18,860 --> 99:59:59,999
then this whole picture here could just be written like this.
