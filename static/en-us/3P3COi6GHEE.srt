00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:03,680
For me, one really neat thing about
the bitonic sorting algorithm is that it

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:05,560
has this nice visual representation,

3
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:08,740
which connects it to the dynamic
multithreading model.

4
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:11,920
You've also seen that it has
a fixed regular parallel structure.

5
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:16,350
So, you could imagine a very
natural implementation using, for

6
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:19,380
instance, the old programmable
data rays or fpgas.

7
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:23,370
Now the regular structure also
means that it will map well to

8
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:25,680
fixed data parallel hardware.

9
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,910
So this includes stuff like sim-D or

10
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:31,560
vector processing systems as well
as graphics coprocessors or GPUs.

11
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:35,960
The downside is that
it is not work optimal

12
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:39,930
even when restricted to the class
of comparison based algorithms.

13
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:42,700
So in practice, you'll have to make
an engineering tradeoff based on

14
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:44,910
the platform and
the scale that you're interested in.

15
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:49,630
The best way to try and understand this
tradeoff is to try implementing these

16
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:53,045
and competing algorithms on real
systems and see what happens.

17
00:00:53,045 --> 00:00:56,580
So until we meet again friends, Cheers.

18
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:59,759
Delicious.

19
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:03,648
[LAUGH]
Mm.

20
00:01:03,648 --> 00:01:04,352
Mm.

21
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:08,660
All right, I can totally do this.

22
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,252
I can totally do this.

23
00:01:11,252 --> 00:01:11,974
Shh.

24
00:01:11,974 --> 00:01:16,066
Ssh, don't be so loud.

25
00:01:16,066 --> 00:01:17,882
[SOUND] Ha!

26
00:01:17,882 --> 00:01:21,210
See, I told you.

27
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:22,240
You.

28
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,180
Am I offscreen?

29
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:23,940
Am I even onscreen?

30
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:25,630
I don't know.
It's like butter.

31
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:29,170
Like butter in a glass.

32
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:31,800
It's like you I love you
