00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:03,090
There's another piece to URLs I'd like to show you. And this is

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:05,650
the, this is the final piece I'll talk about right now, and that's

3
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:08,990
called the port. When you make a web request to a server, this

4
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:11,730
is the host, this is the, the name of the machine or, or

5
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:14,990
the location of the machine you're requesting. In order to make an internet

6
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:17,890
connection you need two things. You need one, the address of the machine,

7
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:21,780
which is represented by the host And two, you also need a port.

8
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:26,040
And by default the port equals 80. If you want to use a different port

9
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:29,710
you can include it in the URL between the

10
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:33,150
host and the path separated by a colon. And in

11
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:35,545
this case we'll be making our request on port

12
00:00:35,545 --> 00:00:39,440
8,000. Get used to this URL because this will be

13
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,580
your local development URL for a lot of this

14
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:44,790
course, and actually for a lot of your career as

15
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:48,280
a web developer. You're constantly accessing your local machine and

16
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:51,460
you're probably doing it on something other than port 80.

17
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:55,660
There are even more parts to a URL, but they're not particularly relevant to

18
00:00:55,660 --> 00:01:00,250
us right now, they'll come up, you know, as we go. Let's do one

19
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:04,390
final quiz about URL's before we move on. What I'd like you to do

20
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:06,810
is take this URL and identify its

21
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:10,100
main parts host, protocol, fragment, query, and port.
