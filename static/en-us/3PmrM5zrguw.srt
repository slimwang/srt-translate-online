1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,904
So like I said, when you do this, you end up with this gradient function.

2
00:00:03,904 --> 00:00:07,475
And of course, we do this both in the x direction and the y direction.

3
00:00:07,475 --> 00:00:11,412
And, you know, we now have this problem of correlation versus convolution.

4
00:00:11,412 --> 00:00:15,475
Well, if this is the x direction, if x goes positive this way,

5
00:00:15,475 --> 00:00:17,485
this is a correlation filter.

6
00:00:17,485 --> 00:00:23,290
By the way, this picture is what this looks like as an image.

7
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:24,091
Okay?

8
00:00:24,091 --> 00:00:28,023
So these zero values on the outside, that's these gray, and

9
00:00:28,023 --> 00:00:32,800
where it goes negative is negative and where it goes positive is positive.

10
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,371
In the y direction, which way is positive is always a problem because,

11
00:00:36,371 --> 00:00:38,406
like we said, y can go up or y can go down.

12
00:00:38,406 --> 00:00:41,575
You know, the main issue of course, is that it, it, it goes vertically.

13
00:00:41,575 --> 00:00:43,878
So those are our two operators.

14
00:00:43,878 --> 00:00:47,548
So that's how you would use a Gaussian in order to get some smooth derivatives.

15
00:00:47,548 --> 00:00:50,985
But there is this question of how big a Gaussian should we use?

16
00:00:50,985 --> 00:00:55,225
You might remember from filtering that we could pick different size Gaussians,

17
00:00:55,225 --> 00:00:58,859
and here again is the fspecial being used, to get different sigmas.

18
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:03,964
And what happens is, you get more or less smooth versions of the image.

19
00:01:03,964 --> 00:01:07,835
The same is true when we compute derivatives, right?

20
00:01:07,835 --> 00:01:10,738
We can change the sigma, the size of the Gaussian.

21
00:01:10,738 --> 00:01:15,906
And when you do that, you'll get sort of enhancing the, the magnitudes of these

22
00:01:15,906 --> 00:01:20,848
derivatives as a function of sort of how quickly the image varies over space.

23
00:01:20,848 --> 00:01:21,482
All right?

24
00:01:21,482 --> 00:01:23,164
So with a small sigma,

25
00:01:23,164 --> 00:01:27,688
all of this fine texture in here shows up everywhere in here.

26
00:01:27,688 --> 00:01:31,325
In fact, even this little texture in here shows up in there.

27
00:01:31,325 --> 00:01:34,395
But if I use a bigger sigma, okay?

28
00:01:34,395 --> 00:01:38,245
So this area here you see there's a whole lot less going on there,

29
00:01:38,245 --> 00:01:41,535
because we smoothed away most of that small variation.

30
00:01:41,535 --> 00:01:45,800
So one way of thinking about this, smaller values, finer features are going to

31
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:50,270
be detected and larger values, only the larger scale edges will be detected.
