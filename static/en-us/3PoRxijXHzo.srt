1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,280
With five columns right off the bat,

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:05,090
we know that we can't do four columns evenly.

3
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:06,010
So this can't be right.

4
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:10,750
With eight columns, it's impossible to have three evenly spaced columns.

5
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:12,830
So we know that eight columns isn't right.

6
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:17,810
With 12 columns, we know that 2, 3, and 4 all divide into 12 evenly.

7
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:21,063
Meaning that we can have two even columns, three even columns or

8
00:00:21,063 --> 00:00:23,380
four even columns on the screen.

9
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:24,940
So this seems like a pretty good answer.

10
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:26,350
But let's think about 20.

11
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:30,190
With 20 columns, 3 doesn't divide into 20 evenly.

12
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:33,710
So we know that we can't do three even columns on the screen.

13
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:36,870
Also, you'll notice that people need to be able to read things.

14
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:41,000
And if a column is one 20th of the screen, it's going to be pretty tiny and

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,380
that's going to be hard to see.

16
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:44,940
So, I can't imagine us ever needing a column that small.

17
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:47,120
This means that the correct answer is 12 columns.

18
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,720
And in fact, most of the grid systems,

19
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:53,310
if not all of the grids systems that you'll see today use 12 columns.
