1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,290
We need to square both sides, doing, that's going to get rid of our exponent of

2
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:08,787
1 half on the left-hand side. And, of course, squaring a number is just going to

3
00:00:08,787 --> 00:00:11,703
give us another number. So this is the best choice.
