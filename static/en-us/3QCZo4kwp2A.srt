00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Here is my answer. It would start by yielding 0.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Then for i in all the positive integers yield first +i and then -i.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
If you didn't want to use ints here, you could do an alternative solution that looks like this.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 99:59:59,999
While True means it's an infinite loop, and I'm yielding +i and -i and then incrementing.
