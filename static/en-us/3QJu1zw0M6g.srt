1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:04,090
So how might we think about creating
some channels that make it easier to

2
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:05,540
separate these things?

3
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:09,150
Well we already saw this from
our previous conversation.

4
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:14,650
Let's separate out the intensity
from the color, okay?

5
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:15,620
So the first thing we're going to do,

6
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:20,850
it we're going to define intensity Y as
some combination of R, G, and B, okay?

7
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:24,167
And so
that gives you this nice picture here.

8
00:00:24,167 --> 00:00:27,886
And those of you that are old enough
to remember black and white television,

9
00:00:27,886 --> 00:00:30,151
you start to be thinking,
oh, wait a minute,

10
00:00:30,151 --> 00:00:34,125
this is like an image that just reflects
the overall intensity of what's there.

11
00:00:34,125 --> 00:00:37,200
And that would be correct, all right?

12
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,320
And in fact, a luminance function,
which is what this called,

13
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,670
is just a linear weight of the red,
green and blue pixels.

14
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:46,590
Here are weights of red, green and blue.

15
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:51,160
And by combining them together,
I get a single value Y, for luminance.

16
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,490
Remember, Y stands for luminance for

17
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:54,890
reasons that are,
because it's the middle of X, Y, Z.

18
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:55,960
That's why.

19
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:00,490
All right, so
now I need the two other values, right?

20
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:04,519
I mean I could just keep the R,
G and then try to reconstruct them.

21
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:08,590
But instead what they do is they
compute a different color space.

22
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:11,450
Then this is called the YUV colorspace.

23
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:16,170
And here's a,
a computation that takes the B values,

24
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:21,600
the Y values, and
creates a new value called U and V.

25
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,170
And a way of thinking about this is
one of them has to do with sort of

26
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:26,400
the difference between
the luminance in blue.

27
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,350
And the other one is the difference
between luminance in red and

28
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:32,310
it matches and
it creates this thing called UV.

29
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:34,530
And the thing that you need,
that you need to know is that U and

30
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:36,750
V contain the color information.

31
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:40,393
So they tell you that they're
giving you an image in YUV space,

32
00:01:40,393 --> 00:01:44,958
you know that UV contain the,
the chromatic the color information.

33
00:01:44,958 --> 00:01:48,769
And by the way in this YUV mapping,
there's a maximum and

34
00:01:48,769 --> 00:01:51,167
minimum that U and V can get maxed to.

35
00:01:51,167 --> 00:01:54,270
And that's why it's called Umax and
Vmax.

36
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:57,280
And we assume the R,
G, B range from 0 to 1.

37
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,520
Okay, if it goes from zero to 255
you just scale the whole thing.

38
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:05,270
All right, when you create that you
can actually make three images, right?

39
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:08,310
You can make a Y image,
a U image and a V image and

40
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:10,840
that would look like this, all right?

41
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:14,350
So the Y image is ju, exactly what
you're used to seeing in your black and

42
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:15,580
white television.

43
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:20,390
But your U image and your V image,
those contain the color elements.

44
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,490
Now you might ask,
well why aren't they in color?

45
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:23,840
>> Why aren't they in color?

46
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,792
>> Because each one of them
is a single channel, okay?

47
00:02:26,792 --> 00:02:27,792
Right, so that's the U.

48
00:02:27,792 --> 00:02:31,920
So the brighter it is, the higher U,
the lower it is, the, the less U.

49
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:32,770
Same thing with V.
