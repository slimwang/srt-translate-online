00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,817
The previous problem brings up a useful little formula from topology called the

2
00:00:03,817 --> 00:00:08,116
Euler-PoincarĂŠ Formula for connected planar graphs. V is the number of

3
00:00:08,116 --> 00:00:12,647
vertices. F is the number of faces. E is the number of edges, and g is the

4
00:00:12,647 --> 00:00:17,763
genus. The genus is the number of holes in the object. As an example, a sphere

5
00:00:17,763 --> 00:00:21,231
and a cube have genus zero. A doughnut and a coffee cup with a handle have

6
00:00:21,231 --> 00:00:25,200
genus one. There's an old joke about topologists not being able to tell their

7
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,946
coffee cup from their donut. An edge collapse is a reversible process, so let's

8
00:00:28,946 --> 00:00:33,334
show how it affects the formula. First we know we're going to have a vertex

9
00:00:33,334 --> 00:00:37,157
created, so that's one. We can see that as the point moves up, two faces are

10
00:00:37,157 --> 00:00:42,575
created, so that's two faces. We can also see three edges are created. The

11
00:00:42,575 --> 00:00:46,048
genus doesn't change. There are no holes created or destroying. We can see this

12
00:00:46,048 --> 00:00:50,161
sums up to zero, the delta. In other words, this formula applies to this mesh

13
00:00:50,161 --> 00:00:53,272
and this mesh, and they both must come out to be the answer too, so the delta

14
00:00:53,272 --> 00:00:58,910
must be zero, the difference between them. So this equation says we subtracted

15
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:03,910
a vertex in two faces. To balance the equation, 3 edges must also be removed.
