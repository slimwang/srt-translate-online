1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:02,664
The answer is that the input should be a string

2
00:00:02,664 --> 00:00:05,414
giving the contents of the rest of the web page.

3
00:00:05,414 --> 00:00:07,457
That's how "get-next-target" works.

4
00:00:07,457 --> 00:00:10,725
It finds the first target from the current page.

5
00:00:10,725 --> 00:00:14,280
One way to see that, is to look at the code we're trying to replace.

6
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:17,698
This code defines lots of variables.

7
00:00:17,698 --> 00:00:19,473
It gives them values.

8
00:00:19,473 --> 00:00:24,322
The only one it uses on the right side, before giving it a value, is "page"

9
00:00:24,322 --> 00:00:27,095
When it uses "start_link" on the right side here,

10
00:00:27,095 --> 00:00:30,380
well the code defines "start_link" on the line above,

11
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:34,695
so, it didn't care about the value of "start_link" going into this code.

12
00:00:34,695 --> 00:00:36,629
The only variable whose value we care about

13
00:00:36,629 --> 00:00:38,178
going into this code

14
00:00:38,178 --> 00:00:39,792
is the value of "page,"

15
00:00:39,792 --> 00:00:41,329
and what "page" is, is a string

16
00:00:41,329 --> 00:00:45,000
giving the contents of the rest of the web page.
