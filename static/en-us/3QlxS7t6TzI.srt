00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:06,820
Computer system security has assumed enormous importance in the connected world

2
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:12,930
that we live in today. Indeed, there are courses offered just on the topic of

3
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:16,020
computer system security. And universities, including

4
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:19,620
Georgia Tech, offer an entire Master's degree

5
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:25,950
program on information security. In this course module our goal is to get

6
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:28,660
an introduction to the terminologies in

7
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:31,466
computer system security that we should be

8
00:00:31,466 --> 00:00:35,590
familiar with as operating system designers. Using

9
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:39,250
a case study we'll also learn Cryptographic

10
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:43,820
techniques that can be used as a tool by an operating system designer

11
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:47,870
to provide authentication in a distributed manner.

12
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:51,400
We'll start this module with a discussion

13
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:57,000
of the terminologies first articulated by Jerome Solser. You'll be

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,520
amazed at how computer visionaries thought of issues

15
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:06,700
with information security, even before computers were connected to one another.
