1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,355
One way to do it, would be to look up here at the original table and count the

2
00:00:05,367 --> 00:00:10,920
number of students who are either 20, 21, 22, all the way to 39. But that would

3
00:00:10,932 --> 00:00:16,385
be really time consuming. Instead, we know that all of these should add to 50

4
00:00:16,397 --> 00:00:21,955
because that's the total number of students in our sample. 19 plus 5 plus 5, is

5
00:00:21,967 --> 00:00:31,407
29, and 50 minus 29 is 21. So in other words, we did 50 minus 19 plus 5 plus 5

6
00:00:31,419 --> 00:00:33,433
in parentheses.
