1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,165
Affordances provide the opportunity for actions.

2
00:00:03,165 --> 00:00:08,850
Anti affordances, prevent otherwise possible actions. So

3
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:13,930
these bars appear to be examples of anti affordances. Bars that prevent cars,

4
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:18,690
trucks and other large vehicles, from driving on the road. And anti affordances,

5
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:21,660
are quite useful in many situations.

6
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:26,240
But, these bars only look like anti-affordances.

7
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,775
They clearly signify non passage. But, but look

8
00:00:28,775 --> 00:00:32,420
at the photographs. While the vertical bars appear

9
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:35,130
to signify that an automobile can't pass over

10
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:38,279
them. In this case, they're fake. They're false

11
00:00:38,279 --> 00:00:42,151
anti-affordances. They signify non passage. But in fact,

12
00:00:42,151 --> 00:00:45,550
they allow it. How? Well they bend when

13
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:50,030
a car passes over them. Or as shown in the photo, if someone steps on them.
