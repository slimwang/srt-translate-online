We just saw that this equation was a circle, with a radius of 10. So now let's

2
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:10,115
consider some other points. Do you think each of these points would be, inside

3
00:00:10,115 --> 00:00:15,988
of our circle? Outside of our circle? Or on the circle. Choose one of these for

4
00:00:15,988 --> 00:00:19,385
each of the points. Keep in mind if it's on the circle, this point, the x and y

5
00:00:19,385 --> 00:00:24,686
value, would satisfy our equation. If it doesn't satisfy the equation, then

6
00:00:24,686 --> 00:00:30,204
think about what kind of numbers our results would be inside the circle and

7
00:00:30,204 --> 00:00:36,376
what kind would be outside. Good luck here.
