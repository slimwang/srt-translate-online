00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:05,430
We've now looked at the central
challenges facing EMR designers.

2
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:08,000
And have considered some
innovative approaches,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,320
particularly to the data
collection problems.

4
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:15,380
There's some additional material in
the text about data visualization you

5
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:16,990
should review.

6
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:21,318
In particular, view the medication
reconciliation video from Dr.

00:00:21,318 --> 00:00:24,760
Shneiderman's group at
the University of Maryland.

8
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:30,740
New challenges arise as the
reimbursement system moves from pay for

9
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:33,390
procedure to pay for performance.

10
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:38,650
Novel informatics tools are required
to overcome these challenges.

11
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:43,680
And, as you'll see later on, are usually
provided by separate systems,

12
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,480
since virtually all EMRs were designed
for the historic payment model.

13
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:53,620
The Marshfield Clinic, the organization
whose exceptional performance in the PGP

14
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:58,220
demo we discussed earlier,
has historically developed its own EHR.

15
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:04,360
The latest version introduced
in HIMS 2015 features a fully

16
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,340
integrated set of these tools.
