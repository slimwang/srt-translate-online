1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
We'll get into both the mathematics and the practice

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
of implementing systems using cryptography,

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
but there's one thing I want to really emphasize,

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
and make sure that you understand.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Implementing your own cryptography is very challenging,

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
it's something that is very easy to do incorrectly.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
One example of that to keep in mind--

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
and this is an important thing--

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
so we often think about programs as black boxes

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
with inputs and outputs,

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
and our encryption functions will usually take a key in a message

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
and produce some ciphertext,

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
and the implementations we'll show in this class

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
will be functionally correct,

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
they'll produce the correct outputs.

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
They won't be secure,

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
and the reason they won't be secure is

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
things aren't really black boxes when we use them.

19
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
There's lots of other things that someone

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
could observe about this.

21
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
They could observe how long it takes.

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
And when you can observe properties

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
of a function--other than their functional behavior--

24
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
other than just their inputs and outputs--

25
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
that's called a side channel.

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
An example of a side channel is timing.

27
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
So, the time it takes to run this function could vary,

28
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
it could depend on the message or the key.

29
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Most of the code that we're going to write in this class

30
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
will have that property.

31
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
We're not going to be adding complexity

32
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
to our code to worry about things like side channels,

33
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
but in terms of implementing things correctly,

34
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
that's really important,

35
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
and there are lots of ways that code could have side channels.

36
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
It could affect what's in the cache of the processor,

37
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
and that could be visible in some way,

38
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
it could actually affect how much power

39
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
your processor uses,

40
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
and people have shown ways to break smart cards

41
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
by measuring the power consumption as they do encryption

42
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
and that gives you some insight into what the key is.

43
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
So, this is just an example of the kinds of things

44
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
that it's very hard to get right in implementing cryptography.

45
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
These are things that, if you were building cryptography

46
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
for any important use, you'd have to worry about.

47
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
These are things that we are not going to worry about

48
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
in most of the code that we write in this class

49
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
so you shouldn't view these implementations as secure implementations.

50
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
The only reason to implement your own crypto

51
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
is for fun and learning.

52
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
And that's what we hope you'll get from this class by doing it,

53
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
but if you actually want to use cryptography

54
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
to protect anything important, well--

55
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
you should use a library implementation

56
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
that's been carefully vetted,

57
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
that's been written in a way to worry about

58
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
these kinds of issues like timing side channels,

59
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
and that other people have looked at

60
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
carefully enough to have some higher level of confidence

61
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
that it's correct and secure.

62
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
So I want to make sure everyone was paying careful attention

63
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
to that last point,

64
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
and we'll have a quiz:

65
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Should you use any code from this course

66
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
to protect nuclear launch codes?

67
00:02:39,000 --> 99:59:59,999
The answers are no--check the correct answer.
