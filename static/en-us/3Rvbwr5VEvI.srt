00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:04,618
You may have figured out that the significance level is the P value. You see

2
00:00:04,618 --> 00:00:10,523
that the P value is less than 0.05 but greater than 0.01. Therefore, at the

3
00:00:10,523 --> 00:00:17,764
0.05 level, we would reject H-naught but at the 0.01 level, we wouldn't. You

4
00:00:17,764 --> 00:00:22,048
could have also used the T table, and found the T critical values for an alpha

5
00:00:22,048 --> 00:00:27,480
level of 0.05 and 0.01. And you would see that the f statistic falls in between

6
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:32,049
them. That's another way to decide what our conclusion will be.
