00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,550
Here in this first picture I have 2 out of 2 parts. Notice that its really one

2
00:00:05,562 --> 00:00:10,882
whole circle. I have 1 half and 2 halves. Here I have 1 3rd of the circle, 2 3rd

3
00:00:11,162 --> 00:00:16,662
of the circle and altogether will be 3 3rds of the circle. Here I have 1 4th, 2

4
00:00:16,662 --> 00:00:22,508
4th, 3 4th, and 4 4th. The same is true with the 5ths and 6ths. You can just

5
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:28,667
count up the pieces. So, the numerator counts how many pieces we have. The

6
00:00:28,679 --> 00:00:35,252
denominator counts the types of pieces we have. So, for example, with 6, I have

7
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:41,180
1 6th, 2 6th, 3 6th, 4 6th, 5 6ths, and 6 6ths, or one whole. I know all these

8
00:00:41,192 --> 00:00:47,300
circles really represent one. They're all equal. They represent one whole

9
00:00:47,312 --> 00:00:47,895
circle.
