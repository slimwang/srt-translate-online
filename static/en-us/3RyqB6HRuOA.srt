00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,685
Let's think first how to get e to the x by itself. Before we do anything else,

2
00:00:04,685 --> 00:00:10,530
we need to subtract 23 from both sides. That leaves us with 3e to the x equals

3
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:15,375
323. To get e to the x alone, all we need to do now is to divide both sides by

4
00:00:15,375 --> 00:00:19,717
3. Now, I could come up with a decimal for the right-hand side here, but I

5
00:00:19,717 --> 00:00:23,820
don't think it's going to be very pretty. So, I'm just going to leave this as

6
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:30,325
an improper fraction for now. So we have e to the x equals 323 over 3. Now, I

7
00:00:30,325 --> 00:00:34,616
want to get x by itself, and what do I need to do? Well, I need to take the log

8
00:00:34,616 --> 00:00:38,154
of both sides and the base of that log needs to be the same as the base we have

9
00:00:38,154 --> 00:00:46,107
here, which is e. So I have ln of e to the x equals ln of 323 over 3. We know

10
00:00:46,107 --> 00:00:52,056
that the left-hand side will reduce just to x. That's why we picked a log of

11
00:00:52,056 --> 00:00:55,880
this base after all. To figure out what the right-hand side evaluates to, we

12
00:00:55,880 --> 00:01:04,720
have to use our calculator. Okay, so natural log of 323 divided by 3. Double

13
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,968
check that we've add the correct thing here and that looks right to me. That

14
00:01:07,968 --> 00:01:14,161
equals 4.679 and so on. We said we wanted our answer to just two decimal

15
00:01:14,161 --> 00:01:18,639
places, so that should be 4.68.
