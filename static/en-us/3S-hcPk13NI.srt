1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:05,535
We typically report the results of one way ANOVA like this. Our F statistic as

2
00:00:05,535 --> 00:00:10,207
a function of our two degrees of freedom, between and within, our p value, and

3
00:00:10,207 --> 00:00:16,270
eta squared. Note that when we're doing ANOVA by hand, we can't find the exact

4
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:21,715
p value. This is the same as with the t test. We only know that our p value is

5
00:00:21,715 --> 00:00:25,684
less than .05, our alpha level, because our f statistic is greater than the f

6
00:00:25,684 --> 00:00:32,125
critical value. If we're using software, it'll be the same thing, except we can

7
00:00:32,125 --> 00:00:37,230
calculate the exact p value. Notice that we frequently used small samples in

8
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:42,310
our examples and problem sets. However, we wouldn't normally use such small

9
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:47,828
samples, especially in real research. But if we use large samples, we can't do

10
00:00:47,828 --> 00:00:52,820
ANOVA by hand. That would just take too long. We would use software instead.

11
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:57,120
When we use software, we don't care as much about the intermediate steps.

12
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,434
Really, we just want to compare the p value with alpha. We know that if p is

13
00:01:01,434 --> 00:01:06,647
less than alpha, we'll reject the null. Since using software is so essential to

14
00:01:06,647 --> 00:01:11,564
doing statistical tests. We're going to provide you with some software output

15
00:01:11,564 --> 00:01:16,262
for you to see and analyze so that you get familiar with it. This is real data

16
00:01:16,262 --> 00:01:19,742
that Doctor Laraway collected from his psychology students at San Jose

17
00:01:19,742 --> 00:01:25,386
University. There are 188 students total, 90 of which were freshman, 44

18
00:01:25,386 --> 00:01:31,971
sophomores, 23 juniors, and 31 seniors. And he asked them to self report how

19
00:01:31,971 --> 00:01:37,139
many days every month they drink caffeine. You can already see that the number

20
00:01:37,139 --> 00:01:42,225
of days that seniors drink caffeine is higher than any of the others. But it

21
00:01:42,225 --> 00:01:47,346
also has a pretty large standard deviation, as does that for juniors. We

22
00:01:47,346 --> 00:01:51,189
want to know if at least one group of college students drinks more caffeine

23
00:01:51,189 --> 00:01:58,760
than the others. Dr. Laraway used the statistical program SPSS to answer this.

24
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:02,760
Here's his ANOVA table output. According to this, which of the following would

25
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,470
we do?
