1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:03,660
So for this assignment, discuss how you
might use incremental concept learning

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:06,660
to design an agent that can solve
Raven's progressive matrices.

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:09,430
What are the concepts that you're
trying to learn in this case?

4
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:11,020
What are you incrementing over?

5
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:13,030
This might depend on
the scope of your problem.

6
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:15,690
So are you doing concept learning at
the level of the individual problem?

7
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:17,418
Or are you doing it between problems?

8
00:00:17,418 --> 00:00:19,193
What concepts are you learning here and

9
00:00:19,193 --> 00:00:21,297
how are you actually
tweaking them over time?

10
00:00:21,297 --> 00:00:22,573
What would a specific concept look like?

11
00:00:22,573 --> 00:00:24,316
Or what would a general
concept look like?

12
00:00:24,316 --> 00:00:26,193
Once you establish these concepts,

13
00:00:26,193 --> 00:00:28,681
how will actually help
you solve knew problems?

14
00:00:28,681 --> 00:00:30,512
Or how are you going to
instantiate them or

15
00:00:30,512 --> 00:00:33,020
leverage them in new problems
that your agent faces?
