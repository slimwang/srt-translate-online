1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:02,410
So there's a fairly well established procedure for cleaning

2
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:05,650
data. Now, the specifics are going to very from one

3
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:08,370
situation to another, but the overall process remains the

4
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:12,280
same. Here, we're going to go through this blueprint, or procedure.

5
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:15,150
And then immediately following this discussion, we'll look at

6
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:19,080
a concrete example following this blueprint. So, the first step

7
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,800
is to audit your data. Now, in this step

8
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:25,200
what you'll be doing is programatically checking the data using

9
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,160
some validation rules you've written, and you'll create a

10
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,810
report on the quality of the data. Now, you

11
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:33,670
might also want to run a statistical analysis in

12
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:37,620
order to, for example. check for outliers. Having run your

13
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:40,220
audit, then you use that information to create a

14
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:43,210
data cleaning plan. In our data cleaning plan, we

15
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:46,400
want to identify any causes of the dirty data

16
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:50,240
that we're seeing. Now, this is going to be very situation-specific.

17
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:53,080
Then we're going to define a set of operations that

18
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:57,560
will correct our data, again, situation-specific. And finally what you

19
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:00,220
want to do, is run a few tests to make sure

20
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:02,090
that your data cleaning plan is going to do what you need

21
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:06,090
it to do. Next we're going to execute the plan.

22
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:09,100
Now just to be clear, this is essentially running a script

23
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:11,350
that will execute that set of operations you defined in

24
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:16,010
the data cleaning plan. Now it's possible, in fact it's likely,

25
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:18,580
that we won't have been able to programatically clean our

26
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:21,620
data entirely. And if it's necessary for you to do

27
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:25,360
so, there maybe a manual correction step, where you go

28
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,680
through, or you hire someone to go through, and make

29
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,420
any changes that need a human eye in order to

30
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:35,260
correct the data. Now, again this is another process where

31
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:38,650
we have humans involved, so once we've gone through all

32
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:41,050
this, it makes a lot of sense, in my opinion,

33
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:43,991
to iterate on this, possibly more than two

34
00:01:43,991 --> 00:01:46,570
iterations, until you have confidence in your data.
