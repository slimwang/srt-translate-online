1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:02,678
Let's say you are an art gallery.

2
00:00:02,678 --> 00:00:05,420
You've been staring at a painting that you really like, and

3
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:07,710
now you want to take a picture of it.

4
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:11,150
Your camera has a lens, and the sensor inside.

5
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:15,400
Now when taking the picture, you obviously want the painting to be in focus.

6
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,890
But say you also wanted frames such that,

7
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:23,530
the picture takes a exactly the image area, that is, you want to get the image,

8
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:27,670
when projected unto the sensor to match the sensor width.

9
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:32,320
Let's assume that your camera lens has a fixed focal length of 15 millimeters,

10
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:37,140
your sensor width, denoted by d is 35 millimeters, and

11
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:42,070
the width of the painting, w is 0.7 meters.

12
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:44,680
Now with your knowledge about field of view,

13
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:50,210
can you figure out how far the lens needs to be from the painting, and how far

14
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:56,460
the image plane needs to be from the lens to capture the desired image in focus.

15
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:00,560
Be mindful of units when calculating your answers.
