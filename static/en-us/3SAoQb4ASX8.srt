00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,270
One thing I want all of you to do is start looking and

2
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:04,520
understanding image formats a little bit.

3
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:06,960
Look at how the color channels are distributed.

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,410
And also what information we can extract about image compression.

5
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:16,290
And also these days, of course, most camera formats have a EXIF, or

6
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:18,260
Exchangeable Image File Format.

7
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:20,930
Which has information including of course, the width and

8
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:22,230
the height of the image.

9
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,690
But also things like how it is coded and

10
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:26,920
what are the compressions associated with it.

11
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:30,360
But more importantly these things also has information like the date the image

12
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:35,240
was captured geotags, and other information that's added in

13
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:38,670
as an additional data structure with an image data cell.
