00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,009
It's awesome that it worked.

2
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:05,540
Behind the scenes the Translation Editor
did a couple of things for us.

3
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:09,339
It created the Spanish version
of this strings.xml file.

4
00:00:09,339 --> 00:00:12,290
When you click on that you can
see that it automatically added

5
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:13,240
the translations in.

6
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:17,220
If we didn't provide Spanish
translations then it doesn't

7
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:18,260
appear here.

8
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:22,070
As a developer you have the option of
modifying the strings file directly or

9
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:23,500
using the Translations Editor.

10
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:27,960
