1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The answer is it could have been any of these,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
but I think the best answer is unit testing

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
because what we're doing is we're taking a software module,

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
testing it in isolation to see if it's up to our standards

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
before we integrate it with the rest of our software.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Now, the type of testing that we're actually doing

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
could have been white box testing, could have been black box testing,

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
and could have been stress testing.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
But I didn't give you enough details about what we were doing

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
to allow you, I believe, to conclude that any of those was definitely what we were doing,

11
00:00:26,000 --> 99:59:59,999
so what I think is the best answer here is unit testing.
