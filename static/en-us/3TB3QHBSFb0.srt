1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,000
Here's the solution.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,555
You can get the csv of
the IBM by using IBM.csv.

3
00:00:07,555 --> 00:00:12,391
The next step was the get the high
prices from the data frame.

4
00:00:12,391 --> 00:00:15,860
df[high] will do that for you.

5
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:18,500
And finally, you go ahead and plot it.

6
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,910
Let's see how the graph looks like.

7
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:23,590
I hope you got a graph similar to this.

8
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:26,832
An advice I would like to
give you at this point is,

9
00:00:26,832 --> 00:00:30,950
you will get hold of Python
easily if you experiment.

10
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:34,810
Try different options and
see what works and what does not.

11
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:38,055
During the course you will realize
why some things worked and

12
00:00:38,055 --> 00:00:39,650
why just some things failed.
