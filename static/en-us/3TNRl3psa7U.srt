Welcome to the lesson one assignments. I'm Andy Brown

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:05,770
and I'm a Udacity course designer. I've been working with

3
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:09,740
[UNKNOWN] Isabelle to design these lessons, these end of lesson

4
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:13,255
assignments and our intention was that they be taken in

5
00:00:13,255 --> 00:00:17,670
order. Lesson one, assignment, lesson two, assignment. But you

6
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:20,400
don't have to do it that way. These assignments will

7
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,940
take a little while. For this lesson, we expect maybe

8
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:25,500
an hour and a half, if you're doing it thoroughly.

9
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:29,360
And depending on why you're taking this class, you may not need to do that.

10
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:31,480
If you're a designer who is just interested

11
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,700
in seeing what's going on in the world

12
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:37,730
of design, you probably don't need to do all of this. But if you are a

13
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:39,790
developer and you do want to increase your

14
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:42,570
design skills, the only way is through practice.
