00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,750
So here was our problem. Data.largest returns a measurable. That's all it can

2
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:08,538
return, because the data class knows nothing about countries. We need a

3
00:00:08,538 --> 00:00:13,680
country, and the answer is simply to cast. The cast is legitimate, the largest

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:17,340
country had to be one of the countries that was put in, and its proof safe to

5
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:22,937
convert back from a measurable to the country. Lets think once more what

6
00:00:22,937 --> 00:00:27,556
advantage we get from the measurable interface. When you look at the BlueJ,

7
00:00:27,556 --> 00:00:31,582
display of classes and the interfaces, you can clearly see that country and car

8
00:00:31,582 --> 00:00:37,153
both implement the measurable interface. You can see that the data class uses

9
00:00:37,153 --> 00:00:42,282
the measurable interface, that's the dotted line here. And what's important is

10
00:00:42,282 --> 00:00:46,440
that the data class knows absolutely nothing about country's cars or any other

11
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:52,214
classes. It's decoupled from those classes, and that's what makes it, so

12
00:00:52,214 --> 00:00:56,246
generic. Now, Sarah will introduce you to an interface that's much more

13
00:00:56,246 --> 00:00:58,620
commonly used, a comparable interface.
