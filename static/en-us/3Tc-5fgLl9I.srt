00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:01,850
Here's a question.

2
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:06,400
What are the work and
span of this parallel scan algorithm?

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:09,680
So here are your answer choices,
and for each of work and span,

4
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:11,430
choose the correct one.

5
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:13,030
That is, choose one from each column.
