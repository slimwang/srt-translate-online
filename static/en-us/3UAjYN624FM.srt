00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,046
Now let's start filling out our ANOVA table. Calculate the sum of squares for

2
00:00:04,046 --> 00:00:09,400
between group variability. Since the sample sizes are different, we have to

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:14,200
multiply each sample size by the square deviation of each group mean from the

4
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:21,495
grand mean. After we multiply the sample size by the square deviation, then we

5
00:00:21,495 --> 00:00:23,620
summed them up.
