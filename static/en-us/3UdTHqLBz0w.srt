00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
[Norvig] The crux of the whole matter is doing the assignments.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
There are 2 ways to do it.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
We can deduce what assignment must be true--

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
that it must be the case that the Englishman is in a certain house.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Or we can just try different possibilities--

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
try to put the Englishman in house 1, then in house 2, then in house 3 and see what works.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
You'd have to be very clever to figure out how to do all these deductions,

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and I don't want to try to be that clever.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I want to see if I can get by with just trying all the possibilities,

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
make the computer do the work so I don't have to.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
So let's approach that and let's say we're going to try all possibilities.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
And so first we put the Englishman into house 1,

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
and later we'll try him in houses 2, 3, 4, and 5.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
What about the Spaniard?

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
If the Englishman is in house 1, what possibilities should we try for the Spaniard?

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Give me your best answer:

17
00:00:51,000 --> 99:59:59,999
all the numbers; only 1; only 2; or 2, 3, 4, 5.
