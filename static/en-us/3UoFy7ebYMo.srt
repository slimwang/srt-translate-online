00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:03,679
So I'm going to discuss B.F Skinner's theory of Verbal Behavior and how we

2
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:08,230
acquire language. And you'll see that adults do much to encourage imitation

3
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:12,435
from children. And one way they do so is through what's called child directed

4
00:00:12,435 --> 00:00:16,024
speech. You saw an example of child directed speech in the lesson on

5
00:00:16,024 --> 00:00:20,944
development when we had the quiz. I was engaging in child-directed speech, and

6
00:00:20,944 --> 00:00:24,656
I did so by raising my voice a higher pitch, I talked in smaller sentences, and

7
00:00:24,656 --> 00:00:29,529
I used lots of emotion. Oh, aren't you a cute little baby?
