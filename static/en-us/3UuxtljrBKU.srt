1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:01,290
After space and

2
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:05,580
color, type is the next item you should
consider when creating a great app.

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:08,500
Roboto, the default sans
serif font family for

4
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:12,860
Android, is a great place to start,
as it was specifically designed for

5
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:16,440
user interfaces across
a variety of screens.

6
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,530
Using Roboto gives you the comfort
of knowing your text will work with

7
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:23,570
a variety of languages and
remain crisp and legible on any screen.

8
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:28,440
And, you can use Roboto across
your entire app, whether it be for

9
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:32,650
headlines, body text,
smaller captions or whatever.

10
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:37,010
It includes a bunch of weights,
like light, regular, medium, bold, and

11
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:39,939
black, and
variants like condensed and slab.

12
00:00:41,228 --> 00:00:44,220
Having those variants available
in addition to font size and

13
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:46,570
color lets you clearly communicate, for

14
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:50,910
example, what's a headline versus
what's part of the body text.

15
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:54,980
Or, as we sometimes say, it'll help
you establish a clear hierarchy for

16
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:56,510
the text in your app.

17
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:59,370
Now, typography is a really large topic,
and we'll

18
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:03,390
try to fit as much as possible into this
course, but we can only cover so much.

19
00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:08,530
If you're interested in typography
outside the realm of mobile app design,

20
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:11,620
I strongly encourage you to
check out some of the books

21
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:13,510
linked in the instructor notes.

22
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:16,630
There's a whole world of information
out there if you're a typography

23
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:17,730
fanatic like me.
