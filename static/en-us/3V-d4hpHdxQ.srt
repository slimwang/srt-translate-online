00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:05,800
I really like what Dave says in this
lesson called Variables Can Vary, and

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:09,330
I want to keep a record of the code
that he writes in this video.

3
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:12,340
So I'm actually just going to write
it myself in my starter code file.

4
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:16,720
And after I copy the code,
I'm going to add some comments

5
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,990
that tell me what this code is
all about and why it's important.

6
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:25,100
I think I'll even include a link
to the video so I can go back and

7
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:26,760
reference it later.

8
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:31,640
In Python, you can add notes to a code
file by using the pound symbol.

9
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:38,196
Basically, that tells the computer
to ignore everything on that line

10
00:00:38,196 --> 00:00:43,034
after the pound symbol, so this way
I can write stuff that is meant for

11
00:00:43,034 --> 00:00:45,720
people to read instead of computers.

12
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:49,789
When I come to a quiz node I can
choose to switch to my browser and

13
00:00:49,789 --> 00:00:54,251
answer the quiz in the Udacity classroom
or I can write my answer in my

14
00:00:54,251 --> 00:00:59,210
starter code file and just copy and
paste it over when I'm ready to submit.

15
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:00,470
I think I'll do that.

16
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:07,640
That way I can keep a record of my
quiz code just for my own reference.

17
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:10,390
Awesome, I passed the quiz.

18
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:13,530
If I ever want to see
what any of my code does,

19
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:16,300
I can easily do that in Sublime.

20
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:21,120
All I have to do is go up to
the menu bar, click tools and

21
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:24,500
then go to build, or as a shortcut,

22
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:30,070
I can press Cmd+B on Mac or
Ctrl+B on Windows.

23
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:34,600
When I click build, a screen shows on
the bottom of my Sublime window and

24
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,010
it shows the output of my code.

25
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:41,940
Doing this often will really help me
get into the habit of running my code.

26
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:46,640
And it will help me a lot when I
start working on big projects.

27
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,060
All right, this is looking pretty good.

28
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:51,540
I'll save this file on my computer
in a place where I'll keep

29
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:54,950
all of my Intro to
Programming Nanodegree starter code.

30
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:57,940
Now you can easily open this file and
check it out again.

31
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:59,810
If I forget any of this content or

32
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:02,660
I just want a reference to
stuff that I've written before.
