00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,690
To help you review for the second exam, we're going to look back now through

2
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:08,985
lesson 17 through 26, and the material we've covered during that time. Let's

3
00:00:08,985 --> 00:00:14,440
get started. We begin by developing and understanding of functions. We ask the

4
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:19,451
question, what is a function? As you learned, a function pairs each input value

5
00:00:19,451 --> 00:00:23,908
with exactly one output value. Which means we can figure out if a graph

6
00:00:23,908 --> 00:00:29,150
represents a function by using the vertical line test. We then looked at domain

7
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:32,488
and range as well as explored what it means for a function to be either even or

8
00:00:32,488 --> 00:00:38,513
odd. From there, we investigated the overall shape of a function. Going all the

9
00:00:38,513 --> 00:00:42,047
way from minus infinity to infinity in the domain, looking at whether it's

10
00:00:42,047 --> 00:00:48,292
increasing or decreasing, and whether it has maximum and minimum points. This

11
00:00:48,292 --> 00:00:51,737
led to a discussion about finding real zeros, which, as you remember, are the x

12
00:00:51,737 --> 00:00:56,902
coordinates of the graph's x intercepts. And we used a polynomial long division

13
00:00:56,902 --> 00:01:02,130
to help us along the way. To help us narrow down the list of possible rational

14
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:07,148
zeroes for a polynomial function we used the Rational Zero Theorem. When we

15
00:01:07,148 --> 00:01:10,328
couldn't find the exact values of zeroes that we could see on graphs, the

16
00:01:10,328 --> 00:01:16,046
intermediate value theorem helped us approximate their locations. With

17
00:01:16,046 --> 00:01:19,378
Piecewise Functions, we got to put together some really interesting graphs, and

18
00:01:19,378 --> 00:01:24,298
start thinking more about domain and range. This prepared us to work with

19
00:01:24,298 --> 00:01:27,886
rational functions, whose vertical, horizontal,and slant asymptotes restrict

20
00:01:27,886 --> 00:01:32,753
their domains and ranges in particular ways. Lastly, we explored

21
00:01:32,753 --> 00:01:37,028
Transformations of Functions. Rigid transformations include vertical and

22
00:01:37,028 --> 00:01:41,293
horizontal shifts as well as reflections in the x and y axis. Nonrigid

23
00:01:41,293 --> 00:01:44,597
transformations, on the other hand, distort the shape of functions by

24
00:01:44,597 --> 00:01:50,706
stretching or shrinking them. We encourage you to review the practice problems

25
00:01:50,706 --> 00:01:55,892
at the end of each lesson, the problem sets and the summary review videos. Best

26
00:01:55,892 --> 00:01:57,640
of luck to you. We know you'll do well. [BLANK_AUDIO]
