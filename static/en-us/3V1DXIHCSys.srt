1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:02,649
You're almost done building Sunshine.

2
00:00:02,649 --> 00:00:04,730
And now it's time to
work on the last step,

3
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:06,910
which is adding some visual polish.

4
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:11,690
Often, when developers start to build an
app, they focus on basic functionality.

5
00:00:11,689 --> 00:00:15,029
But visual detail and
design is also really important.

6
00:00:15,029 --> 00:00:18,949
So in this lesson, we're going to focus
on adding some layout pizzazz and

7
00:00:18,949 --> 00:00:22,089
style to a simple app so
that it looks really good.

8
00:00:22,089 --> 00:00:25,899
We'll be adding details like
custom colors, fonts and styles.

9
00:00:25,899 --> 00:00:29,689
And we'll also learn how to make it look
great on all types of Android devices,

10
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:33,710
from the smallest of watches to
phones and larger tablet screens.

11
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:36,410
Then at the end of this lesson
you'll apply what you've learned

12
00:00:36,409 --> 00:00:39,019
to put the finishing
touches on Sunshine.

13
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:41,660
Let's start by learning a little
more about the importance of design.
