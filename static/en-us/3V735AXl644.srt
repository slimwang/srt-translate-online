1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:01,768
So that's IPv6.

2
00:00:01,768 --> 00:00:04,980
Look for it in your near future or
maybe even in your present.

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:06,318
For most of the rest of this course,

4
00:00:06,318 --> 00:00:10,180
we'll be in IPv4, which is a little
bit more widely used today.

5
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:14,920
Also, our hosting provider doesn't
natively support the v6 just yet.

6
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,840
But almost everything we talk about,
except the addresses,

7
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,140
will apply to v6 as well.

8
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:24,250
However, if you're building apps today
that care about IP addresses, even for

9
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:26,950
things like logging user requests,

10
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:30,600
you've got to expect them to be
deployed in a world with v6 present.

11
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,600
You can't expect that
addresses are 32 bits long, or

12
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,570
that their printed representation
looks like a classic v4 dotted quad.

13
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:42,530
To see if you have IPv6,
go to test-ipv6.com,

14
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:48,590
which is a site for testing whether
your computer has IPv6 access.

15
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,440
If you have a smartphone,
try it there as well,

16
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:53,490
and then mark whichever one
of these options is true.

17
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:56,190
Either that you've tested your devices
and at least one does have IPv6.

18
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,210
Or you've tested them and
none have IPv6 yet.
