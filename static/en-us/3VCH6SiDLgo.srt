00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,080
I started by going straight to
the Mozilla developer network.

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,240
I wanted to check out the list
of different input types.

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:11,200
As you might recall, there are two
inputs that consolidate dates and times.

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,140
And they are date time and
date time local.

5
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:16,030
Either one of these works for

6
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:20,010
this quiz, but I like date time
local a little bit more, because.

7
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:22,570
I never mentioned anything
about time zones.

8
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:25,310
But there's no reason you wouldn't be
able to make date time work either.

9
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:27,750
And here's how it looks.

10
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:31,390
You can click on this drop down arrow
to get a nice visual calendar to

11
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:35,070
pick out dates, and you've got
a place to input times, perfect.
