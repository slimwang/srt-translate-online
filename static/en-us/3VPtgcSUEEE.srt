00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Let's look at the position and the velocity of the weight that forms the end of a standard pendulum

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
that swings and eventually stop swinging.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
What happens to a given area in the phase space of that system?

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Does it remain constant, does it shrinks to half the original size, does it shrink to zero,

5
00:00:21,000 --> 99:59:59,999
does it grow to infinity, or does it grow to twice the original size.
