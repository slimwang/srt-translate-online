Well, there are a number of reasons why we may behave in an altruistic way. So

2
00:00:04,032 --> 00:00:10,142
let's look at a few. One evolutionary theory for altruism is kin selection. And

3
00:00:10,142 --> 00:00:13,814
this refers to the evolutionary pressure for individuals to favor helping those

4
00:00:13,814 --> 00:00:19,810
that are most genetically related to themselves. That is relatives or kin.

5
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:25,874
Another explanation for altruistic behavior is reciprocal altruism. This is the

6
00:00:25,874 --> 00:00:29,626
idea that we help others in the hope that they will help us in the future. It

7
00:00:29,626 --> 00:00:33,595
is much easier for us to survive as humans if we can cooperate with each other

8
00:00:33,595 --> 00:00:37,740
and this type of altruism promotes cooperation.
