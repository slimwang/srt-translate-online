00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Here we give you an intuition as to why

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
an optimistic heuristic function, h, finds the lowest-cost path.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,000
When A-star ends, it returns a path, p, with estimated cost, c.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
It turns out that c is also the actual cost,

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
because at the goal the h component is 0,

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
and so the path cost is the total cost as estimated by the function.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Now, all the paths on the front tier

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
have an estimated cost that's greater than c,

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
and we know that because the front tier is explored in cheapest-first order.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
If h is optimistic, then the estimated cost

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
is less than the true cost,

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
so the path p must have a cost that's less than the true cost

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
of any of the paths on the front tier.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Any paths that go beyond the front tier

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
must have a cost that's greater than that

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
because we agree that the step cost is always 0 or more.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
So that means that this path, p, must be the minimal cost path.

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Now, this argument, I should say, only goes through

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
as is for tree search.

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
For graph search the argument is slightly more complicated,

21
00:01:19,000 --> 99:59:59,999
but the general intuitions hold the same.
