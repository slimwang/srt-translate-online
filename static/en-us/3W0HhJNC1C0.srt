1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,500
You've learned a bit about delegation

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:04,019
and AVAudioRecorder. Before we go any

3
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:06,240
further, it's good reflect on delegation

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,580
Take a few minutes to summarize what

5
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:11,550
you've learned about delegation,

6
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:13,289
how can AVAudioRecorder know that we

7
00:00:13,289 --> 00:00:15,119
implemented the

8
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:18,089
audioRecorderDidFinishRecording function,

9
00:00:18,089 --> 00:00:24,559
how did it know to use our implementation here.
