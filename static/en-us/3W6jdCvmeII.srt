1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,440
So this allows us to
now do the computation.

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:05,240
And now let's look at few curves.

3
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:08,250
Now here I'm just going to show you some
curves from a different set of images,

4
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:11,200
not these, but
just this is just to prove a point.

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,610
Here basically you see the four curves.

6
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:16,309
This one is for green.

7
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:18,570
This is for red.

8
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:24,340
For blue and, and
then all three of them combined to rgb.

9
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:27,510
This is to point out that we can
actually do this analysis separately for

10
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:30,420
all of the different channels and
then combine it separately.

11
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:32,590
Again just showing you six images.

12
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:35,230
Number of images increases,
we can actually do this.

13
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:38,510
Most of the time for simple,
smaller hand-held cameras.

14
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:40,500
They only take about two or
three images.

15
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:44,810
Higher end cameras and
using functions like bracketing

16
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:47,520
you can actually capture
a lot more of these images.

17
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,400
So that basically is the capital
P in my previous equation
