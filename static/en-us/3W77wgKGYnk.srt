1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:04,260
Referring back to our formula, A equals P times 1 plus r over n to the nt,

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:08,670
we've seen n, the number of times the interest is compounded in a year, equal

3
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:17,933
to several different values in our different situations. We've had n equals 1,

4
00:00:17,933 --> 00:00:23,566
2, 3, 4, and 12. And presumably, we could have interest compounded even more

5
00:00:23,566 --> 00:00:27,706
frequently than this. As you've experienced, Grant likes to push limits in

6
00:00:27,706 --> 00:00:31,108
order the maximize the amount of money he makes, and now he wants to know what

7
00:00:31,108 --> 00:00:34,456
would happen if his interest is compounded so frequently That is actually

8
00:00:34,456 --> 00:00:41,162
compounded over and over again all the time. Lucky for him, this sort of

9
00:00:41,162 --> 00:00:47,408
interest setup actually already exists. It's called continuously compounded

10
00:00:47,408 --> 00:00:52,231
interest. If we want to use our good old formula here and keep increasing and

11
00:00:52,231 --> 00:00:58,610
increasing n Do I reach a particular function? Let's see what happens if we

12
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:03,090
substitute in the values p equals 1, r equals 1 and t equals 1 and then

13
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:09,288
increase the value of n. Well they just said that p equal to 1, r equal to 1

14
00:01:09,288 --> 00:01:15,647
and t equal to 1. Here's what we have. A equals 1 plus 1 over n all to the nth

15
00:01:15,647 --> 00:01:21,693
power. Now I'd like us to see what happens if we let n increase. Let's plug in

16
00:01:21,693 --> 00:01:25,470
some values to find out. So here's a little table for you to help me fill out.

17
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:29,128
For each value of n here, please plug it into this equation to find the value

18
00:01:29,128 --> 00:01:33,662
of a that goes with it. Now, you're probably going to get some pretty long

19
00:01:33,662 --> 00:01:36,824
decimals, so I'd like you to type in as many numbers As your calculator will

20
00:01:36,824 --> 00:01:41,304
give you, maybe around ten or so. Remeber you can always use the google

21
00:01:41,304 --> 00:01:44,070
calculator online if you need a different device.
