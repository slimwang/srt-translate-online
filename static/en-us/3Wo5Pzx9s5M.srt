1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,770
Now I'm going to walk through how to
set up a collection view in Storyboard.

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:06,380
There are two ways to set up
table view controllers and

3
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:08,650
collection view
controllers in Storyboard.

4
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:10,315
The first way you've seen before.

5
00:00:10,315 --> 00:00:13,391
You start with the regular
UIViewController like this one.

6
00:00:13,391 --> 00:00:16,660
And then you drag in a table view or
a collection view.

7
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:20,560
The second option is to use
a Table View Controller like this one.

8
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,360
Or a Collection View Controller
like this one.

9
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:26,216
In the table views lesson,
we used option one.

10
00:00:26,216 --> 00:00:30,431
Now we'll set up our Collection
View Controller using option two.

11
00:00:30,431 --> 00:00:33,391
Here I've opened to
the Bond Villains in Tabs project.

12
00:00:33,391 --> 00:00:37,270
But this version doesn't have
a Collection View Controller set up yet.

13
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:42,130
To access this project, switch to the
git branch in the instructor's notes.

14
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:45,010
Now open up the Bond Villains
in Tabs project so

15
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:48,290
that you can follow along with
me as I go through the steps to

16
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:51,420
add a Collection View Controller
to your project.

17
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:54,020
The first step is to drag
in a Navigation Controller.

18
00:00:55,798 --> 00:00:58,940
Next, you'll want to delete the Root
View Controller that automatically

19
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:00,750
came with that Navigation Controller.

20
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:05,450
Next you'll want to drag in
a Collection View Controller, and

21
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:09,118
this item is of the class
UICollectionViewController.

22
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:12,940
Next up, Ctrl+click on that
Navigation Controller and

23
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:16,290
set its Root View Controller to be
the Collection View Controller you

24
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:17,720
just added.

25
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:21,530
Remember that we want our collection
view to show up in our tab bar.

26
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:26,040
To accomplish that, first Ctrl+click on
the Tab Bar Controller and we want to

27
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:30,460
add this second Navigation Controller
to our view controllers array.

28
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:33,910
So we can drag here from
the view controllers array, and

29
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:35,930
add that second Navigation Controller.

30
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:40,810
Next, we need to set the name of
the Collection View Controller to match

31
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:45,010
the name of the class where all our
collection view methods are implemented.

32
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:47,900
To do that we click on
the Collection View Controller and

33
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:51,140
then open up the Identity Inspector
on the right.

34
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:56,040
Here under Class, we're going to put
Villain Collection View Controller.

35
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,580
Of course,
when you're setting this up for

36
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:01,980
Meme Me, you're going to put sent
Memes Collection View Controller.

37
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:04,410
Next, we're going to configure
our Collection View cell.

38
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,280
In order to do that, let's open
up the Outline View on the left.

39
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:13,000
Here, in the outline, under
Villain Collection View Controller,

40
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,900
we can see the Collection View cell.

41
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:15,900
Go ahead and click on it.

42
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:20,860
We need to set the name of the cells
class to match the custom cell class

43
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:22,700
that we implemented earlier.

44
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:25,790
So up here under Class in
the Identity Inspector,

45
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:28,308
we're going to put
Villain Collection View Cell.

46
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,270
And when you're setting up Meme Me,

47
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:35,250
you'll type in whatever name you
used for your custom cell class.

48
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:38,100
Now, I'm just going to make this
collection view cell a little bit

49
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,930
bigger, and
then I'm going to drag in an image view.

50
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:45,449
Right now, I'm just dragging in
an image view for testing purposes.

51
00:02:45,449 --> 00:02:49,780
I just want to be able to see the cells
so that I know I set them up correctly.

52
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:53,310
Now I need to connect an outlet
to this UI image view.

53
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:56,960
So you can see here that I've
opened up the Assistant Editor.

54
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:00,395
And we've got our
VillainCollectionViewCell.swift file

55
00:03:00,395 --> 00:03:01,715
here on the right.

56
00:03:01,715 --> 00:03:03,115
Now to connect the outlet,

57
00:03:03,115 --> 00:03:07,685
all I do is drag from the circle
to the UIImageView in Storyboard.

58
00:03:07,685 --> 00:03:08,615
Last, but not least,

59
00:03:08,615 --> 00:03:13,198
we need to make sure we set the reuse
identifier for our collection view cell.

60
00:03:13,198 --> 00:03:16,480
So you'll want to make sure you click
on the Collection View Cell, and

61
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,730
then you'll go over here to
the Attributes Inspector, and

62
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:23,730
under Identifier,
put VillainCollectionViewCell.

63
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:25,430
All right, let's run it and
see what we've got.

64
00:03:26,655 --> 00:03:31,175
All right, there's our collection view
and it seems to be loading data fine.

65
00:03:31,175 --> 00:03:32,603
And in the next session,

66
00:03:32,603 --> 00:03:36,819
I'm going to talk about how to use the
class UICollectionView flow layout so

67
00:03:36,819 --> 00:03:39,955
that you can arrange these
cells the way you want them.
