00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,733
Graph B can help us visualize the first inequality, and graph A can help us

2
00:00:03,733 --> 00:00:07,676
visualize the second one. Now, we're not totally there yet in terms of the

3
00:00:07,676 --> 00:00:11,834
actual inequalities themselves, but at least in both cases, we now have the

4
00:00:11,834 --> 00:00:16,058
curves and lines graph that we need in order to show these inequalities on the

5
00:00:16,058 --> 00:00:20,362
graphs. Remember that when we were dealing with solving equations graphically,

6
00:00:20,362 --> 00:00:24,327
you could look at both sides of an equation and set each one individually equal

7
00:00:24,327 --> 00:00:28,388
to y, and then graph the two equations that gave us. So in this first graph over

8
00:00:28,388 --> 00:00:32,170
here, which we know of course belongs to x squared minus 16 is greater than

9
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:36,272
zero. I've graphed the parabola, y equals x squared minus 16, and I've graphed

10
00:00:36,272 --> 00:00:41,453
the line, y equals zero. Just the x-axis. Over here in coordinate plane b, I've

11
00:00:41,453 --> 00:00:46,096
graphed the parabola y equals x squared, and the line y equals 16.
