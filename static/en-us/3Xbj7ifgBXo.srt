1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:04,910
Problematic buying allows you to use
audience insights and technology.

2
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:08,160
To tailor messages to the right
person at the right moment

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,880
in the right context.

4
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:12,910
It was known in the past
as Real-time bidding.

5
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:16,810
As it helps you respond to Real-time
signals across screens and

6
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:18,400
across channels.

7
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,470
But today it's much more than Real
time-bidding, it's everything related to

8
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:26,960
media mind decisions, that is done by an
automatic system rather than manually.

9
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:31,620
For example, if a dog owner was
booking his travel online and

10
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:34,600
was interrupted in the middle
to take his dog for a walk.

11
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:38,620
Problematic buying can help set
an apartment to target this dog owner on

12
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:43,730
his phone and make sure he's booking his
apartment on his Smartphone on the go.

13
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:46,790
The secret here is to really
define your audience well.

14
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:47,960
If you do this successfully,

15
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,520
you're more likely to send them
the most relevant message.

16
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:56,940
Research has shown that when an ad is
delivered in real time to an individual,

17
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:58,980
they're twice as likely
to interact with it.
