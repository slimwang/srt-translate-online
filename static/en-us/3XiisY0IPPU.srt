00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,576
And, I hope no one panic. You could start coding if you're real confident. What

2
00:00:03,576 --> 00:00:06,366
I think you really should do at this point is work out some examples. Just to

3
00:00:06,366 --> 00:00:09,249
understand the Inputs and Outputs is not enough. We need to understand the

4
00:00:09,249 --> 00:00:12,116
relationship between the two and the best way to do that is to work out some

5
00:00:12,116 --> 00:00:16,077
examples. And, these are also going to give us some test cases to use to know if

6
00:00:16,077 --> 00:00:18,459
our program is correct. So, that's what we'll do next.
