00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:03,363
We've seen that if we have a constant function like y equals 1 it looks like

2
00:00:03,363 --> 00:00:08,326
this just a straight horizontal line. Now if we increase the degree of this by

3
00:00:08,326 --> 00:00:12,232
one, straighten out this is a zeroth degree polynomial, if we up it by one we

4
00:00:12,232 --> 00:00:16,390
get something like y equals x which takes that horizontal line and just rotates

5
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:22,795
it. Now it has a nonzero slope. Now if we increase the power by one more we get

6
00:00:22,795 --> 00:00:27,490
a parabola. A quadratic function. And we know if we increase it by one more

7
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:31,798
once again, we get this really cool cubic function. Now, you just saw your

8
00:00:31,798 --> 00:00:36,520
first higher order polynomial, in the last quiz. And I think that, we should

9
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:40,800
focus on one of these in particular for right now. Let's look at the graph of y

10
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,986
equals x to the 5th minus x. Let's just look at the overall appearance of this

11
00:00:44,986 --> 00:00:48,920
function. And then build up some information about polynomial functions in

12
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:52,785
general based on that. We saw a big picture of this graph earlier showing

13
00:00:52,785 --> 00:00:57,745
pretty big range on the y axis in a pretty big part of the domain on the x. But

14
00:00:57,745 --> 00:01:00,535
now I've zoomed into the middle where some of the most interesting stuff is

15
00:01:00,535 --> 00:01:04,950
happening. Remember that the ends of the graph, this way and this way, are just

16
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:07,824
sort of continuing on for a long time in the same direction. So it seems like

17
00:01:07,824 --> 00:01:11,790
all the changes are happening in here. Because this is the only area where

18
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:13,621
things are changing, we can split the domain into sections based on what's

19
00:01:13,621 --> 00:01:18,710
happening in here. Now I see one change happening right around here. And

20
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:21,697
another change happening right around here. So with these lines I have

21
00:01:21,697 --> 00:01:26,280
effectively divided the domain into three chunks. Three different intervals.

22
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:30,100
Now let's label these intervals interval one, interval two, and interval three.

23
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:34,600
It also seems like there are two special points. These two right here. I'll

24
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:39,644
color them in this bright blue color and label them points A and B. These are

25
00:01:39,644 --> 00:01:43,142
of course the points where these lines separating the parts the domain from one

26
00:01:43,142 --> 00:01:47,858
another intersect the graph of our function. So let's talk about what the graph

27
00:01:47,858 --> 00:01:52,290
looks like within each of these intervals and why these two points are special.

28
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:55,181
Now first of all, can you tell me in which of these intervals the graph is

29
00:01:55,181 --> 00:01:59,740
increasing? And which of them the graph is decreasing. And second which of

30
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:04,563
these two points is a relative maximum and which one is a relative minimum?
