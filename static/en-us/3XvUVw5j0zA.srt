Here we see the answers, and although neither of these sentences or the parses of these sentences are very good--

2
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:15,099
"raises raises interest rates" is an unusual sentence--it does seem clear that the parse tree on the left is better than the one on the right.

3
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:22,232
"Raises interest rates" is a very good verb phrase, and it's just "raises" is an unusual noun phrase for that.

4
00:00:22,233 --> 00:00:31,599
And so it seems proper that the probability here of .012% is 16 times higher than the probability

5
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:40,466
of this more unusual tree. Thus, it does seem like this idea of a probabilistic, context-free grammar is capturing something

6
00:00:40,467 --> 00:00:45,167
about what makes one parse tree better than another parse tree.
