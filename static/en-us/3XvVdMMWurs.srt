00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
In this unit, we look into spatially extended phenomena governed by partial

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
differential equations rather than the ordinary differential equations that we have seen so far.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Equilibria, again, played a vital role and we saw that solving partial differential equations

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
on the computer leads to severe numerical issues.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Next time, I'm going to give an overview on more advanced topics

6
00:00:25,000 --> 99:59:59,999
including some hands-on experiments.
