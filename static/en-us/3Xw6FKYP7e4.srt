00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,350
So Sebastian, this sounds really useful but really difficult.

2
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:06,610
Are you telling me I have to write a bunch of new features?

3
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:09,820
>> The cool thing about support vector machines is that you don't.

4
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:12,950
There's something called the kernel trick.

5
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:15,330
>> So are you going to explain the kernel trick to us?

6
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:19,030
I bet you are. >> No won't really, I'll just give you the gist of it.

7
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:23,140
There are functions that take a low dimensional input space or

8
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:28,670
feature space, and map it to a very high dimensional space.

9
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:33,470
So that what's used to be not linear separable and

10
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:35,040
turn this into a separable problem.

11
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:40,390
And without going into any detail, these functions are called kernels.

12
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:43,856
And I encourage you to check out in this, these aren't just functions with

13
00:00:43,856 --> 00:00:47,810
a feature space, these are functions over two inputs.

14
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:51,170
And when you apply the kernel trick to change your input space from x,y

15
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:56,400
to a much larger input space, separate the data point using support

16
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:01,909
vector machines, and then take the solution and go back to the original space.

17
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:05,180
You now have a non linear separation.

18
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:09,900
And this is the really cool thing about support vector machines.

19
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:14,610
You can take a very simple idea of finding the best linear separator, or

20
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:18,750
linear line between different classes, apply what's called the kernel trick

21
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:26,440
in a higher dimensional space, and what you effectively get is a very, very powerful

22
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:33,260
system to set datasets apart where the division line might be nonlinear.

23
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:34,300
That is really cool,

24
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:37,450
and one of the most central tricks in all of machine learning
