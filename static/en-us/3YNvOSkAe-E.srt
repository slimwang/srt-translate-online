1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,663
We can see that there's a common factor of 2 in all three terms here. Each of

2
00:00:04,663 --> 00:00:09,471
these is divisible by 2, so we can write 2 times a polynomial. The polynomial

3
00:00:09,471 --> 00:00:13,820
that we get when we divide each term by 2. That way when we redistribute

4
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:18,054
multiplication by 2 to each of these terms, we end up with the original

5
00:00:18,054 --> 00:00:22,311
expressions. We have 2 times the quantity x squared plus 6 x plus 5.
