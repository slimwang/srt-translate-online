1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:04,046
First we want to check to see if there's a greatest common factor other than 1,

2
00:00:04,046 --> 00:00:08,013
1 is the greatest common factor for all three terms, so we don't need to factor

3
00:00:08,013 --> 00:00:13,722
anything out. We want to find factors of negative 120 that sum to positive 14.

4
00:00:13,722 --> 00:00:18,632
Here's the start of a factor pair list. There are other factors for negative 120

5
00:00:18,632 --> 00:00:23,110
but I already found the one I need, negative 6 and positive 20. We can check

6
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:27,862
this real quick to make sure negative 6 times 20 multiplies to negative 120, and

7
00:00:27,862 --> 00:00:32,262
that they sum to positive 14. It's best to rewrite 14a with a negative term

8
00:00:32,262 --> 00:00:38,048
first. We finish out our problem by factoring by grouping, and these are two

9
00:00:38,048 --> 00:00:42,386
factors, 3a plus 4 and 5a minus 2. That's some great work if you got that one

10
00:00:42,386 --> 00:00:46,148
correct. If these are giving you trouble, stay with it. The more practice you

11
00:00:46,148 --> 00:00:50,453
do, the better you'll get at math. As you put in more effort, you will improve.
