1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,112
a plus b is x minus 4 plus 1 and a minus b is x minus 4 minus 1. Simplifying

2
00:00:04,112 --> 00:00:08,412
this gives us the quantity x minus 3 times the quantity x minus 5. Please note

3
00:00:08,412 --> 00:00:12,693
that this is exactly what we got when we factored. So really when compared to

4
00:00:12,693 --> 00:00:16,939
factoring completing the square was a lot of work in this case. But there are

5
00:00:16,939 --> 00:00:20,597
plenty of cases where we have expressions that we can't factor in which

6
00:00:20,597 --> 00:00:24,667
completing the Completing the square will actually help us. It'll make our lives

7
00:00:24,667 --> 00:00:27,832
easier. Here it wasn't really necessary because we could of factored the initial

8
00:00:27,832 --> 00:00:28,388
expression.
