1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,150
Google cast is all about
enabling multi-screen

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:04,980
experiences for the living room.

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:08,700
It uses a sender/receiver
topology that works like this.

4
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:12,790
You already have an app on Android,
iOS, or the web.

5
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:14,300
That's your sender.

6
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:17,080
You start by integrating the cast SDK

7
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:20,640
to enable discovery of cast
devices on the local network.

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,420
When your app finds a nearby device,

9
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:26,440
it makes the cast icon
visible to your users.

10
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:31,210
This nearby cast device could be
a Chromecast or even an AndroidTV.

11
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:32,729
It's the receiver.

12
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:35,680
The user will touch the cast
icon on the sender and

13
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,770
select the cast device to send or
cast stuff to the big screen.

14
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:44,550
What's actually happening here is
the sender's telling the cast device

15
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:47,720
to load a particular
receiver application.

16
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:52,880
The Cast device then pulls that in from
the web since it's just an HTML 5 app

17
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:56,550
written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

18
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:00,480
It could be a simple media receiver that
plays a stream directly from the cloud,

19
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,300
or a custom receiver such as a game.

20
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:05,230
You can also send messages from your app

21
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:10,210
to the receiver app to control things
like play, pause, volume and more.

22
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:11,160
And that's it.

23
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:13,990
A quick and
simple overview of Google Cast.

24
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:16,840
We'll cover more detail in
the Google Cast STK and

25
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,520
receiver apps a little later on.
