1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,806
For the first interval, we would have a negative infinity to negative three. We

2
00:00:03,806 --> 00:00:08,501
use parentheses on each end, since we don't include these values. The

3
00:00:08,501 --> 00:00:12,940
right-hand side would be four comma infinity. This would be the second

4
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:16,705
interval. Be sure to include parentheses here, because we can't include these

5
00:00:16,705 --> 00:00:21,374
two values. Nice work if you remembered interval notation. And, just to be even

6
00:00:21,374 --> 00:00:24,668
more certain that we're right, we can choose any number in either of these

7
00:00:24,668 --> 00:00:29,716
intervals, and they should check in our inequality. So, if I chose x equals 12,

8
00:00:29,716 --> 00:00:34,862
I know that's between 4 and positive infinity. So I could plug in 12 for x, and

9
00:00:34,862 --> 00:00:39,770
then I would get the value 120. We know 120 is greater than 0, which means that

10
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:44,287
this statement is true. This quick check just reinforces that we have the

11
00:00:44,287 --> 00:00:48,118
correct intervals on either side. It's usually a good idea to test a couple

12
00:00:48,118 --> 00:00:51,777
numbers to make sure that you have the correct interval.
