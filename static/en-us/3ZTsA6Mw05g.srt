00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:04,750
If it were up to me, I would use
reduce-scatter followed by all-gather.

2
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:05,814
Let's see why that works.

3
00:00:05,814 --> 00:00:08,690
Reduce-scatter will
perform the reduction,

4
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:10,625
leaving a piece of
the result everywhere.

5
00:00:10,625 --> 00:00:13,653
All-gather will collect
the results everywhere.

6
00:00:13,653 --> 00:00:18,165
All-gathers and reduce-scatters
are duals of one another.

7
00:00:18,165 --> 00:00:20,775
And since we have a bandwidth
optimal version of all-gather

8
00:00:20,775 --> 00:00:23,185
we have a bandwidth optimal
version of reduce-scatter.

9
00:00:23,185 --> 00:00:26,195
Their combination is therefore
also bandwidth optimal.
