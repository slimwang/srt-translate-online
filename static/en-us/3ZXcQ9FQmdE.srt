00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,019
Now, I don't know about you, but I think this manual bug hunting is a little bit

2
00:00:05,031 --> 00:00:09,892
tedious, so why don't we introduce you to some tools that will make our

3
00:00:09,904 --> 00:00:14,786
lives a little bit easier. All the major browsers have developer tools

4
00:00:14,798 --> 00:00:19,659
built into them that can help you with just the kind of problems that we are looking at,

5
00:00:19,671 --> 00:00:24,070
and then some. Now if you're watching this in Google Chrome, you can open

6
00:00:24,082 --> 00:00:28,405
the developer tools by moving over here, into Tools and

7
00:00:28,417 --> 00:00:32,705
clicking on Developer Tools. Now you can see that there's a handy little shortcut here. Depending on

8
00:00:32,717 --> 00:00:37,125
what platform you're on, that shortcut might be different. On Mac, it's Command

9
00:00:37,137 --> 00:00:42,065
Option I. And you can see that it opens up this console here and if we were to

10
00:00:42,077 --> 00:00:47,040
load our file with bugs into it, then you can see

11
00:00:47,052 --> 00:00:52,045
that it starts catching syntax errors. Now, it only goes so far, and then it just crashes,

12
00:00:52,057 --> 00:00:56,460
but you can see that it points us to the first syntax error here and then we can fix them as

13
00:00:56,472 --> 00:01:01,085
necessary. If we kept going with this by fixing this, let's say and then

14
00:01:01,097 --> 00:01:06,095
reloaded the page, you would see that it would get to the next error,

15
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:11,437
which is right in this for loop. Now, you notice that it skipped right over this error here:

16
00:01:11,479 --> 00:01:15,770
didn't even catch it because the way Javascript handles semicolons.
