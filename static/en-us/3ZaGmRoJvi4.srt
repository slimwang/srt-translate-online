1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,220
What makes a good feature?

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:06,270
So here, I have a picture just as an example.

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:11,510
The first thing is, it's called Repeatability/Precision.

4
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:14,740
The same feature should be found in several or

5
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:17,200
multiple images of the same scene.

6
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,970
Now, of course these aren't all the same picture.

7
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:22,650
Because, if I gave you 15 copies of the same picture.

8
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:25,290
This would be a really boring class, all right?

9
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:28,620
These are actually different pictures of the same scene, so

10
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:30,690
things change a little bit.

11
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:35,750
But despite those changes, I want to get the same points being identified, and

12
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:38,140
that's repeatability, and also.

13
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:39,820
I'd like it to be the active same point.

14
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:42,400
All right, so there's this little red dot on top of the camera,

15
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:43,280
there's one over here too.

16
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,810
I wonder which one I'm looking at.

17
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:46,560
See I'm going to make Megan cut back, and forth in her video.

18
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,940
Okay, the little red dot.

19
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:51,680
So that dot's a pretty good feature, because there's only two of them that I'm

20
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,700
looking at here, so I can find both of them, and

21
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:56,820
then matching will probably be easy to do and then they're very precise.

22
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:57,860
That is I'm not going to drift around,

23
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:00,110
I'm going to be able to find right on that dot.

24
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:03,540
The next thing is Salience or Matchability.

25
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:06,340
This is how distinctive the descriptor is.

26
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:11,460
So each feature should be able to be described uniquely enough

27
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:13,470
that it's easy to find it right.

28
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:16,430
So if I'm looking at a bunch of white dots on a black wall, and

29
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:18,570
they're all the same white dot.

30
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:21,960
That's really a problem, because that's the George, George, George, George,

31
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:26,070
George, right, everybody is named George, I can't find anybody, I just quit and

32
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:27,420
go home, all right?

33
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,580
So, you like to have a description that's different, about them.

34
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,530
Compactness and efficiency.

35
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:36,040
Another way of saying this is, don't get carried away.

36
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,590
You remember when we talked about computing the fundamental matrix,

37
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:43,540
we said well, I only need eight corresponding points, but

38
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:46,710
I mean maybe having a dozen or 20 of them might be better.

39
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:52,020
Maybe even 50, but 50 is much, much, much,

40
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:58,130
much, much, much, much, much smaller than the number of pixels in the image.

41
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:01,140
So, what I would really like to do is, in general, I don't want to have

42
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:03,810
a feature everywhere, although in this picture, there's a lot of them.

43
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:06,170
But you see, even here, it looks like there's a lot of them, but

44
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:09,270
I don't know, maybe there's a 100.

45
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:12,290
But there's tens of thousands of pixels here.

46
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:14,620
So, that's what it means by being compact and efficient.

47
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:18,180
And finally, Locality.

48
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:18,880
Locality is,

49
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:22,430
is not what you think if you think locality means exactly knowing where it is.

50
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:24,250
That was the precision.

51
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:29,080
Locality means that, the descriptor that I compute about the feature,

52
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:34,350
the description, the name, is based upon information that comes just.

53
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:37,300
From a pretty small area around the feature.

54
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:41,840
Now you might think that you know I'd like to take a nice big area

55
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,670
to describe it because that'll give me a nice very distinct description.

56
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:46,230
That's like a first name, and a second name, and

57
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:49,360
third name, and a fourth name would be giving me a very rich description.

58
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,330
The problem is and I'll try to find, oh yeah it's right over here.

59
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:53,940
So I'm looking at the side of this.

60
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,830
Now I'm I hope I'm still in the feed.

61
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:57,400
No, the camera moved!

62
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,740
I'm looking.

63
00:02:58,740 --> 00:02:59,450
Okay, good.

64
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:00,260
Thank you.

65
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:03,630
So I'm looking at the side of the, of the lens over here, and

66
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:09,560
the problem is if I take too much of the lens to describe what's going on,

67
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:12,300
as I move over here, and I start to get occluded.

68
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:14,370
A bunch of that neighborhood goes away.

69
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:15,640
That's the same thing when we had,

70
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:18,690
you know, a finger getting occluded a little bit by the other.

71
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:23,870
So since I'm trying to find matching pixels from different views, and

72
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:26,800
different views will cause a little bit of occlusion to change,

73
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,770
I don't want the neighborhood that I use to describe the, the,

74
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:31,880
to make the description to be too large.

75
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,590
And that's what locality means.

76
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:36,170
It makes us more robust to sort of clutter, and occlusion.
