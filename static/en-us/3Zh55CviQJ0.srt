00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:02,710
We covered a lot of
ground in this lesson.

2
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:04,140
You've learned about user research,

3
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:06,610
which allows you to figure
out what users' needs are,

4
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:10,270
what they say they want, and
how they use existing products.

5
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:14,570
>> We also learned about validating your
idea through market demands, trends, and

6
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:16,440
competitive analysis.

7
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,760
Sometimes, as you validate your
original idea might change or

8
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,120
be scrapped, and that's okay.

9
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:26,420
Like any good entrepreneur, you have
to continue validating your hunches.

10
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:28,360
>> Once you have a valided idea and

11
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:31,820
something users want, you'll need to
deliver a product to the end user.

12
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:33,850
We'll cover how to think
about your users and

13
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:36,320
how to design great experiences for
them in the next lesson.
