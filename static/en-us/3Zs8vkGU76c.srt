1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,700
I was able to get all of this
functionality in just 11 lines of code.

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:05,920
I'll show you what I did and

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:08,610
we'll see how your solution
matches up against mine.

4
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:11,590
Remember that the data is
stored in a model variable.

5
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:13,160
I'm going to get a copy of all of this,
so

6
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:16,100
I don't have to keep switching
back here to reference the data.

7
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:20,020
I switched in my code editor, and I have
the store handlebars template here, and

8
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,590
this scratch file with the data for
reference.

9
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:25,240
Read a section for
each one of these items.

10
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:29,060
Handlebars gives us the each block
to let us loop over information, but

11
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:30,570
what are we looping over?

12
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:33,280
Remember that this data
is stored in model.

13
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,970
So we're going to be looping over that.

14
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:38,530
The first time through the loop,
item will be this object.

15
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:41,040
The second time,
it'll be the blue bricks object, and

16
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,580
the third will be green.

17
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:46,010
Then it's just accessing
the properties off of the item object.

18
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:48,030
We also need to display
each of the bricks.

19
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:49,570
So that means another loop.

20
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:52,601
Notice that this is in each loop,
inside of another each loop.

21
00:00:52,601 --> 00:00:55,272
Handlebars can handle some
pretty complicated structures.

22
00:00:55,272 --> 00:00:59,840
To keep things organized, I put each
brick item in its own container div.

23
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,110
The template is now
displaying all content.

24
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:04,989
The last thing to do is handle
the bricks that are on sale.

25
00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:06,760
Since not all of them are on sale,

26
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:10,280
we need to check which ones are on
sale before adding the class.

27
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,960
So we'll use the if
conditional expression.

28
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,200
So if the item is on sale,
we'll give it the on sale class.

29
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,280
If it's not, then we don't do anything.

30
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,300
And that's it.

31
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:22,000
Once you learn the basics,
handlebars is an easy to write and

32
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,770
easy to read templating engine.

33
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:26,060
And it's baked right
into ember templates.

34
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:26,770
Pretty neat?
