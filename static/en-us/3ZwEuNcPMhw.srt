1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,090
First I look at the screen shot and
decide that since the,

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:06,180
these are in rows,
it looks like a vertical linear layout.

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:08,410
The second child though
is not a single view,

4
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:11,530
in fact that's a horizontal
linear layout of three views.

5
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:14,710
This is what the view hierarchy
diagram would look like.

6
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:19,300
We have a vertical linear layout as a
root view and five children under that.

7
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:23,050
The linear layout itself
has three children as well.

8
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:29,700
Once we have the diagram it's easy to
create this skeleton of XML code now.

9
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:32,009
The root view is a linear layout and

10
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:36,160
it contains a text view as its first
child followed by a linear layout

11
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,650
which has a button, text view,
and button inside of it.

12
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:42,560
And this is the closing tag for
the linear layout and

13
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:45,600
then we have the text view,
another text view, and a button.

14
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,230
Which are all children of
the parent linear layout.

15
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:52,230
From this XML we can go
in to Android Studio and

16
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:56,460
modify our existing layout
to look more like this.

17
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:00,310
In Android Studio I open up
activity main XML layout file.

18
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:03,039
We're going to make the changes
in place in this file so

19
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:06,335
that they match more closely
to our desired layout.

20
00:01:06,335 --> 00:01:08,700
The first child is a TextView.

21
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:09,880
That we already have.

22
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,350
And it's supposed to be
the quantity header.

23
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:15,190
Next we should have
a nested linear layout

24
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:17,680
that contains three views inside of it.

25
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,120
We don't have that yet, so let's add it.

26
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:23,215
I'm going to hit Enter and
then just start typing LinearLayout.

27
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:27,390
It also shows up as one of
the auto complete options.

28
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:29,020
So I can just hit okay.

29
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:32,100
Then it auto populates the attributes
that I should fill in.

30
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,610
Because width and height are required.

31
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,020
I set the width to be match_parent,
which will in turn

32
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:42,720
match the width of it's parent, and
this will match the width of the screen.

33
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,890
For layout height, I don't want to
set match_parent, otherwise,

34
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:49,970
it will push the other views
off the screen vertically.

35
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:51,820
So I'm just going to
say wrap_content here.

36
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,960
That way the LinearLayout will only
be as tall as the two buttons and

37
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,610
TextView inside of it.

38
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:02,690
Now, this closing tag should be
moved after all the children

39
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:04,060
of the LinearLayout have been added.

40
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:07,160
So that will go down here.

41
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,320
When you have children
inside of a view group,

42
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:12,050
you should indent
the children by four spaces.

43
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:15,630
I'm going to add a space here too
because I like to have a blank line in

44
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:17,090
between each XML element.

45
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:21,440
One more thing we're missing is setting
the orientation of this LinearLayout.

46
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:26,260
Earlier we decided that the LinearLayout
should be horizontal so

47
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:29,390
that the buttons and
the TextView appear horizontally.

48
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:30,979
Cool.
Now that matches what we wanted.

49
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:37,340
Next we have, two TextViews and a Button
which we already have in our layout.

50
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:39,010
So I think we're done.

51
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:41,860
If you wanted to check the design pane,
this is what it would look like.

52
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:47,100
We have a vertical linear layout
with five direct children and

53
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,880
this linear layout has
three more children.

54
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:52,120
Let's run it on our device
to see what happens.

55
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:55,740
So, this looks close to what we want but
not quite.

56
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:00,060
The quantity picker is appearing
horizontally, which is a good sign.

57
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:03,180
But we want the minus button on
the left hand side and the plus button

58
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:08,355
to be on the right hand side, as shown
In the screenshot of the desired layout.

59
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:11,675
Also, these buttons are tightly squeezed
up against the edge of this TextView.

60
00:03:11,675 --> 00:03:15,080
If I remember the screenshot correctly,
we also want eight dips of space on

61
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,851
the left-hand side and
right-hand side of this TextView.

62
00:03:18,962 --> 00:03:19,832
So let's add that now.

63
00:03:21,252 --> 00:03:22,972
Going back to the XML,

64
00:03:22,972 --> 00:03:26,702
I'm going to move the plus
button to be after the TextView.

65
00:03:26,702 --> 00:03:32,432
And then move the minus button
to be before the TextView.

66
00:03:32,432 --> 00:03:36,372
In a horizontal row, we should have
the minus button, followed by the two,

67
00:03:36,372 --> 00:03:38,252
followed by the plus button.

68
00:03:38,252 --> 00:03:41,320
We also want to add padding
around this TextView.

69
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:44,380
We could either add it as margin or
padding, but

70
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:46,376
I'm just going to do padding.

71
00:03:46,376 --> 00:03:48,959
And we'll set the value
to be eight dips.

72
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:50,543
Okay, great.

73
00:03:50,543 --> 00:03:53,602
Now I have a hunch that there's
a bunch of extra white spaces and

74
00:03:53,602 --> 00:03:56,026
the ordering of our
attributes may be incorrect,

75
00:03:56,026 --> 00:03:59,310
according to the android
code style guidelines.

76
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:02,860
So, in the menu at the top of
your screen, click on code and

77
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:04,890
then click on reformat code.

78
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:06,980
And also rearrange code.

79
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:09,120
And that should rearrange
all the attributes and

80
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,240
fix up all the formatting for
you automatically.

81
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:13,050
Okay, great.

82
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:13,930
Let's run the app again.

83
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:17,170
There.
That's better.

84
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:20,430
Now there's space around the two and
the minus button is on the left-hand

85
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:22,790
side and the plus button
is on the right-hand side.

86
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:24,668
[SOUND] it looks good.

87
00:04:24,668 --> 00:04:27,610
And then we also check
that it still works.

88
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:30,620
So, I'm going to pick an arbitrary
quantity and then order.

89
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:32,035
And that looks correct.

90
00:04:32,035 --> 00:04:37,890
[SOUND] that was a long journey to get
this quantity picker on the screen.

91
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:40,110
All right.
The app is looking really good.

92
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:43,390
But so far, I've only showed you
how to show numbers on the screen.

93
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:45,370
What if you want to show
text on the screen?

94
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:47,590
Keep watching to find out.
