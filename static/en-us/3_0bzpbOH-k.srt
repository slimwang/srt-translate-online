00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:06,104
Let's consider our first equation again with x, y and z. This time let's solve

2
00:00:06,104 --> 00:00:11,490
our equation for x. We can think about cross multiplying or by multiplying both

3
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:17,516
sides by x plus y. We distribute the z to get zx plus zy equals 1x. And now

4
00:00:17,516 --> 00:00:21,345
here's where we might get stuck trying to solve for x. Notice that x is on

5
00:00:21,345 --> 00:00:26,205
different sides of the equation. We need to move all the x terms to one side of

6
00:00:26,205 --> 00:00:30,622
the equation, so that way we can isolate it on one side. Any term that doesn't

7
00:00:30,622 --> 00:00:34,402
contain x should be on the other side of the equation. So let's do some

8
00:00:34,402 --> 00:00:39,418
rearranging. What would be an equivalent equation for this one, out of these

9
00:00:39,418 --> 00:00:40,125
choices?
