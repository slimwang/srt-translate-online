00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,703
Please take a minute to look at the
placement of each letter. There are a few

2
00:00:04,715 --> 00:00:09,657
numbers you may have wanted to place in
several positions. For example, you may

3
00:00:09,669 --> 00:00:14,592
have been tempted to write 3 as an
integer, as a whole number, and of course

4
00:00:14,604 --> 00:00:19,452
a natural number. However, the correct
placement on the graph is for the number

5
00:00:19,464 --> 00:00:24,665
to be placed in the smallest circle it can
be placed in. Remember, by placing a

6
00:00:24,677 --> 00:00:30,185
number in the smallest circle, you are
placing it in all of the larger circles

7
00:00:30,197 --> 00:00:32,630
that surround the smallest circle.
