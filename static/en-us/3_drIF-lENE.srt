1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,420
So, let's say we have something like 26 applications

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:06,140
in a benchmark suite. How do we summarize the

3
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:09,000
overall performance of a machine on the entire suite?

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,793
So we want a single number that represents the performance

5
00:00:11,793 --> 00:00:15,493
of the machine. Usually, we want to use something

6
00:00:15,493 --> 00:00:19,168
like the average execution time. So let's say we have

7
00:00:19,168 --> 00:00:22,108
a computer X and a computer Y, a benchmark

8
00:00:22,108 --> 00:00:25,720
application A, B and C and let's say that computer

9
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:28,744
X takes 9 seconds here, 10 seconds here

10
00:00:28,744 --> 00:00:31,852
and 5 seconds here, whereas the computer Y

11
00:00:31,852 --> 00:00:35,212
takes 18 seconds here, 7 seconds here, and

12
00:00:35,212 --> 00:00:38,852
11 seconds here. The speed up of machine

13
00:00:38,852 --> 00:00:44,536
X over machine Y on each of these applications is two for application A

14
00:00:44,536 --> 00:00:50,906
because X is doing it in half the time as Y, 0.7 on application B because X is

15
00:00:50,906 --> 00:00:57,140
actually slower than Y there. And here is 2.2 because X is more than

16
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:03,300
twice as fast as Y. Now let's compute the average execution time. Here we have

17
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:09,970
9 plus 10 plus 5 over 3, gives us 8 seconds. So on average, computer X finishes

18
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:16,260
one of these three applications in 8 seconds. On average, computer Y finishes

19
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:22,290
one of these three in 18 plus 7 plus 11 over 3, 12 seconds.

20
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:28,190
If we now compute the speedup of X over Y, on average it will be 1.5 when

21
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:35,506
computed this way. But if we average the speedups here, we get 1.63. So if we

22
00:01:35,506 --> 00:01:38,318
want to use average execution times, we can

23
00:01:38,318 --> 00:01:41,282
not simply average the speed ups on individual

24
00:01:41,282 --> 00:01:44,610
applications to get the average speed up. Pretty

25
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:48,130
much the speed up using average execution times

26
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:50,280
is not the same as the average of

27
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:53,972
speed ups on these individual applications. If we want

28
00:01:53,972 --> 00:01:59,432
to be able to average speed ups, then we need to use geometric means for both of

29
00:01:59,432 --> 00:02:02,960
our application execution times and for our speed

30
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,459
ups. In that case we get a geometric mean

31
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:15,110
of 7.66 here, 11.15 here, and 1.456 here. So we have used the geometric mean for

32
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,460
the execution times for each of the computers. If we use the geometric mean for

33
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:25,730
these speed ups, we will get the same value here. The geometric mean is computed

34
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:28,850
by multiplying out, for example, 9 times 10

35
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:31,540
times 5, and then taking the nth root,

36
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:34,260
in this case 3rd root of the value, to

37
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:37,772
get the geometric mean. And because things are being

38
00:02:37,772 --> 00:02:40,546
multiplied out and then the nth root taken you

39
00:02:40,546 --> 00:02:43,466
can see how, if we divide these things, we will

40
00:02:43,466 --> 00:02:46,459
get that the speed of computed geometric means of

41
00:02:46,459 --> 00:02:49,233
execution times will be the same as the mean of

42
00:02:49,233 --> 00:02:51,934
the speed ups, because we have third root of

43
00:02:51,934 --> 00:02:56,680
18 times 7 times 11. These two divided is the

44
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:04,765
same as third root of 9 over 18, times 10 over 7 times 5 over

45
00:03:04,765 --> 00:03:09,928
11. So as you can see this is the geometric mean of execution times, then we

46
00:03:09,928 --> 00:03:12,880
can compute the speedup using them, and that's

47
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:15,544
the same as the geometric mean of individual

48
00:03:15,544 --> 00:03:18,610
speed ups. However this only works for geometric

49
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:22,070
means. We do prefer average execution time when

50
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:25,878
we're computing the average times. However, just

51
00:03:25,878 --> 00:03:28,386
you must be careful not to compute individual

52
00:03:28,386 --> 00:03:31,106
speed ups and then average them. Instead,

53
00:03:31,106 --> 00:03:34,362
you should be computing the average execution times

54
00:03:34,362 --> 00:03:36,656
and then computing the speed up using

55
00:03:36,656 --> 00:03:41,060
those averages. You should also remember that simple

56
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:47,340
average should not be used on ratios of times. So basically a speed up here is

57
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:50,770
a ratio of two times. We should not be using a

58
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:53,670
simple arithmetic mean on these values

59
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:56,180
because they're ratios. Geometric means, on

60
00:03:56,180 --> 00:04:00,200
the other hand, can be used on ratios, but, for this to

61
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:03,180
work, we also have to do the geometric mean on times, too.
