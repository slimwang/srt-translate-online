1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,410
To understand the value of technical
analysis versus fundamental,

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:07,060
it's valuable to consider
the trading horizon.

3
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:09,840
In other words when you buy a stock and

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,400
sell it, what's the time period
between those two activities.

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,030
So, it can be milliseconds,
maybe even smaller time periods.

6
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:21,470
It can be days or it can be years.

7
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:26,430
So, for instance, Warren Buffett
often buys and holds stocks for

8
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:30,750
years, high frequency traders are
trading on the order of milliseconds.

9
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:36,080
So to illustrate what I mean,
consider Fundamental factors.

10
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:41,570
If we are trading over a time period
of milliseconds How much do fundamental

11
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:46,620
factors contribute to the change in
price over those short periods of time?

12
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:50,360
When we're trading machines
on the stock exchange,

13
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:53,090
what really matters is what's
happening there on the stock exchange.

14
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:57,050
For instance, the order book or
momentum and so on.

15
00:00:57,050 --> 00:00:59,460
So at these short time periods,

16
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,390
Fundamental factors
really have low value.

17
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:06,080
Now consider all the way out to years,
we know from, for

18
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,440
instance, Warren Buffet's success,
that fundamental

19
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:14,270
factors over long periods of
time may have significant value.

20
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:15,220
What about days?

21
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:19,700
Well, maybe over a period of days
Fundamental factors do have value.

22
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:22,620
So, imagine that we sort
of chart it like this.

23
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:27,340
Over long periods of time, fundamental
factors provide a lot of value.

24
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,290
Consider the same sort of chart now,
but for technical factors.

25
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:36,000
Let's start out over here,
over many years.

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,990
Think about if we make
a technical analysis of a stock,

27
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:45,130
what it's 20 day momentum is which
we'll talk about in a moment.

28
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:49,830
How much is that really going to affect
the price of a stock years later.

29
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:50,760
Very little.

30
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:55,920
So over long terms technical
analysis is not so valuable.

31
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,400
Think back now to very very
short periods of time.

32
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,730
This is where technical
analysis can shine, and

33
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:04,990
it potentially has high value
over very short periods of time.

34
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:11,000
So we have a chart that looks a lot like
the fundamental chart, but it's swapped.

35
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,940
Let's consider a couple other factors.

36
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:17,580
I won't draw the charts like these,
but just think about these.

37
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:20,630
So consider for instance,
decision complexity.

38
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:22,290
How complex is the decision to buy or

39
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:26,170
sell a stock if you're
going to hold it for years.

40
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:28,170
Becomes more complex this way.

41
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:30,840
How about decision speed?

42
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,550
How fast do the decisions
have to be made?

43
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:36,527
Well, certainly, we have to be
able to make the decisions really,

44
00:02:36,527 --> 00:02:39,590
really fast if we're trading
at the millisecond level.

45
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:42,730
And of course we can take
a long time to make a decision

46
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:45,410
if we're going to buy and
hold for years.

47
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:49,720
So as you look across this spectrum,
consider where is the best region for

48
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:53,800
humans to operate and where is the best
region for computers to operate?

49
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:57,420
Well, because at this
very high frequency

50
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:00,380
the complexity of decisions is simple.

51
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:04,480
Computers can make this decisions very,
very fast and that also happens to

52
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:09,340
be where technical analysis has value
which is the domain of the computer.

53
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:12,920
So computers excel in
this region of the chart.

54
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:18,290
Over here where we can take a long
time ti make a decision and

55
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:20,440
the decisions are complex.

56
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:24,020
This is the best region for
human investors.

57
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:28,690
So, if you look at different types of
hedge funds the high frequency trading

58
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:32,200
computer driven hedge funds
are operating over here.

59
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:36,860
The insight driven, human based
hedge funds are operating over here.

60
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:39,980
And then there's this region in
the middle where we often see humans and

61
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:41,280
computers working together.
