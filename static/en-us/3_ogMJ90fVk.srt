1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So to prepare for watching these lectures, of course, you'll be just to hit the play button

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
but actually it would be helpful, if you actually do some reading.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
And as I said earlier, there's optional reading and you'll see this going forward

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
after each lecture and a Starup Owner's Manual pp. 1-50 or in the strategy volume if it's an E-book.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:24,000
And in Business Model Generation pp 14-49, completely optional.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
But what's available for free is if you want to get a feel of the core strategy

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
how we're trying to teach this and how we teach this in real life,

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
you could go to steveblank.com category/Lean LaunchPad or just click on the link.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
You could also look at other student's presentations and we have our students

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
make 2-min quick time videos which are summaries of their presentations as well

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:52,000
and you could see those at steveblank.com/slides but if you want to actively engage in the class,

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
your first real homework is download that Osterwalder canvas and using yellow stickies,

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
take a shot at actually filling out all your hypothesis on the business model canvass.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
It's okay if you're just guessing because the whole class is about

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
how do you turn those guesses into facts.

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:16,000
So get ready, download the canvas, put on those yellow stickies, and then looking at those boxes,

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:24,000
start figuring out who would you call on and who would you contact to start testing those hypothesis

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
and take a look for the first week at your value proposition and customer segment box.

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Who would you want to talk to, to validate whether your idea about what features are important

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
and who would you talk to, to validate that these are customers you want to go after

21
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
and we're just getting you ready for the work you're going to do after the next lecture.

22
00:01:43,000 --> 99:59:59,999
See you soon!
