1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:04,800
Okay, so let's figure out what these
two steps would look like in code.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:09,040
So the first one is you're taking the
score for team A and you're changing it.

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,100
And I'm just going to say
changing it for now, and

4
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:14,560
we'll figure out what we
change it to in a second.

5
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:16,309
You'd have this variable.

6
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:18,520
And whenever you want to change
the value of this variable,

7
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:21,020
you need to use the assignment operator.

8
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:23,260
And then you can figure out
what you're changing it to.

9
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:26,560
Well, you're increasing it by 3.

10
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:31,207
Which means that you're taking whatever
is currently in Score Team A and

11
00:00:31,207 --> 00:00:32,800
adding 3 to it.

12
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,060
So two things are analogous.

13
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:37,400
Increasing by 3 and
taking the current value and adding 3.

14
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,710
So, if we take the current value and

15
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:44,936
we could get that by just writing
the name of the variable.

16
00:00:44,936 --> 00:00:48,585
Addition symbol and 3.

17
00:00:48,585 --> 00:00:52,385
We are increasing the current
value of Score Team A by 3.

18
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:55,415
And of course, end with a semicolon.

19
00:00:56,465 --> 00:01:00,630
Now I'm not putting an INT here because
this variable has already been declared.

20
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:02,550
We did that a few videos ago.

21
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:04,040
It'll be more clear when
we look at the code.

22
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:07,560
Anyways for
now let's quickly do this next step.

23
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:12,280
So to display the score I need to use
the display method that I copied over.

24
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:16,970
So before I was just
telling it to display 3.

25
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:19,140
But I don't want to
display the number 3.

26
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:22,180
I want to display whatever
value is in Score Team A.

27
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:27,290
So what I actually should
put here is Score Team A.

28
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:33,510
Okay, and I don't want to forget
my parenthesis or my semi-colon.

29
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:36,930
All right, let's put this in the code
and make sure that everything works.

30
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,530
So here I am in my java code.

31
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:44,840
And I'm going to go scroll down
to this addThree forTeamA method,

32
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:49,310
because this is the code that happens
whenever I press the plus three button.

33
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:52,820
All right, I'm going to remove this for
now because this is old code.

34
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:54,900
And I'm going to perform my two steps.

35
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:59,010
The first one was to take
the variable scoreTeamA and

36
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:07,250
set it equal to its old value plus 3.

37
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:09,139
Okay, this is the increase
by three step.

38
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:14,540
And then the second step after
that is to display it and

39
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:19,472
when I say it,
I mean the variable score, Team A.

40
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:22,800
Okay, so there are my two steps.

41
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:27,620
Okay, moment of truth,
let's hit plus 3 points.

42
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:30,225
Okay, it increased to 3.

43
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:38,360
It's kind of small but it increased
to 6, 9, 12, 15, okay, awesome.

44
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,040
This seems to be working.

45
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,890
Now, these other ones don't work,
but we didn't expect them to.
