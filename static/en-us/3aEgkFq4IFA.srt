1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:02,350
There's a lot to remember
when using the terminal.

2
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:03,320
You can't just click around and

3
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:06,060
explore menus like you can
with a graphical program.

4
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:08,060
This doesn't mean that you need
to remember every command and

5
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:09,320
every option though.

6
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:12,500
Looking things up is a regular part
of the terminal user's workflow.

7
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:15,100
In fact, it's normal to forget
the details of commands you don't

8
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:16,510
use frequently.

9
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:19,930
Cowsay is an example of a program
with a bunch of options.

10
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:23,810
By default, cowsay draws a cow,
but you can customize it too.

11
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:28,890
For example, by using the -e argument,
we can replace its eyes with carets.

12
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:31,430
We can also draw a penguin
instead of a cow.

13
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:34,200
So, how do we keep up
with all these options?

14
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,130
Fortunately, all common shell
programs come with a manual,

15
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:40,820
and there's a command that makes
it easy to read them, man.

16
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:45,090
Manual entries are called man pages,
and this is cowsay's man page.

17
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:47,250
Man pages follow a common format.

18
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:49,800
The first section includes
the command's name and

19
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,700
a brief description of the command.

20
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:53,730
The next section is the synopsis.

21
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:57,110
The synopsis explains how to use
the command's flags and arguments.

22
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:59,760
Options surrounded by square
brackets are optional.

23
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,750
In this case,
all of cowsay's options are optional.

24
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:05,150
Some options require
additional information.

25
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:10,180
For example, if you use the -e flag,
you also need to supply an eye_string.

26
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:13,230
The description describes all
of the options in detail.

27
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:16,088
Man pages vary in how they
present this information.

28
00:01:16,088 --> 00:01:18,048
Some man pages alphabetize their option,

29
00:01:18,048 --> 00:01:20,970
while cowsay's man page
is a bit less organized.

30
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:24,186
You can use the arrow keys to
scroll up and down the man page.

31
00:01:24,186 --> 00:01:27,182
The later sections of the man page
include more detailed information about

32
00:01:27,182 --> 00:01:28,500
the command.

33
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,540
Man pages are typically arranged so

34
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:33,270
that the most important
details are near the top.

35
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:36,230
When you're done referencing the manual,
you can press q to exit.
