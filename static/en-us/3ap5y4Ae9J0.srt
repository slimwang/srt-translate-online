00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Let me modify my question and let me say this time I expressed things

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
in terms of standard deviations and not variances.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Each of these has a standard deviation of 10 m.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:16,000
You ought to know that the combined Âµ will be 200 m, but what about the new standard deviation.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 99:59:59,999
You can actually calculate this and give me at least an approximate answer.
