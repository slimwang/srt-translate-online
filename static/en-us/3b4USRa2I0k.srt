1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,350
How about a really, really simple model?

2
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:03,930
Would you like a really simple model?

3
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:07,070
Well, of course, you would because who
wants a complicated model if you can

4
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:08,029
have a simple model?

5
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:08,690
All right.

6
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:12,460
Suppose we just start off with a patch,
a location at some point: x, y.

7
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:13,775
All right.

8
00:00:13,775 --> 00:00:14,905
So, we're going to say, all right.

9
00:00:14,905 --> 00:00:19,965
I've got some patch at x, y, and
my dynamics is going to be random noise.

10
00:00:19,965 --> 00:00:22,435
So what that means is, is that's
the same model that they use for

11
00:00:22,435 --> 00:00:23,575
the head contour.

12
00:00:23,575 --> 00:00:24,845
We're not going to track velocity,

13
00:00:24,845 --> 00:00:28,713
we're just going to assume that
the position changes randomly.

14
00:00:28,713 --> 00:00:31,850
Okay, so as you add your particles
you assume zero velocity so

15
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:35,520
they stay where they are and
you would add random noise.

16
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,925
And then, how about the very
simplest of sensor models.

17
00:00:38,925 --> 00:00:42,040
Okay, you just take the mean
square difference, right?

18
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:46,790
So what this says is if I propose that
the state of the object is here, and

19
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:49,520
it, it used to be here,
I'm just going to compare the patch.

20
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,710
I'm literally going to
subtract the two patches, and

21
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:54,630
say what's the mean squared error.

22
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:55,450
Okay?
That would be,

23
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:58,140
sort of the simplest
sensor model possible.

24
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:00,510
You could do a slightly more
sophisticated one, right?

25
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:02,280
You could do a normalized correlation.

26
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,400
You've already learned about
this when we did stereo.

27
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,680
And you could say the higher
the correlation the more likely or

28
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:11,860
the bigger the sum of the square
differences the less likely.

29
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:14,180
That would be your simp, sensor model.

30
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:17,360
So to this,
all you would need is a patch.

31
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,790
So there's a patch.

32
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:21,970
So those of you who are from
the United States or know U.S.

33
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:23,920
politics, that's Mitt Romney.

34
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,528
The reason I'm showing you this is
that we provided to the students who

35
00:01:27,528 --> 00:01:31,197
are going to be doing problem sets in,
in the original class I'm going and

36
00:01:31,197 --> 00:01:33,050
the OMS class a video.

37
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:33,730
Okay?

38
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:37,910
And this is the patch, grabbed out
of a section of one of the frames.

39
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:42,360
And your goal is to see with a particle
filter, how long can you track

40
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:47,300
Mitt Romney until he until it falls
off and he loses the election.
