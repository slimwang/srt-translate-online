1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,330
So we talked to Rich Fulcher, a design-minded

2
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:04,460
developer on the Android team at Google. So

3
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:05,870
he's going to tell us a little bit about

4
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:08,635
personas and use cases, and basically blow our minds.

5
00:00:08,635 --> 00:00:09,940
>> [LAUGH]

6
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:13,890
>> Hi, I'm Rich Fulcher. I started my career with a

7
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:17,510
Master's degree in Computer Science and was programming computer graphics for

8
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:21,280
quite a while. But then I switched over and I became

9
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:25,390
a designer. And now I'm a designer and manager as part

10
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:28,410
of the Android team here at Google. I think there's a

11
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:31,950
huge temptation at the start of a project to just kind of

12
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:34,270
get going and do the thing you want to do the most. You

13
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:36,780
know, when you're a designer, you want to start drawing. When you're a

14
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:41,150
developer you want to start building out those APIs, or start coding, or

15
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:44,310
kind of get to that first screen. But you want to temper

16
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:47,990
that, you can do that and it's okay to engage with that

17
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:50,580
kind of passion you have for what you do, but you also

18
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:52,790
want to make sure that you're, you're building in the right

19
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:55,590
direction, the only way you can do that is to be aware

20
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:58,820
of the users. So you need to start thinking, you know, who

21
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:01,850
is this audience that I'm building this thing for? It can't just

22
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:04,920
be me, it's gotta be much bigger than that. So, how can

23
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:08,140
I understand them, how can I make sure that the things I'm

24
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:12,880
excited about, these use cases that I'm thinking about, really line up

25
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,930
with what their goals, and what the needs of the user are?

26
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:18,050
So, one way that you can think about users

27
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:20,900
is through the use of a persona. You know, just

28
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:26,080
trying to build out your model of how this

29
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,880
person other than yourself, you know, one of your users

30
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:33,980
just more information about them and kind of what their goals

31
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:36,840
and what their contexts of use are. When you have those

32
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,490
personas the next step is to really think about well, how

33
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:43,260
do they act with your product? And one way you capture

34
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:46,570
that, them completing a task, is through a use case. You

35
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:49,100
know, what are the steps they go through to complete a

36
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:52,370
specific sub-goal? So you have your personas, and you have your

37
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:56,310
use cases. How do they influence the way you treat development?

38
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:59,300
Well, something I do is I try to refer to

39
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:02,100
those personas by name whenever I can. Or I try

40
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:05,100
to talk to the specific use cases. And if I'm

41
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,827
talking just about myself and my opinions, I'll make a

42
00:02:07,827 --> 00:02:11,160
distinction by just repeating the word I. I'll say, well,

43
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:14,540
I, I, I think this. To make a clear kind

44
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:17,450
of gulf between what I personally think, and what I

45
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:20,620
as a designer representing these personas, think should be true.
