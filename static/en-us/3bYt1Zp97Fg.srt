00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:03,260
As I said,
there's no correct answer per se.

2
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:06,720
So what would I have said if I
were in your shoe or pajamas or

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,600
whatever it is you're wearing right now?

4
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:09,805
Maybe I would've said this.

5
00:00:09,805 --> 00:00:14,800
Two-way merging does a lousy job
of utilizing fast memory capacity.

6
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:18,880
Remember, the merging procedure only
works on pairs of arrays at a time,

7
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:23,390
and it just needs one block of
size L of fast memory per pair.

8
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:27,010
So it's very sensitive to L, but
it's not at all sensitive to Z.

9
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:31,679
Hm, someone ought to fix that,
I'm looking at you.

10
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:32,179
Yes, you, I'm looking at you.

11
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:38,944
Hello, it is I.
