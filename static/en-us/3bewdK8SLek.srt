00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Now, let's look at the solution for a problem concerning waning immunity.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
First things first, the constant waning time should be defined as 2 times the infectious time.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
We can show this mathematically using the equations we have for the

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
derivatives of S, I, and R with their respective time.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
We know that after a long period of time you want to attain a steady state situation

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
and there's a number of people in each portion to the population--

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
susceptible, infected, and recover stays constant.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Since they want to find out how long people should spend in the recovered stage,

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
we start with the time derivative of R and set that equal to zero.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Since you know that Rdot now has an extra term added to it or actually subtracted from it

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
showing the number of people that are leaving the recovered population

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
and going back to the infected population.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
We can set these to terms right here equal to zero as well.

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Just to note, I've used CINF to stand for the infectious time

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
and CWAN to stand for the waning time.

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Now with just a little bit of Algebra, we come up with the answer that R=2I.

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Since we know that we want the number of recovered people to be twice the number

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
of infected people, we can plug in this extra information to the equation above

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
and end up with the answer that the waning time is equal to twice the infectious time.

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
This put us directly into the next part of the problem.

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
We defined R to S in the same way that I to R is defined except that we replace infectious time

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
as the waning time and I step with R step as you can see right here.

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Then moving on to our recursive relations, for each element in a step plus one position,

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
we need to take into account the value of the previous element in the number of people

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
added and subtracted from the population during each time step.

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
We know that the one thing that has changed in this model from the standard SIR model

27
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
is that people are now moving from the recovered population back to the susceptible population.

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:55,000
This is why we've needed to add in this extra term R to S, which we subtract from R and add to S.

29
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Now, let's run the program and see what we get.

30
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Here we see we end up with this fancy graph,

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
which has three different series for the three different parts of the population we're looking at.

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Remembering how we set the initial values for S, I, and R.

33
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Remember that the blue line here stands for the susceptible population.

34
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
The green line stands for the infected population,

35
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
and the red line stands for the recovered population.

36
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
And the maximum time that we're looking at 60 days,

37
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
you can see that the red line is graphing twice as many people over here

38
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
as the green line is marking, which is exactly the answer that we wanted to end up with.

39
00:02:30,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Congratulations on successfully completing the first problem of Unit 3.
