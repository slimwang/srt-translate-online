1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,393
We know this value inside needs to be greater than 7 or this value inside can be

2
00:00:04,405 --> 00:00:08,947
less than negative 7. Remember to catch that inequality sign, we have to reverse

3
00:00:08,959 --> 00:00:13,402
it for the negative answer. We can subtract 1 from both sides and then divide by

4
00:00:13,414 --> 00:00:17,658
2. So x is greater than 3. That's one part of our solution. For the other

5
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:22,659
inequality, I subtract 1 from both sides, then divide by 2, so x is less than

6
00:00:22,671 --> 00:00:27,831
negative 4. On a number line, we have x greater than 3, and x less than negative

7
00:00:27,843 --> 00:00:33,099
4. Remember, any number in either region, this region or this region, will work

8
00:00:33,111 --> 00:00:38,003
for my inequality. If x is any value in here or any value in here the condition

9
00:00:38,015 --> 00:00:42,395
is satisfied. In the interval notation we'd have negative infinity comma

10
00:00:42,407 --> 00:00:46,994
negative 4. We use parenthesis because we can include these values. Then the

11
00:00:47,006 --> 00:00:51,370
union because you want this or this region other than 3 to positive infinity

12
00:00:51,382 --> 00:00:55,325
again with parenthesis. If you got that one right, excellent work.
