We've already found one of the factors of our original polynomial. So, what

2
00:00:04,273 --> 00:00:08,680
should be our next step in continuing this factoring process? Should we factor

3
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:12,396
by grouping for the polynomial inside the parenthesis? In other words, should

4
00:00:12,396 --> 00:00:15,654
be factor the first two terms and then the second two terms? Should we

5
00:00:15,654 --> 00:00:19,634
distribute multiplication by x to all the terms inside the parenthesis? Should

6
00:00:19,634 --> 00:00:23,944
we combine like terms? Should we divide both sides of the equation by X? Or

7
00:00:23,944 --> 00:00:27,220
should we find factors of negative 13 and 2, and then apply the rational zero

8
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:28,489
theorem?
