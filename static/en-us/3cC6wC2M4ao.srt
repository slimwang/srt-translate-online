1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
In this question, we assume that a particle,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
'A', has a already normalized importance

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
weight of 0.2.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
So there might be other particles,

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
we don't even care how many.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
But their importance weights add up to 0.8.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
We now sample 3 new particles,

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
with replacement.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
What is the probability that this particle, 'A',

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
is sampled at least once?

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
And the way you derive this is by asking

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
the question, what's the probability

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
that particle 'A' is never sampled?

14
00:00:33,000 --> 99:59:59,999
And then you take the compliment of this.
