00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,740
Now we're going to go through
a series of languages and

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:06,470
try to figure out if they and
their compliments are recognizable.

3
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:09,770
First, let's examine the set of strings
that describe a turning machine that

4
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:11,190
has at most a 100 states.

5
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:15,980
You can assume the particular encoding
for turning machines that we used, but

6
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:20,530
any encoding will serve
the same purpose.

7
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:24,026
Indicate whether you think
that L is recognizable.

8
00:00:24,026 --> 00:00:26,236
And whether you think L
complement is recognizable.

9
00:00:26,236 --> 00:00:29,265
Now we don't have a way of proving yet
that a language is not recognizable, so

10
00:00:29,265 --> 00:00:31,050
I've labeled the no
option also as unclear.
