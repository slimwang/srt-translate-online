1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:00,860
All right guys.

2
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:02,040
Fantastic.

3
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:04,570
Now, I think you've got
the tools you need to detect and

4
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:06,560
track vehicles in a video stream.

5
00:00:06,559 --> 00:00:07,569
So Arpin.

6
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:08,460
Could you remind us again?

7
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:11,130
What are the steps we need to
do to get started on a project?

8
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:11,800
>> Sure.

9
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:14,760
First you need to decide
what features to use.

10
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:18,839
You'll want to try some combination
of color and gradient based features.

11
00:00:18,839 --> 00:00:21,910
But keep in mind that this might
require some experimentation

12
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:23,329
to decide what works best.

13
00:00:24,329 --> 00:00:27,829
Next, you'll need to choose and
train a classifier.

14
00:00:27,829 --> 00:00:31,939
A linear SVM is probably your best bet
for an ideal combination of speed and

15
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:33,050
accuracy.

16
00:00:33,049 --> 00:00:36,859
But you are encouraged to experiment
with other classifiers, as well.

17
00:00:36,859 --> 00:00:37,600
Awesome.

18
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,250
So, Drew.

19
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:40,179
Maybe you could tell us,
then, what happens next.

20
00:00:40,179 --> 00:00:42,340
We've chosen features and
trained a classifier.

21
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:43,460
Then what do we do?

22
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:46,597
>> Well, next, you'll implement
a sliding window technique to search for

23
00:00:46,597 --> 00:00:48,359
vehicles in some test images.

24
00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:49,960
You can try multiscale search or

25
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,299
different tiling schemes
to see what works best.

26
00:00:52,299 --> 00:00:55,509
But keep in mind, you'd like to
minimize the number of search windows.

27
00:00:55,509 --> 00:00:58,689
So, for example, you probably don't
need to search for cars in the sky and

28
00:00:58,689 --> 00:00:59,879
the treetops.

29
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,609
Once you've got a working
detection pipeline,

30
00:01:01,609 --> 00:01:03,159
you'll try it on a video stream.

31
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:05,539
And implement tracking to follow,
detect vehicles.

32
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:07,340
And reject spurious detections.

33
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:07,859
>> Awesome.

34
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:08,549
Well, alright then.

35
00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:09,629
Let's get started on the project
