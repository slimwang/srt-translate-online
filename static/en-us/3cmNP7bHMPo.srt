00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:05,564
The quantity 4x plus 5 squared is correct. Fantastic work if you got that one

2
00:00:05,564 --> 00:00:09,670
right. We can see that this expression fits this first factoring pattern. We

3
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:13,428
have a perfect square trinomial. The first term is a perfect square, a 4x

4
00:00:13,428 --> 00:00:18,044
squared, and the last term is a perfect square, a 5 squared. So the a term is

5
00:00:18,044 --> 00:00:24,850
really 4x and the b term is really 5. So to write my factor form, I simply write

6
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:27,163
4x plus 5 and then square it.
