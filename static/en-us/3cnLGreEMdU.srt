Let's put our new understanding of transforming functions to use, and try to

2
00:00:03,888 --> 00:00:08,693
graph some interesting equations. If we take the function f of x equals

3
00:00:08,693 --> 00:00:12,937
negative x minus one cubed. We can compare it to the function f of x equals x

4
00:00:12,937 --> 00:00:16,528
cubed, to help us figure out how this function might look when it's graphed,

5
00:00:16,528 --> 00:00:22,460
since we already know what this one looks like. So, first things first. What is

6
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:26,590
the minus 1 right here doing? Please fill in this sentence properly to tell me

7
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:31,799
about this transformation. Which direction does this replacement shift the

8
00:00:31,799 --> 00:00:34,229
graph and by how many units.
