1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,280
What both Alice and Bob have so far been able to find is--they have found

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:10,070
exponential time algorithms for their problem and they haven't been able

3
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:12,860
to come up with anything better so far.

4
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:18,460
The question of course is does the fact that Alice and Bob have not yet been able to come up

5
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:25,100
with a polynomial time algorithm mean that the problems they are working on are only solvable

6
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:30,290
in exponential time or could there be some sort of polynomial time algorithm

7
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:34,080
that they haven't found yet and there's a special terminology for that.

8
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:40,600
Problems or computer problems where you only have exponential time algorithms

9
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:46,050
are called intractable problems, and those compute problems where you can't find

10
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:50,590
a polynomial time algorithm--those are called tractable problems.

11
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:54,530
And this is going to be a rather obvious question to some of you I hope--

12
00:00:54,530 --> 00:01:00,890
does the fact that so far we only know exponential time algorithms for the problem that

13
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:04,920
Alice was working on and the problem that Bob was working on.

14
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:11,190
Does that mean that their problems are intractable or in other words, can we already say

15
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:18,290
whether Alice's or Bob's problems are intractable or tractable, and I would like you to tell me

16
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:23,580
if you think that is the case, so if we can already say that their problems are intractable

17
00:01:23,580 --> 99:59:59,999
or if there's probably more information that we need.
