00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:02,271
Let's review what we learned.

2
00:00:02,271 --> 00:00:08,888
I showed you how to use a minimizer to
find x such that f of x is minimized.

3
00:00:08,888 --> 00:00:11,848
I showed you how to minimize
in multiple dimensions.

4
00:00:11,848 --> 00:00:15,700
And how to use a minimizer to
build a parametrized model.

5
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:16,480
Where can you go from here?

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,900
There are a number of ways
you can carry this forward.

7
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:24,830
You can use functions besides
polynomials, you can model stock prices,

8
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:26,250
or you can optimize a portfolio.
