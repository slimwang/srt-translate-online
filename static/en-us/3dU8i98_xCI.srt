00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,060
The best way to answer this
question is to try it out,

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:06,420
if I add this style to this
page using a p selector.

3
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:12,790
So we had p, background color and
then save and refresh.

4
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:16,210
You can see that the style is
applied to all the paragraphs.

5
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:18,720
So the answer is all of them.

6
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,780
The p selector which is
called a tag selector

7
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:25,820
selects all of the elements that
are paragraphs in the HTML.

8
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:29,860
Tags selectors are useful when you want
to change the style of every element

9
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:30,770
of a certain tag.
