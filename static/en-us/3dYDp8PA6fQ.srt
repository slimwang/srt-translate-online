1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:04,107
After you've added the code from the
here's what else we need to add in order

2
00:00:04,107 --> 00:00:07,840
to read the remaining attributes and
display them in our text field.

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:10,890
So first we need to
append read gender and

4
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:13,490
weight in the header,
so it looks like this.

5
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:19,670
So after ID and name here, let's add in
those last remaining three attributes.

6
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:23,920
So I'll end the header with this
new line special character.

7
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,700
Now next we want to find the index for
each column following the pattern that

8
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:32,405
we have here similar for
the idColumnIndex and nameColumnIndex.

9
00:00:32,405 --> 00:00:33,295
So let's build that out.

10
00:00:34,475 --> 00:00:39,345
So to recap, we use the getColumnIndex
method which takes in the name of

11
00:00:39,345 --> 00:00:43,220
the column and returns back to
us the integer index value.

12
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:44,840
Then, inside the wall loop,

13
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:48,710
we can use these indices we just
got to extract the string or

14
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:52,310
integer value of the word at
the current row that the cursor is on.

15
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:56,320
So we already have that here for
the current ID and the current name.

16
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,459
So let's build it out for
breed, gender and weight.

17
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:03,390
So for breed, we can use getstring and
for gender and

18
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:08,300
weight, we used getint because
the values inside them were integers.

19
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:11,810
So lastly, in order to get our
values to display in the text view,

20
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:13,980
we're going to need to append them here.

21
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:18,330
So between each value,
I want to add a delimiter of the dash.

22
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:20,810
So let's go ahead and run it and
see what these changes look like.

23
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:25,840
Now all the values that I input
in appear on the screen, and

24
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,510
even my misspelling of poodle.
