1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,460
If you paid attention and read
carefully, the maximum number of images

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:07,180
Flickr will return for
any given search query is 4,000.

3
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:10,370
Then if we do not specify
the per_page option,

4
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:13,240
Flickr defaults to returning
100 images per page.

5
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:19,450
Finally, if we do the math, assuming the
per_page option has not been specified,

6
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:22,660
page 40 will contain the 4,000th result.

7
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:26,780
Therefore any search request that
goes beyond that 4,000th limit

8
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:29,170
will still return the results for
page 40.

9
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:31,590
So for searches with this many results,

10
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:36,350
the best we can do is select a random
image from those first 4,000 results.

11
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:39,340
But before we implement this,
let's talk about the steps required.
