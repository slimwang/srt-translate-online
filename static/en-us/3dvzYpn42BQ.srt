1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Social networks are just graphs like the kinds of graphs we've been studying.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
But the real world networks that you actually find have some distinctive properties.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
And these have been documented by researchers like Duncan Watts and others.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
One property of these graphs is that they tend to exhibit the small world phenomenon,

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
which essentially means that there are short paths between arbitrary nodes in the graph.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Another is that they're cliqueish, which means they exhibit a high clustering coefficient.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm going to illustrate these two properties next.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
So this is me essentially. I live in Bernardsville, NJ.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
This is Chris M. He lives in Wellesley, MA and he's very tall.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Finally, this is Chris S. and I'm not sure exactly where he lives

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
but I'm going to say New Brunswick, NJ.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
So last summer, Chris S. and Chris M. were both at the New Jersey Shore at the same time

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
and they got together for drinks.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Chris S. told Chris M. that he worked at Rutgers University.

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
And Chris M. said, "Oh! Do you know Michael Littman?"

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
And Chris S. said, "Actually yes. Small world!"

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
So it turned out that Chris S. was connected to me.

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
We both worked at Rutgers and had worked on a project together.

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
And Chris Metcalf and I went to the same undergraduate institution,

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
and we're friends doing computer sciencey stuff.

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
And here are these two random people meeting in some far away place hundreds of miles away

22
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
from where they live and they had this connection between them

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
and what we say when this sort of thing happens is it's sort of a small world.

24
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Even though there's lot people in lots of places, people are not as foreign to us as we might think.

25
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
So the classic example of this kind of effect was from the experiment by Stanley Milgram.

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:57,000
He very coarsely estimated that any person in the US was just 5 or 6 steps away from any other,

27
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,000
and this gave rise to what we now think of as being the idea of 6 degrees of separation.

28
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
In graph theoretic terms, what we say is that a graph exhibits the small world phenomenon

29
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:15,000
if nodes have relatively small degree but also a relatively short path to other arbitrary nodes,

30
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
and social network seem to exhibit exactly this property.

31
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
So just to get you thinking about the degree of different graphs and the path links

32
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
in different graphs, here's four different kinds of graphs we've talked about before.

33
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Clique where all the nodes are connected to each other.

34
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
A ring where the nodes are connected into a ring.

35
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,000
A balance tree where you have a tree structure, but there's a node that kind of separates

36
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
the other nodes into these two different components that are about the same size.

37
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
And a hypercube like this three-dimensional hypercube.

38
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:58,000
And what I'd like you to do is think about in an N node version of that graph what is the degree

39
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
and what is the path length between sort of the longest path link in the graph

40
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
as a function of the number of nodes.

41
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Is it constant? Does it depend on the number of nodes in the graph?

42
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Is it logarithmic? Or is it linear?

43
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:20,000
So a graph that has a low degree might be of 1 or log n,

44
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:26,000
and if it has short paths it might be of 1 or log n.

45
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:33,000
So which properties do these graphs exhibit?
