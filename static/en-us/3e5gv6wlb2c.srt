1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:03,370
So every time a hit is sent
from your app to Analytics,

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:05,790
it includes certain
kinds of information.

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:09,370
You get to see which screens or
activities your users went to.

4
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:15,280
You get geo information,
like their language and their location.

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,930
You get device information.

6
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:20,800
What brands, models, OS.

7
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,730
And you get network info.

8
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:28,360
So every time a hit goes to Analytics it
carries all this information with it.

9
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,870
So now that we've got some
data in our dashboard,

10
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:33,720
I'm going to drill down into
the different parts just a bit.

11
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:37,250
I'm not going to give an exhaustive
tour of the dashboard.

12
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:40,820
There is like week-long
courses on how to

13
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:44,510
understand everything in the dashboard,
but I will take you to the key pages.

14
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:46,480
Let's look at the audience and
see the overview.

15
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,530
And the overview page shows
quite a bit of information.

16
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:54,720
You can drill down here,
see the country, the city.

17
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:58,980
Now you all know where I was,
probably no big surprise, the app name.

18
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:03,680
So you can just drill down through
these things and get the information.

19
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:08,630
Notice the screen resolution and
see that I went to 2.56 screens per

20
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:14,570
session at nine sessions and
the average session duration 27 seconds.

21
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:16,480
That was the overview for the audience.

22
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,160
You can look at the app versions.

23
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,220
Another one that's cool,
of course, is Geo,

24
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:25,700
which gives you information
about the languages.

25
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:28,570
In this case only one language.

26
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:30,340
The location.

27
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:33,730
You can actually drill
down into the location.

28
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:34,890
You can just keep drilling down.

29
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:37,570
At some point you won't be able
to drill down any further.

30
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:40,170
Another part of the dashboard that
you should get really familiar with

31
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:41,590
is the Behavior.

32
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:44,460
Through the Overview
gain a summary of things.

33
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:49,000
The screens, there's all
the screens the users went to.

34
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,715
And remember this will be
aggregated data for all your users.

35
00:01:53,715 --> 00:01:56,490
because in our cases just the one user,
which is us.

36
00:01:57,610 --> 00:02:02,075
And you can drill down a bit more,
get the average time on screen.

37
00:02:02,075 --> 00:02:05,880
Percent exit is how,
what was the percentage of visits.

38
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,350
This was the last visit to the app.

39
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:11,909
So back in audiences too, of course,
you can go down into the devices,

40
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:17,610
Overview, my network operators,
I don't know what they were.

41
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:23,460
Anyway, you should drill down into
your own data, see what you can see.

42
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:26,660
So take some time to explore the
different pages in the reporting section

43
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:29,409
of the Analytics Dashboard,
then take this quiz.

44
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:33,680
What data do you get with auto
activity tracking is enabled?

45
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,580
Do you get to see users' locations,
their devices, what

46
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:41,680
buttons they clicked, who uses email
addresses, and do you get to see what

47
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,640
other apps they have on the devices,
whether they were running your app.

48
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,930
Check all that are true.
