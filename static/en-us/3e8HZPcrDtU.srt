1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:02,810
We have one more thing to
learn about wild loops, and

2
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:05,460
that's the break statement.

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:10,220
Break gives us a way to stop the loop,
even while the test condition is true.

4
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:12,940
So here's the typical structure
of a loop with a break.

5
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:19,398
So we have the while as we did before
and we have the : and

6
00:00:19,398 --> 00:00:23,300
our general while structure
is we have a here.

7
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:26,180
Now we're going to look inside this
block a little bit to see the kinds of

8
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:27,530
things that could be here.

9
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:29,556
And this is just an example of
what might be in the block.

10
00:00:29,556 --> 00:00:32,580
We have some code,
we have some python statements.

11
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:34,270
Then we have an if statement.

12
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:36,170
And that's going to have
another test expression.

13
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:38,210
We'll call that the break test.

14
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:42,290
That's a test expression that's checking
whether it's time to take a break.

15
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:46,380
When the break test is true,
What we have is break,

16
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,730
which by itself, is all we need.

17
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:53,130
What break means is stop executing
the y loop, jump out of the y loop and

18
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:55,150
continue with the code after that.

19
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:59,290
So whatever we had here, this is more
code that was in the wild block.

20
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:00,710
That will get skipped and

21
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:05,570
we'll jump to this point,
which is the code after the while.

22
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:08,400
So what happens when we
execute a loop with a break,

23
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,956
it executes like a normal loop.

24
00:01:09,956 --> 00:01:15,860
If the test expression is true, we go to
the code, if the break test is false,

25
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:19,450
we don't execute the break,
we would continue with the More Code.

26
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:21,180
We would go back to the loop test.

27
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:26,880
Check the test expression again,
if it is true, we go run this code.

28
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,310
If the break test is true,
then we execute the break and

29
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:32,790
what break does is jump out of the loop.

30
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:36,370
So we don't execute the more code we
don't execute the test expression again.

31
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:39,998
If the break happens, what happens is
we jump to the code after the while.

32
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:44,380
This gives us a way to break
out of the middle of the loop.

33
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:46,800
Here's an example of
how we might use that.

34
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:50,520
So before we define the procedure
print numbers without using break,

35
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,940
we defined it like this.

36
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:53,560
So this is the code we had before.

37
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,860
We could re-write that using break.

38
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:58,640
So now instead of having
the while test stop the loop,

39
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,470
we'll make the while test true.

40
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:01,720
True will never become false.

41
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:06,900
That means if we didn't have a break,
the loop would keep going forever.

42
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,770
But we're going to add a break.

43
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:10,550
We're going to have
an if test that says.

44
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:13,310
Well, the stopping condition
now is we're going to stop

45
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:14,340
once I is greater than N.

46
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:17,700
And the way to stop is to use break.

47
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:20,080
If I is not greater than N then
we're going to keep going.

48
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,580
We'll do the same thing we did before.

49
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:22,210
We'll print I.

50
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:24,540
And we'll add one to i.

51
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:29,510
So this look has exactly the same
meaning as the one we had before.

52
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:32,500
The previous one is better in every way,
right, so

53
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,690
this is more complex is more code.

54
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:37,085
This illustrates how we can use break.

55
00:02:37,085 --> 00:02:38,325
We wouldn't want to do it this way.

56
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:39,945
This is much worse than
what we had before.

57
00:02:39,945 --> 00:02:42,445
We want to keep our code simple and
easy to understand.

58
00:02:42,445 --> 00:02:45,745
We'll see, once we get to the code for
abstracting all the links on the page,

59
00:02:45,745 --> 00:02:48,975
that there are cases where it's
easier to write the code using break,

60
00:02:48,975 --> 00:02:49,885
than it is without that.
