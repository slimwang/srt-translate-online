1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,000
One thing I'd like to expose you really quickly is

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,260
RSS, you've probably heard of RSS before. It's how you

3
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:07,930
read a website that has, you know, daily content, you

4
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:09,710
know, like a blog or a news site and you may

5
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:14,260
have a reader that is specialized for just reading the content. RSS stands for

6
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:20,210
RDF Site Summary, and, RDF stands for Resource Description Framework. Now

7
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:25,230
I'm not going to quiz you on this, RDF is, is an XML format for describing just

8
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:29,760
about anything. For basically representing knowledge in XML actually

9
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,692
in my first job I dealt with a lot of

10
00:00:31,692 --> 00:00:33,900
RDF so, I don't want to spend any more

11
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:37,247
time on it. More commonly, RSS actually refers to Really

12
00:00:37,247 --> 00:00:39,956
Simple Syndication and that's kind of more of more

13
00:00:39,956 --> 00:00:42,539
of the context of how we're going to be dealing with

14
00:00:42,539 --> 00:00:45,647
it. You know, RDF was kind of conceived to solve

15
00:00:45,647 --> 00:00:50,667
this grand data, you know, organize the world's information problems.

16
00:00:50,667 --> 00:00:55,010
And RSS was, you know, it uses RDF but really, its

17
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:58,586
just a list of, a list of content in XML. So

18
00:00:58,586 --> 00:01:00,334
let me show you some more example of this in the

19
00:01:00,334 --> 00:01:02,933
wild. I'm at the New York Times home page right now,

20
00:01:02,933 --> 00:01:05,057
and if we go down to the bottom of this page,

21
00:01:05,057 --> 00:01:07,653
we'll see a link for RSS, so I'll click that link,

22
00:01:07,653 --> 00:01:11,670
and I'll choose the New York Times global home page. Now,

23
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:15,840
you can see in our URL, we have GlobalHome.xml. And so

24
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,820
we've received an XML document. And most browsers will

25
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:22,798
actually display XML in a nice way. So, this

26
00:01:22,798 --> 00:01:26,240
is an XML document. It's actually an RSS. And

27
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,770
so, what this basically means is there's a, a particular

28
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:34,400
namespace, kind of a tag space if you will,

29
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,650
for the items in this list. You know, just

30
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:38,870
like HTML has, you know, opens with an HTML

31
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:42,040
and has a body and, you know, very specific tags.

32
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:46,730
An RSS document will also, has specific tags. And

33
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:50,050
in XML, you can use as header area, to describe

34
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:52,526
what name spacing's used. So were using the atom

35
00:01:52,526 --> 00:01:56,630
name space, and the RSS 2.0 name space. And that's

36
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:59,820
basically what this is telling our parser, is you

37
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,400
can download a kind of descriptions of these tags from

38
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:05,660
these URLs. And then we know what tags to expect.

39
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:07,130
We're not going to, I'm not going to quiz you on what

40
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:10,449
RSS actually is, so if you take a, a little peak at this

41
00:02:10,449 --> 00:02:14,610
document, you can see it starts out with some header stuff kind of in

42
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:17,870
this channel section and then when we get down to this list of items.

43
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:20,270
And so I'm going to collapse these first few and we can see we've got

44
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:22,260
an item and this is basically just a list of stories that are

45
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:24,360
in the New York times. So I can collapse and item and we can

46
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:29,040
see if there is another item. There's actually a whole bunch of items. And

47
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,300
each item has, you know, a title, and a link, and sorts of things

48
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:35,240
that you know, would power an RSS reader. You know, a little description.

49
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,830
You know, this is, this is neat. This is for an RSS reader,

50
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:40,560
or a program to download the contents of the New York Times without

51
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,700
having to parse all the HTML. Which brings us to our next quiz.
