1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:01,600
Octave is a free and

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:05,510
open source language for numerical and scientific computing.

3
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:09,470
It is mostly syntax and feature compatible with MATLAB.

4
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:12,010
You can download it from the GNU Octave website.

5
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:15,850
Follow the instructions for your corresponding system.

6
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:19,610
Linux is probably the easiest, and Windows is a bit of a pain.

7
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:23,390
I am on an OS X machine here.

8
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:25,870
There is a binary installer for OS X.

9
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:30,030
But I've had problems with it later on when trying to install packages.

10
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,650
So I prefer the Homebrew route.

11
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:36,530
If you don't have Homebrew set up already, first install XCode.

12
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:39,000
Then open up a terminal and

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,770
use the Xcode-select command to install command line tools.

14
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:46,050
Now you can install Homebrew.

15
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,520
You will also need a LaTeX distribution, like MacTeX.

16
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,130
This may take a while to download.

17
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:59,120
Once you have Xcode, its command line tools, Homebrew, and MapTech installed.

18
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,000
Continue with the instructions on the wiki.

19
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:04,030
Once you have Octave installed and

20
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:07,930
it's in your path you should be able to run it by simply typing Octave.

21
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,960
This is the Octave Interpreter.

22
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,940
Similar to the Math Lab command window.

23
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:19,650
You can type arithmetic expressions, create variables, and

24
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:21,439
even work with vectors and matrices.

25
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,890
To suppress the result of an expression showing up in the output,

26
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:27,780
use a semicolon at the end.

27
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:30,880
You can type exit to come out of the interpreter.

28
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,450
You can also run Octave in GUI-mode.

29
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:37,050
Note that this might still be an experimental feature, and

30
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:38,440
tends to break very easily.

31
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:42,890
You can carry out the same operations here as the console version.

32
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:48,450
In addition you have a work space which lists the variables currently in memory.

33
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:52,820
And a file browser showing contents of the current directory.

34
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:55,400
As in Matlab,

35
00:01:55,400 --> 00:02:00,520
you can read images using the imread command and display them using imshow.

36
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:08,800
The base installation of Octave does not include any additional packages.

37
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,840
To install a package, we need to use the pkg install command.

38
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:18,092
The -forge option pulls packages from the online Octave-Forge repository.

39
00:02:18,092 --> 00:02:22,490
Octave-Forge contains an extensive collection of packages.

40
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:24,430
We are interested in the image package.

41
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:28,939
Notice that this package has some dependencies.

42
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:34,710
We can install the image package, along with all its dependencies, namely,

43
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:38,830
general, control, and signal, in a single command.

44
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:41,930
Once installed, they should show up in the list of packages.

45
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:48,120
Now you can load the image package by typing pkg load image, and

46
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,720
then use functions from it like rgb2gray.

47
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:56,740
It converts a color RGB image into a gray scale or monochrome image.

48
00:02:56,740 --> 00:03:01,210
For more information on the image package, check out it's Octave Forge page.

49
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:05,270
There is an extensive function reference that you'll need to use frequently.

50
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:09,450
The Octave Wiki is very useful as well.

51
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:13,340
It has installation instructions for a number of platforms,

52
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:16,310
as well as tutorials and examples to help you get started.

53
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:20,550
Play around with these to become more familiar with the Octave environment.
