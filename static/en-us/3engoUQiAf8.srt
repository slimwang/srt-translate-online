1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:04,860
This parabola would open to the left. Great thinking if you got that one right.

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:08,398
One of the key things to recognize is that this equation is in the form x

3
00:00:08,398 --> 00:00:13,969
equals. Parabolas that are in this form, either open to the left or to the

4
00:00:13,969 --> 00:00:19,312
right. Since the a value is negative 1, we know the parabola will open to the

5
00:00:19,312 --> 00:00:24,750
left. If I had a different parabola like x equals 3y squared, then we can see

6
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:30,740
that, that parabola opens to the right, since the a value here is positive.

7
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:33,524
Let's take this one away for a moment and just concentrate on the first

8
00:00:33,524 --> 00:00:39,162
parabola. Again, its vertex is at 0,0. This is the turning point for the

9
00:00:39,162 --> 00:00:44,065
parabola. Notice also that there's an axis of symmetry that goes through the

10
00:00:44,065 --> 00:00:48,335
vertex. It means that if there's a point on this side of the graph, then

11
00:00:48,335 --> 00:00:52,945
directly across from it is another point. For example, we know the point

12
00:00:52,945 --> 00:00:57,880
negative 4,2 is on the graph. So, we could also know that the point negative 4

13
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:03,281
negative 2 is also on the graph. If we zoom in on our parabola, we can also

14
00:01:03,281 --> 00:01:08,380
find other points by moving from the vertex. Since our parabola's in the form,

15
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:14,490
x equals. This time, we'll move up and down one unit. Next, we'll move a units

16
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:20,523
in the x direction to find the two points. So, a is negative 1, so I can go one

17
00:01:20,523 --> 00:01:25,952
unit up and one unit left. This gives me the point negative 1,1. And if I

18
00:01:25,952 --> 00:01:30,495
want to find another point I can move one unit down and one unit left to get

19
00:01:30,495 --> 00:01:37,715
this point negative 1 negative 1. Let's also see this with this graph. x equals

20
00:01:37,715 --> 00:01:43,640
3y squared. If we zoom in on this purple parabola, we can see how to get these

21
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:51,246
points of three one and 3 negative 1. We start at the vertex and go one unit up

22
00:01:51,246 --> 00:01:56,675
and one unit down, since we're in the form x equals. And this time we're going

23
00:01:56,675 --> 00:02:01,830
to go three units right since the a value is positive 3. So we'll go one unit

24
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:07,032
up and three units right, one unit down and three units right. This gives us

25
00:02:07,032 --> 00:02:09,800
the other 2 points on our parabola.
