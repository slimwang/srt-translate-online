1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,080
We're going to focus here on
optimizing for Sharpe ratio.

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:09,577
So solving that problem is not trivial,
but it's not too hard either.

3
00:00:09,577 --> 00:00:13,536
What we need to do is frame
the portfolio optimization problem as

4
00:00:13,536 --> 00:00:15,370
a minimization problem, and

5
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:19,570
then we can solve it using
the tools you have already.

6
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:24,240
As you recall, in order to use
a optimizer that minimizes,

7
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,120
we have to do three things.

8
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:35,460
First, we have to provide a function
to minimize f(x) that takes in x, two,

9
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:41,260
an initial guess for that x, and three,
call the optimizer and let it run.

10
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:47,000
Now, in this case, x are the allocations
that we're looking for.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,869
And we want the optimizer to try
different allocations in order

12
00:00:50,869 --> 00:00:55,253
to discover the best set of allocations
that optimizes this function.

13
00:00:55,253 --> 00:00:57,243
Well, what is that function exactly?

14
00:00:57,243 --> 00:01:01,370
We said just a moment ago that we
want to optimize for Sharpe ratio.

15
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:05,030
So, is this just a Sharpe ratio?

16
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:09,195
Well not exactly, because what
the minimizer will do, in this case,

17
00:01:09,195 --> 00:01:12,470
is try to find
the smallest Sharpe ratio.

18
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:15,060
So it'll find allocations
that minimize that.

19
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:18,570
And we want, of course,
the largest Sharpe ratio,

20
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:20,450
because larger Sharpe ratios are better.

21
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,007
That's easy to fix.

22
00:01:23,007 --> 00:01:27,028
All we do is multiply
this by negative 1.

23
00:01:27,028 --> 00:01:34,230
So, all that we want our optimizer to do
is optimize for a negative Sharpe ratio.

24
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:38,500
And that'll find the best allocation or
the best value for

25
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:41,220
x to solve this problem.

26
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:43,260
And remember,
x can have multiple dimensions,

27
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:48,300
so each dimension of x here is
an allocation to each of the stocks.

28
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:51,990
So, if we're trying to solve for
a portfolio of four stocks,

29
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:56,660
x will have four dimensions, and
the value for each of those dimensions

30
00:01:56,660 --> 00:02:00,750
is the percentage of funds to
allocate to each of those stocks.
