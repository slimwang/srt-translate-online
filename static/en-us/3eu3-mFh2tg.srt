1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:03,300
All right. So the learner, if the learner is choosing

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:06,020
which questions to ask the learner is in a distinctly more

3
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:09,400
difficult situation because it doesn't actually know what the right answer

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:13,630
is. So whereas the teacher could ask questions there were maximally

5
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:16,600
informative. That is to say, whittle down the hypothesis set to

6
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,950
one in a single question. The learner doesn't, doesn't have that

7
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:22,830
ability. The learner can't know which, what whether the question that's

8
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:25,790
being asked is going to have a yes or no answer.

9
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:28,710
So again, assuming that the learner can ask any question it wants,

10
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:32,310
but doesn't know what the right answer is. How many questions is

11
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:35,250
it going to need to ask before it can it has whittled

12
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:37,550
down the set of possible people to just the one that is

13
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:42,940
the right answer? So I gave four helpful formulae here. All in

14
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:45,340
terms of the number of people that we have to choose from.

15
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:48,350
Is, do we have to ask questions that is the size of

16
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:50,870
the set of people? Is it going to be more like the log

17
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:53,400
of size of the set of people? Since there's,

18
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,920
you know, lots of difference ways that the person

19
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:58,900
can be chosen. Do we have to look at two to the number of people? Or again can

20
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:00,610
the learner be as powerful as the teacher, and

21
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:02,790
get the whole thing in just a single question?

22
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:04,830
Alright, so, is, is, is this a little clearer

23
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:06,400
Charles? Can you, can you work this one through?

24
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,810
>> Yeah. I think I can work this one through.
