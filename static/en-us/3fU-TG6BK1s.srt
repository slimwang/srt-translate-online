00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:05,320
In this course, we're using WebGL and developers library I chose for this course called the

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:10,341
Three.js. WebGL is an Application Program Interface, API for short, that

3
00:00:10,341 --> 00:00:15,716
controls the GPU. It is based on OpenGL ES, an API used in mobile devices which

4
00:00:15,716 --> 00:00:20,840
in turn is based on OpenGL, an API for desktop computers that dates back to

5
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:25,332
1992. The other major competing API is called DirectX or Direct3D, which is

6
00:00:25,332 --> 00:00:29,921
commonly used for games on the Xbox console and Windows PCs. This is almost the

7
00:00:29,921 --> 00:00:34,605
last time I'll mention DirectX. It's not all that different from WebGL. In fact,

8
00:00:34,605 --> 00:00:39,077
Google Chrome on the PC turns WebGL commands into DirectX calls. See additional

9
00:00:39,077 --> 00:00:43,242
course materials for more information. WebGL itself is a state based API. You

10
00:00:43,242 --> 00:00:47,512
set up exactly how you want the GPU to do something, then send a geometry to

11
00:00:47,512 --> 00:00:51,765
render under these conditions. This gives a pretty fine grained control over the

12
00:00:51,765 --> 00:00:55,175
GPU that can result in hundreds of lines of code that draw even the simplest

13
00:00:55,175 --> 00:00:59,379
scenes. This is why we'll be using Three.js, a free development library with

14
00:00:59,379 --> 00:01:03,335
many useful features. Just a few lines of code in Three.js can create objects

15
00:01:03,335 --> 00:01:07,043
with materials, set up lighting and a camera, and even perform animation.
