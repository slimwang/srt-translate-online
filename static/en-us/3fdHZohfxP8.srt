00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:06,020
Here is a visualization of the agent
based simulation of the Center for

2
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:08,530
Health Discovery and Well-being.

3
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:11,870
A special clinic established
to explore the potential for

4
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:14,710
preventing the development
of chronic disease.

5
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:17,250
Here you can see physical areas,

6
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:22,750
such as the education room Where
trained coaches interact with patients.

7
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:27,740
When the simulation is actually run, all
the clinic personnel and the patients

8
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:33,110
being served move along these pathways
governed by the time it takes to

9
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:38,349
do each element of the clinics work, the
available resources and other factors.

10
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:43,990
The simulation was constructed to help
the clinic identify a set of processes

11
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:48,640
and a revenue model that would
make it both self-sustaining and

12
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,570
of value to its parent organization.
