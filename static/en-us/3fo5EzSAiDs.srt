00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
For reasons that I don't really understand, lots of really important statistics start with the letter M.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Today's statistics have been brought to you by the letter M. Here are some of the statistics.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Maximum is the largest value in L, minimum is the smallest value in L,

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
the midpoint is the average of the max and the min--sort of the halfway

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
point between the largest value and the smallest value.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
The mean is the average of the values in L--we all say mean sometimes or average sometimes

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
also expected value--basically it means the same thing.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The mode is the most common value in L if there's repeat.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The median is say the middlest number, the middlest value in L--basically the numbers

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
are that half the numbers are bigger and half the numbers are smaller and that there can be ties,

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
so we'll have to be a little bit careful how we define that.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
But essentially it is the value that would be in the middle of the sorted list.

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
And all these different notions of statistics all give us a way of taking a really long list of values

14
00:01:01,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and then grinding them together to make a single number that fits comfortably inside of our brains.
