1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,320
Now let's check your understanding so
far.

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:05,910
Here are two points, P and Q.

3
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:08,990
P is located four units to
the left of the origin, and

4
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:11,370
four units below the origin.

5
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:14,440
Q is located four units to
the right of the origin, and

6
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:16,510
two units below the origin.

7
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:19,420
Here are also two vectors, v and w.

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:26,838
v starts at the point P, and
moves up four units and one unit left.

9
00:00:26,838 --> 00:00:32,759
w starts at the point Q, and moves two
units left and zero units vertically.

10
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:36,237
Using this information, go ahead and
fill in the coordinates for

11
00:00:36,237 --> 00:00:38,840
these points and
vectors in the following quiz.
