1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:01,649
Here's the answer.

2
00:00:01,649 --> 00:00:05,310
We haven't made any changes to
the left side of the tree, so

3
00:00:05,309 --> 00:00:08,769
as before,
the same 4 node will be pruned.

4
00:00:08,769 --> 00:00:12,019
On the right side, you can see that
we've switched the two branches.

5
00:00:12,019 --> 00:00:14,509
We evaluated this branch and got a 4, so

6
00:00:14,509 --> 00:00:18,899
we know that in the min node above, our
value will be less than or equal to 4.

7
00:00:18,899 --> 00:00:21,320
However, the final
node is a max node and

8
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,089
we already have a 5 to compare that to.

9
00:00:23,089 --> 00:00:27,870
So we'll always end up choosing
this 5 in the max node above.

10
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:31,900
That means that the right most branches
are relevant and thus could be pruned.
