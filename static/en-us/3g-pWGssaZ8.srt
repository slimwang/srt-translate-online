1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,280
Related visually to the class model diagram is the object diagram.

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:07,270
In fact they're the same with one major exception.

3
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:11,030
Instead of mentioning classes, they mention instances.

4
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:18,130
The label compartment at the top of the boxes has an underlined text line.

5
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:19,480
A text line has two parts.

6
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:22,750
One is the class name, just like in the class model diagram, but it also has

7
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:27,180
the name of a specific instance, and those two are separated by a colon.

8
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:30,190
So for example here, we have the company class, and

9
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:33,440
in particular we have the c instance of a company class.

10
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:37,450
Optic diagrams are obviously used to convey the specific use of

11
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:40,980
the classes involved in a class model diagram.

12
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:43,880
As you can see, for this particular instances here,

13
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:47,680
many of the attribute fields have attribute values filled in for

14
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,990
them, as they would be for a particular instance.
