1
00:00:00,004 --> 00:00:03,910
We know that we can not use the product property to combine either of these

2
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:09,770
pairs of logs, since remember they have different basis. However, let's try

3
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:15,030
grabbing our calculator and seeing if we can add them. To add log base 10 of 4

4
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:19,740
plus natural log of 5. I start out by pressing the log button, since I know

5
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:25,496
this has an implicit invisible ten down here as a base. You want base 10 of 4

6
00:00:25,496 --> 00:00:31,810
plus natural log, so the ln button of 5. And there we go, we have our number.

7
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:36,950
Let's write it down. So, according to our calculator, log base 10 of 4 plus

8
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:43,490
natural log of 5 is about equal to 2.211 so on and so forth. Let's try our

9
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:48,160
second combination here. So, I've got my calculator all ready, and I just need

10
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:53,751
to enter log base 2 of 5. But wait, there's no log base 2 button. What am I

11
00:00:53,751 --> 00:00:58,380
going to do? Well, I could use trial and error. But that would be really,

12
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:02,680
really hard. There must be something easier we can do. Luckily there is.

13
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:07,240
There's something called changing bases that we can do. What this means is that

14
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:12,410
we'll convert log base 2 of 5 to something with a different base that we can

15
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:18,080
evaluate using a calculator. So this is a formula we can use to change a log

16
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:25,700
from being base a to base b. We have log base a of x equals log base b of x

17
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:30,490
over log base b of a. This probably feels a little bit confusing right now and

18
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:35,190
kind of abstract. So, let's try using it to see how it really works. Let's do

19
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:39,360
this first off with something we know the answer, just to make sure that our

20
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,475
method makes sense. I like us to change log base 2 of 8 to something in base

21
00:01:44,475 --> 00:01:49,053
10. First things first though, what is log base 2 of 8 equal to?
