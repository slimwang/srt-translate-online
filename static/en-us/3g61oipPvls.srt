00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,890
Before we jump into intra-domain routing, let's take a

2
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:06,100
look at what a topology might look like inside

3
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:09,200
a single autonomous system. A topology inside an AS

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,920
consists of nodes and edges that connect them. The nodes

5
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:15,990
are sometimes called points of presence, or PoPs. A

6
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:19,370
PoP is typically located in a dense population center,

7
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:21,310
so that it can be close to the PoPs

8
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:25,370
of other providers for easier interconnection. And, also close to

9
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:27,500
other customers for cheaper backhaul to

10
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:31,290
customers that may be pruchasing connectivity from

11
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:33,870
this particular AS. The edges between

12
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:36,460
pops are typically constrained by the location

13
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:38,630
of fiber paths. Which for the

14
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:44,080
sake of convenience. Typically parallel major transportation

15
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:50,580
routes such as railroads and highways. Here's an example of a single AS topology

16
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:53,340
which is the Abilene Network, which is a research

17
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:57,350
network in the United States. Each of these locations

18
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:59,620
would be considered a Pop, and each of these

19
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:02,750
PoPs may have one or more edges between them.

20
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:06,690
Georgia Tech is an autonomous system that connects at

21
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:10,130
the Atlanta PoP of the Abilene Network. Here's a

22
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:12,510
close up of the Abilene Network in the south

23
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:16,360
eastern U.S.. The Abilene network connects to other universities

24
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:19,260
in the southeast near Atalanta and an internet exchange

25
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:22,760
point called SOX or southern crossroads. Now thus far

26
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:25,750
we've just talked about the topology of an autonomous

27
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:28,860
system which essentially defines the graph. The next step

28
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:31,890
is to compute paths over that topology. A process

29
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:34,650
called routing. Routing is the process by which nodes

30
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:37,750
discover where to forward traffic so that it reaches

31
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:41,890
a certain node. There are two types of intra-domain routing.

32
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:44,520
One is called distance vector, and the other is called link

33
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:47,070
state. In the rest of this lesson we'll explore the two

34
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:51,750
different types of intra-domain routing and the advantages and disadvantages of

35
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:54,430
each of them. Let's first take a look at distance vector routing.
