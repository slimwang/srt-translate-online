1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:01,260
All right.

2
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:02,670
Welcome back to Computer Vision.

3
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:05,890
Last time, we introduced principal
component analysis as a way of doing

4
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:09,920
dimensionality reduction,
going from a high space to a low space.

5
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,570
And we said it only works
if the signal actually is

6
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:14,478
present in that lower dimensional space.

7
00:00:14,478 --> 00:00:16,590
In particular,

8
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:21,500
you can only reconstruct an image well
using a small number of low dimensional.

9
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,945
A low dimensional small
number of basis images or

10
00:00:24,945 --> 00:00:28,660
eigenvectors if the image itself
was kind of like that, right?

11
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:34,210
I can only make faces out of eigenfaces,
I can't make bicycles or tortilla chips.

12
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:39,490
So that gave us a little insight, as you
might use that to do detection, right?

13
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:43,150
So if I want to find a face, I might
look for patches that can be well

14
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:46,850
described, reconstructed,
using just that low dimension.

15
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:53,450
So, there's a related task that
we can use this method for.

16
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:57,210
And that's what's called appearance
based tracking all right?

17
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:59,220
So here's the basic idea,

18
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:02,430
learn something about
what a target looks like.

19
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:06,140
Maybe not just a single image but
the possible variations

20
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:10,350
by capturing a low-dimensional space,
being able to reconstruct.

21
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:13,170
And then you're going to
track that target around

22
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:17,310
by finding the place that you can
reconstruct the best, all right?

23
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:18,500
So that's the basic idea and

24
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:22,560
what's cool about this is instead of
like some of the previous tracking.

25
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,100
Where if you learn new appearance
every time step, you might drift

26
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,730
that is you eventually get stuck on
something that's not the object.

27
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:30,390
Here you might be more robust to that.
