1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,520
Let's look at some values from our dolphin image.

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,540
As before, we load the image with imread and

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:09,250
let's also display the image with imshow.

4
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:11,660
How about we print out the size as well?

5
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:14,422
And let's run this to make sure everything's okay.

6
00:00:14,422 --> 00:00:15,246
All right.

7
00:00:15,246 --> 00:00:20,524
Dolphin's still there, and the size is still 320 by 500.

8
00:00:20,524 --> 00:00:24,630
Let's say we want to find out the image value at a particular location.

9
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:29,060
We specify this location with a row and column number.

10
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:34,690
We learned earlier that an image is a function over the two dimensions.

11
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:39,500
Octave uses a notation similar to a function to access values at

12
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,130
a particular location.

13
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:45,860
Let's say we want to find out the value at row 50, column 100.

14
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:49,200
We write img, that's our image variable.

15
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,760
Followed by the row column coordinates in parenthesis.

16
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,521
And let's display this value.

17
00:00:54,521 --> 00:00:56,255
All right, let's see what we have.

18
00:00:56,255 --> 00:00:59,993
So the value at 50, 100 is 208.

19
00:00:59,993 --> 00:01:05,150
Similarly we can find out the values for an entire row.

20
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:10,040
We'll use a similar notation as before, but we'll do something different for

21
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,410
the column.

22
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:16,480
Putting a colon tells Octave to return values for all columns.

23
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,092
Let's see what the output is.

24
00:01:18,092 --> 00:01:23,730
As you can see, Octave dumps values from the entire row, all 500 columns.

25
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:28,220
Obviously, this isn't a useful way to look at values from an entire row.

26
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:29,360
What else can we do?

27
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,360
We can plot these values.

28
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,230
This makes more sense, doesn't it?

29
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:39,340
You can clearly see the relatively higher values where the white wave is,

30
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:42,920
and then the other values are comparatively lower.

31
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:47,180
Can you find out the values from this three by three slice of the image?

32
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:50,610
Rows 101 to 103.

33
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:53,894
Columns 201 through 203.
