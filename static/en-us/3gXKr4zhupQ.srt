1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,840
Remember that this plus or minus symbol actually indicates that we're going to

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,692
have two separate numbers here. There are two numbers contained in this line

3
00:00:07,692 --> 00:00:11,886
right now. One that's equal to negative 1 plus this quantity, and one that's

4
00:00:11,886 --> 00:00:16,119
equal to negative 1 minus this quantity. What I'd like you to do now is to find

5
00:00:16,119 --> 00:00:20,315
the two values of x that are produced by this. Remember what this symbol means

6
00:00:20,315 --> 00:00:24,347
to get you those two different answers, and when you find them, round each of

7
00:00:24,347 --> 00:00:28,401
them to two decimal places. Please put the answer that is the lower number in

8
00:00:28,401 --> 00:00:31,989
the top box, and the answer that is higher number in the bottom box.
