1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,009
So the answer to this question is that both the

2
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:06,730
skin color and the disposition appear to be related in these

3
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:10,370
families, as opposed to height, doesn't appear to related in

4
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:14,220
our first family. Now what do we mean by this? All

5
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:15,800
I mean is that when we look at the son

6
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:19,650
here in the first example, he's much taller than the parents.

7
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:22,950
Both the parents are short, so we're asking the question,

8
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:25,390
where did the trait of the son being tall come from.

9
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:27,330
Not only does it not appear to come from either one

10
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:29,080
of the parents individually, but it doesn't look to be a

11
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:32,549
combination of the pair's height either. In the case of skin

12
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:35,770
color and disposition though, we see that both the daughter and the

13
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:39,410
baby share the same skin tone as the parents so it

14
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:43,230
appears as if that trait was related in this case. And

15
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:46,750
the same thing for disposition. While one parent seems to be

16
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:50,680
sad most or all of the time, the children are happy and

17
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:53,700
resemble what the other parent looks like most of the time,

18
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:57,480
which is having a happy or really cheery disposition. Now it's

19
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,780
really important to remember as we go through this lesson and

20
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:02,550
all the lessons in this course Just because a trait appears

21
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:06,530
to be related or to be inherited in a particular ways.

22
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:09,940
Looks can be deceiving sometimes. And we will talk in great

23
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:14,030
detail about what aspects of traits have a genetic component and

24
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:17,030
which of those might have an environmental component down the line.
