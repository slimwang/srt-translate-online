Loops are a fundamental topic for
any programming language.

2
00:00:03,669 --> 00:00:05,250
So make sure you're
comfortable of loops,

3
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:08,157
because you'll be using
them all the time.

4
00:00:08,157 --> 00:00:10,810
>> Loops are a really cool
feature of the language, but

5
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:13,470
you know what might be even better?

6
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:14,660
Functions.

7
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:16,170
>> Functions are awesome.

8
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:17,690
They let you group lines
of code together and

9
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:19,650
run them all at the same time.

10
00:00:19,649 --> 00:00:21,769
You might not think that
that's anything special, but

11
00:00:21,769 --> 00:00:23,620
wait until you check
out the next lesson.

12
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:25,260
You'll be writing functions
all over the place.
