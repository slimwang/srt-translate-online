00:00:00,006 --> 00:00:04,790
F of x equals x cubed is the simplest cubic function that I can think of. Since

2
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:08,758
in order to be a cubic polynomial, an expression must have at least one term

3
00:00:08,758 --> 00:00:12,658
that's of degree 3, and that must be the term with the highest degree. This

4
00:00:12,658 --> 00:00:16,154
certainly does seem like the simplest cubic function we can come up with. It's

5
00:00:16,154 --> 00:00:20,773
just x multiplied by itself three times. Now, because this function is so basic,

6
00:00:20,773 --> 00:00:25,530
so primary, this gets a special name, a special designation, of being called the

7
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:30,897
parent function for cubics. Just like f of x squared is the parent function for

8
00:00:30,897 --> 00:00:31,872
quadratics.
