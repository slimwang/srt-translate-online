00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,720
A researcher finds that students who listen to classical music in elementary

2
00:00:04,732 --> 00:00:09,651
school tend to have better grades in high school. There was no random assignment

3
00:00:09,663 --> 00:00:14,557
to conditions or manipulation of an independent variable. In other words, they

4
00:00:14,568 --> 00:00:19,285
didn't just look at a bunch of random students. We might not even know which

5
00:00:19,297 --> 00:00:24,095
students they looked at. But then the researcher recommends that children should

6
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:28,515
listen to classical music, because that will cause them to perform better in

7
00:00:28,527 --> 00:00:32,195
school. What's wrong with this logic? Select all that apply.
