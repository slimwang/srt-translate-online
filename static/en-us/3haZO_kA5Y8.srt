00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:05,103
Here's another equation for you to solve. And the ones we've been working with

2
00:00:05,103 --> 00:00:10,040
have definitely gotten gradually more complex, so this one is another step up.

3
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:17,070
We have 3 times the quantity times 2 to 3t minus 2, plus 6 equals 15. Now you

4
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:19,770
could approach this equation in the exact the same way as when we did just

5
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:24,160
before this. You'll just have a few more steps at the end to reach the

6
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,475
solution. Now, you might want to take a couple seconds right now and pause the

7
00:00:28,475 --> 00:00:33,014
video to try solving all the way to t on your own. If you feel like that might

8
00:00:33,014 --> 00:00:35,534
be a little bit much, let's go through it in a slightly more step-by-step

9
00:00:35,534 --> 00:00:39,175
manner. Now of course, there are many different ways to solve this problem, and

10
00:00:39,175 --> 00:00:43,633
I'm just going to show one of them. First, we're going to treat 2 to the 3t

11
00:00:43,633 --> 00:00:49,042
minus 2 as our variable. So, we write the equation isolating 2 to the 3t minus

12
00:00:49,042 --> 00:00:53,973
2 on this side. If 2 to the 3t minus 2 seems like something sort of complicated

13
00:00:53,973 --> 00:00:57,690
to work with, and sort of weird to think about as a variable, then you can

14
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:01,533
substitute in another letter, like u for instance, in place of this whole

15
00:01:01,533 --> 00:01:06,059
thing. Then just solve for u.
