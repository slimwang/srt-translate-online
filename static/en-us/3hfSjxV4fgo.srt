00:00:01,115 --> 00:00:04,510
Exploration-based learning is very common in the real world. You and

2
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:08,860
I do it all the time. You need to prop open a door, you bring a chair, and

3
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:12,090
you use it to prop open the door because it just put an explanation for

4
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:16,470
why the chair, in fact, can prop open a door. There is a sheaf of papers on

5
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:20,380
a desk with the shuffling around. You take a coffee mug, put it on the sheaf of

6
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:24,000
paper that acts as a paperweight. Another example or explanation best learned.

7
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:27,800
You and I are constantly dealing with novel situations,

8
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:32,659
we are constantly coming up with creative solutions to them. How do we do it?

9
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:37,280
One way is if we use existing concepts but use them in new ways.

10
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:42,410
We find new connections between them by building explanations for them. This is

11
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:45,590
sometimes called Speed Up learning because we're not learning new concepts,

12
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:49,350
we're simply connecting existing concepts. But it's a very powerful way of

13
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:52,760
dealing with a large number of situations. And today in class, we'll learn

14
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:56,280
how we can build AI agents that can do the same thing that you and I do so well.
