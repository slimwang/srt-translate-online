00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,210
Let's look at another way to solve quadratic equations, this time we're

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:06,423
going to use a method called completing the square we'll see this method again

3
00:00:06,423 --> 00:00:11,820
when we look at conic sections so be sure you get familiar with it. Let's start

4
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:15,572
by reviewing the perfect square trinomial patterns, what numbers would fill in

5
00:00:15,572 --> 00:00:19,044
each of these blanks be sure to indicate the appropriate sign in each box as

6
00:00:19,044 --> 00:00:25,900
well. So here you use a plus or a minus symbol, and here you'll put the number.
