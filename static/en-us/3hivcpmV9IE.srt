1
00:00:00,168 --> 00:00:03,197
So now let's actually start
understanding how to build

2
00:00:03,197 --> 00:00:04,556
a simple stereo system.

3
00:00:04,556 --> 00:00:09,316
Let's take our coordinate axis, here
I just put a simple left camera here.

4
00:00:09,316 --> 00:00:14,146
I'm going to put them at coordinate
axis point 0.00, which is here.

5
00:00:14,146 --> 00:00:18,801
Now let's imagine I can basically
translate this viewpoint by amount Tx

6
00:00:18,801 --> 00:00:22,783
just in the X-axis,
no change in y to another location here.

7
00:00:22,783 --> 00:00:27,771
So now, I have another camera, which
is located just Tx in this direction

8
00:00:27,771 --> 00:00:31,560
farther from where the original
one was at zero, zero.

9
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,162
So both the cameras
are exactly the same.

10
00:00:33,162 --> 00:00:35,972
They're just now translated
by a certain distance.

11
00:00:35,972 --> 00:00:39,455
And I have of course, a new camera
which has its own coordinate axis.

12
00:00:39,455 --> 00:00:43,999
So right camera is simply just looking
at the same view you just translated by

13
00:00:43,999 --> 00:00:45,561
x along the x directions.

14
00:00:45,561 --> 00:00:46,885
Everything else is the same.

15
00:00:46,885 --> 00:00:51,229
In this case, the focal length is
the same orientation is the same,

16
00:00:51,229 --> 00:00:52,736
everything is the same.

17
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:54,964
Let's look at this scene from the top.

18
00:00:54,964 --> 00:00:56,985
Just looking at the X-Z plane.

19
00:00:56,985 --> 00:00:59,376
So here again, I have a left camera.

20
00:00:59,376 --> 00:01:01,767
Here now,
I have actually listed the focal length.

21
00:01:01,767 --> 00:01:02,975
Right camera.

22
00:01:02,975 --> 00:01:04,926
Again, we know the focal length here.

23
00:01:04,926 --> 00:01:09,430
So, of course, the two cameras are
translated by distance Tx along x-axis.

24
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:12,216
Tx is also know as the baseline.

25
00:01:12,216 --> 00:01:14,144
We have a point, X, Y, Z.

26
00:01:14,144 --> 00:01:18,854
Of course, that point appears and
this viewpoint here we'll point,

27
00:01:18,854 --> 00:01:22,689
call this Xl for the left image,
a location just an x-axis.

28
00:01:22,689 --> 00:01:26,023
Looking down on X, Y is pointing
outwards, we're not change,

29
00:01:26,023 --> 00:01:28,385
looking any changes in y on this one.

30
00:01:28,385 --> 00:01:31,987
So then that point,
appears as Xr on this viewpoint here.

31
00:01:31,987 --> 00:01:37,282
Question now of course is if I
know Xl and Xr, can I compute Z?

32
00:01:37,282 --> 00:01:41,484
Which would basically be the depth
of this point here, right?

33
00:01:41,484 --> 00:01:46,011
Now this is where actually we can
bring back simple geometry to help us.

34
00:01:46,011 --> 00:01:50,470
So let's look at this again back
into our 3D simple stereo system.

35
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:53,954
I have a point in 3D,
that ray of light goes from this camera,

36
00:01:53,954 --> 00:01:56,232
goes through this image and
hits that and

37
00:01:56,232 --> 00:02:00,050
another one across just like we
saw in the previous example.

38
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:05,732
And of course, that's Xl and there
would be an X right here for this one.

39
00:02:05,732 --> 00:02:07,706
Same kind of setup as before.

40
00:02:07,706 --> 00:02:09,110
Now we can actually compute,

41
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:12,605
you link the same equations we looked
at at the beginning of this lecture.

42
00:02:12,605 --> 00:02:18,604
That Xl basically would
be f X over Z and

43
00:02:18,604 --> 00:02:21,800
yl would be Y over Z.

44
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,404
Right?

45
00:02:22,404 --> 00:02:23,750
That's for this point here.

46
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,724
And in this case, of course,
you can also do the Y.

47
00:02:25,724 --> 00:02:28,394
In this case of course,
yl is the same as yr.

48
00:02:28,394 --> 00:02:33,340
The same point in the right camera,
Xr is different and Xl is not.

49
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:34,965
So here is one thing we can start doing.

50
00:02:34,965 --> 00:02:40,538
Basically, we know that this
camera is moved by a distance Tx.

51
00:02:40,538 --> 00:02:44,137
Well, that suggests something
to us we can actually use.

52
00:02:44,137 --> 00:02:48,372
That basically, if I was to move
this point here by that same amount,

53
00:02:48,372 --> 00:02:51,890
nothing else is changing,
the same point would appear.

54
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:56,020
So, in essence, the converse of me
moving the camera by distance Tx is

55
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:59,240
me moving this point in
the other direction minus Tx and

56
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,348
actually taking another picture.

57
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:05,416
So now basically saying is rather than
taking two pictures by moving the camera

58
00:03:05,416 --> 00:03:08,865
by distance Tx, I'm just moving
the point minus Tx in the opposite

59
00:03:08,865 --> 00:03:11,610
direction and taking another pictures.

60
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:14,054
So basically,
that means is now I have a point T,

61
00:03:14,054 --> 00:03:16,452
a point here that should
be visible in this one.

62
00:03:16,452 --> 00:03:18,215
So we don't have to look at this camera.

63
00:03:18,215 --> 00:03:22,654
And of course,
now this ray is coming in this way,

64
00:03:22,654 --> 00:03:29,222
implying that Xr is actually moved
there, same translation as minus Tx.

65
00:03:29,222 --> 00:03:32,611
So now, I can basically compute Xr.

66
00:03:32,611 --> 00:03:37,318
Again f,
X is now just this location x here minus

67
00:03:37,318 --> 00:03:40,390
Tx in X direction divided by Z.

68
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:42,991
So that's basically, becomes my Xr.

69
00:03:42,991 --> 00:03:46,009
Yr is the same,
we haven't changed anything in the Y.

70
00:03:46,009 --> 00:03:50,896
So basically, this starts giving me
a very interesting way of comparing both

71
00:03:50,896 --> 00:03:54,970
Xl and Xr which are now different
just by the top numerator.
