00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:03,910
In our last lesson,
we learned how to identify and

2
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:08,510
clean up dirty data as we build
up our optimal analytic data set.

3
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:13,100
However, once the data is clean it
might not be properly formatted for

4
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:15,510
us to use in building models.

5
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:20,360
For instance, we might want to build a
model forecasting product sales by month

6
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:22,290
over the next six months.

7
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:25,900
If the data we have available
is daily product sales,

8
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:30,210
than we're going to need to sum
this daily data up for each month.

9
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:33,050
That's one example of formatting data.

10
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:34,180
In this lesson,

11
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:38,880
we will cover how to identify when your
data needs to be formatted differently.

12
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:42,300
And how to massage the data or
arrogate it to the form required.
