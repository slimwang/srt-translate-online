Let me ask you a similar quiz,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:09,000
but this time let's say that x equals zero, y equals 10, and our heading direction is π/4,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
which is the same as 45 degrees.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Again Δt equals 1 second, and we move at 5 units per second.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Then we turn by -π/4 per second.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Don't worry about the units, seconds. It's just hear to make it mathematically consistent.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So please plug your best estimates into the boxes over here.
