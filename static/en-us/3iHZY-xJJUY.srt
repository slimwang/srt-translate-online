1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Okay, here's my solution to the 3rd substitution.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
We've got our new string that takes these name substitution variables,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
and this time, it uses our function parameters and substitutes those into the string.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Let's make sure this works.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I run this with a couple things and it says, I'm maverick.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
My real name is steve, but my friends call me maverick. Cool.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Now as you can see, this one is more complex,

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
and it's starting to resemble something that might be useful to us.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Of course, this whole string got cut off a little bit, but it's over here on the edge.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Alright. Okay, let's talk about how to use this in practice now.
