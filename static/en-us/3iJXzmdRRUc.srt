00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,316
Now that their sound manager is initialized. The next thing we need to take

2
00:00:03,316 --> 00:00:06,980
care of is actually loading our sound effects so that they're ready to play.

3
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:11,134
Now the Web Audio API is similar to the image loading process that we use for

4
00:00:11,134 --> 00:00:16,024
Canvas. We only load images asynchronously. Now for essentially the same

5
00:00:16,024 --> 00:00:19,608
reasons. So what we're going to do is check if the sound has already been

6
00:00:19,608 --> 00:00:24,496
loaded. And if it is, we call our call back function. If its not we kick off a

7
00:00:24,496 --> 00:00:28,030
load in the form of an XML a to the p request, and then assign a callback

8
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:34,273
function for once the load has completed. Finally we're going to return to

9
00:00:34,273 --> 00:00:38,010
actual clip data either way. Now here's some skeleton code to get you up and

10
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:42,209
running. What we'd like you to do is to fill in the code So let them performs

11
00:00:42,209 --> 00:00:46,081
the Asynchronous loading that I just desribed
