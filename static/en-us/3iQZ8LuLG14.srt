Consider a network of the following type. A variable A, that is binary,

2
00:00:05,568 --> 00:00:10,640
connects to three variables X1, X2, and X3 that are also

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:15,529
binary. The probability of A is 0.5, and

4
00:00:15,529 --> 00:00:20,516
for all variable Xi we have the probability of Xi

5
00:00:20,516 --> 00:00:25,750
given A is 0.2, and the probability of Xi given

6
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:29,370
knot A equals 0.6. I would like to

7
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:31,800
know from you the probability of A, given that

8
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:37,520
we observe X1, X2, and knot X3.

9
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,000
Notice that these variables over here are conditionally independent, given A.
