1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,070
All right, so even though that
example that we just talked

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:05,100
about is something that
I drew up on the screen.

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:08,380
I decided I would actually turn
that into a real example and

4
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:12,190
ran it in Burlap with the implementation
of MLIRL that's there.

5
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:13,620
And this is the result.

6
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:14,221
It's actually kind of neat.

7
00:00:14,221 --> 00:00:18,390
So, here's the trajectory and
the MDP that we ran in, and

8
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:24,360
here's how MLIRL decided to actually
assign rewards to the different colors.

9
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:27,080
So you can see that the cell
that's green is assigned very high

10
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:28,070
positive reward.

11
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:33,460
So it is drawing the agent over to that
that is a positive place to be and

12
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:35,940
you can see that the blue squares
are actually fairly negative.

13
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:38,740
The ones that correspond to
these blue puddles are given

14
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:43,550
a not insignificant negative reward so
they are actually avoided on purpose.

15
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:47,548
One of the things that's interesting
is as we talked about there's no set of

16
00:00:47,548 --> 00:00:51,234
evidence in this trajectory that red
is good or bad and in fact it ends up

17
00:00:51,234 --> 00:00:55,123
getting pretty much the same reward
as the background, basically zero.

18
00:00:55,123 --> 00:00:59,105
One thing that's a little bit more
interesting is that it actually

19
00:00:59,105 --> 00:01:03,150
concluded that this orange
strip is somewhat aversive.

20
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:07,765
It gave it a slightly stronger negative
reward to try to get it to avoid it and

21
00:01:07,765 --> 00:01:10,355
I guess that was because the
demonstrated path didn't have the agent

22
00:01:10,355 --> 00:01:12,645
spending multiple steps there and
it could have.

23
00:01:12,645 --> 00:01:13,737
>> Yeah
>> But it didn't so

24
00:01:13,737 --> 00:01:14,989
maybe it was a bad place.

25
00:01:14,989 --> 00:01:16,755
>> Right there's lots of
ways that it could have got.

26
00:01:16,755 --> 00:01:19,434
You could have come all the way over
to the origin going straight down.

27
00:01:19,434 --> 00:01:20,067
>> Yep.
>> And

28
00:01:20,067 --> 00:01:23,753
since it didn't it maybe try to
pick a path that minimized orange.

29
00:01:23,753 --> 00:01:25,492
>> Right and so
it just kind of went with that and

30
00:01:25,492 --> 00:01:27,130
gave it a slightly negative reward.

31
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:29,970
If we gave it a bunch more examples and
we could see negative

32
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:33,340
whether that rather than orange really
was consistently a good thing or

33
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:38,330
a bad thing,it would get fixed
with more training data but

34
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:43,730
it's pretty neat how much you can pull
out of actually one single example.

35
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:45,880
>> That actually that's
actually kind of cool and

36
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,740
I do like that gets slightly negative.

37
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:50,840
It doesn't believe that you're
trying to avoid orange just that

38
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,820
maybe you are because if you
weren't trying to avoid orange.

39
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:57,790
I guess if I thought about all the path
that could get me from where I started

40
00:01:57,790 --> 00:01:59,220
to where in that up.

41
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:02,786
There's a lot of them that involve
touching orange more than once and

42
00:02:02,786 --> 00:02:06,843
since you didn't pick that one maybe
you're trying to avoid touching more and

43
00:02:06,843 --> 00:02:10,591
more than once and since are all the
same thing that would be evidence that

44
00:02:10,591 --> 00:02:14,188
it's something to avoid although
it's only very slight evidence.

45
00:02:14,188 --> 00:02:16,788
So that turns it into slightly
negative that's kind of cool

46
00:02:16,788 --> 00:02:17,910
that's kind of amazing.

47
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:19,610
>> Yeah I think so too I mean and

48
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:22,240
one of the things that I really
like about this is the notion that

49
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:26,580
It's actually learning, not just from
the positive example of where it went,

50
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:30,050
but in a sense from all the different
paths that it didn't take.

51
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:30,840
>> Right.
>> Right and

52
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:34,310
so the fact that it didn't hit blue,
it used that as data.

53
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:40,610
So it actually is combining this notion
of your planning in the full MBP.

54
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:43,190
Well, we get to see one
trajectory through that, so

55
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:45,530
what is that telling us about
other parts of the MBP?

56
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:48,440
>> So
I guess the short version of this is

57
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:51,990
you can communicate a lot even
by communicating a little.

58
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:54,103
And an even shorter version
of that is less is more.

59
00:02:54,103 --> 00:02:56,055
>> Well no I wouldn't say that at all.

60
00:02:56,055 --> 00:02:58,730
>> [LAUGH] But you just did.

61
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:00,190
>> I did, but I did then I read it and

62
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:02,720
I realized that that's not what you
meant or that's not what I wanted you to

63
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,650
mean so yes that you can
communicate a lot with a little.

64
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:08,490
Less is enough maybe.

65
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:09,410
>> I like that.

66
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:12,460
That's like eight is enough and eight
is less the nine so less is enough.

67
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:13,560
I like that.

68
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:17,760
>> And that pretty much sums up the the
three Cs that I wanted to talk about.
