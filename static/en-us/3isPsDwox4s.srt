00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:03,230
Hey, Dan, we finished the settings. 
Do you want to check it out?

2
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:04,640
Oh, great.

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,110
Wait, what's with all 
this stuff right here?

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,420
I'm glad you asked. 
All this stuff will help me demonstrate

5
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:13,260
the power of implicit intents,
leveraging other apps

6
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:15,630
to get functionality 
for your app for free.

7
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:20,040
For example, why would you 
write a bar code scanning app

8
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:22,149
when you can just launch 
an intent to do it for you.

9
00:00:22,149 --> 00:00:23,358
(crunching glass)

10
00:00:23,548 --> 00:00:25,858
Or a camera app, 
when you can just launch

11
00:00:25,858 --> 00:00:27,343
an intent to fire a photo.

12
00:00:27,993 --> 00:00:28,953
(glass shatters)

13
00:00:28,953 --> 00:00:31,203
And of course, it would make no sense

14
00:00:31,203 --> 00:00:33,314
to write a phone app just to dial 
a phone number.

15
00:00:33,314 --> 00:00:35,949
- You would just call the intent.
- Wait, I need that.

16
00:00:36,364 --> 00:00:40,840
In other words, don't reinvent the wheel.
Lazy programmers make fewer mistakes.

17
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:43,610
Now, let's go implement 
an implicit intent.

18
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,500
Raydo? 
Dan's being implicit again.
