1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:03,670
The first statement, a packet filtering
firewall is typically configured

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:06,520
to filter packets going
in both directions.

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:07,410
This is true.

4
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:10,490
In fact,
all firewalls regardless of which type

5
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:13,900
is configured to check
traffic in both directions.

6
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:17,580
The second statement, a prime
disadvantage of an application-level

7
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:21,670
gateway is the additional processing
overhead on each connection.

8
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:22,590
This is true.

9
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:24,210
We just discussed this.

10
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:27,970
The third statement, a packet filtering
firewall can decide if the current

11
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:32,350
packet is allowed based on another
packet that it has just examined.

12
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:36,120
This is false because a packet
filtering firewall makes decisions

13
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,480
based only on the current packet.

14
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,340
The fourth statement, a stateful
inspection firewall needs to keep track

15
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:47,080
of information of an active connection
in order to decide the current packet.

16
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:50,970
This is true, because a stateful
inspection firewall decides on a packet

17
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:52,980
based on the context of
the current connection.
