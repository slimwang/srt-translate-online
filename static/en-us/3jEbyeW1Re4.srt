00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:03,110
When creating axis in d3,

2
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:08,760
I would say the hard part is finding out the proper scales for both your axes.

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:15,080
Once you have them, as we do here, creating a d3 axis object is quite simple.

4
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:17,870
Since our code's getting slightly more verbose.

5
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:20,992
At least compared to the Dimple JS code we had earlier.

6
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:24,020
I've added comments to each section of the d3 code,

7
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:28,220
to describe what functions performed with N.

8
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:32,320
I've also moved the debugger down from the top of the file to right before we

9
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,980
create our axes.

10
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:40,970
In this case, the axis function.axis is in d3's svg module.

11
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:45,510
To create an svg axis, and we need to specify a scale

12
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:50,400
using .scale to tell d3, what the range of the axis represents.

13
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,900
In this case passing in time_scale for our x axis.

14
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:54,860
And since d3's so

15
00:00:54,860 --> 00:01:00,940
flexible, we can chain other functions to our axis, to customize its appearance.

16
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:05,200
In this case, we want our ticks to be, every two years.

17
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:10,850
In this case to specify years we go into the d3 time module and specify years.

18
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:16,200
If we wanted a finer grain we could specify a different time object.

19
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,390
For example, let's say days.

20
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:23,000
But in our case, since the World Cup happens only every four years,

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,240
specifying every tick mark every two years, should be more than enough.

22
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:30,460
And here we do the same thing for our y axis.

23
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:32,590
Passing the scale of count_scale,

24
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:36,590
which represents our attendance range and domain, and

25
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:41,080
since this is the y axis, we specified that we want to orient it on the left.

26
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:45,980
So we now have our d3 axis objects, but

27
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:49,660
what we don't have, is the axis in svg on our page.
