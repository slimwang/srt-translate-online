00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:05,680
Let's do yet another quiz on the BTB and BHT interaction. Same BHT and BTB

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:11,690
as in the previous quiz, the same program. The question for you now

3
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:16,350
is which BTB entry do we use for each of these instructions. Leave the

4
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:20,820
field for the instruction blank if none of the BTB entries is used by it.
