00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,507
Here are the three solutions written in logarithmic form. Nice work, if you got

2
00:00:04,507 --> 00:00:09,071
all three right. Now, some of these were tough, so it's okay if you didn't get

3
00:00:09,071 --> 00:00:13,590
all of them right. Let's walk through each of them. For the first one, we'll

4
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:19,040
have our base be 10. And we'll have our answer be 5. When we take the log with

5
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:24,738
base 10 of some number, we'll get 5. It means that this number must be a

6
00:00:24,738 --> 00:00:31,812
100000. The log base 10 of a 100000 equals 5. Its the power that we raise 10 to

7
00:00:31,812 --> 00:00:36,872
in order to get a 100000. For the second one we'll use the same process. We

8
00:00:36,872 --> 00:00:42,110
have a base of 4 so this is the logarithm with a base 4. The result of our

9
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:46,540
logarithm equals negative 3. Its the exponent and this is one sixty fourth here

10
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:51,380
at the argument for our logarithm. It's the number that we take the logarithm

11
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:55,822
of. And finally, for the last one, we use the same technique. Our base of our

12
00:00:55,822 --> 00:01:01,394
logarithm is 2, since this base is 2. The result of our logarithm is x. This is

13
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:08,766
the exponent. And we're taking log base 2 of the number 3 to get x. Now, keep

14
00:01:08,766 --> 00:01:11,670
in mind, in this last equation, we weren't really solving for x. We were just

15
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:16,360
trying to write this in logarithmic form. It turns out that this number x is

16
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:21,599
really equal to log base 2 of 3. Now the logarithm in your calculator can't get

17
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:27,284
this number. The log in your calculator has a base of 10. But there are other

18
00:01:27,284 --> 00:01:31,020
ways to get bases of 2. We won't cover that in this course, but if you're

19
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:32,870
interested, do some research.
