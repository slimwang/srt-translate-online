1
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:05,050
Remember, the entropy is the sum over all the class labels

2
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:12,640
of negative P, log base 2, P.

3
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:17,560
So what's the entropy of the children once we make this split?

4
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:22,330
So I have two class labels that are available to me, the slow and the fast.

5
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:27,420
We'll start with slow, so Pslow is two-thirds.

6
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:28,560
So that's what I'm going to put in here.

7
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:37,060
Negative two-thirds, log base two of two-thirds.

8
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:39,870
And now we do the calculation for the fast component.

9
00:00:41,302 --> 00:00:50,070
So Pfast is one third, so this negative one third, log base 2 one third.

10
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:57,080
Now you do the calculation and

11
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:03,660
write the decimal value of this expression into the box there.

12
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:07,060
Remember if you need to do the log base 2 calculation,

13
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:10,530
one of the things that I found really helpful is the math module in Python.
