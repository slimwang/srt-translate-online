1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:02,850
So we've now made some changes
to our envision prototype.

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:06,210
We've add in the check boxes and
we've changed our home screen.

3
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:10,160
Now in order to do user research
with it we've put it on a phone and

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,000
we'll bring in users to test with it.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,870
Johnathan, how do we go about
putting it onto this phone?

6
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:20,220
>> It's simple Jay, all you need to do
is click on the Sharelink button, and

7
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:21,890
click SMS.

8
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:23,150
When you click the share link button,

9
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:26,640
you'll have an option to choose how
you want to share your project.

10
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,520
Simply click the SMS button, and turn
the phone number that you'd like to send

11
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:34,870
a text to, and it'll automatically
send the text directly to your phone.

12
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:37,780
When you open up the text,
it'll have a link

13
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:41,540
that'll allow you to download
the prototype directly onto your phone.

14
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:43,600
>> And now we're going to bring in
Jeremy to start testing our app.
