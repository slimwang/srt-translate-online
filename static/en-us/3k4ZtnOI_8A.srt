1
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:03,490
So basically what we're
trying to figure out

2
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:08,690
is how our model changes based on
removing variables from the analysis.

3
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:12,250
To figure this out you just
need to remove variables

4
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:16,850
that have too many categories
within one predictor variable.

5
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,650
So how do you actually do this?

6
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:21,790
What I want to do is start with
what we've had built out already.

7
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:25,310
Which is the input data tool,
connected to our select tool,

8
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:27,970
which is connected to
our create samples tool.

9
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:31,880
After this part, I'm going to work and
tweak our actual model.

10
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:35,270
The first thing I'm going to do is I'm
going to bring in the field summary tool

11
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:38,900
and look at the categorical
variables with

12
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:42,080
how many uniques values
they have within them.

13
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,960
What I want to do is
actually just look for

14
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:48,190
the results for
only my different categorical variables.

15
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:52,976
So my customer's segment,
my income, redeemer,

16
00:00:52,976 --> 00:00:58,060
region, status,
region and status fields.

17
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:02,640
I'm then going to bring in a browse
tool after the i or interactive result.

18
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,970
If you look at these different
categorical variables, we can see that

19
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:12,140
the customer segment income, and
region fields all have way too many

20
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:17,580
different categories to effectively use
with their logistic regression model.

21
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:20,840
The way to deal with this is
either combine them into a fewer

22
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:25,460
number of groups, or we should simply
just deselect all of it for our model.

23
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:29,580
So, in this situation
what I ask you to do

24
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:31,580
is if there's more than four categories.

25
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:37,000
Let's just deselect and not use that
field for our logistic progression,

26
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,900
but what I do want to notice
is that our redeemer field and

27
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:43,950
status fields, those fit
the category and they're good to go.

28
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:46,770
So let's now deselect
that field summary tool.

29
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:49,430
I'm going to go back to our
predictive category and

30
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:52,010
bring in a logistic progression tool.

31
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:56,310
Name the model and just like before
I'm going to select my target variable

32
00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:01,270
as a redeemer field and then my
different potential predictor variables

33
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:05,680
which I'm going to choose as spend,
status,

34
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,660
stays per year, total days stayed and
years of loyalty.

35
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:15,050
Let me run this model now reducing
the total number of different potential

36
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:18,160
predictor variables and
let's view if the results change at all.

37
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:24,460
As you can see the r squared
value is now at 0.5865.

38
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:28,790
And, as well, we have three
statistically significant predictor

39
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:32,000
variables not including
the intercept value.

40
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:37,210
This is definitely one very valid
way to determine the optimal

41
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:39,120
predictor variables.

42
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,930
Yet, it is a very manual and
time consuming process.

43
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:47,750
Now what we're going to do is leverage
the stepwise regression technique

44
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,510
to automate this process.
