1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:02,670
The results yield an expected value for

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:06,410
price given the characteristics of our diamond, and

3
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:08,986
the upper and lower bounds of a 95%

4
00:00:08,986 --> 00:00:12,560
confidence level. Note, because this is a linear

5
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:16,680
model, predict is just multiplying each model coefficient

6
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,950
by each value in our data. It turns

7
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:22,980
out that this diamond is a touch pricier

8
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,390
than the expected value under the full model,

9
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:31,998
though it is by no means outside of the 95% confidence interval.

10
00:00:31,998 --> 00:00:36,920
Blue now has by most accounts a better reputation than diamond SE.info

11
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:41,080
however. And reputation is worth a lot in a business that relies

12
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:45,470
on easy to forge certificates in which the non-expert can be easily fooled.

13
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,650
So, while this model might give you a sense of whether your diamond is a ripoff

14
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:56,460
against diamondSE.info diamonds, it's not clear that diamondSE.info

15
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:59,940
should be regarded as the universal source of truth

16
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:01,710
over whether the price of a diamond is

17
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:07,508
reasonable. Nonetheless, to have the expected price and diamondassay.info

18
00:01:07,508 --> 00:01:10,150
with a 95% interval, is a lot more

19
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:12,740
information than we had about the price we should

20
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:15,453
be willing to pay for a diamond before we started this exercise.
