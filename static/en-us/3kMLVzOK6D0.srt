1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,870
>> Okay, Michael, so you seemed like you knew what you were doing

2
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:06,800
so I thought I would verify that by giving you a very easy quiz.

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,109
>> This doesn't look so easy.

4
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:12,800
>> It is easy, so here's the quiz. To help you I've written up both the

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:19,320
Bellmans equation and the update that we would give to utilities. I neglected

6
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,350
to write the little hats and everything because I just don't think you need that

7
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:25,470
but these are the two equations that you need to be able to think about.

8
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:28,500
This is just what we've written up before. And I've written down the

9
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,960
grid world we've been playing with the entire time. And I want you to

10
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:36,760
figure out how value iteration would work from the first iteration and the

11
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:40,750
second iteration for this particular state here that I marked with an X, okay?

12
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:41,840
>> Okay.

13
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,920
>> Alright, and there are a little more information you

14
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,530
need to go. Gamma in this case is going to be

15
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:48,540
equal to one half. Mainly because it's easy to do

16
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:51,150
the math if you do it that way. The rewards,

17
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:54,830
just to remind you, for all of the states except for the two goal

18
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:56,775
or absorbing states is going to be minus

19
00:00:56,775 --> 00:01:01,090
0.04. And my initial arbitrary utilities for

20
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:05,620
all of the states, is going to be 0, except in the two absorbing

21
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:10,454
states where I already know the utilities are 1 and minus 1 respectively, Okay?

22
00:01:10,454 --> 00:01:10,750
>> Okay.

23
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:11,610
>> You got all that?

24
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:13,310
>> I think so.

25
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:14,155
>> You sure?

26
00:01:14,155 --> 00:01:16,540
>> [LAUGH] I feel confident

27
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:22,240
that I'm going to slip up, but Okay, yeah, I think I can take a stab at this.

28
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,394
>> Alright, so gamma's one half, rewards are minus 0.04, arbitrary

29
00:01:26,394 --> 00:01:30,146
starting utilities at times 0 is 0, except here at the absorbing

30
00:01:30,146 --> 00:01:34,800
states. Tell me how the utility here will evolve after one step,

31
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:38,590
or one iteration, and two steps, or two iterations. Okay then, go.
