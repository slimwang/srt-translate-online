00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So we talked about coin flips, and we flipped some coins.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Now, I want to flip many coins including this 2-dollar coin

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
whose country of origin I just don't remember.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Perhaps you can post on the forum where this 2-dollar coin might be from.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
So let's ask an easy quiz. Suppose we do 2 coin flips.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I would like to know how many outcomes of these 2 coin flips are there

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
and which number of heads equals the number of tails

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
which in this example means you would have head exactly once and tails exactly once.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Give me that number.
