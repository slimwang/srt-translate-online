00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,230
When you want to use a database
in your application,

2
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:06,375
first you need to create
the database and give it a name.

3
00:00:06,375 --> 00:00:09,240
You'll use the create
database command for this.

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:12,270
The name you give it here is the same
name you'll use to connect to

5
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:14,360
the database from your code.

6
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:17,850
The opposite of create in SQL is drop.

7
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:19,300
I'm not sure why.

8
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:22,190
Maybe database programmers
used to be really clumsy.

9
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:26,280
Anyway, the way to remove
a database is drop database.

10
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:29,330
And the way to remove
a table is drop table.

11
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:30,920
All of these commands have options.

12
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:33,670
You can look up in the documentation
if you ever need them.

13
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:36,630
When you drop a database or
table, there's no confirmation.

14
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:38,830
No, did you really mean to do that,
warning.

15
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:40,750
So, don't do it if you
don't really mean it.
