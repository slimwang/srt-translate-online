1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
[Thrun] And the answer is simply 0, without much math.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
The word "perfect" occurs in movie, but the word "storm" has never been seen before.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Therefore, the maximum likelihood estimate we will assign a 0 probability to the word "storm,"

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,000
which will make the total product of the various factors involved in "storm" just 0.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
That is not the case for song.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
There is a non-zero probability for "perfect" and a non-zero probability for "storm."

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Hence, it will have a non-zero probability.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
After normalization this will become 1 and this will become 0.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
So without much math I can calculate the correct posterior

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
under the maximum likelihood model, which of course is disappointing

11
00:00:41,000 --> 99:59:59,999
because Perfect Storm is actually a movie title.
