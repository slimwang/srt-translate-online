00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:11,050
>> So, let's add to our diagram a a rectangle for leaf and

2
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:17,140
make it a specialization of the tree class. That is, tree is a generalization

3
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:21,270
of leaf. And we indicate that by a line between the two.

4
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:26,740
And there's a little open triangle at the, at the tree end of the relationship.

5
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:30,530
What that meant was, that we took the leaf attribute outside,

6
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:35,690
that was inside the tree class. And made it now, a separate, separate class
