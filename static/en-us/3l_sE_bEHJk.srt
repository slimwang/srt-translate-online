00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:03,190
A review, which can also be called an inspection or

2
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:07,500
a walkthrough, is a systematic reading of a software development artifact.

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:11,040
Reviews can be a cost-effective way of finding defects in the artifact, and

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:16,260
reviews complement other verification techniques such as testing and proofs.

5
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:19,440
That is, they find, tend to find problems that the other techniques don't find.

6
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:24,880
The purpose of a review is to detect defects, which, depending on the artifact,

7
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,250
might be called bugs or faults.

8
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:29,950
Reviews may also be used to check adherence to corporate or

9
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:31,380
governmental standards.

10
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:34,920
Reviews should not be used to educate staff members, report status or

11
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,350
fix the detected problems.

12
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,170
Reviews can be applied to different kinds of artifacts produced during

13
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:42,540
the software development.

14
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:46,430
These include requirements documents, specifications, architectural designs,

15
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:51,639
detail designs, new code, fixes, test plans, and documentation itself.

16
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:54,960
Effective reviews are systematic.

17
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,580
It is not sufficent, sufficient to just have a meeting and

18
00:00:57,580 --> 00:00:58,760
talk about an artifact.

19
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:02,110
People's time is expensive and group meetings are especially so.

20
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:04,800
Here are the recommended steps to take for an effective review.
