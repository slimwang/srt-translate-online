00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
It's relatively easy to get some reasonable values for the time constants,

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
but it's pretty hard to estimate the heating value.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
There's just something that we can do with this curve.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
The reasonable value for this upper equilibrium is 1200 K.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Just from the color of the flames, the wood should be burning at this temperature.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Now, let's say that the ambient temperature is 300 K, the time constant for the heat loss is 2 minutes,

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:36,000
the time constant for burning is half an hour, and we've got a wood density of 100 kg/mÂ².

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
From this data, compute the value of h--the heating value

9
00:00:41,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and enter that as an integer number of K/kg/mÂ².
