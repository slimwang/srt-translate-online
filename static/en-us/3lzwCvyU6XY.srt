1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,942
So, personality psychologists do in fact use the kinds of measures that Lauren

2
00:00:02,942 --> 00:00:07,544
and Susan just discussed to do many different things. In fact, it's the job of

3
00:00:07,544 --> 00:00:11,986
the personality psychologist to assess personality. And if they're researchers,

4
00:00:11,986 --> 00:00:16,975
they do this either quantitatively or qualitatively. And quantitative

5
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:21,750
personality assessment involves behavior observations or self reports.

6
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:27,950
Qualitative assessment of personality involves interviews or projective test.

7
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:33,390
So, researchers of personality might then look at how personality is associated

8
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:38,750
with or related to outcomes like health, or career interest, our creativity, or

9
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:45,604
marital satisfaction. Now clinical psychologists, who study personality, may

10
00:00:45,604 --> 00:00:49,820
use personality assessment to diagnose personality disorders, and come up with

11
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:56,748
a treatment plan to help them. Now let's talk about where personality comes

12
00:00:56,748 --> 00:00:57,589
from.
