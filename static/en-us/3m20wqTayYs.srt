1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,890
Okay Michael, so here's the first sort
of real example that I want to give you

2
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:06,540
and it's going to be in peer teaching,
which hopefully is near and

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:10,130
dear to some of our listener's hearts so
here's the idea.

4
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:13,000
The idea is that we've got a student.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,920
Let's called the student curly,
and we've got a teacher.

6
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:20,040
Let's called his teachers smooth and
there's a bunch of questions, okay,

7
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:20,650
on some subject.

8
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:21,970
Pick a subject you like.

9
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:22,520
>> Dinosaurs.

10
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:23,070
>> Dinosaurs.

11
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:27,360
Okay good, so if you want your questions
on dinosaurs, you should draw dinosaurs.

12
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,120
>> Okay.

13
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:31,560
There I've drawn
a dinosaur in white ink.

14
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:35,190
Okay, so what we have here is we have
a bunch of questions about dinosaurs

15
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:37,036
from the
>> It's a snow dynamicus.

16
00:00:37,036 --> 00:00:40,485
>> A snow
>> [LAUGH] Okay, let's try that again.

17
00:00:40,485 --> 00:00:43,300
So what we have is we have a bunch
of questions, and let's just say for

18
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:47,380
the sake of this discussion that
we can sort them, and order them

19
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:50,940
from really really easy questions
to really really hard questions.

20
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:53,940
And what I really mean
is that down here,

21
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:57,560
people with very little knowledge about
dinosaurs can answer people up here.

22
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,690
You really have to have
learned a lot about dinosaurs,

23
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:03,380
and it kind of moves between
the spectrum from easy to hard.

24
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:04,200
That make sense?

25
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,880
>> Yeah,
I guess as a coarse approximation.

26
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,930
>> Sure, and so
what we're trying to figure out and

27
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:13,890
this is important the goal
here is to figure out

28
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:18,550
what incentives we can give to both
the student and to the teacher.

29
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:21,620
So that learning happens over time so
the goal is learning and

30
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:23,500
what we need to do is design mechanism.

31
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:27,330
And mechanism in this setting means
like a payoff function essentially.

32
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:28,800
>> Yeah,
because we're talking game theory, so

33
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,630
in the end we're always going to be
talking about some kind of payoff.

34
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:36,340
Some way providing utility for taking
some kinds of actions in the world.

35
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:39,450
>> Now, it's important course this
is not just simply a one shot game.

36
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:42,950
This really is a case that room will
be taking actions over a period

37
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:45,900
of time because of course learning is
going to happen over a period of time.

38
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:48,440
And we want to figure out how
we're going to get someone to

39
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,370
kind of get out these questions.

40
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:50,460
This is all we've got right.

41
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,140
We've got learning, we got a teacher,

42
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:55,060
we got a bunch of questions we know
they're easier or easy and hard and

43
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:58,100
we're going to try to figure out
what we want the teacher to do.

44
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:01,870
And what we want to learner to do so
the learning happen, okay.

45
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:05,790
So we need to design a mechanism
that will ensure the goal.

46
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:09,690
>> And
just to be clear is your assumption that

47
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:13,440
answering questions actually helps
you learn or is this just assessment?

48
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,950
>> This is a sort of assessment.

49
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:19,600
This is assessment but of course if
you can reliably answer questions

50
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,680
then it suggests that
you know something.

51
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,230
Okay.
>> Does that make sense?

52
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:26,600
>> Yeah, I guess I'm just
wondering to what end, right?

53
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:30,450
So, what kind of questions
should be asked.

54
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:32,290
>> Ones that help me to figure
out that you've learned.

55
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:33,150
>> That you've learned.

56
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:33,870
>> Yeah.
>> Okay.

57
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:36,770
>> Now,
other stuff can be happening here.

58
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:38,780
And there's you know
whole complicated things.

59
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:40,680
Readings can happen in between.

60
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,090
There can be tutorials or whatever but

61
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:45,550
we're trying to make this game really
sort of simple to illustrate the idea.

62
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:47,980
So in between questions
things might happen.

63
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:48,520
>> Okay.
>> And

64
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,860
perhaps answering the question
requires that you go off and

65
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:52,900
you do some reading or do some work.

66
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,200
>> Which could promote some learning.

67
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,270
>> Which could promote some learning.

68
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:56,256
Some of these questions might be.

69
00:02:57,490 --> 00:03:01,940
Take implement five supervised
learning algorithms on two

70
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:06,550
datasets that are interesting run them
and write a talker to say for example.

71
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:08,480
>> My gosh,
that's a terrible assignment.

72
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,240
>> Yeah, but
you will learn something in.

73
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,410
>> Yeah, you'll learn that some
people give terrible assignments

74
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:13,540
that cause you to learn.

75
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:14,860
I think that's what
really important here.

76
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:15,440
>> So are you with me?

77
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,470
Kind of understand what it is
we're trying to accomplish here?

78
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:18,080
>> I think so, yeah.

79
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,230
>> Okay, cool.
>> So let me give you a proposal for

80
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:24,740
some instances and you tell me
what you think is going to happen.
