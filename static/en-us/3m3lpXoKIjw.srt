1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So case 1, the code that didn't cover is infeasible code.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
The second case is the code that we believe to be feasible but which isn't worth covering.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
A code might not be worth covering because it's very hard to trigger and it's very simple.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
So let me give a quick example. The res variable is the result of the command to format a disc.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
And if that operation fails, we'll just going to abort the program.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
And so what might be the case is that we lack an appropriate fault injection tool

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
that will let us easily simulate the failure of a format disc call.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
And in furthermore, the response of the code in this case is to

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
simply abort the execution of the program.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
If those two things are the case, then we might be perfectly happy not to test this code branch,

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
and the reason is the abort code, which is going to terminate the entire application,

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
is presumably something that was tested elsewhere, so we don't have any real suspicion

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
that it might fail and there's no reason to think that calling it from a location like this

14
00:00:45,000 --> 99:59:59,999
would act any differently or will probably be okay.
