00:00:00,018 --> 00:00:03,522
The third algorithm we'll cover today is called a histogram. Now, what's a histogram?

2
00:00:03,522 --> 00:00:08,508
It's a means of categorizing and usually displaying data that varies with a particular measurement.

3
00:00:08,508 --> 00:00:12,532
In practice, to create a histogram, we take a measurement for each item in a population

4
00:00:12,555 --> 00:00:15,484
and then place those measurements into a set of bins that we define,

5
00:00:15,491 --> 00:00:18,087
where each bin covers a certain range of measurements.

6
00:00:18,094 --> 00:00:20,724
This is much easier to explain with an example.

7
00:00:20,724 --> 00:00:24,904
I'm recording this lecture at Udacity headquarters in Palo Alto, California.

8
00:00:24,911 --> 00:00:27,786
So let's say I walk out on the street in Palo Alto,

9
00:00:27,786 --> 00:00:32,552
and record the height of each of the next 100 adults that happen to walk by.

10
00:00:32,575 --> 00:00:35,445
What that gets me is a list of 100 measurements.

11
00:00:35,445 --> 00:00:37,738
Here's what that list might look like.

12
00:00:37,745 --> 00:00:40,580
But it's difficult to draw out conclusions from such a list.

13
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:43,321
Instead, what I'll do is create a histogram.

14
00:00:43,344 --> 00:00:50,252
I'm going to specify a number of bins, for instance, 4 bins, shorter than 150 centimeters,

15
00:00:50,266 --> 00:00:54,383
between 150 and 165 centimeters, between 165 and 180 centimeters,

16
00:00:54,421 --> 00:00:57,005
and taller than 180 centimeters.

17
00:00:57,028 --> 00:00:59,452
Then I'll place each measurement into its bin.

18
00:00:59,452 --> 00:01:03,057
So every time someone walks by, I place another tick mark into the bin.

19
00:01:03,057 --> 00:01:10,847
Here, for instance, we might end up with the measurements 12, 34, 38, 60 out of 100 people.

20
00:01:10,847 --> 00:01:14,261
Often in statistics you might want to plot this histogram, which might

21
00:01:14,261 --> 00:01:17,276
give you a curve that tells you something interesting about the data.

22
00:01:17,283 --> 00:01:22,802
Let me introduce you to one specific operation you might want to do on a histogram of data

23
00:01:22,802 --> 00:01:24,959
because you'll be doing this in your assignment.

24
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:28,163
For the histogram we just showed here, we might want to compute the answer to the question

25
00:01:28,163 --> 00:01:32,370
"if I'm this tall, how many people are shorter than me?" for all bins in the histogram.

26
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:36,345
This computation is called the cumulative distribution function on a histogram.

27
00:01:36,345 --> 00:01:38,743
It's also known as a definite integral.

28
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:41,936
We want to compute the cumulative distribution function on this histogram.

29
00:01:41,957 --> 00:01:47,484
The input of the histogram is an array of values, for instance, 12, 34, 38, 16.

30
00:01:47,498 --> 00:01:51,263
In 1 word, or 2 words, to be a little more precise,

31
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:54,108
what is the operation we need to do to this input

32
00:01:54,108 --> 00:01:57,011
to get the cumulative distribution function?
