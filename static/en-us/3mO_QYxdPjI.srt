Thank you for your response.

00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:04,900
I hope you found some examples that involve,

3
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:06,800
estimating depth from stereo images.

4
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:11,250
Or perhaps, novel ways of projecting stereo images so

5
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:13,530
that it's easier to see three-dimensional shapes.

6
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:18,240
I encourage you to share and discuss your examples on the forum.
