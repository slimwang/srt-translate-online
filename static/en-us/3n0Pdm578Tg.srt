00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,147
So in this last section, we're going to discuss the combined approaches, of

2
00:00:03,147 --> 00:00:08,412
which there are three. When we combine psycho therapy and drugs and integrative

3
00:00:08,412 --> 00:00:12,922
therapy and mindfulness training and drugs. So lets talk about the first one

4
00:00:12,922 --> 00:00:17,798
first. Psychotherapy and drugs, so this is in fact a very effective and popular

5
00:00:17,798 --> 00:00:24,485
combination when we're treating anxiety and mood disorders. So the idea here is

6
00:00:24,485 --> 00:00:28,385
that the drugs will focus on and alleviate the anxiety of mood disorder,

7
00:00:28,385 --> 00:00:34,810
whereas as the psychotherapy helps the person manage their irrational thoughts.

8
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:39,922
So another common combination treatment in therapy is when we combine cognitive

9
00:00:39,922 --> 00:00:45,087
behavioral therapy with drug therapy to treat depression. In fact, sometimes we

10
00:00:45,087 --> 00:00:50,878
also have in this mix a token economy behavior modification therapy. In fact,

11
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:55,102
that combination of drug and token economy behavior modification is also seen

12
00:00:55,102 --> 00:01:00,596
in treating children with ADHD. So the idea is that this stimulant medication

13
00:01:00,596 --> 00:01:06,203
will help control some of the symptoms. And then every time the child acts in a

14
00:01:06,203 --> 00:01:10,200
non-hyperactive way, they get reinforced with a token.
