00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,180
Now let's take what we've learned about calculating lie factor and

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:04,990
apply it to a real-world example.

3
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:07,700
Here we have a graphic from the New York Times that is

4
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:11,960
showing the fuel economy standards for autos between the years of 1978 and 1985.

5
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:15,560
We have all the information that we need to calculate the lie factor for

6
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:16,850
this particular graphic.

7
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:19,820
We have the second and first value for the changes seen in the graphic,

8
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:24,110
and also the second and first value for the change that is seen in the data.

9
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:26,880
Let's use these four numbers to calculate the lie factor.

10
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,740
Given that the second value is 27.5 and the first value is 18,

11
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:32,950
what is the size of the effect in the data?
