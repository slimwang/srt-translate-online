1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:05,780
So the big idea in this lesson was to do
a BFS by recasting it in matrix terms.

2
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:06,450
You did so

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:09,890
in order to reuse your basic ideas
from distributing matrix operations.

4
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:13,870
This is a really neat connection,
and you can take it even further.

5
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:16,900
Now it might not always work,
or work as well.

6
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:20,150
So, here's a fun exercise
to do at this point.

7
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:24,030
Go read about or review other
kinds of graph computations.

8
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:28,650
Then ask whether you can do the same
sort of mapping from graphs to matrices.

9
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:31,140
For instance,
is there a matrix based way to do

10
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:34,050
a Depth first search as opposed
to a breadth first search?

11
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:36,610
What about all pairs shortest paths?

12
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:38,050
Triangle counting?

13
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:40,400
Computing betweeness centrality?

14
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,210
Maybe others.
