1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:01,230
Fun fact.

2
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:02,580
James, did you know that,

3
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:05,689
in many parts of the world, names are capitalized differently?

4
00:00:05,689 --> 00:00:09,130
While Americans capitalize the first letter of both names,

5
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:13,190
in many places of the world, the first name has the first letter capitalized,

6
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:15,520
while the last name is entirely capitalized.

7
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:16,100
>> Really?

8
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:18,050
I guess that does make sense.

9
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:20,920
In some countries, I know that they list the family name first and

10
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:23,790
the first name second, and it probably makes sense if

11
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:26,980
our resumes could switch to international mode to do the same.

12
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:29,470
>> Yeah, this sounds like an interesting challenge.

13
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:32,409
First off, append the internationalized button to the main div.

14
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:36,010
This is just a string with HTML that will create a button.

15
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:41,020
Then, create a function named inName() that takes a string of two names and

16
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:44,720
returns an internationalized version that would look something like this.

17
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,500
When you're done, check this button.

18
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,240
You should be able to see the new internationalized name show up on

19
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:51,120
the resume every time you click the button.
