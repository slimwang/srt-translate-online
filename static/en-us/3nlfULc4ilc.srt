1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:02,770
So let's match the activity
with the description.

2
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:04,230
First one, boy in the middle.

3
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:07,710
This means that covertly changing
a computer's network routing.

4
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:08,430
That's D.

5
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:13,140
Clickjacking, it means that it fool the
user into clicking something that is not

6
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:14,306
as it is portrayed.

7
00:00:14,306 --> 00:00:15,613
So that's E.

8
00:00:15,613 --> 00:00:16,926
Man in the browser.

9
00:00:16,926 --> 00:00:20,900
It means that the APT can
modify the web pages covertly.

10
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:24,070
For example,
when the user enters data in a web form,

11
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:27,650
the APT can change the data
without the user knowing about it.

12
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:28,750
So that's B.

13
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:29,620
Man in the middle.

14
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:32,830
This means that the APT
can intercept traffic and

15
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:36,310
listen in on conversations,
so that's eavesdrops, A.

16
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:41,390
Keyloggers, this means that the APT can
covertly record keystrokes by the user.

17
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:41,890
So that's C.
