00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,662
Okay, so a quick quiz just to test a little understanding

2
00:00:02,662 --> 00:00:05,184
about number of steps and total amount of work.

3
00:00:05,184 --> 00:00:07,328
We have a more complicated tree right here,

4
00:00:07,328 --> 00:00:10,891
and so you can think of every circle here as 1 operation.

5
00:00:10,891 --> 00:00:14,163
Some operations take 2 inputs, some operations take 1.

6
00:00:14,163 --> 00:00:20,330
So what are the total number of steps in going from the inputs up here to the output down here?

7
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:23,999
And what is the total amount of work measured in number of operations

8
00:00:23,999 --> 00:00:28,149
to get from the 8 inputs up here to the 1 output down here?
