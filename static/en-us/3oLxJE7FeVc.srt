1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,300
So, unfortunately.

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:03,370
Not unfortunately.

3
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:07,070
Necessarily we have to introduce a little bit of notation and mathematics in

4
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:11,600
order to make it easier to understand, what this reflectance map is.

5
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:16,900
So we're going to start by assuming we have a surface z of x, y.

6
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:19,230
Right? So here we have z in this direction.

7
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:20,800
X and y in that direction.

8
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,390
And you have some surface.

9
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:25,610
As you move in say, the x direction and the y direction.

10
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:27,280
Your z value changes and

11
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:30,990
in fact, you can talk about how z changes as you move an x and

12
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:35,650
y, that would be the partial derivatives of z with a spec to x and a spec to y.

13
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:40,480
And we are going to find two variables referred to as p and

14
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,880
q to represent these derivatives.

15
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:46,110
Now there is a little bit is ambiguity in the literature.

16
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:51,090
When I learned it from Burtoll, p was the partial of z with respect to x.

17
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:53,370
Q is the partial of z with respect to y.

18
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:56,790
As I was rummaging around the web to see how people talk about this all of

19
00:00:56,790 --> 00:01:00,900
sudden sometimes people use the negative of the partial of

20
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:03,540
z with respect to x and the partial of z respect to y.

21
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:06,620
And it turns out when you do it as the negative it makes some

22
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:08,520
formulations a little bit easier.

23
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,410
So I'm going to use it as the negative, but

24
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:12,670
you can use it either way as long as you're consistent.
