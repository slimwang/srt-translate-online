Charles Spearman developed one of the first theories of intelligence. He

2
00:00:03,998 --> 00:00:08,537
believed that intelligence is a single general capacity or ability. The reason

3
00:00:08,537 --> 00:00:12,035
for his belief is that he found that although intelligence test assessed math,

4
00:00:12,035 --> 00:00:17,006
language, and spatial ability. Children's scores on these domains, tend to be

5
00:00:17,006 --> 00:00:21,670
positively correlated. Meaning, those who scored high on one dimension, for

6
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:25,330
example, math, tend to score high on others, such as language, or spatial

7
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:30,424
skills. Likewise, those who scored on low on one dimension, tended to score low

8
00:00:30,424 --> 00:00:31,790
on others.
