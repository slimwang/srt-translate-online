1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,370
This would be our solution, great work if you found it. We want to start by

2
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:08,274
finding the lowest common denominator, so we should factor each of these

3
00:00:08,274 --> 00:00:13,526
denominators. We factored this denominator to be m plus 1 times m minus 5. This

4
00:00:13,526 --> 00:00:18,150
denominator, we'll need to use factoring by grouping. You need to find factors

5
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:23,273
of 30 that sum to negative 13. Those factors are negative 3 and negative 10.

6
00:00:23,273 --> 00:00:29,046
They multiply to give us positive 30, and they add or sum to give us negative

7
00:00:29,046 --> 00:00:33,680
13. We use our factoring tree method to get this lowest common denominator. We

8
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:38,300
multiply our first fraction by the missing factor of two m minus three, whereas

9
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:42,566
we multiply our second fraction by the missing factor of m plus one. And

10
00:00:42,566 --> 00:00:47,050
remember, we're really just multiplying by a one here and a one here. We're

11
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:53,175
changing these fractions into equivalent forms. We distribute m to 2m minus 3 to

12
00:00:53,175 --> 00:00:59,708
get the first numerator, 2m squared minus 3m. Next, we distribute the negative 3

13
00:00:59,708 --> 00:01:05,272
to the m plus 1. We'll get negative 3m and negative 3. Now, we want to add the

14
00:01:05,272 --> 00:01:10,102
two numerators together and keep our denominator the same. The like terms in

15
00:01:10,102 --> 00:01:16,972
these numerators are negative 3m and negative 3m. So we have 2 m squared, minus

16
00:01:16,972 --> 00:01:21,688
6 m, and minus 3. Finally we want to check to see if this is factor able. We

17
00:01:21,688 --> 00:01:29,718
want to find factors of -6, that's sum to -6. Well there are no factor pairs of

18
00:01:29,718 --> 00:01:34,868
-6 that sum to you -6. So we're finished. So really subtracting rational

19
00:01:34,868 --> 00:01:39,132
expressions is not that different from adding them. We just want to make sure we

20
00:01:39,132 --> 00:01:41,333
remember to distribute the negative sign.
