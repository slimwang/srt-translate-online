1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,890
And here are some observations
that you may have made.

2
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:05,230
There's no right or wrong answer here.

3
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:08,230
We just want to get you in the habit
of identifying things that you do or

4
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:10,230
don't know in some code.

5
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:12,730
So you may have noticed that this
starts with a opening angle bracket,

6
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:14,386
and then the name of the view.

7
00:00:14,386 --> 00:00:16,790
Ding [SOUND].

8
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:18,950
And then there's a bunch of attributes.

9
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:22,665
[SOUND] And
then a closing angle bracket, boom.

10
00:00:22,665 --> 00:00:25,430
But there is no forward slash,
that may come later.

11
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:29,290
You may recognize the values of width
and height, which means the sides of

12
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:31,760
the view group will shrink to
wrap the content inside of it.

13
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,865
Then there's this new attribute
that you haven't seen before,

14
00:00:34,865 --> 00:00:36,330
android:orientation="vertical".

15
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:38,850
You may make some connection

16
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:41,570
with the way that these
are vertically in a column.

17
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:43,830
Then there are these
two TextView elements.

18
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:48,110
From looking at the attribute text,
it seems like Guest List is here and

19
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:49,870
Kunal is here.

20
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:50,960
Looks like it's a party for one.

21
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,980
Then we have this funny
group of symbols down here.

22
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:58,080
You may or may not recognize it from
earlier, but this is a open angle

23
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:02,400
bracket, forward slash Linear layout and
then close angel bracket.

24
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:05,379
This is the closing tag, and
this is the opening tag.

25
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:09,300
You get brownie points if you remembered
that from the beginning of the lesson.

26
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:11,490
Cool.
So let's look at more code examples, and

27
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:12,440
dig into this more.
