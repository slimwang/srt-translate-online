00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
[Narrator] There are many answers to this; any 2 letters that are the same cannot decrypt to CS

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
because the way the monoalphabetic cypher works every time we see a G,

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
it maps to the same letter, so G could decrypt to C,

4
00:00:13,000 --> 99:59:59,999
but that would mean the other G also decrypts to C and we can't get CS out.
