00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,690
Let's take a moment to think about
the machine learning base approaches

2
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:05,320
to intrusion detection.

3
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:10,120
Which of these statements best describes
the machine learning base approach for

4
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:11,580
intrusion detection?

5
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:15,280
Is it, detecting new and novel attacks?

6
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,400
Or, detecting attacks
similar to past attacks?
