To get rid of our natural log here, we need to use lnx as the input to the

2
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:11,470
exponential function with e as the base. So that gives us e to the lnx equals e

00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:17,010
to the 3 4ths. We know the left hand side just simplifies to x and the right

4
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:21,885
hand side rounded to three decimal places is 2.117
