I hope our discussion of the big problems in AI didn't scare you off,

2
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:06,396
let's bring the discussion down, closer to work.

3
00:00:06,396 --> 00:00:11,467
And talk about a few fundamental characteristics of AI problems. Number one,

4
00:00:11,467 --> 00:00:16,600
in many AI problems, data arrives incrementally not all the data comes

5
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:22,330
right at the beginning. Number two, problems often have a recurring pattern,

6
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:26,860
the same kinds of problems occur again and again. Number three,

7
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:31,500
problems occur at many different levels of abstraction. Problem number four,

8
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:35,720
many interesting AI problems are computationally intractable. Number five,

9
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:39,630
the world is dynamic, it's constantly changing but knowledge of

10
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:44,960
the world is relative to static. Number six, the world is open ended but

11
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,110
knowledge of the world is relatively limited. So, the question then becomes,

12
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:52,300
how can we design AI agents that can address AI problems with

13
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:56,060
these characteristics, those are the challenges we'll discuss in this course
