00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:04,782
Klout score is the single number that, that measure your influence across the

2
00:00:04,782 --> 00:00:09,178
Internet primarily the social media. I'm Chief Scientist at Klout, I run the

3
00:00:09,178 --> 00:00:13,013
data science team as well as the data infrastructure team oversee all the data

4
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:16,832
driven products that come, you know kind of lead the team behind the score. >>

5
00:00:16,832 --> 00:00:21,837
And you created the whole infrastructure, and the algorithm behind the Klout

6
00:00:21,837 --> 00:00:26,135
score, right? >> I create the infrastructure and the science behind the Klout

7
00:00:26,135 --> 00:00:33,341
score. We grade everyone's influence on the Internet from a scale from 1 to 99.

8
00:00:33,342 --> 00:00:38,000
It's a single score that you can see as your credit score for you online

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,265
reputation or you know, a single score that you can measure influence with.

10
00:00:43,265 --> 00:00:48,001
Klout score is calculate by incorporating all your data from various social

11
00:00:48,001 --> 00:00:53,680
networks, ranging from Twitter to Facebook, to LinkedIn. And for wach network, I

12
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:59,433
would collect about a hundred signals. Number of retweets you get per twwet,

13
00:00:59,433 --> 00:01:05,077
number of likes you get per post on Facebook stuff like that are all the signals

14
00:01:05,077 --> 00:01:10,878
that we look at overall we consifer four hundred signals per person. And we

15
00:01:10,878 --> 00:01:16,698
generally scores for 400 million and more users at everyday. Klout score follows

16
00:01:16,698 --> 00:01:23,278
this by model distribution, where you have this very big peak of users who are

17
00:01:23,278 --> 00:01:29,576
in this 40 to 60s on this side and also the users who are quality content

18
00:01:29,576 --> 00:01:35,163
producers. And you also have this very nice peak of users on the other side who

19
00:01:35,163 --> 00:01:40,428
are the consumers of those content. And if you, you know, plot the score, and

20
00:01:40,428 --> 00:01:45,321
the number of users with each score buckets from this side to this side. You

21
00:01:45,321 --> 00:01:49,930
know, this is zero, and that's 99. And this, you know, the y axis is the number

22
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:54,536
of users who are in this buckets. You can see a very nice by model distribution

23
00:01:54,536 --> 00:01:58,635
there. The average cost score is lower than the median because they are

24
00:01:58,635 --> 00:02:03,531
proportionally more people with a lower score, so they drag the average down. So

25
00:02:03,531 --> 00:02:07,799
in such a distribution, taking a look at the median makes more sense. Being able

26
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:11,390
to beat forty is actually a pretty good sign of being very influential on the

27
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:12,150
social media.
