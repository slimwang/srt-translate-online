00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:04,169
As I mentioned in the previous lesson,
because of my background, I'll be using

2
00:00:04,169 --> 00:00:08,320
a retail scenario as an example for
working through the concepts.

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,310
But keep in mind that you should be able
to easily translate these concepts to

4
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:14,419
whatever area you work in.

5
00:00:14,419 --> 00:00:18,390
For example, when we talk about
customers, you may be thinking of

6
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:24,580
students, employees, people visiting
a website, or responders to a survey.

7
00:00:24,579 --> 00:00:29,129
When we talk about stores,
you can think school sites, hospitals,

8
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:32,719
airports, or
just about anything that has locations.

9
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:36,199
The point is that you will want to
gather whatever data is relevant

10
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,300
to your area of analysis.

11
00:00:38,299 --> 00:00:42,669
In our case, we will look at what kinds
of data are typically available for

12
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:46,130
analyzing results for retail stores.

13
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:49,230
One thing to consider when you begin
your search for the right data

14
00:00:49,229 --> 00:00:53,339
is to understand the objective for the
segmentation you're trying to create.

15
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:57,060
In the case of retail stores, we may
want to have segments that will help

16
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:00,230
management provide a benchmarking
system to understand and

17
00:01:00,229 --> 00:01:02,319
evaluate the store performance.

18
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:07,629
Or we may want our segments to help make
marketing or product pricing decisions.

19
00:01:07,629 --> 00:01:11,060
Or a third objective could be to
help managers determine the best

20
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:14,655
product allocation and
space planning for each store.

21
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:19,299
If you think about these objectives,
they are all a bit different.

22
00:01:19,299 --> 00:01:23,289
And the final clustering solution
could look different for each one.

23
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:25,830
So if you think of what
data might be needed for

24
00:01:25,829 --> 00:01:30,209
a specific objective versus all of
the data that might be available,

25
00:01:30,209 --> 00:01:32,809
it will help you fine tune your search,
so

26
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:36,790
that you don't spend extra time getting
data together that you may not need.
