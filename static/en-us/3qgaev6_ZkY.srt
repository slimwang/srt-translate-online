Welcome to lesson two everybody. In this lesson we're going to learn

2
00:00:03,035 --> 00:00:06,210
about forms. Forms you've seen all over the place on the internet.

3
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:10,178
They're the text boxes, check boxes, radio buttons that basically allow

4
00:00:10,178 --> 00:00:14,540
websites to get information from users, including on [UNKNOWN] own site. Every

5
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:17,506
quiz you do is submitting a form. So we are going to

6
00:00:17,506 --> 00:00:20,368
spend a lot of time, basically learning how to build this things

7
00:00:20,368 --> 00:00:22,817
in your editor in a browser testing them out. And we're

8
00:00:22,817 --> 00:00:25,308
also going to spend time learning how to make sure the data you're

9
00:00:25,308 --> 00:00:27,704
getting from the user is actually secure. Because this is

10
00:00:27,704 --> 00:00:30,122
how you let the users basically into your website. So

11
00:00:30,122 --> 00:00:32,362
we have to make sure that we only allow them

12
00:00:32,362 --> 00:00:34,900
do what we want them to do. So, let's get started.
