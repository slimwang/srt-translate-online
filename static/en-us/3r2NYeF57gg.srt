1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,328
After one month I would have $250. Well, this is below our line so that means we

2
00:00:05,328 --> 00:00:10,677
saved less than $100 in a month. We started with $200 and we only gained $50. We

3
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:15,472
should have gained more than a $100. For 2 months and $500, we can see that,

4
00:00:15,472 --> 00:00:20,074
that is above our line. This means we must have saved more than $100 in one of

5
00:00:20,074 --> 00:00:24,499
these months. I know this because after 2 months, I should expect to have

6
00:00:24,499 --> 00:00:29,221
exactly $400 if I were to have saved exactly $100 a month. But we have more. So

7
00:00:29,221 --> 00:00:34,352
this one works. This one's a little bit tricky. After 1 month, I saved exactly

8
00:00:34,352 --> 00:00:39,556
300 dollars. Well, this means I saved exactly 100 dollars in that 1 month. So I

9
00:00:39,556 --> 00:00:44,664
didn't save more than 100 dollars. So this one's out. This point means that,

10
00:00:44,664 --> 00:00:48,664
after 3 months, I saved 400 dollars. That would put me here.
