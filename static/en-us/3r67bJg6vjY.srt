Now, not every parabolic equation we encounter will be in vertex form. Here's

2
00:00:05,242 --> 00:00:10,360
another parabolic equation. Notice that we have an x squared term, but we just

3
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:15,047
have a single y term. Remember, all parabolic equations either have an x

4
00:00:15,047 --> 00:00:20,627
squared term, or they have a y squared term. They can't have both. Based on

5
00:00:20,627 --> 00:00:24,990
what you know so far, which way do you think this parabola opens? Does it open

6
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:30,314
to the left? To the right? Up? Or down?
