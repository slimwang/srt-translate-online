1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,560
And these are all yes, no questions.

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:08,740
Question number one, does the, the word order matter inside of a phrase?

3
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:09,770
Yes or no?

4
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:15,890
Do long text or phrases give fundamentally different input vectors?

5
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:17,300
Yes or no?

6
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:20,710
Or put differently, if I just take the same email and make ten copies and

7
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:22,050
put all the ten copies into a,

8
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:26,020
like the same text, will I get something different, yes or no?

9
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:32,220
And finally, can we really handle complex phrases involving multiple words?

10
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:38,060
Classic example in the US is Chicago Bulls is actually a sports team,

11
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:41,920
where Chicago itself is just a city, and Bulls is an animal.

12
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,171
But the conjunction of these two words means something entirely different from

13
00:00:45,171 --> 00:00:46,400
the words insulation.

14
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,980
Again, yes or no?

15
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:48,600
Give it a try.
