Hi, welcome back to the show. Let's take a look at the solution here. So, our

2
00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:07,430
loadAsset function should first check the gCachedAssets dictionary for the file

3
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:10,566
name that was provided if the file is not present in the cache, then the result

4
00:00:10,566 --> 00:00:15,250
of this access will return no. If this happens we know that the image has been

5
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:19,096
loaded, and we need to actually issue a load call. From here we can actually

6
00:00:19,096 --> 00:00:22,599
create our image do our on load, and set our source. Once is all done we

7
00:00:22,599 --> 00:00:26,133
actually set the image object as the value to the key of asset name inside of

8
00:00:26,133 --> 00:00:30,580
the cache. This allows us later, once again, to go through, query for a name

9
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:34,765
and get an object, which you can see down here. If the object has already been

10
00:00:34,765 --> 00:00:37,517
loaded, then when we query for it, we'll get a something back, which allows us

11
00:00:37,517 --> 00:00:41,613
to pass that image object to the callback function that was given to us.
