00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
It's not enough to know that a string contains a token,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
just like it's not enough to know that a sentence contains a verb.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
We need to know which one it is, and formally

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
we refer to that as the value of the token.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
By default, the value of a token is the value of the string it matched.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
We can rebuild it, however. We have the technology.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Let's see how that plays out.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Here I've written a definition for a slightly more complicated token,

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
a number, one or more copies of the digit 0-9,

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
and now I would like you, our last, best hope for victory,

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
to help me understand it.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
If the input text is 1368,

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
what will the value of the token be?

14
00:00:45,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Check all that apply.
