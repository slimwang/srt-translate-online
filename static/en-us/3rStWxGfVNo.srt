1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,090
This is what we're going to cover and
in lesson two.

2
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:06,580
First, we're going to show
the quantity and then an order button.

3
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:08,650
Then, we're going to
show the price as well.

4
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:11,480
Next we're going to add a plus and
a minus button so

5
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:14,149
that when you tap on either of
these the quantity changes.

6
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:19,020
After that, we're going to take these
buttons and rotate them horizontally so

7
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:21,550
they show up like this for
the quantity picker.

8
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:24,505
And lastly, we're going to adjust
the way that the price is displayed and

9
00:00:24,505 --> 00:00:28,100
we'll also move the order button
down to the bottom of the screen.

10
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:31,380
This is what the app is going to
look like by the end of Lesson two.

11
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:34,300
Along the way we're going to learn
about Java concepts like variables and

12
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:35,110
data types.

13
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:36,770
That way when we click on the plus or

14
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:39,898
the minus button we'll be able to
update the quantity or if click

15
00:00:39,898 --> 00:00:43,220
on the order button we'll be able to
calculate and display the price here.

16
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:47,490
Now we're going to just focus on
the first stage of our app and

17
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:49,100
then slowly build up from there.

18
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:51,870
I'd like you to plan how you're
going to build up this layout.

19
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:55,830
The app displays quantity 0 and
then an order button.

20
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:58,170
If you're stuck try going,
through the three steps for

21
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:01,380
creating a layout that we went
over in the practice set.

22
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:06,210
Select the views you want, position
the view, and then style the views.

23
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:09,340
In this planning stage, I'll ask for
you to write a couple words for

24
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:10,780
each of these.

25
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:14,160
It's generally a good habit to plan out
how you're going to build something,

26
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:16,270
before you actually go and code it.

27
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:19,240
Otherwise, you might get lost
in all the details of the code.

28
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,440
Which views do we need here?

29
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:24,310
Do we need text views, image views, etc.

30
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:25,600
Step two.

31
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,490
For positioning the views,
which view group will be the root view?

32
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:33,100
Feel free to add other comments
about how to position these views.

33
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:35,710
Finally for
step three we need to style the views.

34
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:37,440
Is there anything we need to do here?

35
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:40,500
Write your comments below,
on how we need to change the view so

36
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,520
that they look like this.
