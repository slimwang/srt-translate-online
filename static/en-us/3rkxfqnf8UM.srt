1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,270
So now that we have seen
what the TLB size should be,

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:05,410
let's see if we understood it well.

3
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:11,300
Suppose we have a processor with a 32
kB cache and a 64 byte block size.

4
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:17,030
Suppose we also have virtual to physical
address translation for a 4kB page size.

5
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:21,705
The question for you is, how many
TLB entries do we need if we want to

6
00:00:21,705 --> 00:00:25,393
have similar miss rates in
this cache and in our TLB?

7
00:00:25,393 --> 00:00:31,842
The choices you have are 8 to
512 entries, 64 to 32,000,

8
00:00:31,842 --> 00:00:36,999
fewer than 64 entries, or
more than 256 entries.

9
00:00:36,999 --> 00:00:38,220
Choose the best answer here.
