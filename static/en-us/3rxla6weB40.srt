Here's one more example of reasoning and
propositional logic.

2
00:00:02,779 --> 00:00:05,449
In a particular model of the world,

3
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:08,210
we know the following
three sentences are true.

4
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:12,865
E, or B, implies A.

5
00:00:12,865 --> 00:00:18,115
A implies J and M.

6
00:00:18,115 --> 00:00:20,658
And B.

7
00:00:20,658 --> 00:00:24,877
You know these three sentences to
be true and that's all we know.

8
00:00:24,876 --> 00:00:30,945
Now, I want you to tell me, for
each of the five prepositional symbols,

9
00:00:30,945 --> 00:00:35,435
is that symbol true or false or
unknown in this model?

10
00:00:35,435 --> 00:00:40,488
And tell for the symbols E,

11
00:00:40,488 --> 00:00:43,354
B, A, J and M.

12
00:00:43,354 --> 00:00:53,354
