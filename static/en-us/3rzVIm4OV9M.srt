1
00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:03,730
But we would also want to
drill a little further down

2
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:07,620
into the details to confirm
this reasonableness.

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:12,490
Let's take a look at the single variable
growing season length by cluster.

4
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:13,839
Now as an aside,

5
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:18,689
I previously said it is best validate
your clusters using variables

6
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:23,150
that were not directly included
in the cluster modeling process.

7
00:00:23,149 --> 00:00:28,289
In some cases though, the best
variables are the ones that you used.

8
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:33,189
In our example, since climate is really
built around just a few metrics,

9
00:00:33,189 --> 00:00:38,030
we are using some that we have used
directly in creating the model.

10
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:39,600
Let's add a new sheet to Tableau.

11
00:00:42,979 --> 00:00:47,049
And you can create the visualization
by dropping the cluster ID

12
00:00:47,049 --> 00:00:47,919
into the columns.

13
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:53,692
In the growing season
length into the rows.

14
00:00:53,692 --> 00:00:57,161
[BLANK_AUDIO]

15
00:00:57,161 --> 00:00:59,441
It will sum these up by default,

16
00:00:59,441 --> 00:01:04,909
which seems to show some distinctness
around a few of the clusters.

17
00:01:04,909 --> 00:01:06,549
But since it's a sum,

18
00:01:06,549 --> 00:01:11,137
that could be just because of
the number of stores in a cluster.

19
00:01:11,137 --> 00:01:17,751
A better validation visualization would
be using the box-and-whisker plot type.

20
00:01:17,751 --> 00:01:22,718
[BLANK_AUDIO]

21
00:01:22,718 --> 00:01:27,061
You'll need to uncheck aggregate
measures to get it to show the clusters

22
00:01:27,061 --> 00:01:27,924
separately.

23
00:01:27,924 --> 00:01:34,185
[BLANK_AUDIO]

24
00:01:34,185 --> 00:01:35,945
>From this visualization,

25
00:01:35,944 --> 00:01:41,149
we can easily see that the behavior
of the clusters is different.

26
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:46,410
Cluster one obviously has
the longest growing season.

27
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:51,310
And clusters four, five and
ten have the shortest.

28
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:55,240
By referring back to our map,
this makes total sense.

29
00:01:55,239 --> 00:01:59,554
Since cluster one is in Florida and
four,

30
00:01:59,554 --> 00:02:04,250
five and
ten are in the northern most states.
