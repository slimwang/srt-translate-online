00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,710
We said that the goal of computer architecture

2
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:05,790
is to design a computer that is better suited

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:08,210
for its intended use. In the rest of

4
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:11,170
this course, we will learn about techniques that can

5
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:14,070
be used to improve the computer's performance, energy

6
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:18,130
efficiency, and cost. However, before we get into these

7
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:20,650
techniques, we need to learn how to measure

8
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:25,220
and compare performance and other characteristics of computer designs.

9
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:27,230
In other words, we need to come up with

10
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:32,049
some numbers that express our intuitive notion of better
