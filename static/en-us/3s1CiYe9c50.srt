1
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:03,615
Okay, so like you've seen before,
we go ahead and

2
00:00:03,615 --> 00:00:05,583
we click Start a new
Android Studio project.

3
00:00:05,583 --> 00:00:07,082
So I'm going to do that.

4
00:00:07,082 --> 00:00:09,760
Okay, and then we'll see
a screen that looks like this.

5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,870
Now it said to name this
project Practice Set 2,

6
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:13,265
so I'm going to do that right now.

7
00:00:13,265 --> 00:00:17,114
And I want to use the same company
domain that I've already been using for

8
00:00:17,114 --> 00:00:20,470
all of my other projects,
which is android.example.com.

9
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:23,570
Now, as long as you didn't do anything
funny, this should have stayed the same,

10
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:24,979
so you probably don't need to change it.

11
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:29,870
Now just double-check that the project
is being saved wherever you want it to.

12
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:32,759
In my case I'm putting it on the
desktop, but you might want to put it in

13
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:35,680
your documents or
somewhere else on your computer.

14
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:36,720
All right, now I'll hit Next.

15
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:39,350
This screen looks pretty good.

16
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:41,530
I do want to make something for
a phone and a tablet and

17
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:45,120
I don't want to make something for a TV
or that I'm going to wear on a watch.

18
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,770
So I'm not checking these boxes and
I have this box checked.

19
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:51,340
In addition, I said that you should
be making something for API 15,

20
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:54,400
so I have API 15 selected.

21
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:57,345
If you don't,
you can always click here and change it.

22
00:00:57,345 --> 00:01:00,956
I'm going to click Next.

23
00:01:00,956 --> 00:01:03,242
Okay, and on this screen we're also
going to stick with what we know.

24
00:01:03,242 --> 00:01:07,748
Go ahead and select Blank Activity and
then click Next to go to the next page.

25
00:01:07,748 --> 00:01:10,960
And there's no need to customize
these or change these around.

26
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,020
You can just keep the defaults.

27
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:14,730
And once you're done with that,
go ahead and click Finish.

28
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:19,680
Okay, and after a little bit you should
see that your app loads up like this.

29
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,180
Good work.
