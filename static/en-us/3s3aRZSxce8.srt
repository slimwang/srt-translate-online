1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,790
Here's a key number, 14.

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:07,600
Studies show that patients like Marla,
patients with four or

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,610
five or more chronic conditions,

4
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:16,230
are seen on average each year
by 14 different physicians.

5
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:18,590
So why is this the case?

6
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:21,910
Well they have a lot of problems
that involve many different parts of

7
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:22,460
their body.

8
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:28,440
In Marla's case, her lungs, her heart,

9
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:32,500
her blood vessels and
the insulin control system,

10
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,160
which is centered in an organ
called the pancreas.
