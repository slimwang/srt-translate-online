1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:05,640
In DRAM, we also have a transistor
that is activated by the wordline and

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:08,480
that connects the cell to the bit line.

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,080
But we said that's the only
transistor we have.

4
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:14,330
The cell is made out of
a simple capacitor here.

5
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:20,010
So, the idea is that to write to this
cell we will activate the wordline,

6
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:22,920
we put let's say A1 into the bitline.

7
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:28,310
This transistor connects
the capacitor to the bitline.

8
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:34,470
Now what happens is R1 effectively
charges this capacitor.

9
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:37,020
Once we deactivate the wordline,

10
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:40,930
the capacitor retains the value
that corresponds to a 1.

11
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:44,040
If we want to write a 0,
we activate the wordline.

12
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:48,650
The capacitor is now connected
to the bitline that is connected

13
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:53,210
to a zero voltage, and we empty
this capacitor into the bitline,

14
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:57,410
thus now our capacitor
becomes a zero value.

15
00:00:57,410 --> 00:01:00,670
Now when we disconnect the wordline,
the capacitor has nothing in it, so

16
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:01,760
it retains the value of 0.

17
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:06,530
So as you can see, the bit is
really stored in this capacitor.

18
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:08,580
When it's charged, we are storing a 1.

19
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:10,650
When it's not charged,
we are storing a 0.

20
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:12,770
So what's the problem here?

21
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:17,140
Well the problem is that this
transistor is not a perfect switch.

22
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:19,230
It's a little bit leaky.

23
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:23,754
Here it's not a problem because
if it's a little bit leaky,

24
00:01:23,754 --> 00:01:28,812
these two are strong enough to retain
the voltage at let's say 1 and

25
00:01:28,812 --> 00:01:33,630
0 or 0 and 1, while these
are not trying to defeat them.

26
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:37,020
But here our capacitor is slowly
leaking into the bit line and

27
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:39,220
eventually gets empty.

28
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:43,890
So one problem with DRAM is that it
will lose this bit over time, and

29
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:47,770
that means that periodically we
have to actually read out this bit,

30
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:51,220
figure out what it was, and
write it back in at full voltage so

31
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:54,750
that it can again leak for
a while before it gets lost.

32
00:01:54,750 --> 00:02:00,170
Another problem with DRAM that
you don't have with SRAM is that

33
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:04,110
once we open the wordline,
the capacitor drains into the bit line.

34
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:08,740
We can sense what the value was, but the
capacitor is no longer fully charged.

35
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:12,330
This is called destructive read.

36
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:16,730
When you read a DRAM cell,
you have to write it back in.

37
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:19,110
It loses the value as it gets read.

38
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:24,420
So this is what is usually called
a 6T cell or 6 transistor cell.

39
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:29,030
That are two transistors that are there
for connecting to the cell and

40
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:33,190
there are four transistors in the cell
itself because each of the inverters has

41
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:34,680
two transistors.

42
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,790
This is, of course, a 1T cell.

43
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:42,410
Now, the area occupied by an SRAM
cell obviously is the area occupied

44
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:44,710
by about six transistors.

45
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:49,590
The area of the DRAM cell it looks like
it's the area of one transistor and

46
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:51,650
the area of the capacitor.

47
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:56,980
The bigger this capacitor the longer it
can retain something that corresponds

48
00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:02,100
to a 1 or a 0 before it gets lost,
so we want this capacitor to be big.

49
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:08,280
A capacitor can be viewed as two metal
plates placed very close to each other.

50
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:12,950
The bigger the area of the plates, the
bigger the capacitance of the capacitor,

51
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:13,950
it can keep more charge.

52
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:20,490
So it looks like, to make a good DRAM
cell, we will have to make a big cell

53
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:26,140
because this capacitor will need a lot
of metal area to build large plates,

54
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:29,080
but this is not how we
build this capacitor.

55
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:32,940
The transistor and
the capacitor itself are actually built

56
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:37,350
as a single transistor in a technology
that is called trench cell.

57
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:41,580
So this end of this transistor
is simply buried deeply

58
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:44,420
into the silicon substrate when
we manufacture transistors.

59
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:48,110
So really the capacitor is kind
of buried under the transistor.

60
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:50,710
So we really get the area of
the transistor itself and

61
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:51,970
not much around it.

62
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:54,480
You can see also that the DRAM cell

63
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:58,070
can be smaller because it doesn't
need this second bit line.

64
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:01,160
We just need one, so
that also makes it slightly smaller.

65
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,590
We don't need as much wiring there.
