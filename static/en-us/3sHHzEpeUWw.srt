00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,656
Our long division here works here just the same as it always has. When we go

2
00:00:03,656 --> 00:00:09,870
through all the steps, we end up with x squared minus 6x plus 13. And luckily,

3
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:12,820
we have a remainder of 0. Which as always, shows that 2x minus 1, really is a

4
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:17,505
factor of the expression we started out with. Since the remainder is 0, that

5
00:00:17,505 --> 00:00:20,616
means if we plug in the root associated with this, the function will have a

6
00:00:20,616 --> 00:00:22,249
value of 0.
