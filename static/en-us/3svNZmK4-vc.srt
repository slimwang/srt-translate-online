1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,280
Just recording data isn't sufficient.

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:07,450
Certified EHRs must provide
tools to use that data

3
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:10,970
to improve care quality
through functions like these.

4
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:14,440
We earlier discussed the key
role medications play

5
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:19,530
in managing chronic disease and
the many problems they currently create.

6
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:25,570
So note that the first four of these all
relate to improve medication management.

7
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:29,230
Also note that the EMR must
be able to calculate and

8
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:32,200
submit clinical quality measures.

9
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:36,320
Remember that as we discuss the key
role that quality measures play

10
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,060
in determining meaningful use.
