00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,510
Now all of these theories are great, but there's a problem here. Say we need to

2
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:07,660
see if a drug can affect a child's intellectual development, well we need to

3
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:13,240
have a way to measure intelligence. But how do we measure intelligence? Well

4
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:17,020
the first thing you need to know is that intelligence is what psychologists

5
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:22,128
call a hypothetical construct. Meaning it's an idea that can't be directly seen

6
00:00:22,128 --> 00:00:25,790
or measured, so it can only be indirectly measured.
