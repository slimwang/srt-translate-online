00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:03,490
Another yet more subtle technique that you can employ as

2
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:07,220
a visual designer is the use of negative space.

3
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:12,450
Negative space is developed around and between the shapes or forms of objects.

4
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:16,460
Take, for instance, this classic example of Rubin's vase.

5
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:19,000
Are we actually looking at a vase here or

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
are we looking at two people face each other?

7
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:26,628
You might be more familiar with examples of negative space in company logos.

8
00:00:26,628 --> 00:00:31,630
For example, FedEx hides an arrow between the capital E and the letter x.

9
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:35,740
This design reinforces the company's function as shipping service.

10
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:41,080
Other logos include the television network NBC with its peacock shown here.

11
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:43,575
And the white panda from the World Wildlife Fund.

12
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:48,680
What designs or logos have you seen that use negative space?

13
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:51,680
I'd like you to share an example in the discussion thread titled

14
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:52,630
negative spaces.

15
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:57,120
