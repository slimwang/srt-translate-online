00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,550
All right. So we covered a lot of

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:06,080
material now on queries. Let's do a quick recap.

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,970
First, we used a query by kind to

4
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:10,570
get all the conferences. Then we combined the query

5
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:13,620
by kind with an ancestor filter. And finally,

6
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:18,230
we applied property filters. Remember, property filters gives you

7
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:23,140
a lot of flexibilities when doing queries. Now, the

8
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:25,390
time has come to look under the hood of

9
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:28,050
Vapor Store, and see how these queries are actually

10
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:31,290
run. The time has come to look at indexes.
