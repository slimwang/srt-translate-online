1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:03,700
All right, so the first two tasks of the
exercise were meant to catch you up to

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:06,540
the state of our code after you
watch me make those changes in

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:07,850
the previous video.

4
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:12,300
So in our first task, we're asked to
delete this block of log messages, so

5
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:13,450
I'm going to go ahead and
do that right now.

6
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:16,020
Nice.
Easy.

7
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:21,530
Our next task is to modify
the activity_numbers.xml to change it,

8
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:24,910
to use a linear layout
instead of a relatively out.

9
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:27,150
As well as changes
orientation to vertical

10
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:30,052
[BLANK_AUDIO]

11
00:00:30,052 --> 00:00:34,340
And then also add a view ID
which I want to call review.

12
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,670
Great so those are first two tasks.

13
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:39,950
So for the third task,

14
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:42,456
we need to modify the on create
method in the numbers activity.

15
00:00:42,456 --> 00:00:45,800
We need to modify it so that it uses
a while loop to create a text view for

16
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:49,200
each element in the words list and then
displays the text view on the screen.

17
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:53,730
So here's our version of
the NumbersActivity.java that we've

18
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:55,240
posted online.

19
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:58,420
And the code that it uses here
to create the three text views

20
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:02,000
has a menu approach rather than
using the while loop approach.

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,350
So after starting this code and

22
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:06,860
understand how it works,
it will help us to write the while loop.

23
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:10,764
Now before we begin writing the while
loop, let's review the three guiding

24
00:01:10,764 --> 00:01:14,060
questions that we discussed
earlier in the while loop lecture.

25
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:17,311
All right so now let's discuss how to
add text views to the screen using

26
00:01:17,311 --> 00:01:18,700
the while loop more in depth.

27
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:20,850
And remember,
this is the general structure for

28
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:22,632
how we're going to write
our while loop and

29
00:01:22,632 --> 00:01:26,001
the three questions that we'll talk
about will help us fill in these boxes.

30
00:01:26,001 --> 00:01:28,560
So what task do we want to do each time?

31
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,250
Well, from the numbers activity code, it
looks like we want to create a new text

32
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:35,680
view, then set the text view to
a single word in the list, and

33
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,710
then add the text view to the review.

34
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:40,650
Second, so how many times do
we want to repeat this loop?

35
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:42,950
In this,
example we want to repeat it ten times.

36
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:45,420
So one iteration per word in the list.

37
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,490
And there are ten words
in this list right now.

38
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:50,120
The third question is,
what is the condition?

39
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:53,660
Well, we want to keep iterating through
the list until we reach the end of it.

40
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:56,290
So if we create an index
variable to keep

41
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:58,970
track of our current index position,
our condition can

42
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:02,480
be to keep looping until the index
variable is less than ten.

43
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,730
Which is currently this
length of the words list.

44
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:07,420
So this assumes that the index
variable starts at zero and

45
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:08,680
then increments by one each time.

46
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:11,770
All right so I'm back here
in the NumbersActivity.java.

47
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:15,958
The version where we've created
text views doing the manual way.

48
00:02:15,958 --> 00:02:19,520
So I'm going to copy and paste this
block of code that allows us to do that.

49
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,580
And now in Android Studio,
in the NumbersActivity.java,

50
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:25,930
in onCreate method,
I'm going to add that block of code.

51
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:28,830
Now remember what we did here was
first we found the root view for

52
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:31,550
the whole layout then we created
a variable to keep track of

53
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:34,720
the current index position
in the words array list.

54
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,740
And then we created new text views
to display each of those words and

55
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:41,560
added those text views to our
root view to be displayed.

56
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,590
But this was a pretty mail approach.

57
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:46,000
So let's take a look at how
to change it to a while loop.

58
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,390
Starting with this first line
of finding the review for

59
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:50,460
the whole layout,
we do want to keep that.

60
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:53,000
I'll stay here even with
using are while loop.

61
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,010
Now next comes the parts of the while
loop, so I will write that out here.

62
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:00,490
Remember that the while loop requires
setting up the counter variable then

63
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:04,695
comes the while keyword and inside the
condition, followed by the braces and

64
00:03:04,695 --> 00:03:06,800
inside these braces
contained instructions or

65
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,440
tasks as well as updating
the counter variable.

66
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,020
So here's a set up of our while loop.

67
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:14,310
So the first thing we need to do is
to set up the counter variable and

68
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:16,160
it looks like we actually
did that down here.

69
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:19,640
So I'm going to take that piece of
code and substitute it in here.

70
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:23,080
Now next we have the while keyword
followed by the parathesis and

71
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,980
inside we have the test condition.

72
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:28,060
And we're aware that our test condition
is that we need the index variable

73
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:30,980
to be less than ten in order
to continue this while loop.

74
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:32,850
However, instead of
using ten explicitly,

75
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:35,570
I want to use words.size method.

76
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:37,478
That way if the words
list ever does change,

77
00:03:37,478 --> 00:03:39,652
we won't need to update
the test condition here.

78
00:03:39,652 --> 00:03:42,253
It would allow us to automatically
get to the end of the list,

79
00:03:42,253 --> 00:03:43,770
no matter how long it is.

80
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:47,262
All right, so now while this condition
is true, we want to create a text view

81
00:03:47,262 --> 00:03:50,840
and set the text to be the word at
the current index in the words list.

82
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:53,560
And then we needed to display
the text views on the screen.

83
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,770
So since I already have the code for

84
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:57,200
this, let's move it in
the while statement.

85
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,140
So this will take
the place of instructions.

86
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:03,641
Nice, so it looks like we're
almost done all the while loop.

87
00:04:03,641 --> 00:04:06,960
Last thing we need to do here is
to update the counter variable.

88
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,832
Remember that we need to update
the counter variable at the end of each

89
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:13,168
iteration, so that we can exit the loop
when we've reached the end of the list.

90
00:04:13,168 --> 00:04:18,125
So, using the shorthand that we learned
earlier, I'm going to type in index++.

91
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:23,640
And remember, this is a shorthand
that's equivalent to index = index +1.

92
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,960
So I'll just make a comment
of that off to the side,

93
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:26,970
to help you guys remember that.

94
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:31,200
So now I can go ahead and remove the
rest of this whole I don't need anymore

95
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,580
since the while loop does all of that.

96
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:35,630
All right so we just made a number
of changes to our code and

97
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:37,740
implemented a brand new
concept the while loop.

98
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:39,650
So to recap what we just did,

99
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:43,840
remember that we remove the log messages
in the NumbersActivity onCreate method.

100
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,350
We also modified activity_numbers.xml,

101
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:50,870
change it to use a linear layout
instead of a relative layout.

102
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:52,970
We set the orientation
to be vertical and

103
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:55,536
then we added a view
ID called root view.

104
00:04:55,536 --> 00:04:58,450
And lastly, an onCreate method
of the NumbersActivity,

105
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:01,830
we use the three guiding questions to
help us write a while loop to create and

106
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:05,040
display a text view for
each element in the words list.

107
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,070
All right, so earlier we talked a little
bit about kinds of short hands and

108
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:12,550
one common one that we saw was the
index++ that we used in the while loop.

109
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:16,790
And I mentioned that it was
shorthand for index = index +1.

110
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:19,280
There are a number of other
similar math shorthands.

111
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:23,120
For example,
a variable maybe such as j plus or

112
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,200
equals a number so 3 in this case.

113
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:31,480
And as a shorthand for that variable is
assigned that variable plus that number.

114
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:35,340
Additionally, we can have subtraction
shorthands such as taking a variable and

115
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:41,470
then add minus minus and
this is shorthand for i = i- 1.

116
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:45,450
And remember in all these cases we can
substitute different variables and

117
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:46,590
different numbers.

118
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:51,970
It's also really important to notice
that i++ is not just equal to

119
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:57,210
the i + 1 part, but it equals
the entire expression i = i + 1.

120
00:05:57,210 --> 00:06:01,440
So, doing the calculation and
then assigning it back to that variable.
