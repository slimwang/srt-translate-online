00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:05,510
As I said, these reactive systems are hard to build. You probably have heard

2
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:10,880
of examples of complex systems getting into deadlock states or

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:15,960
otherwise freezing up because of the common [UNKNOWN] blowup in

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,710
complexity that occurs from all of the internal things that are going on.

5
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:23,230
So, you have to spend some time in getting these things right. And

6
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:29,410
some kind of behavioral modeling technique, like statecharts, okay,

7
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:35,840
can be very helpful to getting that kind of assurance. Besides statecharts,

8
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,800
UML provides other diagrams that can be used for understanding behavior.

9
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,750
Okay, we've already seen these in our review of UML, activity diagrams,

10
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:49,120
sequence diagrams, collaborations, use cases, communication, timing and

11
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:55,140
interaction overview diagrams. Okay? Outside of UML, there's a couple of

12
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:59,770
other behavioral modeling approaches which I'll just mention to you, we won't go

13
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:04,922
into it. One of those is temporal logic. If you've heard of model checking and

14
00:01:04,922 --> 00:01:10,240
model checking tools these are ways of modelling system and

15
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:15,280
asking can I ever get into this certain state that I don't want to get into,

16
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,790
okay. Am I ensured that I can't get into it, okay and

17
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:22,170
model checking tools can help you get answers to that problem.

18
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:27,550
Another notation for expressing concurrency is process algebras.

19
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:32,570
These allow you to specify what things can go on concurrently and

20
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:36,630
the reads and write behavior between the concurrently executing activities.

21
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,875
We will be looking further into statecharts, we will do, be doing an exercise

22
00:01:42,875 --> 00:01:48,670
that ask you to learn the features. This is such an essential part of getting

23
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:53,500
models right that want to make sure that you have kind of acquired that skill.
