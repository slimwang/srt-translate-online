00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,150
There's a lot of interesting
questions we could answer.

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:06,470
Besides the questions I already
mentioned, we could look at how much

3
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:10,010
time the average student spends
taking classes on Udacity.

4
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:12,720
We could look how time spent
relates to the number of lessons or

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:15,030
projects students complete.

6
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:18,420
We could look at how student
engagement changes over time.

7
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:21,780
Or how many times students submit
projects before they pass and

8
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:24,230
whether this differs for
different projects.

9
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:27,480
I'm sure you thought of a lot of
interesting questions as well.

10
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,810
In this lesson, I'm going to focus on
how the numbers in the daily engagement

11
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:35,230
table differ for students who pass their
first project versus students who don't.

12
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:37,880
But feel free to explore any of
the other questions you've thought of

13
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:39,640
yourself and
share what you find on the forums.
