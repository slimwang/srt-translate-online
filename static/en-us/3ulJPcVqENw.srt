1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:03,340
The answer is in-store name and
description.

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:05,540
Your game will first be
noticed in the app store so

3
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:08,020
that's when you need
the clearest communication.

4
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:11,020
So the most important thing to
translate for different audiences

5
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:14,750
is anything in the app store,
that includes the in-store name and

6
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:18,907
description and maybe the text
that goes to your screen shots.

7
00:00:18,907 --> 00:00:22,630
But the name and description are the
most important because your screen shots

8
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:26,620
should mostly be visual and
not rely on text to communicate.

9
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:30,067
The names of in-app purchases and
leaderboards are less important, and

10
00:00:30,067 --> 00:00:32,790
players should be able to get
an understanding of these features

11
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:33,770
just by playing your game.
