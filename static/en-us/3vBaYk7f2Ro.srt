1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So as we saw, this quiz was particularly tricky.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
It wasn't obvious how to work out the right answer.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
We're really interested in supporting phone numbers from

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
a bunch of different countries or formats, but we're really only interested

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
in that hyphen if it's followed by more digits.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Conceptually, you might think "Wow, I really want to group

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
the hyphen and the digits together and then have either all of them or none of them."

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
We don't know how to do that just yet, but we will in a few more minutes,

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,243
and then you'll get a chance to show off your mastery in the homework.
