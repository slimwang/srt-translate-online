1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,580
This case here is correct for the following reasons, x₃ is just as it is--there's not a not.

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:12,340
What that means is that if we take the path that signifies x₃ is set to true

3
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:15,030
and we know that is the path that goes like this.

4
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:20,170
Then we want to be able to visit this vertex here by paying so to say

5
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:23,110
just one extra edge, so that's exactly this one here.

6
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:28,230
If we had not x3 here, then this answer here would have been correct.

7
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:33,960
It seems like this is actually a good idea to show that any Boolean formula can be transformed

8
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:39,350
into a graph such that the shortest path between A and B tells us whether the original

9
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:44,350
Boolean formula had a satisfying assignment or not, but of course we haven't proved it yet

10
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:51,770
and that is why we will now have to go into gory details in order to actually prove

11
00:00:51,770 --> 99:59:59,999
that we can reduced SAT to shortest tour.
