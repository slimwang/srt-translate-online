00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:03,430
We can only speculate about
the real photo app code, but

2
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:06,670
it's probably something
like the array of structs.

3
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:09,320
But, for many tables, the dictionary
technique would work fine.

4
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:14,780
Note that in both answers, there is
an array of repeating data objects, and

5
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:18,710
each data object can be used to
build a single table view row.

6
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:21,660
We'll experiment with both
types of data structures and

7
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:25,350
we have a SWF session coming up
on array and dictionary syntax.

8
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:28,170
No matter the data structure,
the table view will need to

9
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:32,100
ask questions of its delegate in order
to access the data in the model.

10
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:35,070
Let's take a closer look at the delegate
methods that make this possible
