00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:05,471
So, before conditioning, the tone is a neutral stimulus. It elicits no specific

2
00:00:05,471 --> 00:00:10,730
response other than perhaps an orienting response. After conditioning, the tone

3
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:15,573
is the condition stimulus. Prior to conditioning, the meat powder is an

4
00:00:15,573 --> 00:00:20,668
unconditioned stimulus. It automatically elicits salivation, which brings us to

5
00:00:20,668 --> 00:00:26,298
our unconditioned response. The dog salivating to the meat powder. Remember

6
00:00:26,298 --> 00:00:30,345
after the conditioning, now we have our CS of the tone and the dog will

7
00:00:30,345 --> 00:00:36,060
salivate the condition response to the tone. Great job if you got those right.
