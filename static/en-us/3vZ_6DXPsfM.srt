00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Welcome to Unit 3.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
In Units 1 and 2, we learned about symmetric ciphers and how to use them.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Symmetric ciphers assume that both parties have the same key.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
The important property that makes them symmetric

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
is that the same key is used for encrypting and decrypting.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
In some scenarios, this is okay.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
When we talked about using symmetric ciphers to encrypt a file,

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
we could assume the same party is encrypting and decrypting the file,

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
so they can create and keep the key locally.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
But when we talk about using symmetric ciphers for most applications

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
that involve more than 1 party, this is a big problem.

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
If Alice and Bob want to talk together,

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
they have to first agree on the secret key.

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
There has to be a way for Alice and Bob to

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
communicate that key without exposing it.

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
They can't send it over the insecure channel.

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
If they could send a secret key over an insecure channel, well,

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
they wouldn't need encryption at all.

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
In the early days, this was done by having a secret code book

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
that was physically distributed to the end points that were communicating.

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
With Colossus, this was the code book that had the keys for each day,

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
and that was physically distributed to the capitols where the Lorenz machines were.

23
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
With Enigma, this was physically distributed to all the ships,

24
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
and captains were under very strict orders to destroy those code books

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
any time their ship was in danger of being captured.

26
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
This was the most important thing to destroy on the ship

27
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
to make sure the enemy didn't capture the code book.

28
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
For most applications, especially any civil application in the day of internet,

29
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
distributing a physical code book or having 2 parties meet

30
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
in a secure place to exchange a key is not very practical.

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
What we want is some way to establish a secure key

32
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
or some way to enable 2 parties to communicate

33
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
that doesn't require that, so that's the main topic of this unit.

34
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
We're going to look at different ways that we could enable this kind of communication

35
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
without starting from advance where Alice and Bob have a shared key.
