00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,985
What heuristics tell us about human
thought and decision making is that

2
00:00:03,985 --> 00:00:08,658
they're quick and efficient, and therefore
they're adaptive in everyday life.

3
00:00:08,658 --> 00:00:11,184
They allow us to make decisions
such as whether or not we should

4
00:00:11,184 --> 00:00:14,294
jump out of the way of that
moving car to save our lives.

5
00:00:14,294 --> 00:00:19,448
However, heuristics can also lead
to biased decision and estimate making,

6
00:00:19,448 --> 00:00:22,108
and unfortunately we see
that humans are not as rational

7
00:00:22,108 --> 00:00:23,904
as we would like to think we are.
