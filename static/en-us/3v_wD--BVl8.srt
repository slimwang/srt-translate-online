1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,780
Now, we're going to switch gears and move to a different catagory of mental

2
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:07,826
disorders. And those are disssociative disorders. These disorders produce

3
00:00:07,826 --> 00:00:13,177
extreme disruptions or gaps in memory, identity, or consciousness. In the DSM 5

4
00:00:13,177 --> 00:00:18,619
puts them in their own category. This is a condition in which cognitive

5
00:00:18,619 --> 00:00:24,030
processes are disjointed and fragmented. This disorder often stems from

6
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:28,835
exposure to trauma or extreme stress. And even physical or sexual assault that

7
00:00:28,835 --> 00:00:34,206
occurs. And it's most likely to occur during childhood. Individuals with

8
00:00:34,206 --> 00:00:38,691
dissociative identity disorder will develop at least two separate, independent

9
00:00:38,691 --> 00:00:44,130
identities. Now this used to be called multiple personality disorder. These

10
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:49,236
individuals experience two or more distinct personality states amnesia and self

11
00:00:49,236 --> 00:00:54,178
destructive behaviors. Here, a person may find themselves at a hotel and not

12
00:00:54,178 --> 00:00:58,780
remember how they got there. They may injure themselves or not be able to

13
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:03,944
remember a particular experience in their life. This is reportedly due to the

14
00:01:03,944 --> 00:01:09,312
fact that the other personality is the one engaging in these behaviors. This

15
00:01:09,312 --> 00:01:13,990
disorder is another example of a position that psychologists disagree on. Some

16
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:19,425
psychologists don't agree that this is an actual diagnosis. Some even suggest

17
00:01:19,425 --> 00:01:24,516
that the separate personalities are ultimately produced by the therapist. So we

18
00:01:24,516 --> 00:01:27,918
see here that some psychologist state that this is a real disorder, and some

19
00:01:27,918 --> 00:01:32,035
state that it's not. Now lets go back to Susan, to talk about disorders that

20
00:01:32,035 --> 00:01:34,030
affect the body, and the mind.
