1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,930
We're going to illustrate this
with a very simple example and

2
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:07,420
here it is, so imagine you've got
a robot that just has two things, okay?

3
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:10,420
It is a map of a hallway, okay?

4
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:13,800
So, here you're seeing a hallway and
by the way this little blue dot here,

5
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:17,940
this is the robot, the robot
doesn't actually know where it is.

6
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:21,610
We know where it is because
we're really really smart, okay?

7
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:25,220
Or we work for the NSA,
I hope that didn't cost me my grant.

8
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:28,420
Anyway, so the,
the robot knows this, this map and

9
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:31,990
it knows that it, essentially where the
walls are and where the doors are and

10
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:34,640
we'll assume that the doors are open,
'kay?.

11
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,460
The other thing that the robot has,
is it just has a detector,

12
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:41,532
a sensor really dumb that
just looks out to the side.

13
00:00:41,532 --> 00:00:44,880
You can even think of it as just
gotta stick and it pokes it.

14
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,800
And it says,
do I hit something or don't I?

15
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:51,060
And by the way, it's, it's not very
accurate, so he sticks it out there and

16
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:53,170
sometimes he sticks it this way and
sometimes.

17
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:55,850
So it's, it's approximately
that direction he just says,

18
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:56,890
did I hit something or not.

19
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:59,720
And you might thing that might
be an incredibly dumb robot and

20
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:03,130
you might be right except
here's a picture of a robot.

21
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:06,110
I don't want to insult my SRI friends
because this robot actually got pretty

22
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:09,290
smart but this is the robot originally,
flaky here.

23
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:14,050
And flaky had down below on the bottom,
these little ultrasonic sensors

24
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:17,190
that would send out a chirp and
it would respond back.

25
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:18,500
Did I hit anything?

26
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,890
Or how far away was
the things that I hit?

27
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:25,250
So, humor me that this is just a robot
that basically detects, just a hole or

28
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:27,040
just a not a hole.

29
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,820
That's the only thing that it knows and

30
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:34,450
because it's not perfect in setting
out its, its signal, right?

31
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:39,220
Just because it said,
the sensor says hole,

32
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:41,600
doesn't mean there actually was a hole,
right?

33
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,810
And just because, it says wall doesn't
mean it actually was a wall, okay?
