1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:03,400
All right, we're going to stop here.

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:06,870
We've taken a brief look at model fitting,

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:09,850
as really being a robust estimation problem.

4
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:12,590
So for transforms, you want to estimate the transform and you want to be

5
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:16,570
able to do that robustly, and we use robust error functions to help.

6
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:18,970
But what we're going to look at next time,

7
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:22,590
is a more algorithmic, approach to doing this.

8
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:26,270
Famous method actually invented by a very good friend of mine,

9
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:31,650
he's older than I am, so I'm not quite that old, that we'll talk about.

10
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:36,630
And what's cool is, it's a little bit more computer science oriented, and

11
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:38,810
this is a computer science class so that's great.

12
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:42,960
And it's nice to, you, we can use a little bit of combinatorial analysis to show

13
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,530
exactly how good it is.

14
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:47,550
And the other thing is, it is used all the time, so

15
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:50,550
you can say well finally is going to teach me something useful.

16
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:51,310
Come back next time.
