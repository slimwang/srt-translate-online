1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:04,850
Even though we center our discussion of
accessibility on users with impairments,

2
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:07,400
we can all relate to the experience
of using it to interface,

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:09,050
which is not accessible to us.

4
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:13,120
Have you ever tried to use a desktop
optimized site on a mobile device, or

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,840
seen this content is not
available in your country when you

6
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:17,910
are trying to watch a video online?

7
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:20,900
So in a broad sense you've
almost certainly experienced

8
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:22,480
being unable to access something.

9
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:26,650
As we mentioned, this cause is
largely concerned with accessibility

10
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:31,260
in the narrowest sense of ensuring users
with disabilities can access content.

11
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:35,130
However, addressing accessibility
issues in the narrow sense

12
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:38,258
very often improves the user
experience for everyone.

13
00:00:38,258 --> 00:00:39,230
To see where that's true,

14
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:42,220
let's look at an example with
some accessibility issues.

15
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:43,082
This form have several.

16
00:00:43,082 --> 00:00:47,720
The user name text and some of the text
in the price details is low contrast.

17
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:50,430
So that's hard for
low vision users to read.

18
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:53,390
Having the form labels on the left and
the form fields on the right,

19
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:57,430
makes it hard for most people to
associate them and almost impossible for

20
00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:59,340
someone who needs to
zoom in to use the page.

21
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,209
And this label isn't correctly
associated with the check box.

22
00:01:04,209 --> 00:01:05,000
So I have to tap or

23
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,060
click this tiny square, rather than
being able to click the label.

24
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:13,270
Plus a screen reader user would have
difficulty figuring out the association.

25
00:01:14,358 --> 00:01:18,290
So now let's wave our accessibility
wand and see with those issues fixed.

26
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:21,170
We've made that low contrast text DACA.

27
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:22,390
We've modified the design so

28
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:25,290
the labels are right next
to things they're labeling.

29
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:28,620
And we fixed that label to be
associated with the check box.

30
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:32,760
So now I can check and uncheck it
by clicking anywhere on the label.

31
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:36,860
I'm much more comfortable actually
using the accessible version.

32
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:39,320
Sure, I could probably get
by with the old version.

33
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:40,970
But it would cause some extra stress and

34
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:44,900
possibly cause me to make mistakes
if I was in a hurry or distracted.

35
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:48,800
True story, I once accidentally had
something shipped to me in San Francisco

36
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,880
instead of my parents in Australia,

37
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,040
because of a form that looked a lot
like the previous one we just saw.

38
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,230
So while we want to address
accessibility first and

39
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:59,610
foremost to avoid excluding
people from accessing things,

40
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:02,100
it certainly isn't a zero sum game.

41
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,720
We're more likely to
make things better for

42
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,710
everyone by addressing accessibility.
