00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:04,860
In this lesson we'll be talking about network measurement, or how to see what

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:07,230
traffic is being sent on the network.

3
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:10,563
There are two types of network measurement. One

4
00:00:10,563 --> 00:00:14,140
is passive measurement. In passive measurement we

5
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:19,020
collect packets, flow statistics, and so forth of

6
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:21,600
traffic that is already being sent on

7
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,915
the network. So, this might include packet traces,

8
00:00:24,915 --> 00:00:28,560
flow statistics, or application level logs.

9
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:33,080
In active measurement, we inject additional traffic

10
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:35,700
into the network to measure various characteristics

11
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,720
of the network. So we've seen some

12
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:41,140
examples of active measurement already, such

13
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:43,790
as in the previous lessons, where we

14
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:46,010
actively sent traffic on the network to

15
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:49,980
measure speeds of downloads. Other common active

16
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:55,380
measurement tools include those such as ping, and traceroute. Ping

17
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:59,202
is often used to measure the delay to a particular server.

18
00:00:59,202 --> 00:01:03,640
And traceroute is often used to measure the network level,

19
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:08,080
or the IP level path between two hosts on the network.
