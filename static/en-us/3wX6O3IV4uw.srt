1
00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:04,910
All we have to do, as we saw in the simpler examples before, is take the

2
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:10,520
original function, and then, substitute 2 in a spot of every x. So we get f of 2

3
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:14,724
is equal to 2 squared minus 2 plus 2. Which is just equal to 4.
