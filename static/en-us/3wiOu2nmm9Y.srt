1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,738
This one would be d. For a negative exponent we take the reciprocal of the base

2
00:00:04,738 --> 00:00:09,386
and raise it to a positive power. We know 1 divided by y cubed is the same as 1

3
00:00:09,386 --> 00:00:14,568
divided by y cubed. Next, we multiply our numerators and denominators together

4
00:00:14,568 --> 00:00:19,302
to get 7x squared divided by y cubed. This choice. To get to the answer more

5
00:00:19,302 --> 00:00:24,323
quickly, think about what a negative exponent does. It moves the base from the

6
00:00:24,323 --> 00:00:27,283
numerator to the denominator, just like in d.
