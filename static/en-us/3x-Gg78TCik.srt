1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,050
It wasn't that long ago that computers
were these strange things you

2
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:05,210
put in a separate room.

3
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:08,240
You loaded software on them from
something you got in the mail and

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,330
you printed the output on paper.

5
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:14,220
They were clearly abstract tools for
uncommon tasks.

6
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:17,820
>> Nowadays, all these devices
talk to each other and to use.

7
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,930
They're part of our daily lives,
and provide all sorts of value.

8
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:23,460
From looking at movie
times to calling a taxi or

9
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:25,927
talking face to face with
a friend across the globe.

10
00:00:25,927 --> 00:00:29,070
>> > And yet, much of how we interact
with computers is still abstract and

11
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:30,960
specific to the device at hand.

12
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,900
In fact, many people view the future
of computing as devices everywhere,

13
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:38,020
floating screens, animated graphics
on every surface, cats and

14
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:39,750
dogs living together, pandemonium.

15
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:44,210
>> But that's not what we
mean by ubiquitous computing

16
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:47,980
because it's not the device or the app
that's the most interesting thing here.

17
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:51,790
The most interesting thing is solving
real problems for real people, and

18
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:55,670
then providing that solution anywhere
and everywhere they'd want or need it.

19
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:59,150
That's what we mean by
truly ubiquitous computing.

20
00:00:59,150 --> 00:00:59,770
>> When we build for

21
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:03,970
real people, technology doesn't become
more visible, it becomes less visible.

22
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:06,950
It blends into our lives and freezes
from learning obscure ways of doing

23
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:11,140
things, so that we can focus more on
what we're doing not how we're doing it.

24
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:13,890
>> We hope you've fun learning
the design principles and

25
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:17,290
building blocks for these new form
factors as we've had teaching them.

26
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:20,230
>> Now, go out and make the world
an even cooler place to live in.
