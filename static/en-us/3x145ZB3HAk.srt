1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,439
If you got 10 over 21, you got it right. Let's see how to get that answer. Since

2
00:00:05,451 --> 00:00:10,728
these numbers are large, we want to try to factor them before we multiply them,

3
00:00:10,843 --> 00:00:15,983
and see if we can cancel any factors. So, we can write 8 as, 4 times 2 and we

4
00:00:15,995 --> 00:00:21,344
can write 15 as, 3 times 5. For the second fraction, we can write 25 as 5 times

5
00:00:21,356 --> 00:00:27,185
5. And we can write 28 as 7 times 4. If you notice, there's a 4 in the

6
00:00:27,197 --> 00:00:33,927
numerator, and a 4 in the denominator. So, we know that 4 over 4 equals 1. Also,

7
00:00:34,037 --> 00:00:39,001
there's a 5 in the numerator and a 5 in the denominator and we know that 5 over

8
00:00:39,013 --> 00:00:43,441
5 is equal to 1. So, after we cancel any factors that are in common between the

9
00:00:43,453 --> 00:00:48,657
numerator and the denominator, we simply multiply the numerators together, so

10
00:00:48,669 --> 00:00:53,352
we're left with 2 times 5 and we multiply the denominators together, 3 times 7.

11
00:00:53,628 --> 00:00:59,176
So we know, 2 times 5 is 10, and we know that 3 times 7 is 21.
