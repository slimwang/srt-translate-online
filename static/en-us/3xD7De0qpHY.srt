00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,945
You've been using MathQuill for the past few lessons, and hopefully you've

2
00:00:03,958 --> 00:00:08,215
gotten used to entering exponents and fractions using it, making your equations

3
00:00:08,227 --> 00:00:12,393
and expressions look super pretty. But now that we're starting to use radicals,

4
00:00:12,488 --> 00:00:16,663
we need to use MathQuill in a new way. I already showed you earlier how to enter

5
00:00:16,675 --> 00:00:21,363
square roots in MathQuill, you type backslash sqrt space, and then whatever goes

6
00:00:21,375 --> 00:00:25,691
inside. The MathQuill also lets us write nthroots. So, it allows us to type

7
00:00:25,703 --> 00:00:30,379
radical signs and then type whatever number we want for the index, and then, of

8
00:00:30,391 --> 00:00:35,084
course, enter whatever we want underneath the radical. To write a radical sign

9
00:00:35,096 --> 00:00:39,602
when you need to write a number you just write backslash nthroot space, and then

10
00:00:39,614 --> 00:00:43,605
whatever number you want to go in this spot up here. To get out of typing in the

11
00:00:43,617 --> 00:00:47,477
index spot, to typing underneath the radical sign again, you need to type a

12
00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:51,517
right arrow key. So, try out these first two where you can use some instructions

13
00:00:51,529 --> 00:00:55,302
on what to type. And then, for your two challenge problems, I'd like you to

14
00:00:55,314 --> 00:00:59,024
experiment combining the different functionalities in MathQuill that we've been

15
00:00:59,036 --> 00:01:02,956
using with this new set of tools. So, we have, for example, in this term,

16
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:07,577
exponents combined with radicals and fractions all in one. So, if you can do

17
00:01:07,589 --> 00:01:12,558
this, you're an official MathQuill pro. Just experiment, just have fun to see

18
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:14,785
how incredibly powerful this tool is.
