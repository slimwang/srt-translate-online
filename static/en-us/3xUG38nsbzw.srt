The key thing to remember is point slope form. If we understand the equation for

2
00:00:04,494 --> 00:00:08,703
slope then we know point slope form. We can fix one of the points to be x and y

3
00:00:08,703 --> 00:00:13,120
and then we just plug in another point once we know the slope. This can lead us

00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,098
to the equation.
