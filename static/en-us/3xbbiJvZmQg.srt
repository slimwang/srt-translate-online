00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,730
Now that you have some idea of the tools you have to work with, I want to go

2
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:07,190
back to the three main pillars of optimizing performance

3
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:12,660
that Colt mentioned, Network, Compute, and Render. Let's start

4
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:16,000
by taking a look at Network. The first

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,340
question we have to ask is, what aspects of

6
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:21,980
network usage should we be targeting for optimization? The

7
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:25,920
number of bytes transferred? How often we send requests?

8
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,460
The power consumption of the network stack, or

9
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:31,150
the maximum number of TCP connections we use.
