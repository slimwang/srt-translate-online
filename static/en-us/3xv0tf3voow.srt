1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:01,359
>> All right Charles, what do you think?

2
00:00:01,359 --> 00:00:04,210
>> Okay, so being in the version space just means

3
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:06,920
that you're consistent with the, data that you see. Right?

4
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:07,855
>> Good. Mm-hm.

5
00:00:07,855 --> 00:00:11,450
>> Okay, so we should be able to very quickly go through this. So X1,

6
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:15,200
just copy X1 over. Well, if we look at the training data, in the first

7
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,690
case, X1 is zero and the output is zero. Second case, X1 is one and

8
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:23,210
the output is one. So that is, in fact, consistent with just always copying X1.

9
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:25,360
>> So that is in the

10
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:26,220
version space, right?

11
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:29,184
>> Right. And without even having to think about it, since x1 is in

12
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:30,864
the version space, doing the opposite of

13
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:32,790
x1 can't possibly be in the version space.

14
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:33,220
>> Agreed.

15
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:34,680
>> So let's skip that.

16
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:38,790
>> Looking at x2, we can see that in the first case, you go

17
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:42,680
x2 0, c of x is 0. Yeah, so yeah that's looking good. That's consistent

18
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:45,780
so far. But then on the next row you get 0 and then you

19
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:50,980
get the, opposite of 0. You get 1, the compliment of 0. So, that definitely

20
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:54,940
is inconsistent with just copying over X2, so you can't have X2

21
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:58,150
and by very similar reasoning you can't have the opposite of X2.

22
00:00:58,150 --> 00:00:59,240
>> Agreed.

23
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:02,510
>> Okay, so, true is clearly not consistent because

24
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:04,144
we got a 0 once and a 1 once.

25
00:01:04,144 --> 00:01:04,870
>> Mm-hm.

26
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:07,440
>> And by the same argument false is not consistent because we

27
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:10,510
got a zero once and a one once. Now or, let's see or.

28
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:12,830
>> But in case it's not clear, I probably could have been clearer about

29
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:16,060
this, but here, zeroes and falses are the same thing and ones and trues

30
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:16,830
are the same thing.

31
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:18,260
>> Right. Just like in C.

32
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:18,897
>> [LAUGH]

33
00:01:18,897 --> 00:01:21,380
>> Okay. So I just assume everything you do

34
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:23,530
is written in C, Michael, so, it just works that

35
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:24,710
way. In fact there's a C right up there at

36
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:26,500
the top of the, at the top of the slide.

37
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:29,880
>> Yeah so I feel like I should do this. Now I understand what's going on.

38
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,830
>> Right, now it's in C.

39
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:35,900
>> Much better. Okay, so, or. Or means if either one of them

40
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:40,590
is true, then you say yes and, huh! That's actually consistent with or.

41
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:41,180
>> Yep.

42
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:45,400
>> Hm. But it is not consistent with and,

43
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:48,920
because one and zero would be zero, not one. Second

44
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:52,510
case, XOR, well, I already know it's consistent with XOR,

45
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:54,620
because I happen to know that that's the target concept.

46
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:55,160
>> Yeah.

47
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:58,112
>> And an equiv would be not

48
00:01:58,112 --> 00:02:02,810
consistent. Though interestingly, not equivalent would be consistent.

49
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:05,360
>> Yes, because not equivalent is XOR.

50
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,120
>> Oh, yeah, that's right.

51
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:06,291
>> All

52
00:02:06,291 --> 00:02:09,630
right, so that's, yeah, that's it, X1, OR, AND, XOR.

53
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:10,610
>> Excellent.

54
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:11,420
>> Cool.
