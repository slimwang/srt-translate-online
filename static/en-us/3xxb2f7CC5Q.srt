00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:22,090
>> And that's the point. The point being that often,

2
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:27,610
the new problem is not identical to the old problem. And

3
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:32,159
when it's not identical, then we have to do some reasoning. We can not just

4
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:37,345
retrieve something from memory, and use the same solution that was used earlier.

5
00:00:37,345 --> 00:00:41,368
Case-based reasoning, the phrase case-based reasoning, has two parts to it,

6
00:00:41,368 --> 00:00:45,310
case-based, and reasoning. So far we have looked at the case-based part,

7
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:48,690
where we can just extract something from memory and reuse it.

8
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:52,200
Now we can look at the reasoning part. Once you have extracted something off

9
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:56,320
memory, how can you reason about it, and adapt it, but for the new problem?
