Perfect, thanks Dan. 
Since he's turned you

2
00:00:02,711 --> 00:00:05,169
into a UI expert now, 
where should we define

3
00:00:05,169 --> 00:00:09,039
this list item layout? 
If you're thinking the layout folder,

4
00:00:09,039 --> 00:00:12,481
under the resources directory, 
then you are correct.

5
00:00:12,481 --> 00:00:15,115
Here you can create 
a new layout resource file

6
00:00:15,115 --> 00:00:19,803
called list item forecast. 
Inside that file, define a text view

7
00:00:19,803 --> 00:00:24,657
as the root view, then assign it 
an ID list item forecast text view.

8
00:00:24,657 --> 00:00:27,815
Give it a minimum height, 
so that the list item isn't too short

9
00:00:27,815 --> 00:00:31,692
for tapping on and vertically center 
the text within that item.

10
00:00:31,692 --> 00:00:35,421
Go ahead and try it yourself now. 
And check the box when you're done.
