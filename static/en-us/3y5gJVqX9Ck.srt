00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,430
Welcome to lesson five. You've come a long way, and

2
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:06,240
most of the legwork is done already. If you think

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,180
back to lesson one, and there was that green button

4
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:11,820
that said Create an app, lots of things have happened since

5
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,510
then. But what we didn't tell you is when you

6
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:18,490
created that app, you also created a mobile app. In fact,

7
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:21,700
everything that youâ€™ve done so far is available already on

8
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:25,220
a mobile device. When you added work flow rules and approvals.

9
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:27,340
When you added charts and dashboards. All of

10
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:30,720
that now is instantly mobile. Samantha and Andy

11
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,320
are going to show you that mobile app and

12
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,080
how to add even more cool features to it.
