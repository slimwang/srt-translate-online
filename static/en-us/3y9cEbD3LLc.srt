1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:03,700
Okay, so I see some text here,
and I see some text here,

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:06,990
which probably means that we're
going to have some TextViews involved.

3
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:10,480
Now, they're fairly separated on the
screen and positioned differently, so

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,880
I think these are two
separate TextViews.

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,390
Now in the background,
I can see the Android party picture,

6
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:18,855
which is an image, so this right here,
I'm going to label as an ImageView.
