1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,860
As we said, our plan is to
have the victims contact us.

2
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:07,610
That is, after we spread a malware,
each victim computer, or

3
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:10,820
compromised computer,
will somehow contact us.

4
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:15,100
For example, we may hardcode in the
malware some email address that we use

5
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:17,670
or even our IP address and so on.

6
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:22,160
The first problem with such approach of
hardcoding our content information in

7
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,910
the malware so that the victims can
contact us, is that it is not stealthy.

8
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:28,960
It is a safe bet, that eventually,

9
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,910
security admins will find out that
there are bots on their network and

10
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:36,210
they may be able to obtain
the botcode or the malware.

11
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:38,000
And through malware analysis,

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,080
they may be able to recover
our hardcoded address.

13
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:45,060
From there, they can identify us,
so this is not stealthy at all.

14
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:48,100
The second problem is that,
this is not robust at all,

15
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:52,000
because there's only one single
server for command control.

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,770
That's the one that's
hardcoded in the malware.

17
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:59,080
For example, if we have hardcoded our
email address in the malware, and

18
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:01,710
the email address
account has been banned,

19
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:05,730
then there is no command control
available for victims anymore.

20
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:06,890
So this is not robust.
