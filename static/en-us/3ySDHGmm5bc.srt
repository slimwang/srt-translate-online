1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:04,720
When we square both sides of the equation, we get 2x plus 6 on the left and x

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:10,850
squared minus 2x plus 1 on the right. Great work if you found these two parts.

3
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:14,154
We know a square undoes the square root, so we would be left with this

4
00:00:14,154 --> 00:00:19,850
expression on the left. For the right-hand side, we want to square x minus 1.

5
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:25,000
This means we'll multiply x minus 1 by itself. When we do that, we will get the

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,272
polynomial x squared minus 2x plus 1. Remember this is really a perfect square

7
00:00:30,272 --> 00:00:35,720
so it follows the pattern a squared minus 2ab plus b squared. We can use that

8
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:38,040
pattern to multiply this more quickly.
