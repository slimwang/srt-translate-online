1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
To answer this we'll apply these two formulas.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
First we'll compute x-bar and y-bar.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
X-bar is 2. Y-bar is 8.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Now we'll compute our differences-- -1, 0, 1 for the x's, -4, -1, and 5 for the y's.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:30,000
The numerator of each of these is 4 + 0 + 5 = 9.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,000
The denominator of b is 2, so b is equal to 4.5.

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Now, to sum up the square differences and the y's,

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:49,000
we have 16 + 1 + 25 = 42.

9
00:00:49,000 --> 99:59:59,999
The product of these is 84, so we have 9 / âˆš84, which 0.982.
