1
00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:04,270
Recall the 1-D block row algorithm and
its pseudocode.

2
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:07,868
You know that it's running
time is (2 tau n cubed) / P,

3
00:00:07,868 --> 00:00:12,680
for flops, + alpha P + beta n squared,
for communication.

4
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:16,050
In fact, you can make this
code a little bit faster.

5
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:19,260
All you have to do is rearrange
the statements of the loop body.

6
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:22,450
Notice, I said rearrange
the statements of the loop body.

7
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:25,490
You don't have to actually change
the statements themselves.

8
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:28,800
In the best case, the rearrangement
I have in mind might improve

9
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,450
the performance by up to a factor of 2,
relative to this running time.

10
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,146
Your task is to show me how.

11
00:00:35,146 --> 00:00:40,094
I will pre-fill this text box with these
statements, and I want you to rearrange

12
00:00:40,094 --> 00:00:43,832
them to get this possible factor
of 2 improvement in speed.
