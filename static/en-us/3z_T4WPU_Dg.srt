00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,573
Pattern finding, just like we did in the last quiz is a big part of what makes

2
00:00:04,585 --> 00:00:09,350
math so interesting. Now that we know that each day we make 23 more units total,

3
00:00:09,455 --> 00:00:14,134
what's the best way to find out how many we'll have by the end of day 14, which

4
00:00:14,146 --> 00:00:18,732
is when the expo is? Should we complete the table down to 14 days? Should we

5
00:00:18,744 --> 00:00:23,697
find a mathematical relationship between days and total number made? Or, last

6
00:00:23,709 --> 00:00:27,706
but not least, should we make an estimate about how many wipers will be made by

7
00:00:27,718 --> 00:00:31,516
the end of day 14? This a little bit subjective, and more than one of these

00:00:31,528 --> 00:00:35,058
might actually work, but please pick what you think would be the most.
