1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:09,330
We'll have positive 3 for the first one, negative 3 for the second one, and

2
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:16,134
negative 51 for the third one. Great work, if you've done all three of those.

3
00:00:16,134 --> 00:00:16,203
Now if you weren't quite sure what to do, that's okay. Let's see how it's done.

4
00:00:16,203 --> 00:00:16,931
For the first problem, we know that the a value's really equal to 3. So, we're

5
00:00:16,931 --> 00:00:20,822
going to square this 3. Our b value is really squared to 6, so we'll square the

6
00:00:20,822 --> 00:00:27,500
square root of 6. 3 squared equals 9 and the square root of 6 squared is 6.

7
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:31,502
Then we just subtract these two numbers to get positive 3. For our second

8
00:00:31,502 --> 00:00:35,166
problem, the a value is really equal to the square root of 2. And our b value

9
00:00:35,166 --> 00:00:39,500
is really equal to the square root of 5. Squaring this square root leaves us

10
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:43,331
with 2. And squaring this square root leaves us with 5. So 2 minus 5 equals

11
00:00:43,331 --> 00:00:47,671
negative 3 and this last difference of squares, will have a as 2 root of 3 and

12
00:00:47,671 --> 00:00:54,484
b as 3 root of 7 and here's where we want to be careful. We want to square this

13
00:00:54,484 --> 00:00:59,630
2 and this square root of 3. We know 2 square root is 4. And the square root of

14
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:03,576
3 squared is 3. There's a multiplication between this number and this radical,

15
00:01:03,576 --> 00:01:07,860
so after we square there's still multiplication between this number and this

16
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:13,630
number. We square 3 root 7 to get 9 times 7. Next we multiply 4 times 3 to get

17
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:17,550
12 and 9 times 7 to get 63, and then subtract to get our final answer of

18
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:22,443
negative 51. Now I think that's pretty incredible that we can take something

19
00:01:22,443 --> 00:01:25,720
that contains radicals. and pop out just one number
