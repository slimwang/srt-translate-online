00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:04,610
Okay, we're starting course two on congestion control and

2
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:08,520
streaming. And we'll first talk about congestion control. In

3
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:12,010
particular, what is congestion control and why do we

4
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:14,840
need it? Simply put, the goal of congestion control

5
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:18,720
is to fill the Internet's pipes without overflowing them.

6
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,400
So to think about this in terms of an

7
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,140
analogy, suppose you have a sink. And you're filling

8
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:26,130
that sink with water. Well, how should you control

9
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:29,340
the faucet? Too fast and the sink overflows.

10
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:33,390
Too slow and you are not efficiently filling up

11
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:38,260
your sink. So what you would like to do is to fill the bucket as quickly as

12
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:41,350
possible without overflowing. The solution here is to

13
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:43,670
watch the sink. And as the sink begins to

14
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:46,400
overflow, we want to slow down how fast

15
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:49,250
we're filling it. That's effectively how congest control works.
