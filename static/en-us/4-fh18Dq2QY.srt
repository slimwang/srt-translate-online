1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,180
This third one is the answer to our first question.

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:07,150
The visible property in data-bind makes the element visible when

3
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:11,760
a variable is true, and vice versa when the variable is false.

4
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:14,625
Our second answer is this first one here.

5
00:00:14,625 --> 00:00:19,700
The click property in data-bind will run a function when the click happens.

6
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:23,940
So, when we click on this button, the resetClicks function will run.
