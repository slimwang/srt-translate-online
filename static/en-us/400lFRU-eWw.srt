00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:06,460
Since we have m and b, we can just plug these in to slope intercept form to find

2
00:00:06,471 --> 00:00:11,547
the equation for each of these lines. Line f has the equation y equals negative

3
00:00:11,547 --> 00:00:16,375
x minus 2. Line g we can just write as y equals negative 1/2 x. You could, of

4
00:00:16,387 --> 00:00:22,810
course, also write plus 0 out here, but that's not necessary. And lastly, line h

5
00:00:22,822 --> 00:00:27,331
is y equals negative 1/2 x plus 3. As we saw before, lines g and h have the same

6
00:00:27,343 --> 00:00:32,259
slope, negative 1/2, and we can see on the graph that they look parallel. They

7
00:00:32,271 --> 00:00:37,191
don't have the same y intercept, but they do point in the same direction.

8
00:00:37,307 --> 00:00:42,331
Parallel, as we learned very early in the lesson, just means same slope.
