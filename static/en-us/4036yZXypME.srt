00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,810
>> Well, it turns out it doesn't matter which one you call p1, or p2. I'm going

2
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:09,637
to find the slope with this one as p1, and this one as p2. I'm going to label

3
00:00:09,637 --> 00:00:14,527
this point with x sub 1, y sub 1, and this point with x sub 2, y sub 2. Y sub 2

4
00:00:14,527 --> 00:00:19,487
is 3, and y sub 1 is 6, so I have 3 minus 6. X sub 2 is 7, and x sub 1 is 4, so

5
00:00:19,487 --> 00:00:24,812
I have 7 minus 4 for the run. I have negative 3 divided by 3 which makes

6
00:00:24,812 --> 00:00:30,772
negative 1, but let's see if this works the other way. I can label this point 2

7
00:00:30,772 --> 00:00:36,587
and this point 1. So this time y2 is 6 and y1 is 3 and for the x values, x2 is 4

8
00:00:36,587 --> 00:00:42,430
and x1 is 7. Here I have 3 divided by negative 3, and look at that, I still get

9
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:43,424
negative 1.
