00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:06,758
Substituting in e to the 2 x equals e squared, and 5 e to the x equals 5 u. We

2
00:00:06,758 --> 00:00:12,974
end up with u squared minus 5 u plus 6 equals 0. Now it's time to factor. This

3
00:00:12,974 --> 00:00:18,058
is equivalent to u minus 3 times u minus 2 equals 0. Then it's super easy to

4
00:00:18,058 --> 00:00:24,226
solve for u. We have u minus 3 equals 0 and u minus 2 equals 0. That gives us u

5
00:00:24,226 --> 00:00:27,259
equals 3 or u equals 2 as our solutions.
