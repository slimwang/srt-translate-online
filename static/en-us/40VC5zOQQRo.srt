00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,878
Alright, so not too much code. First we call a new XMLHttpRequest, then we

2
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:10,144
specify the open method with the parameters GET, weapon.json, and true since we

3
00:00:10,156 --> 00:00:15,241
want the call to be asynchronous and then we set the onload function to be our

4
00:00:15,253 --> 00:00:20,459
parsing code from before and finally we kick-off the request with xhr.send.

5
00:00:20,471 --> 00:00:25,304
Now, if we open this in chrome's developer tools, we can see that we actually do make

6
00:00:25,316 --> 00:00:29,950
this request for weapon.JSON, method get and it's successful status, and it

7
00:00:29,962 --> 00:00:34,319
takes about thirteen milliseconds. And if we look at the console, we can see

8
00:00:34,331 --> 00:00:38,751
that we do actually print out the value of the X parameter that we were looking

9
00:00:38,763 --> 00:00:39,368
for before.
