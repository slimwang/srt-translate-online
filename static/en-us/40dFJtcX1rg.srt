00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:02,860
We've already seen the problems with callbacks.

2
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:07,800
And, of course, object-oriented programming language can have lots of callbacks.

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:12,375
And an object which has the ability to make calls to self or

4
00:00:12,375 --> 00:00:17,510
this, which are self-referencing methods, compounds this problem.

5
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:21,740
In general, with objects, it becomes much more difficult to guarantee contracts

6
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:25,440
in the face of object callbacks and inter-method calls.

7
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,900
The problem is even worse in the presence of multi-threading.

8
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:30,520
Other problems like inheritance and

9
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:33,670
fragile base class definitions are discussed in the next few slides.
