1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,740
So how can you make sure that you will
have all of the indexes that your

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:03,650
queries will need?

3
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:06,640
Well, one way would be you could
manually edit index.yaml for

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,250
each index that you're going to need.

5
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:11,180
Another way is that you can run every
multi-property query on localhost

6
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:12,220
before you deploy to appspot.

7
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:13,180
That would also work.

8
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:16,000
You'd have to make sure you ran every
single one at possibly every path

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,180
through your application.

10
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:20,550
In that case the auto-generator would
write index.yaml which would get pushed

11
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:21,940
when you deploy your application.

12
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:24,780
Marking all your properties you need
indexed with index equals True,

13
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:25,920
that's not going to work.

14
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,640
That will not generate any
multi-property indexes.

15
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,660
But for single-property indexes,
you don't need to do anything.
