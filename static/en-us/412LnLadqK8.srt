1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,400
To do this we're going to make
some simplifying assumptions.

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:09,820
The first assumption is
a Markovian assumption and

3
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:13,120
that's that only
the immediate past matters.

4
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:18,400
So what this says is,
if I know all of the states up through

5
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:24,410
t minus 1, and I want a prediction
of this state at time t.

6
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:27,620
That just depends on
the state of t minus 1.

7
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:29,710
Now these are Xs, not the Ys.

8
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:32,600
These are if I actually knew the state.

9
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:37,230
What this tells me is if I wanted to
predict the state on Wednesday, and

10
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:42,440
I knew the state on Tuesday,
Monday, Sunday, Saturday.

11
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:45,390
It's all the same as knowing
the state on Tuesday.

12
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:47,860
Okay?
I only have to know one prior state.

13
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:50,650
Now some of you might ask, but,
wait a minute, if I know Monday and

14
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:54,550
Tuesday, I might be able to estimate
the velocity for Wednesday.

15
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:55,520
>> If I know Monday and

16
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,600
Tuesday, I might be able to
estimate the velocity on Wednesday.

17
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,000
>> So that's right, except not, because.

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,780
Your state could also
include the velocity, right?

19
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:10,932
So, if I knew the position and the
velocity on Tuesday I make a prediction

20
00:01:10,932 --> 00:01:14,208
about Wednesday, so
this is the Markovian assumption.

21
00:01:14,208 --> 00:01:17,065
This probability of Xt given Xt minus 1,

22
00:01:17,065 --> 00:01:23,690
that's what we refer to as the dynamics
model, that's how things are changing.

23
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:25,920
Second simplifying assumption.

24
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,870
We're going to assume
that the measurements,

25
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:34,410
the probability of the measurements,
remember, these are noisy measurements.

26
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:36,340
Given everything in the past, and

27
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:40,750
the current state,
only depends on the current state.

28
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:44,450
So this is where we say that
the probability of a measurement,

29
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:48,640
given a particular state and everything
else, only depends upon the state.

30
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:53,748
By the way this is called the
observation model and I will tell you,

31
00:01:53,748 --> 00:01:58,792
it is this particular assumption
that is sometimes the most suspect.

32
00:01:58,792 --> 00:02:02,924
One way you can think about this,
suppose you have some noise in your

33
00:02:02,924 --> 00:02:06,708
sensor that is related to some
other processes going on.

34
00:02:06,708 --> 00:02:10,725
And it changes in a particular way
that you might be able to estimate.

35
00:02:10,725 --> 00:02:11,675
This thing says, well,

36
00:02:11,675 --> 00:02:16,095
I don't look at my previous measurements
in order to make that prediction.

37
00:02:16,095 --> 00:02:18,990
So for everything we're going to do,

38
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:21,480
we're going to make use of
this observation model,

39
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:24,640
where the likelihood of the measurement
depends only on the current state.

40
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,500
Just know that for more advanced things
like conditional random fields and

41
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,940
other, other approaches.

42
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:31,890
We'll actually be able to
make the current measurement

43
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:34,860
tied to previous measurements, but
we're not going to do that here.

44
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:38,620
I know some of you have taken various
machine learning courses, and

45
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:40,800
you're familiar with graphical models.

46
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,040
And, if I were to draw up this
set of simplifying assumptions

47
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,640
as a graphical model,
it would look like this.

48
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:51,580
And what this says is that some state X,
depends only on the state at time T,

49
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:54,990
depends only on the state
at time T minus 1.

50
00:02:54,990 --> 00:03:00,530
And furthermore, it says that my
measurement depends only on the state.

51
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:02,660
And whenever I look at that,
I always think to myself, hm.

52
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:05,000
Okay, that's a joke.

53
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,840
Why?

54
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,370
because those of you who know what this
is, this is a hidden mark up model.

55
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:11,520
An HMM.

56
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:14,350
See, now Megan, who's helping with
the slides, she didn't know that, so

57
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:16,300
she didn't know how funny that was.

58
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,230
So she's now what is it?

59
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:19,850
ROTL?

60
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:22,760
No, ROTFL, sorry, I,
I left out the floor.

61
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:25,420
It's really hard to say emoticon things.

62
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:27,417
Not emoti, what do you call those thing,
whatever they are.

63
00:03:27,417 --> 00:03:28,583
She's, now she's getting up.
