1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Now assume the test comes back negative, the same logic applies as before.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
So please give me the combined probability of cancer given the negative test result

3
00:00:11,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and the combined probability of being cancer-free given the negative test result.
