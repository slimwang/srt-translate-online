00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,430
So let's have a quiz to review our

2
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:07,890
knowledge of the difference between worms and viruses. So

3
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:10,000
what's the main difference between a worm and a

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,830
virus? Is it that worms do not have destructive

5
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:16,300
payloads, whereas viruses do? Is it that viruses

6
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:19,740
only infect Windows machines, whereas worms can infect any

7
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:22,340
kind of machine? Is it that viruses can spread

8
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:25,280
more rapidly than worms? Or is that worms can

9
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:29,460
spread automatically without human intervention, whereas

10
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:32,009
viruses require human intervention to spread.
