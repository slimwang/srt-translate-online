Now, let's watch the end of the clip, and see what happens. [SOUND]. Greg still

2
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:10,964
flinched even though I didn't shoot the gun, but I hit the bill. We see that

3
00:00:10,964 --> 00:00:14,546
Greg still flinches, even though I didn't shoot him with the toy gun. He's

4
00:00:14,546 --> 00:00:18,110
learned to flinch after hearing the bell, because we classically conditioned

5
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:22,544
him. To have a startle response to the sound of the bell. This is a learned

6
00:00:22,544 --> 00:00:25,444
association. I'm going to have Susan explain to you, what classical

7
00:00:25,444 --> 00:00:27,159
conditioning is all about.
