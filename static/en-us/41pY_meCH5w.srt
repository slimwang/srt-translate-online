1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
To work out the answer, let's look at the individual features for each of the states.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:13,000
For this state up here, the values for F1, F2, and F3 would be 2, 1, and 1.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
That is, the distance from the agent to the goal is 2,

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:24,000
the distance to the closest bad guy is 1, and the distance of the bad guy to the goal is 1.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Now this state here also has values 2, 1, and 1.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
That would be indistinguishable under either functions F or G.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
This state here has values 2, 1, and 3.

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
The 2 and the 1 are the same, so that would be indistinguishable under F,

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
but would be different under G.

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
And this state has values 2, 3, and 1, and the 2 and 3 are different than 2 and 1,

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
so that would be different under either F or G.

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Now the question which is a more useful function--

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:09,000
the answer is G is more useful, because G can actually distinguish between these 2 states.

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
In this state the agent is surround by bad guys, so that's a bad situation.

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
In this state the agent has a clear path to the goal, so that's a good situation.

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
You'd want a function that says that those two are different

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
rather than one that says they're the same.

18
00:01:24,000 --> 99:59:59,999
G says they are different whereas F says they're the same.
