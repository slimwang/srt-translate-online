1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So now we have equations that govern the

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
rates of change of the position and the velocity.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
The rate of change of the position is the velocity,

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and the rate of change of the velocity is the acceleration,

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
which is by Newton's law, force divided by mass,

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
and in a typical setting, we also know the position

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
at time 0 and the velocity at time 0.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Now we are going to use the computer to learn

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
what these equations are leading to, and the easiest

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
way for doing so is called the Forward Euler Method.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
The most complex thing about that method may be

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
the name of Euler.

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Euler was born in Basel, Switzerland, that is.

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Most people these days use the German pronunciation

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
of his name -- Euler -- even though the

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Swiss pronunciation may be different from that,

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
and in the U.S., you may also hear the pronunciation Euler.

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I try to stick to the pronunciation Euler,

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
but forgive me if I, from time to time, fall back into saying Euler

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Euler's idea was to solve these equations

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
by walking in small time steps.

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
If we start at the initial position--

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
x(0) and the initial velocity -- v(0),

24
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,000
what would happen after a short timespan we call h?

25
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The position would approximately increase by h times the velocity.

26
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
If the velocity is 2 meters per second,

27
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
and we wait for 3 seconds,

28
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
we will be changing the position by 6 meters, for instance.

29
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
But, of course, we're using a much smaller time step.

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Similarly for the velocity, after some small time h,

31
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
the velocity will be its original value plus

32
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
the time step times the acceleration, which is F/m.

33
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
So these equations will take us from

34
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
time 0 to time h approximately.

35
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I'm cheating a little when I write equal signs here.

36
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
In the same fashion, we can get from time h to

37
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
time 2h doing another step.

38
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
This is what this second step looks like.

39
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
We know the position that we have reached at the end of the first step,

40
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
and we continue with the new velocity,

41
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
and that results in the new position --

42
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
similarly for the velocity.

43
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
You iterate this process over and over again

44
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
and find estimates for positions and velocities as you go.
