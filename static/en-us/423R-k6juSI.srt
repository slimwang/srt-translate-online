1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,913
Step 4, copy each act of nodes edge list to this array.

2
00:00:03,913 --> 00:00:10,312
So vertex 1 copies its 3 element neighbor list into the output array, starting at offset 0,

3
00:00:10,312 --> 00:00:13,550
and vertex 3 copies its only neighbor to offset 3.

4
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:18,789
So the potential new frontier here are nodes 0, 2, 4, and 4.
