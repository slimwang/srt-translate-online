00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,969
You may have seen a recent news
story about a team of Japanese and

2
00:00:02,969 --> 00:00:06,800
German researchers who wrote a program
to simulate the human brain.

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,850
Brains!

4
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:11,490
And in fact, their program didn't
simulate the entire brain,

5
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:15,910
just 1% of it over a short
period simulated time.

6
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:22,160
Now 1% of the brain is about 2 billion
neurons and 10 trillion synapses.

7
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,240
Very roughly speaking, neurons and
synapses form a kind of network

8
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,480
where neurons are like nodes,
and synapses are like edges.

9
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,900
The synapses serve as kinds of
communication channels connecting

10
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:35,390
the neurons.

11
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:38,490
Now as it happened in the simulation,
these synapses, because there are so

12
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:41,480
many more of them, accounted for
most of the storage and

13
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:43,130
computation in the model.

14
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:45,190
And in particular,

15
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:48,340
the reason these researchers needed to
run their simulation on a super computer

16
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:51,970
is because every synapse required
about 24 bytes of storage.

17
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:57,500
I think you can imagine that 24 bytes
times ten trillion is a lot of bytes.

18
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:01,840
Now, suppose I gave you a computer
work station with 16 gibibytes of

19
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,080
main memory.

20
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:06,670
If you don't know what a gibibytes is,
please see the instructor's notes.

21
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:08,620
Here's my question to you.

22
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:14,330
How many of these 16 gibibytes machines
would you need to store a full model?

23
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:17,630
That is, all 100% of the brain.

24
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:20,180
I want you to type your
answer in this box, and

25
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:23,700
please enter it to 2
significant figures.

26
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:27,366
So, for example,
if you thought the answer was 232.7,

27
00:01:27,366 --> 00:01:29,141
you would just write 230.
