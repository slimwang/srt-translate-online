>> Now that you've seen how to convert to slope intercept form, I want you to

2
00:00:03,852 --> 00:00:07,923
try and graph this equation. I've marked up some points, and I want you to check

3
00:00:07,923 --> 00:00:11,567
all the boxes that make our graph. Take your time on this problem and think

4
00:00:11,567 --> 00:00:15,142
about it. Be really careful with your negative signs, and think about the

5
00:00:15,142 --> 00:00:19,063
directions you need to move with slope. As always, try your best. And if you get

6
00:00:19,063 --> 00:00:23,324
stuck, try watching the previous video again. Or, watch some of the answer and

7
00:00:23,324 --> 00:00:28,032
then pause it, until you get unstuck. This allows you to monitor your thinking,

8
00:00:28,032 --> 00:00:30,080
and continue solving the problem.
