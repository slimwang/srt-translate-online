00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,288
So now, that we've got an idea of how to use function notation in the context of

2
00:00:04,288 --> 00:00:08,514
equations, how do we actually use it? Well, it gives us a sort of short hand, as

3
00:00:08,514 --> 00:00:13,298
we saw in a couple of quizzes before. For instance, if someone walks up to me

4
00:00:13,298 --> 00:00:18,638
and asks me, what is the value of x squared minus x plus 2, when x is equal to

5
00:00:18,638 --> 00:00:22,878
2? Well, function notation comes in super handy here. If we recognize that x

6
00:00:22,878 --> 00:00:28,926
squared minus x plus 2 is a function where x is the independent variable, the

7
00:00:28,926 --> 00:00:34,782
same thing is asking, if f of x equals x squared minus x plus 2, then what is f

8
00:00:34,782 --> 00:00:40,275
of 2? So actually, just because I know you want to solve this problem, what is f

9
00:00:40,275 --> 00:00:42,873
of 2? Please fill your answer into this box.
