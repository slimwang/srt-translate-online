00:00:01,569 --> 00:00:02,480
Welcome.

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:04,300
Please confirm your name.

3
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:05,170
>> JP.

4
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:06,210
>> Full name.

5
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:07,680
>> JP Soucheck.

6
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,470
>> Please verify your identity.

7
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:10,510
>> Come on.

8
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:11,720
I just want to see Lilah.

9
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,660
>> What is your date of birth?

10
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:14,550
>> September 12th.

11
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:16,040
>> Father's middle name.

12
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:16,880
>> Peter.

13
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,960
>> Social security number.

14
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,790
>> Come on.
I just want to get through the door.

15
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:23,170
>> Please put your eye
next to the scanner.

16
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:26,280
Scare.

17
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:27,510
Mother of an Android.

18
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:29,990
>> Eye scan verified, you may entry.

19
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:33,890
>> JP, hey.

20
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,980
>> So
what's up with the whole door thing?

21
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:40,820
>> Well you know given
our recent trolling,

22
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:44,420
I really decided that I think
authentication is a priority for us.

23
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:46,290
We need to know what
user's identities are so

24
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:48,500
that we know that they
are who they say they are.

25
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:51,260
Anyways, I made these cool wire frames.

26
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:55,890
In fact, for version 0.3 of the app,
the developer and

27
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:57,990
I are going to work on the login flow.

28
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:01,190
Luckily, Firebase makes
authentication dead simple.

29
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:02,870
It has support for email login and

30
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:05,310
a bunch of other providers
such as Google login.

31
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:06,828
We're going to implement both.

32
00:01:06,828 --> 00:01:10,270
And then, once we actually know who's
logged in, we can implement some cool

33
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:13,470
functionality, like letting users
signal that they bought items, or

34
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:15,180
that they're in the store shopping.

35
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:18,810
This will allow anyone looking at
the list to easily see things like,

36
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:21,489
Walter's in the store, or
that Kugare has bought cheesy flakes.

37
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:23,720
>> Right where do we start?

38
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:27,013
>> Hm, well I should actually continue
working on these login screens a little

39
00:01:27,013 --> 00:01:30,010
bit, but maybe you can talk to
the developer about authentication.

40
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,210
>> Let's talk about authentication.
