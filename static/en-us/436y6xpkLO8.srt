1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Finally, the general concept of a cause can be misleading.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
To think about the window shuttering, we said it was the ball. It's right.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
But, it could also have been the window maker.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
If the window maker had not made this particular window

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
then the window would not have shuttered

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
and if the house builder had not built this particular house with the window in it

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
then the window would not have shuttered either.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
For a single effect, there can be multiple causes,

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and all of these are valid according to our earlier definition.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
This is where the concept of an actual cause comes in handy.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
An actual cause assumes and changes as little as possible, but it changes the effect.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
If we think about the causes we have discussed, a ball shuttering the window

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
does not change much except for the window.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
The window maker not producing the window makes of a larger different

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
because then we would have the house with one window missing

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
for quite some time, which would change a lot.

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Parts of the house would get very wet for instance,

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
would be cold or hot depending on the climate.

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
If the house maker had not built the house, the change would be even bigger.

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
So, what you want is an actual cause

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
that assumes and changes as little as possible, which precisely what the ball is in here.

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
For debbugging the same hole, you want to have a cause

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
that assumes and changes as little as possible but still produces the effect,

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
and that's precisely what delta debugging gets you starting with the general cause

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
the entire input reproduces an actual cause namely a subset of the input

26
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
in which everything is relevant for producing the effect.

27
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Here's a quiz. I invoke the GNU compiler, and it crashes.

28
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Which of these are general causes for the failure?

29
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Is it me because no me, no invocation, no crash

30
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
or is it Richard Stallman, the founder of the GNU project

31
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
because without Stallman no GNU compiler no crash

32
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,000
or is it oxygen, without oxygen, no Richard Stallman, no me, no compiler,

33
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
no crash, probably also no world as we know it, no computers,

34
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
no electricity, interesting, or finally is it a bug in the compiler

35
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
because no bug no crash. Check all that applied.
