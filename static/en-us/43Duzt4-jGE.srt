00:00:00,005 --> 00:00:06,909
9.0 minus 7.9 is 1.1. We still need an equal sign of course. And on the other

2
00:00:06,909 --> 00:00:10,142
side of the equation, we still keep our log base 10 of J, since nothing down

3
00:00:10,142 --> 00:00:16,222
here has cancelled that out. And we're subtracting log based 10 of C. Now, we

4
00:00:16,222 --> 00:00:22,196
have minus log based 10 of S here, and we're actually adding one down here. So,

5
00:00:22,196 --> 00:00:26,633
those two cancel out and this is all we're left with.
