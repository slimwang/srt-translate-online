1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,140
Well, there are lots of features within
Google Analytics, but the top three that

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:06,689
I would say that are really important,
the first one is measuring events.

3
00:00:06,689 --> 00:00:09,460
And events is learning how to
measure user engagement and

4
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:11,460
with an interactive
content like buttons or

5
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:14,910
videos, or any other media
that's inside the app itself.

6
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:17,448
The second one is measuring
in-app payments or

7
00:00:17,448 --> 00:00:19,548
transactions that are within the app.

8
00:00:19,548 --> 00:00:21,898
And the third one is measuring
your campaign effectiveness.

9
00:00:21,898 --> 00:00:25,333
So this is how you can implement
campaign measurement to understand

10
00:00:25,333 --> 00:00:29,020
which channels and campaigns are doing
app installs for your app today.
