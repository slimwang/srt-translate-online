Okay. Let's try an easier quiz this time with evaluating expressions. You'll

00:00:03,677 --> 00:00:07,101
need to remember how to perform operations with fractions. Here are some

expressions. Notice, I have variables in the expressions. Here are the variables

00:00:11,007 --> 00:00:14,607
and their assigned values. A smile is equal to 3/4. A diamond is equal to 1/12.

00:00:15,072 --> 00:00:18,449
You can put your answers in these boxes here. Remember, if your answer is a

00:00:18,461 --> 00:00:22,060
fraction, enter it as a number, the fraction bar, and then a number. The first

number is the numerator, the second one is the denominator. Good luck.
