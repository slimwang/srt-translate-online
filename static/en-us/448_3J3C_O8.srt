00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:04,340
So I've got the website open and I've
opened dev tools to the Network tab.

2
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:08,150
I've hit refresh and
all of the network requests are showing.

3
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:10,840
Here's one image and here's the other.

4
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:13,810
Notice that their size
definitely isn't the same.

5
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:17,470
One is 123 kilobytes while
the other is only 63 kilobytes.

6
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,075
It looks like udacity_large has
different dimensions than udacity_small.

7
00:00:22,075 --> 00:00:26,180
$0 refers to whatever
element you have selected,

8
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:29,510
up in the Elements pane, which,
in this case, is the image.

9
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:31,690
When you do .naturalWidth on the image,

10
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:35,210
you see that its original
width is 601 pixels.

11
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:37,430
Now, I want to take a look
at the other image.

12
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:40,870
Running the same command
gives us 1202 pixels.

13
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:43,300
So large is twice as big as small.

14
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:45,750
The thing is though that
both of these images look,

15
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:48,080
well, pretty much identical.

16
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:51,360
So there's a lot of wasted bytes when
you deliver an image with dimensions

17
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,380
that are just too large.

18
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:58,830
Well yes, some high dpi displays do
need images that have larger dimensions

19
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:02,910
than what's displayed, that's going to
be a topic later on in this course.

20
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:06,250
For now, just remember that
images only need to be as large

21
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:08,040
as they will be displayed.

22
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,652
And what happens to
your users on mobile?

23
00:01:09,652 --> 00:01:12,930
In devtools,
I've set network throttling to 3G,

24
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:16,270
so I want to see what it's like for
somebody on a bad connection.

25
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:17,970
Let's refresh and watch.

26
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:18,470
Ooh.

27
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:23,430
Notice how the image on the right
took a little bit longer to show up?

28
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:25,430
That's just unnecessary.

29
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:28,360
On a mobile device with limited
connectivity, it's a big problem.
