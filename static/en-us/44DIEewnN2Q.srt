1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:03,990
Our class code is the object-oriented
representation of a table in

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:05,120
our database.

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,930
The only thing we need to do
is create a class name, and

4
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:10,610
make it extend from the Base
class we just created.

5
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:14,040
For conventional purposes,
let's make all of our classes start with

6
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:18,540
a capital letter with no spaces in
between, also called camo casing.

7
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:21,690
Inside of this class declaration,
we will add all of the code for

8
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:23,800
our table and mapper code.

9
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:27,280
For this project, we will need to
create two classes to correspond with

10
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:31,360
the two tables we want to create in our
database, restaurant and menu item.

11
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:34,320
Be sure to write this class
code between your beginning and

12
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,160
ending configuration code.

13
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,540
Inside each of our classes,
we must create a table representation,

14
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:43,810
we use the special variable, double
underscore table name double underscore.

15
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:48,100
To let SQLAlchemy know the variable
that we will use to refer to our table.

16
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,450
For conventional purposes,
let's make our table names lowercase,

17
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:53,190
with underscores for spaces.

18
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:56,800
Inside our restaurant class, we will
set double underscore tablename double

19
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,820
underscore equal to restaurant,
and inside the MenuItem class we

20
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:03,990
will set it equal to menu
underscore item, as seen here.
