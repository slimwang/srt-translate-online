00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:04,700
Next, I want to make sure you're aware of the online wiki for this course.

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:08,690
It has information such as the class syllabus, lecture schedule,

3
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:12,860
project schedule, various resource links that are useful for the class.

4
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:17,340
It also has grading criteria and other policies that are valid for the course.

5
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:20,320
Let me now explain the grading policy in this class.

6
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,310
Your grade will roughly be split between the theoretical and the practical part.

7
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:27,700
The theoretical part, you will have two exams, a mid-term and a final.

8
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:29,520
The final will not be cumulative and

9
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:32,710
these will be worth 25 and 30% of your grade.

10
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:35,410
Your projects will be worth 40% of your grade, so

11
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:37,360
these are your programming assignments.

12
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,757
and you will have 5% of your grade come from class participation.

13
00:00:40,757 --> 00:00:44,418
Given that the class is online, for class participation, we expect you to

14
00:00:44,418 --> 00:00:47,977
participate in Piazza, the online forum that we'll use in this class.

15
00:00:47,977 --> 00:00:51,135
How well you answer to questions posted by other students,

16
00:00:51,135 --> 00:00:54,102
how often you raise an interesting and useful topics for

17
00:00:54,102 --> 00:00:57,573
discussion in the forum, and also how well you do on the quizzes on

18
00:00:57,573 --> 00:01:01,780
the Audacity platform that will be incorporated in the class lessons.

19
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:04,769
You can always monitor your grades in T-Square.

20
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:08,350
For the exams, we'll use an online service called ProcterU.

21
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:11,530
As the name suggests, this is a service that proctors you

22
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:15,400
during the examination and insures academic honesty.

23
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,440
The tests are to be taken individually, and

24
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,520
they will be closed notes, closed book exams.

25
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,740
For the projects, you can work in teams.

26
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:26,900
Across teams, you can have high level discussions about your design approach or

27
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:28,570
implementation approach.

28
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:33,180
But, you're not allowed to share code, results, text for the final report.

29
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:36,160
You should have these discussions thru Piazza, so

30
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:39,400
both the core staff, as well other students can help you.
