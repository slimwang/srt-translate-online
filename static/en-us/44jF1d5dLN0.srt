00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:04,000
Let's recap our four major expectations. One, a

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,180
time commitment. You need to be sure to set

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:10,460
aside enough time to complete the course. Two, interaction.

4
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:12,410
We want you to actively engage with us here

5
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:14,140
by answering the questions as we go through

6
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:18,750
them. Three, minimal background. You don't need much information.

7
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:20,330
So just bring yourself, and you'll get through the

8
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:25,290
course just fine. And four, get and give help.

9
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:28,820
If you need extra additional resources, be sure to check out the links under

10
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:31,450
the instructor's notes in the discussion forums.

11
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:33,290
And as always, help out your fellow

12
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:35,760
classmates. If you have information that can

13
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,150
help answer a fellow classmate's question, go

14
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:41,540
to the forums and give it a shot. We could always use another genome guide.
