1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,050
All right, mag is short for magnitude.

2
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:07,260
And this is a decimal value that tells
us how strong the earthquake was.

3
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:11,140
Place is just the location of the
earthquake expressed in an abbreviated

4
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:13,150
English text string.

5
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:16,340
Time is the timestamp for
the earthquake event.

6
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:20,507
It is expressed in Unix Epoch time,
which we talked about earlier.

7
00:00:20,507 --> 00:00:22,740
Felt might be a tricky one.

8
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:27,300
The USGS site includes a metric called,
did you feel it?

9
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:30,060
So the felt value
represents an aggregation

10
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:33,430
of website users that reported
that they felt the quake and

11
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:36,400
how strong they suspect
that it might have been.

12
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:39,260
Tsunami is another
potentially tricky one.

13
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:41,620
What the heck is this doing here?

14
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:46,120
Well, it's true that tsunamis are a
potential hazard when earthquakes occur

15
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:49,000
in the ocean or near coastal land areas.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,870
So sometimes a tsunami alert
will be issued and used

17
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:56,920
by an emergency notification network
to warn people near the coastline.

18
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:01,220
This value registers a 1 if
there is a tsunami alert, and

19
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:03,230
0 if there is no alert.

20
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:07,520
This is a kind of way to say that
a value is true or false using numbers.

21
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:12,070
The title field is a concatenation
of the magnitude and place fields.

22
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:16,330
The architects of this feed realized
that it was probable that the people

23
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:20,010
might want to use these two values
together as a descriptive title

24
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:23,420
of an event, and
added it as a convenience.

25
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:27,800
The coordinates data might be a little
tough to understand at first because

26
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:33,080
it's not explicitly labeled, but
what it is is an array of three numbers.

27
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:40,540
The three numbers are, in this order,
longitude, latitude and depth.

28
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:44,980
These three numbers together describe
the exact location of the earthquake

29
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:47,090
within the crust of the planet.

30
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:50,150
It's pretty useful to understand
how the depth affects

31
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:51,970
how earthquakes are experienced.

32
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:55,661
The more shallow the quake,
the stronger it is felt on the surface.
