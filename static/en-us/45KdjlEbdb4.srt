00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Let's exercise these equations over here using the following example.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Suppose in the beginning x equals 24, y is 18,

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and the orientation for now is going to be zero, just to make it simple,

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
and suppose Δt is 1 second, our velocity is 5 units per second,

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
and our rotation velocity is π over 8 seconds.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Can you use this formula to calculate x', y' and θ' after Δt?
