1
00:00:00,018 --> 00:00:04,498
That ends our very long lesson on Harris corners.

2
00:00:04,498 --> 00:00:07,193
I'm hoping Megan can do some, like video magic.

3
00:00:07,193 --> 00:00:10,273
So you've actually just seen three magnificently edited, cut,

4
00:00:10,273 --> 00:00:13,518
tight, get, you know, I hear she's friends with John Williams, so

5
00:00:13,518 --> 00:00:15,390
there'll be a score in the background.

6
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:22,552
Anyway, but this notion of variation and gradients is very important in general.

7
00:00:22,552 --> 00:00:24,550
It's used for feature detectors.

8
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:28,132
But it's, but this notion of gradients varying over a window will be

9
00:00:28,132 --> 00:00:32,851
important when we do other issues having to do with motion and stuff like that.

10
00:00:32,851 --> 00:00:38,851
But for now, we're just thinking of it as doing point detection.

11
00:00:38,851 --> 00:00:42,741
And in the next couple lessons, we're going to take a look at some of

12
00:00:42,741 --> 00:00:47,556
the properties of this detector and then we're going to build some descriptions,

13
00:00:47,556 --> 00:00:50,555
some descriptors around those detected points.

14
00:00:50,555 --> 00:00:51,449
Are you tired?

15
00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:52,597
I'm tired.

16
00:00:52,597 --> 00:00:55,120
All I've got to drink is water, I hope you can do better.
