00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:04,360
In this unit I'm going to talk about how geometric objects are define for

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:08,299
rendering. Along the way I'll discuss points, and vectors and how these get used

3
00:00:08,299 --> 00:00:11,633
in computer graphics. Let's dive right in, there are two distinctive

4
00:00:11,633 --> 00:00:15,395
mathematical objects that we use in computer graphics all the time points, and

5
00:00:15,395 --> 00:00:19,260
vectors. I'm going to focus on the 3D aspect since that's what we commonly use

6
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:23,445
3D computer graphics. Working in 2 dimensions is similar, 3D is just 50% more

7
00:00:23,445 --> 00:00:28,389
interesting. To start, we'll define a 3D point as a location in space. A 3D

8
00:00:28,389 --> 00:00:33,156
vector defines a direction in space. A location in space has to be defined with

9
00:00:33,156 --> 00:00:37,092
respect to something else. For example on the earth we define a location in

10
00:00:37,092 --> 00:00:42,134
terms of its latitude,longitude and altitude. This is a spherical coordinate

11
00:00:42,134 --> 00:00:46,550
system, in that the lines of latitude and longitude wrap around a sphere, the

12
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:46,993
earth.
