1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,680
By requiring that the passwords
are changed periodically we are sort of

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:08,460
ensuring that it's going to be less
likely that someone who is not

3
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:11,470
the right user is going to be able
to gain access to an account.

4
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:15,460
So, this is actually part of
the policy we're going to see later on.

5
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:20,320
And if there is a compromise, if
a computer is hacked, if a password is

6
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:25,400
stolen, then we have to report it
to somebody who's responsible for

7
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:30,070
cyber security at Georgia Tech, maybe
in your unit or could be the university

8
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:34,730
wide, but yes our policy does,
so this option is also there.

9
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:37,480
The third one says Georgia Tech
computers cannot be used to

10
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:41,880
download illegal content, example
of that here is child pornography.

11
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,540
It's absolutely a part of that
