00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:01,800
Welcome.

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:05,300
So far whenever we think about photography, we think about a process where it

3
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:10,030
takes a camera like this, and captures a image that can be done, used as

4
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:13,900
a photograph, could be printed, or you could do different types of things with.

5
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:15,580
For computational photography,

6
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:19,630
we need to actually add a level where we can take this image and create

7
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:24,690
a digital representation of this image that would make this a computable entity.

8
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:28,260
So in this series of lectures, what we're going to do is take a digital image,

9
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,620
and start looking at what we can do with an image and

10
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:32,420
different types of processing approaches on it.
