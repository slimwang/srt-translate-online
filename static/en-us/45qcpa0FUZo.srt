1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Now we come to the first problem of Unit 2. This time we're still dealing with orbits.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
We have a pendulum and we want to create expressions

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
for the position, velocity, and acceleration.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
As always, we've given you some code to help you out.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Here you can see the time set, the magnitude of the acceleration due to gravity,

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
and the length of the pendulum, which is just the length of the

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
string to which the bulb of the pendulum is attached.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
What we're asking you to do is to first fill in this definition of the acceleration of the pendulum

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
showing how it depends on the position of the weight.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Now if you think about the way that a pendulum swings, you can imagine

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
that if we extend the trajectory, we would get a circle.

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
So position is the length of this curve path.

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The next thing that you need to do is to fill in this function called symplectic Euler

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
in which logically you will use symplectic Euler method to calculate both distance and velocity.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
To help you out a little bit, here is a refresher on what the symplectic Euler method says.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Another important piece of information if you're not super-comfortable with physics stuff

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
is Newton's second law right here showing the relationship between force, mass, acceleration.

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
So looking back at our code, you can see that we've created

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
empty arrays for you--for position and for velocity.

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
It's up to you to fill these arrays in including the initial conditions.

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Remember you'll need to initialize x and v where x is zero and v is zero

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
equals something that you're going to figure out.

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'm going to give you a few hints though--you can see that we've created

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
this constant called num_initial condition and set it to equal to 50.

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
What you're really doing overall in this problem is looking at 50 different pendulums

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
which each have different initial values for x and v, and to give you a visual of what this looks like,

27
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I'm going to show you the final plot that you'll get with this program.

28
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
So here's the set of graph that you should get as your final result if the program is working correctly.

29
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
You're going to ignore these top two graphs for now. Let's focus on this bottom plot.

30
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
This is showing velocity on the vertical axis and position on the horizontal axis.

31
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
If we look at the top two graphs, we can see that this green set of points right here

32
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
corresponds to what's happening at time zero.

33
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Since green ellipse down here is showing the set of initial conditions

34
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
for the 50 different pendulums that we're looking at.

35
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
This green ellipse is kind of like a snap shot of what's happening

36
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
to all these different pendulums at time zero.

37
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
The way that I want you to figure out how to set

38
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
the values for each pendulum for x and for v is just think about this ellipse.

39
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Now in Unit 1 you learned about orbits and you'll actually be able to use

40
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
some of that knowledge in this problem knowing that this green shape is an ellipse.

41
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
You can see that its major axis right here lies along the line v=0

42
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
and its minor axis lies along this line x=2.

43
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Now the half length of the major axis is 0.25

44
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
so I guess actually it don't looks like the major axis here.

45
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:47,000
It's really the minor axis if these two sets of axes had the same scales applied to them.

46
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Either way, this rightmost point on ellipse corresponds to x=2.25

47
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
and the leftmost point corresponds to x=1.75.

48
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
In terms of v, we have values ranging from -2 down here to 2 up here.

49
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:07,000
So think about what equations for x and v you'll need to create an ellipse with these dimensions.

50
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
That would be how you set the initial conditions for x and v.

51
00:03:10,000 --> 99:59:59,999
I think this is a very interesting problem so I hope you enjoy doing it. Good luck.
