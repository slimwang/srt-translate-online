1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
We're going to make this change to the app we've been working on,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
and we've got to do two things.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
We need to make a thanks handler.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
We need to add the thanks URL,

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and we need to redirect to the thanks URL.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Okay, let's go ahead and do these.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Here we are--we have the functions you're familiar with, our normal form handler.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Let's go down to the bottom of our file and add a new handler.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I've added the definition for the thanks handler.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
This has the same structure as our other handler.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
It has a name, and then it inherits from webapp 2 request handler.

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
We're going to add a get function to it for get requests.

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
We're going to take this behavior from here and move it down here.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Okay, now we have our handler.

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Let's do the redirect here.

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:52,000
So instead of printing thanks we're going to redirect.

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
This is how you do redirects in google apps.

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
You call the function redirect on self in a handler,

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
and it will redirect you to the URL that you provide.

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
We don't have to say HTTP here because we're redirecting to the same domain.

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
So we can just specify the path.

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
We need to do one final thing.

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
We need to add the thanks URL.

24
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
We need to map it this handler; so let's go ahead and do that.

25
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Okay, I added another URL down here in our mapping area.

26
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
It maps /thanks to the thanks handler.

27
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Let's go ahead and test this in the browser.

28
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
We reload our page, we enter in a valid date, and we click submit.

29
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Now, remember submit is going to give us a redirect

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
instead of just sending us data in the post.

31
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Here we go.

32
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
We are now at /thanks, and our web application is saying thanks.

33
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Now we can reload this page as much as we want,

34
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
and we don't get any silly resubmit this form thing.

35
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I can share this link with my friends and say look how smart I am.

36
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I know my birthday.

37
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
They will be suitably impressed.

38
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
The server won't have to validate our form over and over again.

39
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Okay, that's it for basic forms.

40
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Thanks very much.
