1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,960
So, now that we seen Amdahl's law, let's do a

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,250
quiz. Let's say we have a program with 50 billion

3
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:08,403
instructions it executes. Let's say that we have a processor

4
00:00:08,403 --> 00:00:11,602
clocked at two gigahertz. Let's say that we improved the branch

5
00:00:11,602 --> 00:00:14,198
instruction so that it no longer takes four cycles to

6
00:00:14,198 --> 00:00:17,400
do one. Now it takes only two cycles to do one.

7
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,960
This is a table where we show for each of

8
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:25,960
the four instruction types, integer, branches, loads, and stores, the percentage

9
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:31,577
of all instructions in the program that are of this type. So, for example 40% of

10
00:00:31,577 --> 00:00:35,564
all instructions that we execute are integer instructions.

11
00:00:35,564 --> 00:00:38,984
20% of all instructions that we execute are branch

12
00:00:38,984 --> 00:00:42,770
instructions. 30% are loads, and 10% are stores.

13
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:45,030
And finally we have the CPI for each

14
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:47,500
of these types of instructions. For integer it's

15
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:51,280
one, for branches it was four. The improvement reduces

16
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,628
that to two. Loads spend two cycles

17
00:00:53,628 --> 00:00:56,652
per instruction and stores spend three cycles per

18
00:00:56,652 --> 00:01:00,137
instruction. The question for you is, what is

19
00:01:00,137 --> 00:01:02,800
the overall speedup, which you will answer here.
