00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:02,870
Now that we can make levels that
are bigger than just one screen,

2
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:04,620
and there are some consequences for

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:09,320
falling off, let's build a level with
more and bigger jumping challenges.

4
00:00:10,512 --> 00:00:13,360
Add some more platforms to
the debug level initializer so

5
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:15,050
that Gigagal has some more room to play.
