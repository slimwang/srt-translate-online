1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,636
So the question becomes what do we do?

2
00:00:02,636 --> 00:00:03,404
How do we compute?

3
00:00:03,404 --> 00:00:05,606
To figure out that a pixel in an image.

4
00:00:05,606 --> 00:00:10,244
The pixel is some location x, y is actually an edge pixel.

5
00:00:10,244 --> 00:00:13,614
That is that it lands on an edge or is part of an edge somewhere.

6
00:00:13,614 --> 00:00:17,551
To think about this, we have to return to our idea of image as function.

7
00:00:17,551 --> 00:00:20,121
So you remember here's our comedienne.

8
00:00:20,121 --> 00:00:24,859
And this was two different representations of the same function.

9
00:00:24,859 --> 00:00:27,337
One just happens to be shown to you as a picture, so

10
00:00:27,337 --> 00:00:30,231
you're used to seeing that although it's pretty scary.

11
00:00:30,231 --> 00:00:33,056
And the other is shown as this height map,

12
00:00:33,056 --> 00:00:36,705
where the height was proportional to the intensity.

13
00:00:36,705 --> 00:00:40,541
And the thing that's clear is that these edges, right?

14
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:43,044
So this edge by the side of her face there.

15
00:00:43,044 --> 00:00:48,916
Is really a steep cliff by the side in, in that function.

16
00:00:48,916 --> 00:00:49,550
Okay.

17
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:53,090
And what we're going to look for fundamentally for

18
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:58,626
edges are going to be these steep changes somewhere in that image function.

19
00:00:58,626 --> 00:01:00,127
So it sounds pretty simple.

20
00:01:00,127 --> 00:01:00,694
Okay.

21
00:01:00,694 --> 00:01:02,830
In some little local neighborhood.

22
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:04,458
Can I determine that I'm in a,

23
00:01:04,458 --> 00:01:07,601
at a location where there's going to be a very strong change?

24
00:01:07,601 --> 00:01:09,036
Doesn't seem so hard.

25
00:01:09,036 --> 00:01:12,710
Well, there are two things that we have to sort of answer in order to

26
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:13,707
be able to do this.

27
00:01:13,707 --> 00:01:17,311
If we're trying to look at a neighborhood with strong signs of change.

28
00:01:17,311 --> 00:01:20,347
We had this question of well, how big is a neighborhood?

29
00:01:20,347 --> 00:01:22,450
And then what do you mean detecting change?

30
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:24,051
How much of change is change?

31
00:01:24,051 --> 00:01:27,154
And, and how are we going to determine exactly where that change is?

32
00:01:27,154 --> 00:01:29,261
So, so here's an example of a function and

33
00:01:29,261 --> 00:01:33,194
the idea is that, you know, probably the edge might be thought of as like that.

34
00:01:33,194 --> 00:01:36,097
Our first problem of course, is we don't get to do that.

35
00:01:36,097 --> 00:01:39,334
We have to pick the pixels that we say are the edge.

36
00:01:39,334 --> 00:01:40,101
Right?

37
00:01:40,101 --> 00:01:43,650
We don't get to say it's between, well, we could say, it's between pixels but

38
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:45,206
we, we tend not to do that, right?

39
00:01:45,206 --> 00:01:49,276
So the idea here is that the 80s are on one side and these 20s and

40
00:01:49,276 --> 00:01:53,660
30s are on another side, so we have to try to go about finding those.
