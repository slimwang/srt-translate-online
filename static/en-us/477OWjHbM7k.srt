1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,130
Great, so let's move forward and

2
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:05,600
understand where we position
ourselves among our competitors.

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,109
But first we need to
analyze our competition.

4
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:12,260
Now, there are four levels of market
competition which we use to assess

5
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:16,390
our competitors in the industry and
how we are placed in the industry.

6
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:21,330
So, the four levels of competition
are product form, product category,

7
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:23,590
generic, and budget competition.

8
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:26,440
So, let's go through this
with a tangible example.

9
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:27,870
Let's take flavored water a.

10
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:31,230
This is a lightly flavored
water without any added sugar.

11
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:34,560
Competition at the product form level
will include products that have

12
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:38,620
the exact same features and
similar values as our product.

13
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:43,555
So a competitor at the product form
level would be flavored water b.

14
00:00:43,555 --> 00:00:46,113
This is another flavored water,
without any added sugar,

15
00:00:46,113 --> 00:00:48,950
just gives you a little
extra kick to your water.

16
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:52,840
Now, product form competition
is extremely narrow.

17
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:56,270
We only consider products that
are actually the exact same,

18
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:57,710
just different brands.

19
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:01,580
So both of these waters are flavored
waters without any added sugar,

20
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:03,700
they just are different brands.

21
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:06,802
Now, product category
competition includes products

22
00:01:06,802 --> 00:01:11,291
with similar features but it's a little
bit of a bigger scope than product form.

23
00:01:11,291 --> 00:01:15,680
So an example of that would
be flavored sparkling water.

24
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,260
Now,, this is also flavored
water that doesn't have sugar,

25
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:19,930
but it's a sparkling water.

26
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:23,150
So, it's a competitor
on the category level.

27
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:25,487
Now ,thinking about our
flavored water example,

28
00:01:25,487 --> 00:01:27,122
I want you to consider your own app.

29
00:01:27,122 --> 00:01:28,306
Who are your competitors?

30
00:01:28,306 --> 00:01:31,112
Now thing about product
category competition and

31
00:01:31,112 --> 00:01:33,240
product form competition.

32
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,376
What competitors do you
have in these areas?

33
00:01:35,376 --> 00:01:38,190
Now fill in each competitor's
name in the appropriate field.

34
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:40,445
If you don't have your own app to use,
feel free to use a Embarkment.
