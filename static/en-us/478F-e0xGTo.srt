1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,410
So now before we carry on, let's spend
a little bit of time comparing Epsilon

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:06,490
photography and Coded photography.

3
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:11,240
The aim so far, I've set for the concept
of Coded Photography is to encode into

4
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:16,090
a single image, information about
the environment, the photographic

5
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:20,240
signal from the environment, and then
we can add a post capture, after we've

6
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:25,290
captured the image decoded you actually
got more information about the scene.

7
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:29,338
We saw this example a little bit when
we did Light Field Cameras, right?

8
00:00:29,338 --> 00:00:32,670
It captured the stack of pictures
into one image representation, and

9
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:35,100
then we were able to do thinks
like do things like paralens and

10
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,140
also change focal lens.

11
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:41,070
So Coded Photography basically is,
in that, that kind of a process

12
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:45,220
where we basically, encode into the
image itself additional information that

13
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:49,970
would allow us to extract more kinds
of images out of it at a later point.

14
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:54,590
Something that could actually capture
depth, parallax even focal planes, and

15
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:56,660
perhaps, additional information.

16
00:00:56,660 --> 00:01:00,410
Epsilon Photography basically says,
rather than capture one image with all

17
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:04,450
of that information, let's capture a
series of images, a sequence of images,

18
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:08,540
a sequential set of images that may
have those different variations.

19
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:12,150
Take a picture, change the focal length,
take another picture.

20
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:13,910
That basically means, for example,

21
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:16,500
if there was a fast moving object
we would actually have trouble,

22
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,790
because we would really like
to have a much faster camera.

23
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:23,460
In the case of Coded Photography, since
it's doing all of that, and if it's fast

24
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:28,040
enough in computing all of this, it can
actually capture the image in one gulp.

25
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:30,550
So that's, basically one of
the big differences here.

26
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:33,690
Now of course, the space that
goes from Coded Photography and

27
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:37,390
Epsilon Photography couldn't be merged,
because we can actual combine them to be

28
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:39,800
able to generate null forms of images,
too.

29
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:43,010
So, one thing to note
about coded photography is

30
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:47,260
that each image that we may capture in a
Coded Photography signal would basically

31
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:50,150
mean that the neighborhood pixels
may have different radiations.

32
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:53,950
One pixel would have focal lens at
something, the other one may actually

33
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:57,940
have it at different one, and knowing
the code that relates both of them, and

34
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:01,730
knowing one pixel at the left or right
was captured, we can actually decode it,

35
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:03,550
and generate something new and
interesting.

36
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:06,295
Again, an example that comes to mind
is something I mentioned before,

37
00:02:06,295 --> 00:02:10,169
bare patterns but knowing the pattern
that this one is r, this one is g, and

38
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:13,420
this one is b in a square pattern,
allowed us to decode the image.

39
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:16,330
In Epsilon Photography of course,
that variation is in time.

40
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:18,640
Now, all of this allows
us to now of course,

41
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,540
create the images that can
control light over time or space.

42
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:25,720
Because now we can capture a series of
images of one image that actually has

43
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,780
those radiations either in space or
in time, and

44
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:31,870
we can preserve details about
the recorded environment.

45
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:35,220
So, in essence, what I'm trying to get
to is there is this big space that we

46
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:38,310
could actually have between Coded
Photography and Epsilon Photography.

47
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:39,300
Both of them are useful,

48
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:42,590
and they may even overlap a little
bit in terms of what they can do.

49
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:45,490
These are just labels that we're
coming up to help us kind of define

50
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:48,380
the space of different
types of photography's

51
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:51,570
concepts that are related to
Computational Photography.

52
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:54,920
And of course, have both overlap
between both of them, and again,

53
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:58,020
at the end of the day, we're trying
to figure out how to capture the best

54
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:01,700
possible way of capturing an image that
we can actually render differently?
