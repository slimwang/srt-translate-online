For this quiz, I've got some CSS on
the screen with two break points and

2
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:06,520
the two resulting layouts.

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:10,560
I want you to tell me
which div is which.

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:14,130
For the red, green, and dark blue boxes,

5
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:19,030
type in the IDs of the elements
over here that match.

6
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:23,240
Your options are box A,
box B, and box C.
