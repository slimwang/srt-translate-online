1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,654
Now that we have a good understanding
of modern application design,

2
00:00:03,654 --> 00:00:06,171
I'm pretty sure our next
step is to deploy our code.

3
00:00:06,171 --> 00:00:08,528
Now I'm thinking about
application dependencies.

4
00:00:08,528 --> 00:00:10,528
I'm thinking about how
to build packets and

5
00:00:10,528 --> 00:00:13,915
distribute all of these applications,
and this seems like a lot of work.

6
00:00:13,915 --> 00:00:16,181
Kelsey, is there any way around this?

7
00:00:16,181 --> 00:00:19,520
>> One option would be figure
out all your dependencies and

8
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,496
build a native package for every
Linux distro you plan to support or

9
00:00:23,496 --> 00:00:26,638
you can skip all of that and
build a container image.

10
00:00:26,638 --> 00:00:28,357
>> What's a container image?

11
00:00:28,357 --> 00:00:31,308
>> A container image is a packaging
format that includes not

12
00:00:31,308 --> 00:00:34,076
only your application, but
all your dependencies or

13
00:00:34,076 --> 00:00:37,110
runtime information required to run it.

14
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:38,630
Think about your mobile phone.

15
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:41,295
You download a self-contained
application and run it.

16
00:00:41,295 --> 00:00:44,634
Containers do the same thing but
for your servers.

17
00:00:44,634 --> 00:00:48,090
>> So this is something that's
available on servers today?

18
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:49,110
>> Close.

19
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:51,890
The container technology is built
into most major operating systems,

20
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:56,510
including Linux and Windows, but it's
not exactly easy to use out of the box.

21
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:59,420
You'll need something like Docker
which provides a nice API on top of

22
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:02,670
container technology and
makes it easy to create, distribute,

23
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:05,950
and run container images
on your own servers.

24
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:07,040
Okay, I get it.

25
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:11,370
You know,
given the available options, and

26
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:14,090
my sanity, it seems like container
images are the way to go.
