00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,749
We get x times the entire quantity y plus z. Both terms in the first expression

2
00:00:04,749 --> 00:00:09,129
have a factor of x so we can sort of pull an x out of each term, write that as a

3
00:00:09,129 --> 00:00:14,166
factor that's multiplying two terms inside parenthesis and, of course, these two

4
00:00:14,166 --> 00:00:18,838
terms which are the terms left over from each of the original terms still have

5
00:00:18,838 --> 00:00:22,862
the same relationship as these two do. These are added together.
