You've now seen a lot of variable declarations. I've seen a lot in my life.

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:07,960
I've written a lot in my life. Here's a bunch more. Some of these have mistakes

3
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:11,415
in them. Can you match each variable declaration to a description of the

4
00:00:11,415 --> 00:00:16,410
mistake? The possible mistakes are, the variables can only contain letters and

5
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:21,590
numbers. B, it's always a good idea to include an initial value. Variable type

6
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:26,970
doesn't match initial value type. Variable has a bad type. No mistake, this

7
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:31,390
variable declaration is fine. Variable declarations need a semicolon. And

8
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:33,600
variable declarations must have types.
