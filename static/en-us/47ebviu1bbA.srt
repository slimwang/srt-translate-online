1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:04,890
The correct answer is that the stock
is probably going to go down in price,

2
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:08,290
because there's much
more selling pressure.

3
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:12,950
Imagine for
a moment if we put in two market orders.

4
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:18,740
Suppose there was a market
order to sell 500 shares.

5
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:20,450
What would happen?

6
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:25,385
Boom, you would sell 100 at 99.95,
50 at 99.90 and

7
00:00:25,385 --> 00:00:28,685
so on,
the price would immediately go down.

8
00:00:28,685 --> 00:00:34,008
Consider on the other hand if someone
put in a market order to buy 500 shares,

9
00:00:34,008 --> 00:00:36,370
well the price wouldn't budge.

10
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:40,155
You'd just get 500 of these 1000 for
sale but

11
00:00:40,155 --> 00:00:44,812
the price would still remain
between $100 and 99.95.

12
00:00:44,812 --> 00:00:48,624
I'll explain that a little bit more as
we provide some specific examples on

13
00:00:48,624 --> 00:00:51,660
what happens to the order book
as different orders come in.
