1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:05,630
It turns out that this answer is also log base b of 5. Great work if you got

2
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:09,452
this right. Again, I think it's best to think about splitting this up into two

3
00:00:09,452 --> 00:00:14,984
logarithms. Log base b of 5 and log base b of 5. We're adding three logarithms

4
00:00:14,984 --> 00:00:19,880
together right here. So, we can really just multiply these arguments together.

5
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:26,596
So, we'll have log base b of 3 times 5 times 5. That's how we can combine these

6
00:00:26,596 --> 00:00:31,211
three logarithms through addition. And then we'll have minus log base b of 15

7
00:00:31,211 --> 00:00:36,842
on the end. And finally to subtract two logarithms with the same base, we'll

8
00:00:36,842 --> 00:00:42,654
divide the second one into the first one. So we'll have log base b of three

9
00:00:42,654 --> 00:00:48,796
times five times five divided by 15. We have the factors of 15, which reduced

10
00:00:48,796 --> 00:00:53,965
to one, which leaves us with log base b of five. Now, there was one other way

11
00:00:53,965 --> 00:00:58,345
we could have solved this problem and it involves using the power rule. Let's

12
00:00:58,345 --> 00:01:02,563
see what that would look like. We could've started by moving this 2, backup as

13
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:08,610
an exponent for the 5. So 2 times log base be a 5 would equal log based b a 5

14
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:14,260
squared. Now we can apply the same rules for adding logger items with the same

15
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:19,625
base. And subtracting logarithms with the same base. When we add these 2

16
00:01:19,625 --> 00:01:25,108
logarithms together, we'll have log base b of 3 times 5 squared. We simply

17
00:01:25,108 --> 00:01:30,232
multiply these two numbers together. And finally here, we'll divide this number

18
00:01:30,232 --> 00:01:35,672
into this number. So to combine these logarithms when subtracting, we'll have

19
00:01:35,672 --> 00:01:41,604
the log base b of 3 times 5 squared divided by 15. Notice that 5 squared is the

20
00:01:41,604 --> 00:01:46,490
same thing as 5 times 5. So we're really back to what we ended with last time.

21
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:53,113
Our factor of 15 simplifies to 1 so we're left with log base b of 5.
