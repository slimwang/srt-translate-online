1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,520
So now our page has the correct layout.

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:06,280
But we need to make sure that our page looks good on all sized screen,

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:08,100
not just this big one.

4
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:09,170
So let's go ahead and resize it.

5
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:11,060
You can see it gets smaller.

6
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:13,800
And as we get closer and closer to the mobile size,

7
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:17,070
we can see that this image is being pushed off the side of the screen.

8
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:18,670
I'll go ahead and make it big again.

9
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:21,410
It's important to make sure that our websites look good on mobile too.

10
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:24,030
So, we need to make some changes using Bootstrap.

11
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:27,350
Look through the Bootstrap documentation to answer this question.

12
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:31,580
Which class should you apply to images to make them resize automatically?

13
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:32,350
