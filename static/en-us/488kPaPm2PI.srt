00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:03,190
We now know a great deal about all three class patterns,

2
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:06,410
functional, prototypal and pseudo-classical.

3
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:06,930
Let's move on to

4
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:11,450
thinking about the slightly more advanced code-sharing technique of subclassing.

5
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:14,490
After that, we'll explore how we could achieve these same goals using

6
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:15,540
a pseudo-classical pattern.

7
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:19,660
Note that the pseudo-classical pattern is a lot more widely documented on

8
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:23,340
the internet than the functional pattern that we're about to explore here.

9
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:26,140
So, external resources may be confusing until after you've

10
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:27,990
completed the section after this one.
