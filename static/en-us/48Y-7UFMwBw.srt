1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,705
The answer is this one. Y minus k equals a times the quantity x minus h squared.

2
00:00:04,705 --> 00:00:09,247
This is almost the same as the equation that we were working with, in the last

3
00:00:09,247 --> 00:00:13,910
lesson. Remember that we kept talking about the form y minus k equals x minus h

4
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:18,444
squared. And this was used for parabolas that had a leading coefficient of 1. So

5
00:00:18,444 --> 00:00:22,776
this makes perfect sense that if we have a leading coefficent of a instead of 1.

6
00:00:22,776 --> 00:00:26,754
We would modify the equation like this. Now, 2 of these equations here are

7
00:00:26,754 --> 00:00:31,131
actually not correct mathematical representations of what we're looking for.

8
00:00:31,131 --> 00:00:35,311
This one, y minus k equasl ax minus h. Doesn't graph a parabola at all. We can

9
00:00:35,311 --> 00:00:38,901
see that we only have an x to the first term, not an x to the second term. So

10
00:00:38,901 --> 00:00:42,756
this is a linear equation. That means it definitely can't be right. And the last

11
00:00:42,756 --> 00:00:46,642
one right here doesn't have the correct placement of the leading coefficient of

12
00:00:46,642 --> 00:00:50,100
a, as we can see from the last example we did. The second choice is

13
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:54,388
mathematically equivalent to the third one, the correct one, except here, like

14
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:58,228
we saw in the last quiz, we can't directly read off the coordinates of the

15
00:00:58,228 --> 00:01:02,335
vertex, or we wouldn't be able to if we had actual numbers plugged in. So this

16
00:01:02,335 --> 00:01:03,384
is the best choice.
