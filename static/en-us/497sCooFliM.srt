1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,969
That really ends our conversation about shape from shading.

2
00:00:02,969 --> 00:00:07,930
I'll say that and as I said with lightness,

3
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:12,370
it's still pretty a pretty under-solved problem.

4
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:17,870
Back in the 70s, and 80s where the view that the primary job of vision, or

5
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:20,670
one of the primary jobs of vision was to reconstruct geometry,

6
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:23,120
there was a lot of focus on how.

7
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:27,050
Geometry reflected itself in lightness and to try to undo that process.

8
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:30,590
Remember I talked about vision as being sort of inverse graphics.

9
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:34,280
That whole focus has diminished quite a bit, and the other thing is,

10
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:37,000
the idea of being able to take derivatives and

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,909
images with our current imaging systems where things are.

12
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:44,600
You know very it's all sorts of noise and kinds of things like that.

13
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:47,930
It just was yielding very brittle kinds of results, and like wise the types of

14
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:51,310
assumptions we had to make were sort of overly restricted.

15
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:54,146
So I don't think my colleagues would disagree and

16
00:00:54,146 --> 00:00:56,580
say we basically can't do that right now, okay.

17
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:58,480
So you show us a nice, you know,

18
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,650
my coat lying over there, you guys can't see it, the chair, etc, whatever.

19
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:07,940
I can tell a lot of shading information, by integrating many multiple cues.

20
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:10,740
And, we don't really have good techniques for doing that.

21
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:15,070
There is a question, of whether machine learning is actually a play.

22
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:18,140
That is, maybe our system doesn't actually undo.

23
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:20,870
The physics of the image formation.

24
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:22,830
But instead it has learned,

25
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:28,250
the relationship between certain image patch appearance and shape.

26
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:32,980
And it just does that recognition or that mapping, without undoing the physics.

27
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:35,220
I would say the jury is still out on that.

28
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,050
And probably the truth is going to be somewhere.

29
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:43,030
In between I mean, Ted Adelson's demonstrations of that shadow casting,

30
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:47,150
clearly there's a global effect on sort of a local process.

31
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:50,450
And, exactly how we do that is still unknown.

32
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:54,360
So, shape from shading is a very old problem, but

33
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,750
we could probably use some very new solutions.

34
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:59,170
But at least now you have some idea of the,

35
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:01,600
sort of the nature of the problem and what we have done.
