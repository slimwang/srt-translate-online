1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,090
So this is one possible answer.

2
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:06,970
Insert into animals values wibble, which
is just the name I gave the possum.

3
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:08,830
You can call it whatever you like.

4
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:11,600
The species, and then the birthdate.

5
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:12,510
Here's another option,

6
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:15,320
we could explicitly say what
columns we're inserting into.

7
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:19,030
Even though these are in the same order,
it's still okay to do this.

8
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:23,330
And by the way, that's pretty much
all there is to the insert statement.

9
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:25,970
It's a lot simpler than
the select statement.

10
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:29,020
Select queries can express
arbitrary complicated searches and

11
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:33,280
aggregations of data, but inserts
are just add this row to this table.
