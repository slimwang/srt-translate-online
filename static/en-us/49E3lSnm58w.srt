1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:04,250
Now we're going to spend some time building cat clicker together with Knockout.

2
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:07,210
You can find the files I'm using at the repository linked in

3
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:08,800
the instructor notes.

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,069
Now, here's our out index.html file, but

5
00:00:12,069 --> 00:00:15,630
we're going to put that aside and open up app.js.

6
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:19,410
As you can see, we're starting with absolutely nothing here.

7
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:23,000
First, let's make a ViewModel so we have a place to put things.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,550
Now, if we only type this, nothing special will happen.

9
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:30,980
We'll just end up with a function called ViewModel, but it won't ever get run.

10
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:34,880
We need to tell Knockout to apply our bindings to this ViewNodel.

11
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,460
Now, I'll go over what that means in more detail a little bit later.

12
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:43,672
For now, let's just start our app by typing ko.applyBindings and

13
00:00:43,672 --> 00:00:45,049
a new ViewModel.

14
00:00:45,049 --> 00:00:47,827
Now let's hop over to our browser, hit refresh, and

15
00:00:47,827 --> 00:00:50,930
ensure that nothing pops up in my console.

16
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:52,330
When I'm developing, I go back and

17
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:55,460
forth a lot to make sure I don't run into errors.

18
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:57,270
Now let's go back to our app.

19
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:00,310
We need to put something inside our ViewModel here.

20
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:05,129
For now, I'm actually going to put our model here in the ViewModel.

21
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:06,790
Now, this may seem confusing at first.

22
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:10,410
You may think, but Ben, aren't we supposed to separate things?

23
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:11,520
Well, the most important thing for

24
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,700
now is that the pieces are functionally separate.

25
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,340
For simplicity in this example,

26
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:19,350
we'll define our model stuff here inside the ViewModel.

27
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:22,500
But even though the model is being defined inside the ViewModel,

28
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,970
the functionality is separate.

29
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:28,250
Now, in a few lessons, we'll see a good way to separate out our model data

30
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:31,610
more cleanly, but for now, we'll go with this.

31
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:33,480
So, what do we need in here?

32
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:38,250
Well, we need the same fields as before, name, click count,

33
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:42,690
image source, and, because we appreciate our artists, image attribution.

34
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:48,060
And there's our model for a simple version of cat clicker.

35
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:49,914
Now, what about our ViewModel?

36
00:01:49,914 --> 00:01:52,880
We obviously need an incrementCounter function.

37
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:57,170
But if we look back at our previous code from the last lesson,

38
00:01:57,170 --> 00:02:01,120
you'll notice we don't need most of the functions we wrote before.

39
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:04,670
For example, before, we had a getCurrentCat function,

40
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:09,220
which allowed the view to get it from the octopus to get it from the model.

41
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:13,430
We don't need that anymore because Knockout will handle the view to model and

42
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:16,260
model to view synchronization for us.

43
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:19,960
The only time we need to write ViewModel methods are when we

44
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,870
need to actually change something ourselves.

45
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:23,635
In this case,

46
00:02:23,635 --> 00:02:29,325
this.incrementCounter is going to set the clickCount to be itself plus 1.

47
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:31,115
As you can see,

48
00:02:31,115 --> 00:02:36,990
this.clickCount with nothing in the method is getting our clickCount.

49
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:40,420
We're adding 1 and then taking this whole thing here and

50
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:43,900
storing it inside of this.clickCount.

51
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:47,890
Effectively, what we've done here is say count plus plus.

52
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:50,288
In this case, it's this.clickCount, and

53
00:02:50,288 --> 00:02:53,450
this.clickCount is a Knockout observable.

54
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:56,890
Now all we need to do is make our HTML connect up with this.
