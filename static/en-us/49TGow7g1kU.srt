00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,178
Now that we know how to calculate slope or just the steepness of a line, let's

2
00:00:05,178 --> 00:00:10,256
go back to our original lines, y equals 2x plus 3 and y equals 1 half x plus 3.

3
00:00:10,256 --> 00:00:15,435
Well they each have an intercept of 3. So 0 3 is on both of the lines. This blue

4
00:00:15,435 --> 00:00:20,944
line has another point 1, 5. And this yellow line has another point 2,4. Using

5
00:00:20,944 --> 00:00:25,171
this information, can you tell me what the slope of each line is?
