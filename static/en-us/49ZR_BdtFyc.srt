00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
In homework 3.4, you're asked to simulate circular robotic motion.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
We gave you some equations to help you along in your simulations.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I want to give you those formulas again and explain where some of them came from.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
The first equation I want to talk about is this one.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
The radius of curvature is equal to the length of the vehicle over the tangent of alpha

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
where alpha is our steering angle. Let me write that up here.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
So where does this equation come from.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
To derive it, the key realization is that the front and rear tire do not travel along the same circle.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Here's my rear tire, and here's my front tire.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
They are, of course, separated by a distance that we called "L."

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Let's draw the circles that these tires travel along.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Well, this rear tire is actually going to travel along a smaller inner circle

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
while this tire is going to travel along a larger outer circle.

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Since we defined our radius of curvature as the distance from the back tire to the center,

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Let's label this r, and we can see that the line connecting these tires defines an axis,

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
and here we have our steering angle, alpha, from here.

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Now we can do a little bit of geometry.

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Let's make a right triangle.

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Well, if this angle here is alpha, then this much be a 90 degree angle,

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
because a radius intersecting with a tangent line always forms a right angle.

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,000
That means that that this angle here must be equal to 90 degrees minus alpha,

22
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,000
which means this angle, since this is a right triangle must be alpha.

23
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Well, we're almost there. The tangent of this angle is equal to the opposite side,

24
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
which is the length, over the adjacent side, which is the radius.

25
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
So tangent of alpha is equal to L over r.

26
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
We manipulate this equation a little bit, and we find that the radius of curvature

27
00:02:00,000 --> 99:59:59,999
is equal to the length of the vehicle over the tangent of the steering angle.
