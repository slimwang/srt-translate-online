00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:07,430
Final, third part of this one cycle quiz, is what will this patch, if anything

2
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:15,700
in this cycle? So we have added boxes here for you to check, which instructions

3
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:20,070
are going to this patch in this cycle. Note that it is possible for no

4
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:22,420
instruction to dispatch. But if one does,

5
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:26,310
which one? Again, the state of the presser

6
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:29,280
here is at the beginning of the cycle. So we need to kind

7
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:33,850
of reconsider, what are all the things that have happened during this cycle.
