Hi. I'm Peter Norvig. I'll be your instructor for CS212, Design of Computer Programs.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I'm assuming that you have some background.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
You took CS101 or the equivalent elsewhere,

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
so you understand the basics of statements, expressions, and data types

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
in Python or some other language.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Now, what this class will be about is the design process:

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
how to take what you already know and put them together in order to solve a problem.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
We'll talk about some of the attributes of good programs--

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
correctness, efficiency, generality and so on--

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
and we'll give you a process for thinking about design:

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
how to go from the uncertain stage of not knowing what the problem really is

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
and working your way all the way through to a good solution.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
We'll also give you a set of tools that you can use along the way.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I had a lot of fun choosing the examples for this class and working them out,

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
and I think you'll have a lot of fun too,

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
and when you're done, you'll have a real sense of accomplishment.

17
00:00:58,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So I hope to see you in class.
