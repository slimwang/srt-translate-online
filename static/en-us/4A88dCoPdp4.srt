00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:04,810
In the real world, things don't just
appear or disappear out of thin air.

2
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:06,440
They move into place.

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:09,510
Instantaneous changes can be
confusing or disorienting.

4
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:14,510
>> Just as we learned how applying
lessons from the physical world to

5
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:18,990
create tangible surfaces in our UI
helps to convey information about them.

6
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:21,490
Applying real world principles
of motion can make your

7
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:23,530
interface more understandable.

8
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:27,760
>> Think of your user interface
as existing on a shared stage.

9
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,170
Elements move in and out of this
stage in a controlled manner.

10
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:35,820
>> Right, in this lesson we'll look at
how you can use motion to create a more

11
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:40,330
continuous experience, how we can teach
your users about using your UI and

12
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:42,280
how we can also provide
moments of delight.
