1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The answer is we can't achieve the goal.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
We're just missing a nut so we can't do it.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
But we're going to have to consider 4 factorial times 5 factorial paths

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
before we discover that.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
The reason is because we start out, and we say in order to achieve inspected,

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
we need the precondition of being fastened.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
In order to achieve fastened, we need some nut and some bolt.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
We can try N1 and B1, but then we would also, when we end up back tracking,

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:38,000
have to try N2 against B1, N3 against B1, and so on, for all these and all these,

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
and we'd have to do that at every step in the back track.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
So we end up trying all combinations of nuts and all combinations of bolts.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
That seems silly, and so the idea of resources is to make the nuts and bolts

13
00:00:52,000 --> 99:59:59,999
rather than make each one be distinct so we can handle them more efficiently.
