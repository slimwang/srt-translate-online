00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:02,290
Here is our example class again.

2
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:05,650
Now let's look at the middle compartment which is for purposes of

3
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:11,480
describing attributes. You'll see that there are different attributes described.

4
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:15,950
All of them have names. They have types. And they may have some other symbols

5
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:22,110
that described how the names can be accessed from other classes. Those symbols,

6
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:27,980
describe the visibility of that name. They're optional you don't have to provide

7
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:32,080
them and there's no reason, at the start, to do that. They're a refinement that

8
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:38,570
you add later on in the process. The four options in UML for visibility include.

9
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:42,880
Publicly visible that's a plus sign. Private, which is a minus sign.

10
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:49,780
Protect meaning that only sub-classes can access that attribute

11
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:54,990
is the pound sign. And for those situations where you used UML

12
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:59,960
packages that tilde indicates that the name is visible within the package.

13
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:05,230
In addition to the visibility of course you must have the name of the attribute.

14
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:10,685
You can indicate the multiplicity of ordering of the attribute.

15
00:01:10,685 --> 00:01:16,119
Now they're not shown in this example, but we'll see them later. You should give

16
00:01:16,119 --> 00:01:23,320
the type of the attribute. And UML has a set of built in types that you can use.

17
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:27,200
You can optionally describe an initial value for that particular instance

18
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,980
variable. You could indicate that the instance variable is derived.

19
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:37,950
That is it's computed rather than being set directly. And you can give some

20
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:44,120
additional properties to the instance variable using the the braces

21
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:49,050
notation that we mentioned before. For example we can indicate that that

22
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:54,250
particular instance variable is frozen. That means its value can't change.
