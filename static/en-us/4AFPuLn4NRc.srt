1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:04,550
One more topic before we finish
up with drawing, and that's text.

2
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:06,890
Text is actually a super
complicated topic.

3
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:09,780
So we're just going to do
the minimum necessary to

4
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:10,910
get some text on the screen.

5
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:15,830
First thing, text in LibGDX
is actually made of bitmaps.

6
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:18,860
That means instead of describing
the shape of the characters,

7
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:22,270
we describe the actual pixels
that make up the text.

8
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:25,930
We'll discuss bitmaps and
textures in more detail later on, but

9
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:29,930
the short version is just that we use a
SpriteBatch instead of a shape renderer.

10
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:32,320
Everything else is almost identical.

11
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,080
So in this demo,
we'll create our SpriteBatch and

12
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:37,730
we'll use just the default bitmap font.

13
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:40,980
Then we'll set the scale so
the font appears a little bit bigger and

14
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:43,370
then we need to set the filter.

15
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:46,310
Now texture filtering is
a complicated topic all on it's own.

16
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:48,130
We'll talk more about that later.

17
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:52,530
But it's how we determine what a bitmap
looks like when the bitmap gets drawn at

18
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:56,440
a larger size than it was
originally designed to be drawn at.

19
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:00,470
This linear filter makes sure that the
text doesn't look all pixellated when we

20
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:01,880
draw it large.

21
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:05,900
Sprite batches and fonts need to be
disposed of, just like a ShapeRenderer.

22
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:09,710
Finally down in renderer,
we clear the screen just like normal.

23
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:12,370
We begin a batch of the sprite batch

24
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:15,150
just like with a shape renderer
except there's no mode.

25
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:20,230
Then to actually draw, we call draw on
the font object passing in the batch,

26
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:22,530
the text we want to draw and
the position.

27
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:25,580
Also remember to end
your sprite batches.

28
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:27,480
And there we go,
we've got Text on the screen.
