00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:05,638
The answer is, there shouldn't be, if price is less or equal to 100. This

2
00:00:05,638 --> 00:00:09,706
condition doesn't change the execution. But it adds unnecessary code, and

3
00:00:09,706 --> 00:00:13,050
opportunities for bugs. We could later decide that we want to change the

4
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:17,632
threshold of 100. And then we would have to remember to change it in both

5
00:00:17,632 --> 00:00:23,320
places. We're creating extra work and unnecessary complexity for ourselves by

6
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:26,021
adding unnecessary code.
