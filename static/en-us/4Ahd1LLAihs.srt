There are many ways to move a camera through a scene. We can walk or fly. We

2
00:00:03,924 --> 00:00:07,594
can look one direction while moving another and so on. Here we're moving a bit

3
00:00:07,594 --> 00:00:11,378
sideways and a bit forward while looking forward. I usually think of the camera

4
00:00:11,378 --> 00:00:15,872
as being in one of two modes, viewer-centric or model-centric. When things are

5
00:00:15,872 --> 00:00:18,914
viewer-centric the viewer is moving around through the world. When

6
00:00:18,914 --> 00:00:21,620
model-centric, a particular object in a world is being studied and the viewers

7
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:25,270
goal is to see this object from different angles. In this mode we keep the

8
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:29,290
camera focused on a location as we move. The place where we look is called the

9
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:33,532
Target in 3JS. And in other systems. Note that this Target location is not at

10
00:00:33,532 --> 00:00:37,294
all necessary in making the various matrices need for viewing the scene. The

11
00:00:37,294 --> 00:00:41,635
target is much more related to user intent. Because the target is such a useful

12
00:00:41,635 --> 00:00:44,605
concept, many, but not all, camera control systems support the idea of a target

13
00:00:44,605 --> 00:00:49,980
in some way. To set the target we use the camera control's target parameter.

14
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:53,242
We've set this parameter before. It provides the point that our camera is

15
00:00:53,242 --> 00:00:56,625
looking at, so setting the view matrix. By setting the target in the camera

16
00:00:56,625 --> 00:00:59,460
controls, you not only set the camera's view transform, you keep the camera

17
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:04,132
pointed at this location when you orbit. If the object is moving, you can

18
00:01:04,132 --> 00:01:07,359
update the target each frame, and the camera will stay trained on it.
