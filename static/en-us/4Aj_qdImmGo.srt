1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,996
There are 19 people aged zero to 19, which is about here. And there are 21

2
00:00:06,008 --> 00:00:12,368
people aged 20 to 39, which is about here. And then, five people between 40 and

3
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:18,740
59, and five people between 60 and 79. That means our bar graph will look like

4
00:00:18,752 --> 00:00:23,917
this. So, we have the axis. Frequency is always on the y-axis. And then, the

5
00:00:23,929 --> 00:00:29,153
variable is on the x-axis. In this case, it's age. If you recall, sometimes the

6
00:00:29,165 --> 00:00:34,411
independent variable is also called the predictor variable. And the dependent

7
00:00:34,423 --> 00:00:39,474
variable, which is on the y-axis, is also called the outcome. But not in this

8
00:00:39,486 --> 00:00:45,447
case. This is a special type of graph called a histogram, and the variable on

9
00:00:45,459 --> 00:00:51,448
the y-axis is just a frequency. Here, at the intersection of the axes is the

10
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:57,672
origin. It's Cartesian coordinates are 0,0 because from here, we've gone zero to

11
00:00:57,684 --> 00:01:03,650
the right and zero up. Each axis goes from low to high. So, we start at zero and

12
00:01:03,662 --> 00:01:09,820
work our way up to higher values. Same with here on the y-axis. So now we have a

13
00:01:09,832 --> 00:01:13,735
histogram for our sample of 50 Udacity students.
