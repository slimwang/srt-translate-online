1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:04,310
The answer is that MIP level 1 will also have no real bumps left, so the ridges

2
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:08,560
will disappear. The two normals in each case will cancel out and the surface

3
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:12,370
will look flat. This is the problem with normal maps, that they disappear when

4
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:15,460
filtering is done. There are approaches that have been developed to help

5
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:19,500
improve this situation, but MIP mapping itself is often not done on normal maps

6
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,125
because of this problem.
