00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:05,302
The next childhood disorder we'll discuss is Autism spectrum disorder. Formally

2
00:00:05,302 --> 00:00:10,102
known simply as Autism. Autism Spectrum Disorder or ASD is characterized by

3
00:00:10,102 --> 00:00:14,449
severe language and social impairment in combination with repetitive habits and

4
00:00:14,449 --> 00:00:20,819
inward focused behaviors. Autism behaviors vary on the continuum from severe

5
00:00:20,819 --> 00:00:25,640
disability to high-functioning. For example, children with a high-functioning

6
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:30,550
type of autism may have social impairment and skills impairment. But they may

7
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:33,559
also have more advanced speech capability as well as an above-average

8
00:00:33,559 --> 00:00:38,402
intelligence. Hanz Asberger was the first to describe his high functioning type

9
00:00:38,402 --> 00:00:44,010
of autism and it was since termed Asberger's Syndrome. However, under the

10
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:48,530
current DSM, Asberger Syndrome is no longer under it's own diagnostic criteria.
