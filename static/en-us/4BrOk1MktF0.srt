00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
I have another question about this protocol.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The way that I've described it here,

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
does it actually provide authentication?

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
The possible answers are no, neither party is authenticated to the other one;

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
yes, that it authenticates the client to the server but not the server to the client;

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
yes, it authenticates the server to the client but not the client to the server;

7
00:00:21,000 --> 99:59:59,999
or yes, it authenticates both parties to each other.
