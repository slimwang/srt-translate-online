00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:01,500
Welcome.

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:05,650
In the last lecture we looked at point processes of an image that allowed us to

3
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:07,300
do simple arithmetic, addition,

4
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:10,300
subtraction of pixels from one image to the other.

5
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:13,420
Let's now look at the whole concept on how we can take a pixel and

6
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:15,490
look around the neighbor of that pixel and

7
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:19,200
use that information to improve the quality of an image.

8
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:23,630
For example, by looking at and averaging around a pixel, we can blur an image.

9
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:29,160
We can also do other things like, if there is noise in the image,

10
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:33,390
we can look at the neighborhood and again, get rid of the noise in an image.

11
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:36,520
So those kinds of processes let us now look at

12
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:40,920
neighborhoods of pixels within the single image of multiple images, and

13
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,450
use that to enhance the quality of images.

14
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:46,490
That's the kind of stuff we're going to look at in this series of lectures.
