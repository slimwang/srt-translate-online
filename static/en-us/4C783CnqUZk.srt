00:00:00,294 --> 00:00:02,440
Sebastian and Katie just gave
me something similar to what I

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:05,590
tried to give you at the start of
this nano degree program, a feel for

3
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:08,900
why you should care about machine
learning and what you can do with it.

4
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:10,010
So let's dive in.

5
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:11,200
Let's hear from Charles, Isabelle and

6
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,520
Michael Lettman about what
machine learning actually is and

7
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:17,050
how it can be used from their
masters level class in Georgia Tech.

8
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:18,785
By the time this nano degree
group program is over,

9
00:00:18,785 --> 00:00:20,860
we'll have used every
part of this course.
