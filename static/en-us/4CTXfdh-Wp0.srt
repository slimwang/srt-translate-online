1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:04,689
So, actually this is a quiz. What will happen when we run this code?

2
00:00:04,689 --> 00:00:07,470
Is it that thread one will seize control and print that thread one is

3
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:10,400
better forever? Will thread two seize control

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,950
and print thread two is better forever?

5
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:15,190
Will the threads print their messages alternately,

6
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:16,730
or is the order of prints indeterminant?
