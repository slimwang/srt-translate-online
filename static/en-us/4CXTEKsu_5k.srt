00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,400
To see if the problem that Alice is working on where it takes cover has any relation

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:10,120
to either clique or independent set, the first thing that we could do is just take the graphs

3
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:16,020
where we previously solve clique and independent set on and find vertex covers for that.

4
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:21,740
This is kind of a double quiz because I would like you to figure out the size of

5
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:27,600
the smallest possible vertex cover for both this graph here and this graph over here.

6
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:31,050
Please enter your answer for this graph over here in this box

7
00:00:31,050 --> 99:59:59,999
and your answer for this graph here in this box.
