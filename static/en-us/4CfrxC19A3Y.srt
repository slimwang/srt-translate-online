1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,810
In this level,
we learned how to make things move.

2
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:05,680
First, by just keeping track
of how much time had passed.

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:09,730
And then, by updating the world based
on how much time passed between frames.

4
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:12,530
We also learned how we can make
a game that can easily switch between

5
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:13,370
different screens.

6
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:17,260
So, this has been fun and all,
but everything we've made so

7
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:19,850
far has pretty much run on autopilot.

8
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:22,550
So in the next level,
we'll tackle interaction.

9
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:26,270
We'll learn how to detect and respond to
all sorts of inputs, like key presses,

10
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:27,760
touches and device orientation.
