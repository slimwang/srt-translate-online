00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:13,593
This condition is evaluated 4 times. This condition is evaluated 4 times. First

2
00:00:13,593 --> 00:00:23,374
it's evaluated when i is 1. Then we add two to i. So it's evaluated again when

3
00:00:23,374 --> 00:00:33,281
i is three. And when i is five. And then, one more time, when i is 7. At which

4
00:00:33,281 --> 00:00:37,329
point, the condition no longer holds and so it skips the rest of the loop.
