00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,700
Let me a show you a series of
examples of what it means to

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:08,410
take these now images at different
exposure values, to be able to generate

3
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:12,720
something equivalent to a stack of
images at different exposure values and

4
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:16,129
again, here, we're basically giving
it a lot of different samples.

5
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:19,950
Again, an underexposed dark image,
you can see the outside.

6
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:23,890
Now, of course,
I've made it a little brighter,

7
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:29,390
more, more, and
now you can actually see in detail.

8
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:33,770
This was always visible but now more
of the insides are becoming visible and

9
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:38,540
as we keep going, you'll notice
that outside gets overexposed and

10
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:41,170
some of the insides are also
getting a little overexposed and

11
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:42,480
detail is kind of getting lost.

12
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,310
You're getting a little bit
of a halo effect here and

13
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:45,860
all that kind of stuff too.

14
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:48,750
Even more now, actually,
the boundaries are getting lost.

15
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:51,630
So let's save this as
my stack of images.

16
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:54,420
What we did in the previous case was we
calibrated but this would, of course,

17
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,540
could be done for a real image.

18
00:00:56,540 --> 00:01:00,180
Again, in this case, what I basically
did was I took different images and

19
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:01,770
note that in this instance,

20
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:05,340
I actually have all of these images
aligned because I put them on a tripod.

21
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:08,450
If they were not on a tripod, what
you would've had to do is, of course,

22
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:09,550
do image alignment.

23
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:12,750
Remember the stuff that we looked
at when we talked about panoramas,

24
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:14,410
as we'd have to align
these images together.
