00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,200
Let's recap the design of NFS by
asking a question about file handles.

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:09,090
In the previous morsel, we mentioned
that a file handle can become stale.

3
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:10,690
What does this mean?

4
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:12,570
The file is outdated?

5
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:15,100
The remote server is not responding?

6
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:17,960
The file on the remote
server has been removed?

7
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,730
Or the file has been opened for
too long?
