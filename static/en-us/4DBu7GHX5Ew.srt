00:00:00,006 --> 00:00:03,605
In this algorithm we will count all of the elements that match a certain

2
00:00:03,605 --> 00:00:08,341
criteria. When you have a picture, we say that the picture is in landscape

3
00:00:08,341 --> 00:00:13,872
orientation if it is wider than it is tall. Most, but not all of these

4
00:00:13,872 --> 00:00:18,177
pictures, of course, contain a landscape. We say that the picture is in

5
00:00:18,177 --> 00:00:22,662
portrait orientation if it is taller, than it is wide. Now let's say we have a

6
00:00:22,662 --> 00:00:25,455
bunch of pictures and we want to count how many of them are in portrait

7
00:00:25,455 --> 00:00:30,191
orientation. That's an example of a counting problem, in general you keep a

8
00:00:30,191 --> 00:00:35,385
counter. You visit each element. If the element is a match for whatever it is

9
00:00:35,385 --> 00:00:40,520
you're looking for you increment the counter. What does it mean to be a match?

10
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:44,554
Well that depends on the problem. If you have an array of bacteria, we might be

11
00:00:44,554 --> 00:00:49,770
looking for the ones that are beneficial. If you have an array of pictures,

12
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:53,190
like we have in our example, we happen to want to know the ones that are

13
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:59,200
portrait. Those are the ones for which the height is greater than the width.

14
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,750
Now that's your job in the next quiz. Complete the program so that it counts,

15
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:05,850
how many pictures are taller than their way.
