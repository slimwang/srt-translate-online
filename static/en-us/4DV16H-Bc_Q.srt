00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:04,700
In this lesson, you'll learn how to
optimize your pages for different screen

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:10,503
sizes, including the difference between
CSS and device-independent pixels,

3
00:00:10,503 --> 00:00:14,300
and how to choose the right sizes for
your elements.

4
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:15,580
>> And at the end of the lesson,

5
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:18,470
you'll build the mobile
version of the hometown site.

6
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:21,990
Now, when I'm working on my sites,
sometimes I notice that content seems to

7
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:26,010
flow off the page or I have to pinch and
zoom to see anything.

8
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:27,410
What's going on here?

9
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:32,930
>> Well besides your CSS which
could use a little bit of work,

10
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:36,760
the biggest problem is that you don't
have the viewport set properly.

11
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:40,430
The viewport defines the area of
the screen that the browser can

12
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:42,250
render content to.

13
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,190
Here, let me show you an example.

14
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:47,970
In my laptop, I've sized the browser
window to 800 pixels wide,

15
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:49,880
which makes my view port 800 pixels.

16
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,640
If I expand the width,
the view port size changes, and

17
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,480
now I have a view port
width of 1000 pixels.

18
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,180
>> All right,
well that seems simple enough.

19
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:02,000
But not all displays have
the same pixel density right.

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:02,500
>> Right.

21
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:06,180
>> Like what about something like
your Chromebook pixel display.

22
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:06,790
>> Right.

23
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:09,258
Well the Chromebook pixel display,

24
00:01:09,258 --> 00:01:14,290
tells me that it's got a width
of 2,560 pixels by 1,700 pixels.

25
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:17,150
But when I make the browser
window the full width.

26
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:18,900
And ask for the view port width.

27
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:21,020
It tells me its only 1280 pixels wide.

28
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,752
>> Wait.
Not the full 2560.

29
00:01:24,752 --> 00:01:26,355
>> Nope.
Not at all.

30
00:01:26,355 --> 00:01:29,012
>> Hm.
Well not all pixels were created equal.

31
00:01:29,012 --> 00:01:30,139
Were they?
>> Exactly.

32
00:01:30,139 --> 00:01:31,950
A pixel isn't always a pixel.
