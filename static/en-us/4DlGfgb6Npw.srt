1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:04,410
So to help us go through this whole process of learning how to merge two images,

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:07,120
let's look at two specific example images.

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,730
Here I'm going to use, of course, a image like this and another image like this.

4
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:15,440
Both of skin of two different well known cats.

5
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,110
To help us with our analysis, let's just deal with black and

6
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:19,840
white images for now.

7
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,130
So what we're interested in is merging these two images together to

8
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:24,910
form one novel image.

9
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:31,340
What we can do is take one image, take the second one.

10
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:34,610
And, as we learned in one of our earlier lessons, just do some sort of

11
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:38,330
point arithmetic to combine these two images and come up with a weight of

12
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:41,770
taking one percentage of the other, and one percentage of the other.

13
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:45,895
So, for example, I could just take 50% of the pixel values from this image and

14
00:00:45,895 --> 00:00:50,250
50% from the pixel values of this image and just do a simple pixel arithmetic.

15
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:53,290
Just add with the weight 50/50 between those two.

16
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:55,920
That would show us this blended image.

17
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,530
So of course, here you notice now real blending going on.

18
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:01,690
This part of the spot here, and

19
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:05,120
this part of the spot here are kind of now merged.

20
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,125
And of course there's transparency and

21
00:01:07,125 --> 00:01:11,990
there's overlap of these types of spots from one image to the other.

22
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:14,440
Of course, we could play around with how we merge this thing,

23
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,570
get more information from this, less from that and

24
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:21,250
now actually, we can see that this spot is less visible, that spot is more.

25
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:24,080
So again, variety of ways we can do these blends.

26
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,970
Let's look at this again a little bit more carefully and

27
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:27,290
see what we can do with it.

28
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:32,870
My goal in this exercise is for us to now take this image and that image and

29
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:36,940
put them next to each other and blend them just around, in this region.

30
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:40,520
So for example, this is my boundary between those two images and

31
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:44,720
I want to be able to blend aspects of this image, this side and this side, and

32
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:49,252
basically I want to have a blended image right in the middle where the line is,

33
00:01:49,252 --> 00:01:53,468
somewhere in this range, across the whole region.

34
00:01:53,468 --> 00:01:57,900
So this box, let's say, you know, just a few pixels from the center here in

35
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:00,800
this here, I want to do all of the blending, so I want to actually have

36
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:05,010
this spot here, and not just have a sharp line, but merge over here, and

37
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:09,060
similarly, these two spots kind of also have a little bit of blending going on.

38
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:09,960
So that's our goal.
