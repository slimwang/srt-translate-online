1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,390
Finally, there's IndexedDB.

2
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:07,680
It's fast, allows you to store complex
data, asynchronous and transactional.

3
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:12,000
And it's essentially
available everywhere.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,068
It's likely the best fit for
any important user data.

5
00:00:16,068 --> 00:00:19,780
The biggest drawback to using
IndexedDB is its ugly API,

6
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:24,420
with lots of setup required and
call backs to handle.

7
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:28,030
There are a few good repro libraries
out there that will obstruct away

8
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:29,750
some of the ugliness.

9
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:35,390
Mozilla has published localForage,
which provides a local storage like API.

10
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:38,950
Or Lovefield,
which provides SQL-like APIs.
