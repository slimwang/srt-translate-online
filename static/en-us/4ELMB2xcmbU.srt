00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,560
Alright.

2
00:00:00,566 --> 00:00:04,856
So really, all you have to do is set ChainGun equal to Weapon.extend and in this

3
00:00:04,856 --> 00:00:09,253
case, we're not extending it with any further functionality. We'll be getting to

4
00:00:09,253 --> 00:00:14,389
that later. And similarly, we're defining Entity to extend Class, Teleporter to

5
00:00:14,389 --> 00:00:17,988
extend Entity, and EnergyCanister to extend Entity. This bit of code doesn't

6
00:00:17,988 --> 00:00:23,722
really do anything by itself but we'll be adding more functionality to these, as

7
00:00:23,734 --> 00:00:27,548
we go. And this way, we have a nice clean framework for doing that.
