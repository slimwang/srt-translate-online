1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,580
And the game that I'm going to show you is called "Roadblock."

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:05,600
Roadblock is a game for 2 players.

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,160
It's played on a graph with end vertices where the edges are colored.

4
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:12,300
And coloring--well, in a way, it's similar to Shortest Tour.

5
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:15,060
So in Shortest Tour or Traveling Salesman, each edge

6
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:17,700
had a number or distance assigned to it.

7
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:21,400
And here each edge has a color, so you can have red edges, blue edges,

8
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,940
yellow edges, any number of colors that you desire.

9
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:26,730
And each edge has exactly 1 of those colors.

10
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:29,450
Now, some of the vertices also have a label.

11
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:32,610
Some of the vertices have a label that says, "player 1 wins,"

12
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:35,420
and others have a label that says, "player 2 wins."

13
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:37,420
So the situation might look something like this.

14
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:40,620
So here's the graph with end vertices, in this case, 11 vertices.

15
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:44,020
The edges are colored either red, purple, or blue,

16
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:46,020
and some of the vertices are labeled.

17
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:49,430
Here we have the 2 vertices that say "player 1 wins,"

18
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:52,670
and here we have 2 vertices that say, "player 2 wins."

19
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:55,290
So what are the rules of the game? Both player 1 and player 2

20
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:59,300
start out with a number of playing pieces that are also specified in the beginning.

21
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:02,810
So each player has a number of pieces at specified vertices.

22
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:05,570
So in this example I'm drawing here, it might look something like this.

23
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:10,490
So player 2 might have a piece here; player 1 might have a piece here.

24
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:15,340
Player 2 gets another piece down here, and player 1 gets another piece up here.

25
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:19,260
So player 1 starts playing, then player 2 moves, then again player 1.

26
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:22,340
So they play in turns, and here are the rules of the game:

27
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:30,020
In any turn, you can take 1 of your pieces and move it along the edges of the graph.

28
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:35,110
But you can only move your piece along edges that have the same colors.

29
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:37,640
So you can choose the color, but you must stay on that color.

30
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:42,960
So, for example, player 1 could move this piece here, either to this vertex down here

31
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,920
or this 1 down here or this 1 over here; that would all be fine.

32
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:52,020
Player 2 here, for example, could even travel 2 edges in 1 turn, or 3 edges,

33
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:54,220
1, 2, 3, because they're all red.

34
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:58,180
But what player 2 could not do is travel 1, 2, 3.

35
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:02,870
Because then the color of the edges would change, along which player 2 travels.

36
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:06,430
Each time you have a move you can change your color, but not during a move.

37
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:10,590
And there is a second rule, and that is you cannot jump over other pieces.

38
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:15,170
So player 1 here, for example, cannot travel along these red edges here

39
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:17,170
because player 2 has a piece here.

40
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:20,380
And that is why it's basically called "Roadblock," because player 2

41
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:23,370
is blocking this road here for player 1.

42
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:25,820
But, of course, player 1 could go here or here.

43
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:27,990
How do you win this game? That is very simple.

44
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:33,380
Player 1 wins the game if player 1 manages to place 1 of his or her pieces

45
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:36,210
on a vertex that says, "player 1 wins."

46
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:41,490
And player 2, likewise, wins when player 2 places his or her pieces

47
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:44,910
on 1 of the vertices that say, "player 2 wins."

48
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:47,710
It can be any graph, any combination of labels of the vertices,

49
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:50,770
any edges, any color combinations of the edges.

50
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:53,200
So you're given this configuration here as an input.

51
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,420
The question is, can player 1 always win?

52
00:02:56,420 --> 00:03:00,220
Or, in other words, can player 1 'force' a win?

53
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:03,500
And what I mean by that "is player 1 being able to force a win,"

54
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:09,730
means that no matter how smart player 2 plays, what moves he or she makes,

55
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:15,260
how intelligent and whatnot, player 1 will always be able to make moves

56
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:18,070
that will allow player 1 to win.

57
00:03:18,070 --> 99:59:59,999
So given this graph up here, can player 1 always win?
