00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,860
Software developers use forums and
discussion boards all the time.

2
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:06,330
It turns out by a field that's
marked by constant learning,

3
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:08,890
evidently a life of learning means
a life of reading, and it's hard to

4
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:12,660
imagine that there's a profession
more steeped in online discussions.

5
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:15,750
>> Your cohort's forum will be another
indispensable resource during your time

6
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:17,340
in this nanodegree.

7
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:20,950
There, you can ask or answer questions
and contribute to discussions.

8
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:23,320
The Udacity team, as well as
other students in your cohort,

9
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:25,770
will be there to respond and help out.

10
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:28,930
Everyone, even the most experienced
of engineers get stuck sometimes when

11
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:30,160
trying to solve problems.

12
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,229
So please don't hesitate to
take advantage of the forum for

13
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:33,700
help if you're ever in this position.

14
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:37,290
You can search to see if someone has
already asked a question related to

15
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:40,150
yours, or
you can make a new post if no one has.

16
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:42,980
Chances are someone else is wondering
about the same thing you were,

17
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:43,640
so don't be shy.
