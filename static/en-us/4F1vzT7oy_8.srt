00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,788
The solution to this equation is x equals 3 over 26. If you got the answer

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:07,797
right, you are well on your way. Let's see how we got that answer. Once again,

3
00:00:07,809 --> 00:00:11,838
this is an equation that has fractions in it. Since I don't want to have to add

4
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:16,000
and subtract, multiply and divide a lot of fractions, I can clear the fractions

5
00:00:16,012 --> 00:00:21,830
by multiplying through by the least common denominator. The denominator are 6,

6
00:00:21,949 --> 00:00:27,553
2, and 3. The least common denominator is 6. So, I have to multiply the equation

7
00:00:27,565 --> 00:00:32,223
through by 6. I'm going to skip this step of showing the individual

8
00:00:32,235 --> 00:00:37,947
multiplication of the terms. When I multiply 6 times x plus 7 over 6, the six is

9
00:00:37,959 --> 00:00:44,574
cancelled out, and I'm left with x plus 7. When I multiply 6 times 1 half x, 6

10
00:00:44,586 --> 00:00:51,151
times 1 half is 3, and I have to multiply that by x. When I multiply 6 times 2

11
00:00:51,163 --> 00:00:57,095
3rds, I get 12 over 3, which is 4. Remember, when I'm multiplying through by the

12
00:00:57,107 --> 00:01:01,970
least common denominator, I have to multiply the least common denominator by

13
00:01:01,982 --> 00:01:06,920
every term. And that's every term whether there's a fraction in the term or not.

14
00:01:07,027 --> 00:01:11,482
So, I also have to multiply 6 times 4x, which gives me 24x. Now that I've

15
00:01:11,494 --> 00:01:16,078
eliminated all the fractions from my equation, I can combine my terms. On the

16
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:20,397
left side, I only have x plus 7. And on the right side, I have 3x plus 24x is

17
00:01:20,409 --> 00:01:24,875
going to give me 27x. And then, I have the plus 4. The next thing I want to do

18
00:01:24,887 --> 00:01:29,312
since I like to deal with positive coefficients is to subtract x from both

19
00:01:29,324 --> 00:01:33,958
sides. Even though there's not a coefficient in front of this x, we know that

20
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:39,834
there's a 1 there. So, 1x minus 1x gives me 0 and the only thing I have left on

21
00:01:39,846 --> 00:01:45,024
the left side of the equation is 7. On the right side of the equation, I have

22
00:01:45,036 --> 00:01:50,081
27x minus 1x, gives me 26x plus 4. No that my variable is on one side of the

23
00:01:50,093 --> 00:01:55,616
equation, I want to isolate it by subtracting 4 from both sides of the equation.

24
00:01:55,942 --> 00:02:01,386
7 minus 4 is 3 and that equals 26 x. The last step is to divide both sides of

25
00:02:01,398 --> 00:02:07,019
the equation by the coefficient of the variable, which is 26. When I do that, I

26
00:02:07,031 --> 00:02:12,609
know 26 over 26 is 1, so I have x on the right side of the equation and 3 over

27
00:02:12,621 --> 00:02:17,178
26 on the left side of the equation. Remember, it doesn't matter whether you

28
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:20,562
have a number equals x or x equals a number. It's the same thing.

29
00:02:20,658 --> 00:02:25,051
Congratulations on completing solving linear equations. Now that you've learned

30
00:02:25,063 --> 00:02:29,379
how to solve linear equations, let's do something a little bit different. Chris,

31
00:02:29,475 --> 00:02:31,079
what do you have up for us next?
