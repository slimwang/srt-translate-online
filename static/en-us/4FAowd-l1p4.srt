00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,999
Now we can calculate the standard error. Note that since S sub G is the

2
00:00:03,999 --> 00:00:10,225
standard deviation, if we square it, we have the variance. So we have the

3
00:00:10,225 --> 00:00:14,385
variance of the meal prices at Gettysburg divided by the number in our sample

4
00:00:14,385 --> 00:00:18,545
from Gettysburg, plus the variance of our meal prices at Wilma divided by the

5
00:00:18,545 --> 00:00:23,870
number of restaurants in our sample from Wilma.
