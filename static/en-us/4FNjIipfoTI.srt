1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,140
So you've just learned a lot about
loops, if else statements, and

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:05,080
some other Python syntax.

3
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:08,010
You'll now apply these concepts in
a new function you'll learn about.

4
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:10,860
To build your first real version
of a mad libs generator.

5
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:14,210
Which can take in a string that might
contain the words noun, or verb.

6
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:16,830
And replace those words with
randomly generated nouns and

7
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:19,740
verbs to simulate user input.

8
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:23,010
You'll see how functions are useful
in breaking down large tasks

9
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:25,560
into smaller more manageable chunks.

10
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:26,200
Let's get started.
