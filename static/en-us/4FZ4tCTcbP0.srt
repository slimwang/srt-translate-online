1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Let's go through it together--the Web page is broken down into words and trees.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
That's lexing and parsing, and we do that first.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
This is right; the Web page is then interpreted--that's True.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Some of the fragments or elements that we come across

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
might be JavaScript--embedded JavaScript--

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
so then we have to call the JavaScript interpreter.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
So thus far, the first 3 seem pretty good.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Eventually, the user's JavaScript code on the Web page

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
may call: write--at which point we'll have to

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
store all of that output so that we can display it on the Web page.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
That's good.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Ah! But then here we're suggesting that the

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
JavaScript interpreter calls the graphics library.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
This is an erroneous step; in our particular architecture,

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
the JavaScript interpreter returns all of the strings to the HTML interpreter

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
and that interpreter, then, calls the graphics library.

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
This is what's known as a Design Decision.

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
For our particular Web browser,

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
only the HTML interpreter is going to call the graphics library.

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
That's not the only way to do it.

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Just like there's more than one way to build a house,

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
there's more than one way to build or design a Web browser.

23
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
We've just decided for this particular one,

24
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
that only the HTML interpreter's going to call the graphics library.

25
00:01:11,000 --> 99:59:59,999
I claim that's going to simplify the amount of code we'd have to write.
