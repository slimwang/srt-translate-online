1
00:00:00,218 --> 00:00:06,181
And, the answer is, again, 0.002777 and so on,

2
00:00:06,181 --> 00:00:09,617
which is the same as 1 over 360. And, the way

3
00:00:09,617 --> 00:00:12,172
to see this is that the width of this interval over

4
00:00:12,172 --> 00:00:14,875
here is 360. We didn’t know the height which

5
00:00:14,875 --> 00:00:18,388
is what I asked you to guess. But, if we multiply

6
00:00:18,388 --> 00:00:23,036
360 by 1 over 360 then the area of this rectangle

7
00:00:23,036 --> 00:00:27,000
over here becomes 1. So, let’s do this again.
