1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,500
Two of my favorite charts, they were not listed in the flow chart,

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:07,270
are tables, or simply just text and maps.

3
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:11,310
A table isn't traditionally thought of as a tool for visualization.

4
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:14,870
But sometimes if your data doesn't have any inherent structure or

5
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:17,780
order, a table is the most natural choice.

6
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:21,540
Tables typically are used to represent summaries of data or

7
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:23,200
somewhat disjoint facts.

8
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:28,330
In this example, we'll be looking at states and their corresponding state bird.

9
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:32,020
Since states do have some geographical representation,

10
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:33,940
we may want to represent them on a map.

11
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:40,330
But since State Bird is simply a label or category, it may be hard to represent

12
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:44,090
in one of the other visual encodings that correspond with a geographic map.

13
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:47,470
Typically, with a map, you have either the size or

14
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:51,090
color of some geographic region, or some points to plot.

15
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:54,220
In our case, we simply want to look up what state and

16
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:56,250
find the corresponding state bird.

17
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:59,450
Tables work well when there is no in-hand relation between the data

18
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:00,810
you're conveying.

19
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:04,569
Since we simply want a state to state bird mapping,

20
00:01:04,569 --> 00:01:08,040
we can use a table as something of a look up mechanism.

21
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:12,460
Maps are interesting, because they are something of a compound visual coding.

22
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:17,660
A map is simply an x and a y coordinate combined with some geographic context,

23
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:20,290
often the case of latitude and longitude.

24
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:23,750
And when combined, we get a mapping of an x and

25
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:29,660
a y pixel coordinate to some latitude and longitude, which equals a map.

26
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:34,600
I quickly wanted to go over one of my favorite visualizations for its simplicity

27
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:39,750
and power, by Dustin Cable from the Wilden Cooper Center for Public Service.

28
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:41,460
With this visualization,

29
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:45,110
we have many visual encodings going on in the same space.

30
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:50,960
Every point on the map is actually one person from the U.S. census.

31
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:56,090
The color of the dot corresponds to their race as reported on the census.

32
00:01:56,090 --> 00:02:00,780
And the x and y pixel position of the map correspond to the latitude and

33
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:05,570
longitude of the census block from which the person reported their race.

34
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:09,360
What's truly stunning with this visualization is that nowhere in

35
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,590
the graphic are state or city borders drawn.

36
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:17,470
The natural structure of the United States and the population density

37
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:21,960
across the United States naturally falls over the fact that every dot represents

38
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:26,070
a person, and most the people in the United States are reported on the census.

39
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:30,110
The map we have drawn here only uses two visual encodings, the x and

40
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:34,810
y coordinate for position, and one visual encoding, the color, for the race.

41
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:39,090
There are just a few other geographic charts that I want to talk about.

42
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:43,400
A choropleth map represents some value by color and

43
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,070
plots it geographically across a region.

44
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:50,100
Typically, you may see this as States of the United States,

45
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:54,300
which have a different color representing the intensity of some value.

46
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:57,370
Going back to the previous example of unemployment,

47
00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:01,760
we might represent the unemployment of every state as some range of colors.

48
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,250
A map that's very similar to a choropleth, but

49
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:09,210
uses a different visual encoding to encode its value is a cartogram.

50
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:12,240
A cartogram represents some geographic data, and

51
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:17,830
uses the size of the geographic region to encode often some continuous value.

52
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:21,070
Again, going back to the unemployment example, rather than

53
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:26,010
representing the unemployment rate of a state by its color with a choropleth,

54
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:30,705
we can represent it by the size of the state, geographic region that we draw.

55
00:03:30,705 --> 00:03:33,380
And just reviewing what we just covered with the dot map,

56
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:36,240
a dot map could actually represent any shape.

57
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,040
In the case of the example I've shown,

58
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:42,810
it was similar to a scatter plot where we represent our data with circles, and

59
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:45,270
how it corresponds to some geographic change.

60
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:51,280
The map we just went over is an interesting combination of a choropleth and

61
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,810
a dot map in a way,

62
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:58,570
since it uses some geographic data with a shape, in our case a circle.

63
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:03,120
And some color to encode another secondary value for each point.

64
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,130
And as always, there are many other chart types that I'll not cover here but

65
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:10,720
are typically some sort of compound chart in the way a choropleth or

66
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,370
a chartogram combines elements from two simpler chart types.

67
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:18,250
In the resources section of the class, you can find an exhaustive list

68
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:21,170
of most every comment chart type that people use.
