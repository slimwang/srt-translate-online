1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:01,980
This is a tricky question, and

2
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:03,700
maybe one that you had to think about pretty hard.

3
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:06,210
I would say there's only one answer.

4
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:07,110
This one.

5
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:07,750
One data set.

6
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:10,960
It would be a good candidate for linear regression.

7
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,330
Hopefully, you got that one.

8
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:14,400
So, what are the problems with the other ones?

9
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,290
Well, let's start with this one on the lower right.

10
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:20,560
It would be pretty easy to think of a function that might fit it nicely, but

11
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,490
this function would be something like Y equals X squared,

12
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:26,970
which is not of the form y equals mx plus b.

13
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:29,430
In other words, this isn't a line.

14
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:31,396
This is more of a curve.

15
00:00:31,396 --> 00:00:33,810
There are ways that you can fit these functions, but

16
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:37,170
it wouldn't be an example of linear regression.

17
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:40,390
So that's why this would not be a good candidate for linear regression.

18
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:44,230
One possibility that's almost good for linear regression is this one.

19
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:45,960
Because you could fit it with lines but

20
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,970
you need two different lines to fit the pattern adequately.

21
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:51,780
In fact, if you try to fit this whole data set with one line,

22
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:53,850
it'll probably give you something like this.

23
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:58,330
A clever thing that you could do would be to split it in half along this dotted

24
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:03,880
line and fit one half of the data to one line and one half to the other one.

25
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:07,110
So if you checked that box because you're thinking something like that,

26
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:09,530
then I would say that's probably an acceptable answer.

27
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:14,120
But just as it is, there's not a single line that fits all of these data points.

28
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:17,850
So I would say that without doing something like, fitting it piece wise,

29
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:19,870
this would not be a good candidate either.

30
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:22,370
Next, let's see the data set in the top middle here.

31
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:25,070
The problem here is just that the data is all over the place.

32
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:27,530
There doesn't seem to be a very strong pattern.

33
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:32,310
So there's lots of different lines that might all have very similar r squares or

34
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:35,030
sum of square errors that could all look very different.

35
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:37,860
And in this case, it's hard to say that any of these lines is really

36
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:40,120
describing a pattern in the data very well.

37
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,750
So I would say this is not a particularly good candidate.

38
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:47,110
And this last one, on the upper left, is very tricky.

39
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:52,350
And if you got this one wrong, you shouldn't feel too bad because it's tough.

40
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:54,630
And the problem with this one is,

41
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:57,880
let's look back at this equation y equals mx plus b.

42
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:02,010
And what this means is that by varying along the x axis,

43
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:05,090
the input variable, I want to be able to predict something about

44
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:08,199
what the y value will be along the vertical scale.

45
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:11,900
So I only have one x value, and that's right here.

46
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:17,050
And I have many different y values all along this range.

47
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:20,690
And so there's no way just using this data.

48
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:24,840
That I can vary x and use that to predict a change in y.

49
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:28,600
Another way to say this is that when the equation tries to fit this data,

50
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:32,080
it's going to come up with infinity for m.

51
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,070
And usually when you get infinities, it means that something's going wrong.

52
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:40,220
This is very tricky because you definitely need to have variation in x.

53
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:46,270
Now in this case, of course, on the lower left, you only have variation in x.

54
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:48,470
You don't have any variation in y.

55
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:52,100
So in this case, the slope m would be equal to zero.

56
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:54,510
So fitting it with a line might be a little bit of overkill.

57
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:58,960
You could just say that, suppose that this is eight.

58
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,860
You could just say that y is always equal to eight.

59
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:05,180
And that would do a perfectly good job of describing the pattern.

60
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:09,840
But it's very important that you have a range of x values that you can examine.

61
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,390
So that's why this is not a good candidate for linear regression, but this is.
