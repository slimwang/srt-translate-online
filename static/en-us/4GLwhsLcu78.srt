00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,480
Let me actually, showcase another interesting example.

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,130
This is an example from the landing,

3
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:10,210
the emergency landing of the US Air flight in the Hudson River in New York.

4
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:13,300
It's again, you know, the ability of this pilot to

5
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:16,650
land the airplane was amazing and he saved a lot of lives.

6
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:19,190
In this case, we've got several types of images.

7
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:20,830
First, before the plane landed,

8
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:25,020
many people from high rises up in New York City saw the plane and

9
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:28,210
took pictures, and these pictures were on Twitter worst, pretty fast.

10
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:31,720
These were participatory or citizen images.

11
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:34,070
Shortly after, when the the plane landed of course,

12
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:38,630
organizations like news agencies got there, and we got images like this.

13
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:42,570
Basically, showing where the plane was and how the rescue efforts were going on?

14
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:46,130
So, Participatory Citizen Data, Institutional Imagery.

15
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:51,053
What was interesting was next day, they went and found these videos.

16
00:00:55,895 --> 00:00:57,578
Where you can actually, see the plane land.

17
00:01:02,315 --> 00:01:03,525
So these were not videos or

18
00:01:03,525 --> 00:01:06,830
these were not cameras placed there with that purpose in mind.

19
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:10,190
These were cameras placed there for security purposes.

20
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:12,020
And again, merging these types of things,

21
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:16,870
now we get a much different view of what's happening in that interesting event.

22
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:19,340
And again, thankfully many people were saved at this event.
