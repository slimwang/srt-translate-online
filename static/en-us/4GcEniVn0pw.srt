1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The answer is Bob can compute this because Bob knows r. Bob selected r.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Bob has received these two and the value of k1 is equal to r

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
because that was the one that Bob sent back here.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
That means Bob can compute these

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
subtracting r from W1 prime will give Bob that correct value of wire.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Bob cannot compute W0 though

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
because the value used for k0 is meaningless and unknown to Bob.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
This provides the property that we were looking for that

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Bob can select one of the two values that are the wire labels Alice generated.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Alice doesn't learn which one he selected and Bob doesn't learn anything about the other one.
