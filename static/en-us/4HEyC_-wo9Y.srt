00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,760
A drug is any chemical that influences biological processes when introduced

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:09,274
into the body. Now, it's really important to know that drugs don't introduce

3
00:00:09,274 --> 00:00:15,470
any novel physiological responses in the body, or in the brain. Rather, drugs

4
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:20,150
can disrupt our homeostasis. Within our body, we maintain our internal

5
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:25,067
environment within certain limits. For example, our body maintains things like

6
00:00:25,067 --> 00:00:30,140
our temperature, our water content, our sodium content, even our heart rate.

7
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:34,482
Our resting heart rate is between 40 and 100 beats per minute. But,

8
00:00:34,482 --> 00:00:39,227
methamphetamine can push our heart rate way out of this range in unsafe levels

9
00:00:39,227 --> 00:00:44,770
of over 200 beats per minute. So, we see here that methamphetamine doesn't

10
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:49,465
cause any new responses in our body. We already have a heart rate, doesn't

11
00:00:49,465 --> 00:00:54,049
create that. But it affects the homeostasis, so it increases our heart rate.
