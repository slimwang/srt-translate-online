Hello again. Well, that was a bit of guesswork.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
But I think you might have guessed the right answer.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
We can do so by elimination.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
If we remove the angled brackets, the all of this HTML tag is going to turn into regular text.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
This will create a very different behavior in Mozilla,

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
and therefore we are probably not going to reach the code

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
which originally caused the failure.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
The same goes for select.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
If we remove the attributes--that is, name equals operating system

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
or multiple or size equals 7--then our input will still be a select tag

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
with no attributes at all,

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
and this will still trigger the original failure.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
So, you see that in this big HTML input, only eight characters are relevant

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
for reproducing the problem.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
This will certainly give us nice reward from the Mozilla developers.
