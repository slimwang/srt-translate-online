1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:02,950
Android 5.0 Lollipop, or API 21,

2
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:08,170
added new ways to better choreograph
moving between activities.

3
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:12,230
Firstly, a new API lets you to run
a transition when you launch or

4
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:13,680
leave an activity.

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:17,520
This allows you to customize how
individual views in the screen,

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:18,820
enter or exit.

7
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:21,480
We call these content transitions.

8
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,790
Secondly, it added the ability to
create a shared element transition.

9
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:27,140
This is where an element,

10
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:31,520
which is present on two screens,
transitions smoothly between them.

11
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:33,500
The result is visual continuity for

12
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,460
shared elements across
the two activities.

13
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:39,550
Before we dive deeper into
these powerful new APIs,

14
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:43,630
let's take a second to talk a little
bit about backwards compatibility.

15
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:46,120
So far in the course,
almost everything we've covered

16
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:49,390
has been achievable on all
relevant versions of Android.

17
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:53,760
Especially with the help of Android
support libraries like AppCompat.

18
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,380
As we've seen in this lesson,

19
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:59,510
the Android animation APIs have become
more powerful with each release.

20
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:03,655
This means that some of the more
advanced effects might be impossible or

21
00:01:03,655 --> 00:01:06,770
unfeasible to achieve on older devices.

22
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:09,400
A generally good approach for
implementing animations,

23
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:14,220
is to use the newest APIs but to then
degrade gracefully on all the devices,

24
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:16,769
swapping in simple animations for
the more complex ones.

25
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:21,430
Remember, that devices are constantly
being refreshed and upgraded.

26
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:25,403
So while working on the newest API's
might have a lower uptake at first,

27
00:01:25,403 --> 00:01:27,692
the return on investment will only grow.

28
00:01:27,692 --> 00:01:32,384
Okay, let's take a closer look at
the new activity transitions in 5.0.
