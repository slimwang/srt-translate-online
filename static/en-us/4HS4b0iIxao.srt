00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,918
Cleaning, checking and counting OCD are the most common types of OCD and it

2
00:00:03,918 --> 00:00:09,092
interferes with normal functioning of daily life. For example, a person with

3
00:00:09,092 --> 00:00:12,813
OCD who fears germs is going to spend an excessive amount of time worrying

4
00:00:12,813 --> 00:00:17,152
about germs. They're going to be thinking about all the germs that surround

5
00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:21,682
them. Worrying about touching something and acquiring new germs. Now these

6
00:00:21,682 --> 00:00:25,246
anxious thoughts that they have are combated by the compulsive behaviors that

7
00:00:25,246 --> 00:00:30,312
they engage in. For example, a person who's afraid of germs may wash their

8
00:00:30,312 --> 00:00:35,408
hands two to 300 times a day in scolding hot water. Or perhaps they wash them

9
00:00:35,408 --> 00:00:41,441
five to six times a day, but for 30 to 40 minutes at a time. The person is

10
00:00:41,441 --> 00:00:46,021
aware of these compulsions but they're unable to stop them. A person with

11
00:00:46,021 --> 00:00:49,336
checking OCD, may have to check the stove repeatedly before leaving the house

12
00:00:49,336 --> 00:00:55,066
to make sure it's off even though they haven't cooked at home in months. And

13
00:00:55,066 --> 00:00:58,972
finally a person with counting OCD maybe has to touch a doorknob 14 times for

14
00:00:58,972 --> 00:01:04,510
fear that his dog will die if he doesn't. Even though he knows there's really

15
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:07,646
no connection between how many times he touches a door knob and the fate of his

16
00:01:07,646 --> 00:01:12,118
dog. So the main thing to remember is that the person is aware of these

17
00:01:12,118 --> 00:01:15,150
compulsions, but they're still unable to stop them.
