1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
[Male narrator] The answers are first,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
the sentence if 5 is an odd number,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
then Paris is the capital of France, is true

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
in propositional logic.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
It may sound odd in ordinary English,

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
but in propositional logic, this is the same as true implies true

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
and if we look on this line--the final line for P and Q,

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
P implies Q is true.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The second sentence, 5 is an even number, implies Moscow is the capital of France.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
That's the same as false implies false,

11
00:00:38,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and false implies false according to the definition is also true.
