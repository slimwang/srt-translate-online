00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:01,710
Welcome to lesson two.

2
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:05,670
We're going to start by digging into one
of the key materials in material design,

3
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:07,150
paper surfaces.

4
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:11,020
Material design seeks to describe
what your UI is made out of.

5
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:13,570
We use the metaphor of distil
paper to build on top of

6
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:17,840
people's real world experiences to
make your UI easier to understand.

7
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,530
>> Right.
We'll explain how the idea of

8
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:23,270
tangible surfaces can make your app
easier to interact with, how it can

9
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:28,630
focus attention, promote key actions,
and delightfully respond to user input.

10
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:30,000
>> Once we've covered the theory,

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,020
we'll go over how to apply this
practice to our Android apps.
