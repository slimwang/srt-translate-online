We've been talking about array lists up to now and array lists are very

2
00:00:03,208 --> 00:00:06,625
flexible, but there are times when arrays are lower level construct are more

3
00:00:06,625 --> 00:00:13,842
useful. Here is how to make an array of values of type double. As you can see,

4
00:00:13,842 --> 00:00:16,466
it looks quite different than the declaration of an array list, so let's take

5
00:00:16,466 --> 00:00:21,450
it apart. Over here is the type, it's an array indicated by these brackets of

6
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:27,026
double. This is the variable. Here's the new operator and back here we say we

7
00:00:27,026 --> 00:00:31,247
want to construct an array of ten doubles, so as you can see you put the length

8
00:00:31,247 --> 00:00:35,602
of the array inside the brackets, unlike with arrayLists, the size of an array

9
00:00:35,602 --> 00:00:39,689
can never change, this array here has been made with ten numbers and it'll

10
00:00:39,689 --> 00:00:47,664
always have ten numbers in it. No more and no less. There's a second way of

11
00:00:47,664 --> 00:00:51,764
constructing an array that's often very convenient. Here I have again an array

12
00:00:51,764 --> 00:00:57,399
of floating point numbers. I call it moreValues. And over here I simply put

13
00:00:57,399 --> 00:01:02,819
enclosed inside braces the values that I want to put in the array. This array

14
00:01:02,819 --> 00:01:06,359
has length five and again it'll always have length five.
