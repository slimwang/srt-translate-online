00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Now for the mean is 0.7 and we get 0.28 for the term in the right.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
In my calculation, σ² is 0.21 and when I apply my magic formula,

00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
plugging in N=10, I get this guy right over here.

00:00:18,000 --> 99:59:59,999
What's interesting is this CI term is now smaller because they have a larger sample.
