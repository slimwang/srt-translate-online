1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Now we move to a bigram model,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
where we're sampling from the probability of a word given the previous word.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Now we see a little bit of structure emerge.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
So you can see at the start of the sentences "I have", "hear you," "hark ye."

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
The words seem to go together,

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
but then as the sentences move on they ramble and don't go any definitive direction.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
So the sentences are locally consistent at the level of one or two words,

8
00:00:28,000 --> 99:59:59,999
but that consistency doesn't go very far.
