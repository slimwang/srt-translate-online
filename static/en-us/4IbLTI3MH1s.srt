00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:05,010
What did you learn recently,
last week or last month,

2
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:07,870
that you thought was
particularly interesting?

3
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:10,270
>> Related to IOS development or just?

4
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:14,110
>> Let's do development general or
specifically IOS.

5
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:14,820
>> Sure.

6
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:18,910
So I do follow several
Like SwiftBlogs and

7
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:22,050
places that are constantly putting out
talks that people are giving on Swift.

8
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:26,600
And there's one in particular about
GameplayKit, which is new to iOS nine.

9
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:30,580
And it's talking about how you can
use things that are more tailored for

10
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:34,870
game applications for
non-game applications so.

11
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:39,280
In particular they talk about how games
play could has this concept of state

12
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,110
machines and state machines are good for

13
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:45,780
managing transitions between
different states of application and

14
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:49,470
this particular speaker is talking about
they use the state machine to manage

15
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:55,550
the state of his navigation stack
kind of how to quickly route from

16
00:00:55,550 --> 00:01:00,600
a really deep part of the navigation
stack back to the View Controller to

17
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:05,340
a certain new controller using the state
machine and also using pathfinding.

18
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:08,230
So it was just an interesting
take on a gameplay kit in

19
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:11,870
kind of nontraditional uses of it.

20
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:16,340
>> Talking about blogs,
what blogs or websites do you,

21
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:19,780
technical ones,
>> Do you follow on a regular basis?

22
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:22,680
>> So for
a while I've been following NS hipster,

23
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,930
who writes good articles about different
parts of Apple frameworks and things.

24
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:31,400
I've also been following Tasha the
robot, she's a really great developer

25
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:36,100
and she does a lot of Swift so that's
good for anyone doing swift development.

26
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:40,790
I've also done my best here
recently to tune into when so

27
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:47,260
summits are happening another Swift
what's the word meet apps and

28
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:49,200
things like that to see what
people are talking about.

29
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:53,730
I think realm IO has a newsletter
that you can subscribe to or

30
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:55,950
they are releasing videos and

31
00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:00,640
conferences and Speeches that
people are giving about Swift.

32
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,700
>> Have you been to any conference?

33
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,240
Or are you planning to go?

34
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:08,280
>> I haven't been to any
Swift Conferences before, no.

35
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,590
But I'm hoping to, so
