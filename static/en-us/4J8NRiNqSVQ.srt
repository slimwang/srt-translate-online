00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,850
This wonderful app developer
out of the United Arab Emerits,

2
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:05,720
the company is called Megabit.

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:07,620
And he creates games, basically.

4
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:10,000
But he started out
making his first game,

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,540
in his first year, he made like $2,000.

6
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:15,610
And he is living at
home with his parents.

7
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:17,980
And his parents are like why
are you doing this as a business?

8
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:18,760
This is crazy.

9
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:21,982
I can't believe you're spending all
your time building these apps, right?

10
00:00:21,982 --> 00:00:24,247
You should go back to school,
become an engineer.

11
00:00:24,247 --> 00:00:26,242
You know, maybe, become a doctor.

12
00:00:26,242 --> 00:00:27,930
You know, whatever it may be.

13
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:28,890
And he was like no, no, no.

14
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:29,720
I really love doing this.

15
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:31,400
So he started doing it more.

16
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:34,530
And then the second year,
he made probably like $14,000 and

17
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:38,140
he was like well, at least,
I'm going up, right?

18
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:41,570
And kept building, and
kept moving, chugging along.

19
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:44,280
And a year later,
he made close to $250,000.

20
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,710
And his parents were like, stay in it.

21
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:49,035
Do everything you can to stay.

22
00:00:49,035 --> 00:00:51,270
[LAUGH] Now his brother's
helping him out.

23
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:55,310
And he is looking to hopefully,
create close to $1 million this year.

24
00:00:55,310 --> 00:01:00,020
So it just shows you monetization,
even though you start very small.

25
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:02,090
There's no guidebook
to what's successful.

26
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:04,989
Really understanding your users, and
then trying to build off of that.

27
00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:06,130
So you can grow your business.
