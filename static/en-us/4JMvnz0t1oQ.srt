00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,014
This battle between static and dynamic typing is one of the longest lasting and

2
00:00:04,014 --> 00:00:07,612
bloodiest battles in all of computing. But there's really no right answer to

3
00:00:07,612 --> 00:00:10,937
which is best, it depends on what you're doing. We're going to stick with Python

4
00:00:10,937 --> 00:00:14,010
for the rest of this course. But to be a complete programmer, you should have

5
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:17,770
experience with both static and dynamically type languages. And in fact, the

6
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:21,601
distinction between the two is starting to get blurry. There's lots of language

7
00:00:21,601 --> 00:00:26,429
that are primarily statically type, like C sharp, that include some dynamically

8
00:00:26,429 --> 00:00:31,049
type features. And there's also ways to use static checking to increase the

9
00:00:31,049 --> 00:00:34,233
likelihood that your Python programs are correct.
