00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,366
So far everything we've said about language has to deal with the probability distribution over words.

2
00:00:06,367 --> 00:00:12,832
So we take a sentence, "Fed raises interest rates," and we compute a probability for that,

3
00:00:12,833 --> 00:00:18,599
and we do that in terms of the probability of some words given neighboring words.

4
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:29,199
But there's another approach to language processing that deals not just with adjacency of words, but with an underlying tree structure that's hidden,

5
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:37,732
that's not apparent in the sequence of words, but which represents the underlying structure, and perhaps meaning of the sentence.

6
00:00:37,733 --> 00:00:50,966
So we can say that "Fed" is a noun, and by itself it's a noun phrases, "raises" is a verb, "interest" is a noun,

7
00:00:50,967 --> 00:01:02,899
and "rates" is also a noun. And together they make up a noun phrase. And now we have a verb with its object makes up a verb phrase.

8
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:11,766
And then a noun phrase as a subject, and a verb phrase as the main part of the sentence, makes up a sentence.

9
00:01:11,767 --> 00:01:16,766
And that's our tree that represents a part of this sentence.

10
00:01:16,767 --> 00:01:24,466
Now, however, one of the factors that's important here is that this tree is not unique. This seems to make a lot of sense.

11
00:01:24,467 --> 00:01:32,099
This says that "the Fed" is a subject of this sentence, and the object is "the interest rates," and they're being raised.

12
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:37,732
But we can think of other parses that also makes sense to some degree for this sentence.

13
00:01:37,733 --> 00:01:46,732
For example, "interest" is also a verb, and it could be that "rates" is a noun which is serving as a noun phrase.

14
00:01:46,733 --> 00:01:54,732
And so the verb phrase could be "interest rates." What is doing that interest of rates?

15
00:01:54,733 --> 00:02:05,332
Well, it could be "Fed raises." A certain type of raises called Fed raises, they interest something, and what they're interesting is the rates.

16
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:15,000
And that could be a sentence. And that sentence seems less likely, but they're both valid parses of this sentence.
