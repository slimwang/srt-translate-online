00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:04,100
Besides introducing the terminology
of alphabets, strings, and

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:06,650
languages, the major goal of this lesson

3
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:09,080
is to convince you that some
functions are not computable.

4
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:12,690
Central to our argument will
be the difference between

5
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:15,950
countably infinite sets and
uncountably infinite sets.

6
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:19,820
If you weren't familiar with this
distinction already, you may be thinking

7
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:24,430
to yourself, infinity's
a strange enough idea by itself.

8
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:25,450
Now I have to deal with two of them?

9
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:27,960
Well, it isn't as bad as all that.

10
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:32,350
A countably infinite set is
one that you can enumerate.

11
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:33,360
That is, you can say,

12
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,590
this is the first element, this is
the second element, and so forth.

13
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:40,100
And, this is the really important part,

14
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:42,480
eventually give a number to
every element in the set.

15
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:46,700
For some sets,
an enumeration is straight forward.

16
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:48,190
Take the even numbers.

17
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:51,235
We can say that two's the first one,
four is the second,

18
00:00:51,235 --> 00:00:53,520
six the third and so forth.

19
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:56,530
For some sets like the rationals,

20
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:59,480
you've to be a little bit
clever to find an enumeration.

21
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:02,420
We'll see the trick for
enumerating them in a little bit.

22
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:04,700
And for some sets,
like the real numbers,

23
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:09,220
it doesn't matter how clever you are,
there simply is no enumeration.

24
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:10,760
These are the uncountable sets.

25
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,740
In what follows, we'll argue that
the set of all strings over an alphabet

26
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:18,840
is countable and give a few other
results that will be useful for

27
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,419
thinking about countability in general.

28
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:24,976
Then we will show that the set
of languages is uncountable.

29
00:01:24,976 --> 00:01:27,080
Let's make this notion of countable and

30
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:29,950
uncountable sets precise
with a formal definition.

31
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:33,520
We say that a a set is
countable if it is finite or

32
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,660
if there is a one-to-one correspondence
with the natural numbers.

33
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:37,630
A one-to-one correspondence,

34
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:41,080
by the way, is a function that
is one to one, meaning that

35
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:45,450
no two elements of the domain get mapped
to the same element of the range.

36
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:49,080
And also onto,
meaning that every element of the range

37
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,470
is mapped to by
an element of the domain.

38
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:55,495
For example, here is a one-to-one
correspondence between the integers,

39
00:01:55,495 --> 00:01:59,935
1 through 6, and the set of
permutations of three elements.

40
00:01:59,935 --> 00:02:03,385
Now, in general, the existence
of a one-to-one correspondence

41
00:02:03,385 --> 00:02:06,575
implies that the two
sets have the same size.

42
00:02:06,575 --> 00:02:08,835
That is, the same number of elements.

43
00:02:08,835 --> 00:02:11,865
And this actually holds even for
infinite sets.

44
00:02:11,865 --> 00:02:15,900
That is why we say that there
are as many even natural numbers

45
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,770
as there are natural numbers.

46
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:20,760
Because it's easy to establish
a one-to-one correspondence between

47
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,360
the two sets.

48
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:25,360
F of N is equal to 2 N, for example.

49
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,180
For our purposes, we are most
interested in showing that for

50
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:32,210
any finite alphabet, the set of strings
over that alphabet is countable.
