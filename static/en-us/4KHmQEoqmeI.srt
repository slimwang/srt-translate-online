1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,690
The answer is that breadth
first search is complete, so

2
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:08,679
even if the tree is infinite, if
the goal is placed at any finite level,

3
00:00:08,679 --> 00:00:12,449
eventually we're going to march down and
find that goal.

4
00:00:12,449 --> 00:00:14,459
Same with cheapest first.

5
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:15,800
No matter where the goal is,

6
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:19,990
if it has a finite cost, eventually
we're going to go down and find it.

7
00:00:19,989 --> 00:00:22,529
But not so for Depth-First search.

8
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:26,730
If there's an infinite path, Depth-First
search will keep following that.

9
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:31,219
So we'll keep going down and
down and down along this path and

10
00:00:31,219 --> 00:00:34,979
never get to the path that
the goal consists of.

11
00:00:34,979 --> 00:00:38,059
And never get to the path
on which the goal sits.

12
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:39,875
So Depth-First search is not complete.

13
00:00:39,875 --> 00:00:41,234
