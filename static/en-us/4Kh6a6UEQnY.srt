00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:05,075
Welcome to the unit on Modules and Classes. As we build larger and more complex

2
00:00:05,075 --> 00:00:09,875
programs we quickly end up with programs that are far too big for one person to

3
00:00:09,875 --> 00:00:14,172
keep in their head at any one time. One solution to this would be to have your

4
00:00:14,172 --> 00:00:18,031
head explode, this only works once. Instead what we need are Techniques to

5
00:00:18,031 --> 00:00:21,938
Manage Complexity. And that's going to be the focus of this unit as well as some

6
00:00:21,938 --> 00:00:25,544
of the things that we cover in later lessons. This is one of the main things

7
00:00:25,544 --> 00:00:29,352
that distinguishes experienced programmers from beginners, is this ability to

8
00:00:29,352 --> 00:00:34,210
Manage Complexity, to deal with larger and larger programs. And the biggest idea

9
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:38,570
for that is actually modularity. Unlike exploding heads, breaking up programs

10
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:42,164
into pieces is actually a good thing. In this unit we'll look at two mechanisms

11
00:00:42,164 --> 00:00:45,479
that Python provides top help programmers break things up into pieces in a way

12
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:50,072
that doesn't make your head explode. The first is Modules, and the second is

13
00:00:50,072 --> 00:00:54,596
Classes. By using these ideas well you'll be able to construct large and complex

14
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:57,423
programs without your head blowing up into pieces.
