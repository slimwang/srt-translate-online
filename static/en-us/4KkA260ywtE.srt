When we factor a quadratic trinomial, we want to find factors of a times c that

2
00:00:05,343 --> 00:00:11,644
sum to b. So in this case, we want to find factors of 1 times 6, or just 6, that

3
00:00:11,644 --> 00:00:16,582
sum to 5. I know 3 and 2 are factors of 6, that add to 5. So I can use those to

4
00:00:16,582 --> 00:00:21,834
rewrite my middle term. Then we use factoring by grouping to get x plus 2 times

5
00:00:21,834 --> 00:00:26,017
x plus 3. Great work if you got that one right. You might have noticed a pattern

6
00:00:26,017 --> 00:00:30,456
when factoring trinomials that have an a value of 1. The two factors here always

7
00:00:30,456 --> 00:00:36,286
appear in this parentheses. But keep in mind, this is only if the a value is 1.
