Here is how you complete the largest method. For simplicity, I'd put objects i

2
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:08,790
and another variable that I call current. You don't strictly have to do that.

3
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:11,725
And now I have to check whether current is bigger than largestSoFar. Well,

4
00:00:11,725 --> 00:00:16,071
they're objects so I can't compare them directly. I have to compare their

5
00:00:16,071 --> 00:00:21,035
measures. Is the measure of current bigger than the measure of the largest so

6
00:00:21,035 --> 00:00:26,598
far? If so, I changed my mind about who's the LargestSoFar. It's exactly the

7
00:00:26,598 --> 00:00:29,874
same algorithm that you've seen in lesson seven, now applied to measurable

8
00:00:29,874 --> 00:00:36,830
objects. Let's run the tester. And we see what the most fuel efficient car is.

00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:38,640
Not surprisingly, it's an electric one.
