1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:03,460
Domain names are also essential
to several HTTP features,

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:05,420
including cookie security and SSL..

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,020
A single web server can handle requests
from multiple sites which it tells apart

4
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:11,730
by their domain names.

5
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:15,810
Apache calls this a virtual
host configuration.

6
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:19,610
NGiNX calls it having
multiple server blocks.

7
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:21,450
No matter what you call it,

8
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:24,290
it's why your HTTP requests
have a host header in them.

9
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:27,450
You have to tell that web server what
host name, really what domain name,

10
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:29,420
you're expecting to talk to.

11
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:31,350
As you saw earlier in the course,

12
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:34,900
the host header is a required
part of HTTP requests.

13
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:39,320
When a web app sets a cookie, it sets
that cookie for a particular domain

14
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:43,240
name, and further requests to that
demand will get that cookie sent back.

15
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:47,240
And SSL encryption certificates
are issued for particular domains.

16
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:50,110
SSL serves several different
security purposes.

17
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:52,300
By encrypting the traffic
between browser and

18
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:56,120
server, it prevents networks in
the middle from reading private data.

19
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:59,780
But it also lets the user's browser
verify that the site they're getting

20
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:04,340
data from is actually the site that they
expect, that when you go to google.com,

21
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:06,060
you're actually talking to Google, and

22
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,330
not to some bad guy who's
pretending to be Google.
