00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:04,160
The area of this rectangle is the number of square units that occupies this

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:09,339
space. So we could find that by multiplying the length times the width, l times

3
00:00:09,339 --> 00:00:15,056
w. For the perimeter, we're finding the distance around this rectangle, so

4
00:00:15,056 --> 00:00:19,464
we'll want to have 2w plus 2l, or I could write that in reverse order as 2l

5
00:00:19,464 --> 00:00:25,892
plus 2w. Either one would be correct. Nice work if you found these two

6
00:00:25,892 --> 00:00:26,890
expressions.
