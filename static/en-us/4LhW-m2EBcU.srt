00:00:00,191 --> 00:00:04,513
Being in a hospital, that fact alone, increases your

00:00:04,513 --> 00:00:08,713
probability of dying by a factor 40 is a causal

00:00:08,713 --> 00:00:12,782
statement. It says the hospital causes you to die.

4
00:00:12,782 --> 00:00:15,954
Not just it coincides with the fact that you die

5
00:00:15,954 --> 00:00:19,059
and very frequently people in the public get

6
00:00:19,059 --> 00:00:22,167
this wrong. People observe there is a correlation

7
00:00:22,167 --> 00:00:25,359
but they suggest the correlation is causal in

00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,530
attempting to make you understand the statistic

9
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:31,686
as a call of action. Now, to understand why

10
00:00:31,686 --> 00:00:33,781
this could be wrong letâ€™s dive in a little bit

11
00:00:33,781 --> 00:00:36,000
deeper into the same example
