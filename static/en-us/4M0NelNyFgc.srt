00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:05,580
One category of validation rules are requirement requirements placed

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:09,260
by the value on one dimension on the values of another dimension. For example,

3
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:12,780
if you've got event connectors that require delivery notification, then you

4
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:16,850
also need to be concerned with the cardinality rules, synchronization rules, and

5
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:20,920
mode rules. Might be situations where it's not a strict rule, but

6
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:25,036
it's some kind of caution. Certain combinations may be unstable or unreliable.

7
00:00:25,036 --> 00:00:29,970
That is they're dynamic, the dynamics of that particular situation may not work

8
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:35,570
in all circumstances having to do with concurrency and locality. There

9
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:39,740
may be restrictions. 'Kay, certain combinations may be invalid, for example,

10
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:43,440
passing by name and transient can't be used together. And there might be

11
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,830
prohibitions. Total incompatibility of dimensions, such as streams and atomicity
