00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,935
This square has an area of 9 units squared. This one has an area of 16 units

2
00:00:03,935 --> 00:00:08,903
squared. And this one has an area of 25 units squared. Great work for finding

3
00:00:08,903 --> 00:00:14,606
these numbers. To find the area of any square, we simply square its side. So we

4
00:00:14,606 --> 00:00:20,174
know 3 squared equals 9. For this square, we'll have 4 times 4, which equals

5
00:00:20,174 --> 00:00:26,058
16. And finally, for our last square, well have 5 times 5, or 5 squared which

6
00:00:26,058 --> 00:00:27,791
is 25.
