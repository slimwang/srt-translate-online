00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:04,380
The Google Maps APIs for Android allow
you to add a number of different shape

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:08,100
types to your maps, in order to
customize them for your application.

3
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:11,890
The different shapes that are available
are poly lines, which are a series of

4
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:15,760
connected line segments, defined
by the latitudes, and longitudes.

5
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:18,990
These can be used to mark paths,
or routes on a map.

6
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:21,870
Then there's polygons,
which are enclosed shapes,

7
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:26,160
that can be used to mark an area on the
map and finally circles which provide

8
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,860
geographically accurate projections
of circles on the Earth's surface.

9
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:33,510
Let's first take a look at poly
lines and how you can define them.
