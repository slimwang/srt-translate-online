1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,469
The answer is fairly straightforward.

2
00:00:02,469 --> 00:00:05,670
X values can range from 10 through 210.

3
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:10,030
Y values can range from 15 through 165.

4
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:14,240
And we define the image intensity values to be in the range 0 through 10.
