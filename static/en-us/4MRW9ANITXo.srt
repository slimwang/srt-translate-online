00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,238
In the Unites States historically, the main source for diagnosing mental

2
00:00:04,238 --> 00:00:09,744
disorders has been the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual or the DSM. And this

3
00:00:09,744 --> 00:00:14,035
is published by the American Psychiatric Association. This manual uses a

4
00:00:14,035 --> 00:00:18,796
combination of scientific evidence and clinical observations to determine what

5
00:00:18,796 --> 00:00:25,267
constitutes diagnosis of a particular disorder. The DSM defines mental disorder

6
00:00:25,267 --> 00:00:31,118
as a syndrome, a set of related conditions. Of clinically significant

7
00:00:31,118 --> 00:00:36,520
disturbances of thoughts, feelings, or behaviors. We want to point out that

8
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:40,540
this is an American perspective on psychological disorders, and therefore, it

9
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:46,432
may not encompass the perspectives of other cultures on mental health. More

10
00:00:46,432 --> 00:00:50,202
specifically, the DSM 5, which is the latest edition of the manual, argues for

11
00:00:50,202 --> 00:00:55,460
the 4 d's of determining whether something is a mental doisorder. Let's take a

12
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:59,024
look at each of these individually, while keeping in mind our continuum that we

13
00:00:59,024 --> 00:01:02,642
discussed earlier, meaning the range on the continuum, from what's considered

14
00:01:02,642 --> 00:01:08,096
to be acceptable, or normal, or normal variations in these categories. Or

15
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:13,200
what's considered outside of the normal range of these categories. So, the four

16
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,216
d's of disorders are disturbance, dysfunctional, distress or disability and

17
00:01:18,216 --> 00:01:20,590
finally deviance.
