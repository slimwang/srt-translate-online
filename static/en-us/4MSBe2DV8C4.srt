>> Now can you see a pattern here? Something's going on. I want you to really

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:08,430
think about what the x-intercept and the y-intercept mean, and then complete

3
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:12,874
these sentences. For the x intercept the x or the y coordinate is always equal

4
00:00:12,874 --> 00:00:17,201
to what? And for the y intercept the x or the y coordinate is always equal to

5
00:00:17,201 --> 00:00:21,565
what? So choose out of the x or y coordinate for each sentence and then choose

6
00:00:21,565 --> 00:00:23,330
the number that it's equal to.
