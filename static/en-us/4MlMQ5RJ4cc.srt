1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,710
So, your Facebook page yes definitely dynamic. It's

2
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:07,240
built by Facebook servers and rendered in your browser.

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:11,080
The udacity.com logo, not dynamic. It doesn't change

4
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:12,570
very often it's just a file sitting on a

5
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:18,300
server. A blog's front page. Yes, definitely dynamic.

6
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,694
You know, a blog's front page probably takes all

7
00:00:20,694 --> 00:00:22,917
of the blog's and resets somebody has written

8
00:00:22,917 --> 00:00:25,311
and collates them together and renders a page that

9
00:00:25,311 --> 00:00:27,420
you know, includes you know, the top ten or

10
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:32,100
whatever. And Google search results. Definitely dynamic. You run a

11
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:35,860
search, Google in the background you know, does a

12
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:38,790
search on, on all of their computers, puts together results

13
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:40,610
and then renders them for you on the fly.

14
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:43,830
So, these are all examples of dynamic content. You know,

15
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:47,590
content that's basically put together by programs. And, in this

16
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:50,910
class we're actually going to be building a blog, so that's

17
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:51,840
what you're going to to learn how to build.
