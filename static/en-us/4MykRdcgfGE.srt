1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:05,024
I want to start by listing the factor pairs of 30. We have 1 and 30, 2 and 15, 3

2
00:00:05,024 --> 00:00:11,210
and 10, and 5 and 6, and we could keep listing by putting 6 and 5. But we start

3
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:15,770
to repeat a factor pair so we can stop. This lower number is positive 11. So, I

4
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:19,774
know I don't need to have a negatives for both of the factors. I just want to

5
00:00:19,774 --> 00:00:24,956
find the factor pair that sums to 11. That factor pair, is 5 and 6. Good

6
00:00:24,956 --> 00:00:27,233
thinking if you found that factor pair.
