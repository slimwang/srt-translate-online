1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:04,010
We just saw how we can reuse code and
classes through inheritance.

2
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:06,500
But this is only part
of a bigger picture.

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:10,520
Inheritance allows us to express higher
level relationships between classes.

4
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:14,655
For example, if a dog class inherits
from an animal class then a dog

5
00:00:14,655 --> 00:00:18,345
is an animal, in the sense that it
inherits all the features of an animal.

6
00:00:18,345 --> 00:00:21,775
It will be this kind of higher level
logic that will help you build bigger

7
00:00:21,775 --> 00:00:23,625
and better applications
as you move forward.

8
00:00:23,625 --> 00:00:25,105
See you in the next session.
