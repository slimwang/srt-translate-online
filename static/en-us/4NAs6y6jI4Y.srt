In our last video, we considered possible models for

implementing our regression estimation problem.

00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:09,530
In later lessons, we'll discuss in much greater detail which models are most

00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:12,970
appropriate to take advantage of structure that might exist in data.

00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:15,380
At this moment, let's choose linear regression.
