00:00:00,072 --> 00:00:04,785
One really handy feature of Xcode is
that Alt+clicking on a class can take

2
00:00:04,785 --> 00:00:07,150
you directly to its documentation.

3
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:09,674
Let's take a closer look
at the documentation for

4
00:00:09,674 --> 00:00:11,244
the UIViewController class.

5
00:00:11,244 --> 00:00:15,493
Let's see what we can find in
the Interacting with Storyboard section.

6
00:00:15,493 --> 00:00:18,229
You're already familiar with
the storyboard property,

7
00:00:18,229 --> 00:00:22,060
which we used to get a reference
to the dice view controller.

8
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:28,370
We've also seen prepareForSegue and
performSegueWithIdentifier.

9
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:31,146
It's good to become comfortable
with these methods and

10
00:00:31,146 --> 00:00:35,220
properties now, because they'll all come
into play again soon as we begin to work

11
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:36,831
with navigation controllers.

12
00:00:36,831 --> 00:00:39,615
Let's go ahead an implement
prepareForSegue in our

13
00:00:39,615 --> 00:00:41,139
RollViewController file.

14
00:00:41,139 --> 00:00:44,055
I want you to pay close attention
to this segue argument,

15
00:00:44,055 --> 00:00:47,292
because it has some information
that we really need right now.

16
00:00:47,292 --> 00:00:51,841
In particular, the segue has this
destinationViewController property,

17
00:00:51,841 --> 00:00:55,360
which in this case is
the DiceViewController.

18
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,760
And now that we have a reference
to the DiceViewController,

19
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,070
we can set the dice values.

20
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:01,340
And now let's try running it.

21
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:03,180
Sweet!

22
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:04,209
We've got dice!
