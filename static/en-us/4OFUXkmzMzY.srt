00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,929
Hopefully you were able to type this expression into MathQuill properly. But

2
00:00:03,929 --> 00:00:07,162
just in case it's giving you trouble, here are the keys you need to press to

3
00:00:07,162 --> 00:00:11,205
make it happen. To write log base 3 of x plus 4, we use something pretty

4
00:00:11,205 --> 00:00:16,970
similar to what we did up here. You type \ log and then space to type the word

5
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:22,036
log. To move down to type the 3 as a subscript, hold down Shift while you press

6
00:00:22,036 --> 00:00:26,656
the button with the minus sign. Then you can enter your 3 and move back up

7
00:00:26,656 --> 00:00:31,840
here, press the Right Arrow key. They may need a parenthesis, an opening one.

8
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,578
And then we have our input, x plus 4. Of course, MathQuill closes this

9
00:00:35,578 --> 00:00:39,476
parenthesis for you on its own. So you don't have to technically type another

10
00:00:39,476 --> 00:00:43,759
one, although you can if you want to. As I said before, you'll get a ton of

11
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:47,739
practice typing in things like this in MathQuill in future lessons.
