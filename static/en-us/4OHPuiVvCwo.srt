1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
So the task now is to actually implement Heun's method,

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
we have provided for you Euler's methods.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
You can copy these lines and turn them into Heun's method in the end.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Again, the error is determined so that we can see by how much

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Heun's method is better than Euler's method.
