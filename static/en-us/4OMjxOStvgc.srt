00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,855
Now that you've worked so hard to figure out the vertex form of our equation,

2
00:00:03,855 --> 00:00:08,087
I've decided to show you the graph. Now I'll actually write the equation for the

3
00:00:08,087 --> 00:00:12,346
parabola in both forms, vertex form and standard form. And I'd like you to tell

4
00:00:12,346 --> 00:00:16,686
me what the roots of this parabola are. Remember simplify and write the answers

5
00:00:16,686 --> 00:00:18,261
in as compact a way as you can.
