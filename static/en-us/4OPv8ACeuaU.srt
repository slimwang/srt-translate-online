00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
[Thrun] So congratulations. You learned a lot about Bayes networks.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
You learned about the graph structure of Bayes networks,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
you understood how this is a compact representation,

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
you learned about conditional independence,

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and we talked a little bit about application of Bayes network

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
to interesting reasoning problems.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
But by all means this was a mostly theoretical unit of this class,

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
and in future classes we will talk more about applications.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
The instrument of Bayes networks is really essential to a number of problems.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
It really characterizes the sparse dependence that exists in many readable problems

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
like in robotics and computer vision and filtering and diagnostics and so on.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I really hope you enjoyed this class,

13
00:00:43,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and I really hope you understood in depth how Bayes networks work.
