1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Okay, so now you know the basic % s and how to include multiple variables.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Let's make it even more complex.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
What if we want to include the same string--the same variable twice

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
or you want to not go insane trying to remember how many variables you've included

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
and have to count % s's.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
There's a new syntax for that, and that looks like this.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Instead of saying % s, we can include in parenthesis a name, an identifier,

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
and then instead of including just variables at the end, we can include a dictionary

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
that maps name to value,

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
and name can appear in the string multiple times, and we can have multiple names.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Let's have a quick quiz with that.
