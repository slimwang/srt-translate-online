00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
So now for your homework, go and extend my spyder with the following commands--

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:14,000
we have s step one line--this is already in there, we have c for continue execution,

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
and we have quit--this is already in there.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Now come the extra command--we have p for print all variables and also with an extra argument,

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
which should print the variable as variable equals value.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:34,000
We want to have commands to set breakpoints--b at line sets a breakpoint in line,

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
meaning that after you enter this command, execution will always stop

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
whenever that line is reached, and finally, special command and is specially useful--

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
if you typed in w for watch point or anything that starts with w such as watch

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
and give a variable name as argument, then the program should stop

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
whenever the variable changes its value.

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:04,000
With these commands, you can actually go and debug the remove HTML markup function

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
step by step, printing out individual variables, but as we discussed today,

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
you should go and use the scientific method for your homework.

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
We will test your debugger by coming up with commands such as these

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
and of course, expecting very specific output.

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
This is an extra part that will not be graded, which you can do just for fun.
