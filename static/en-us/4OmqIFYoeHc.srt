00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
To solve this, let us sort the house prices by their increasing numbers--

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:15,000
110K, 125, 148, 160, 180, 325, all the way up to 2400--

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
and that makes it obvious the one in the middle is 160K.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
So $160,000 is the median house price.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
If you look at this neighborhood again,

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I would say the 160K is a really good characterization of the typical house price

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
you find in this neighborhood.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
It's much, much, much more reasonable

9
00:00:34,000 --> 99:59:59,999
than the nearly 500K that the mean would provide us.
