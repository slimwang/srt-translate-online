1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,890
So we saw that if we ask these three questions. Well

2
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:05,250
we needed three questions to be sure that we will find the

3
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:10,090
gold star, by opening box, but we don't need three questions.

4
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:13,930
If we are little smarter about our questions, we only need 2.

5
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:15,680
And the way to do it in 2 questions is to

6
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:19,290
ask for questions that gives us more information. So the problem with

7
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:22,590
asking is that is it in the green box question first?

8
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:26,550
Is that three 3 4 of the time? The answer is no.

9
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:29,200
And if we're trying to use yes, no questions. Or we're trying to

10
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:32,750
use bits to get as much information as possible, what we want to do

11
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:36,760
is ask questions where the answer is equally likely to be yes as

12
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:39,530
it is to be no. We want a question where half the time the

13
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:42,850
answer is yes and half the time the answer is no. If the

14
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:45,660
question isn't like that, so if it's a question where it's no more

15
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:48,800
often than it's yes, well then we could guess the answer is no

16
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,710
and be right more than half the time. So we're not getting a full

17
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:54,850
bit of information in the result, because we had a good chance

18
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:57,580
of being right without getting that answer. So we want to figure out

19
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:02,320
questions where the answer is equally likely to be yes. As it

20
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,620
is to be no. So we could ask that as our first

21
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:07,360
question. So we're going to ask, is the gold star in either the

22
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,770
green or the purple box? So the answer is yes if it's

23
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:13,530
in one of those two boxes. The answer is no if it's

24
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:17,570
in either the blue or the red box. So, there are four boxes.

25
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:18,960
For two of the boxes the answer is going to be

26
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,630
yes, so half the time the answer is yes. So that

27
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:26,140
means, we're gaining one full bit of information. If the answer

28
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:29,530
is yes, we've learned that it's in either the green or

29
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:33,330
the pop-, purple box. If the answer is no, we've learned

30
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:37,580
that it's in either the blue or the red box. And

31
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:39,390
so if the answer is yes, well now we need to

32
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:42,460
ask one more question. To figure out which box it's in.

33
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:44,590
And that could be, is it in the green box?

34
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:47,050
And so, if we ask that question, if the answer is

35
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:50,590
yes, well then we know it's in the green box. If

36
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:54,080
the answer is no, then we know it's in the purple

37
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:57,080
box. We only needed two questions to get to the right

38
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:59,830
box. And that's the same, if the answer was no to

39
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:02,660
this. Well then we can ask is it in the blue

40
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:07,600
box? That's a yes no question. If the answer is yes,

41
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,229
well then we know it's in the blue box.

42
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:11,000
If the answer is no, then we know that it's

43
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,530
in the red box. So now, we can cover

44
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:16,510
all four possible boxes. We didn't need three questions like

45
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:20,180
we did when we asked, is it in the green box, is it in the purple box, is it

46
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:22,100
in the blue box? We might have needed three

47
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,800
questions to determine the box, here we only needed two.
