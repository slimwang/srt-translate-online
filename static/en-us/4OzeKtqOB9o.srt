Welcome to CS256 mobile web development. We're here

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:06,640
to teach you to apply your web development skills

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,940
to this, and to this because as you're probably

4
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:11,790
aware the mobile web is kind of a big

5
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:15,530
deal. Most statistics project that mobile web usage will

6
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:18,370
soon over take desktop web usage, so you might

7
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:21,570
ask whats the difference between developing for the desktop

8
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:25,470
web and developing for the mobile web. Well mobile

9
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:28,360
web development is really just normal web development

10
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:31,380
with some additional key considerations and a few additional

11
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:34,080
API's. We're going to assume that you're familiar with

12
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:38,570
the building block HTML, CSS and javascript. The mobile

13
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:40,990
web is also built on these technologies, although

14
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:44,160
we are going to cover some specific advanced features that

15
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,140
apply to the mobile space. Of course, there are

16
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:50,420
a lot of additional considerations for developing for mobile.

17
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:53,730
Things like smaller screen sizes and limited network bandwidth

18
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:56,800
and computing power. Well you might think these constraints are

19
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,510
a bad thing. In fact, developing mobile first forces you

20
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:03,370
to focus on the key points of your user experience.
