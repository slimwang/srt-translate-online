1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:03,950
There's something else we need to talk
about before you start writing code.

2
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:07,110
Go ahead and download the starter code
project for my favorite movies and

3
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:09,240
then open up the info.plist file.

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:14,444
I believe it's located in
supporting files > info.plist.

5
00:00:14,444 --> 00:00:18,087
Remember how we had to modify
the info.plist file in the image

6
00:00:18,087 --> 00:00:18,935
request app?

7
00:00:18,935 --> 00:00:23,855
This accounted for
images that used HTTP instead of HTTPS.

8
00:00:23,855 --> 00:00:28,594
Well, as of now the movie database
also relies on HTTP to actually

9
00:00:28,594 --> 00:00:31,881
make some of its request for
images and such.

10
00:00:31,881 --> 00:00:35,941
And to adhere to Apple's ATS standards,
this just won't cut it, so

11
00:00:35,941 --> 00:00:38,955
we've made some changes
to the info.plist file.

12
00:00:40,455 --> 00:00:44,065
And we'll collapse out the at
transport security settings.

13
00:00:45,915 --> 00:00:48,426
And let's just collapse all these so
you can see everything.

14
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:54,814
Instead of allowing arbitrary loads,
like we did in the image request app,

15
00:00:54,814 --> 00:00:59,075
and remember, this looked like we'd
go here, allow arbitrary loads, yes.

16
00:00:59,075 --> 00:01:03,406
So this property, we've gotten rid of,
we don't need this property anymore.

17
00:01:03,406 --> 00:01:06,863
To do this, we've used
the exception domains dictionary,

18
00:01:06,863 --> 00:01:11,620
which in itself contains dictionaries
for each domain that the API uses.

19
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:12,830
And for each domain,

20
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:17,690
we can specify that we want to allow
it to use insecure HTTP loads.

21
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:20,910
Now I know some of these key value
pairs you haven't seen before, but

22
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:24,060
it's not really important that I
get into all of them right now.

23
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:28,750
The only one that I want to point
out is NSIncludesSubdomains.

24
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:31,710
This key provides a boolean that says
whether or not you want settings of

25
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:36,690
a domain, say like cloudfront.net
to apply to all of it's subdomains.

26
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:41,636
A subdomain is an extension to
a domain name that's used to organize

27
00:01:41,636 --> 00:01:43,301
resources together.

28
00:01:43,301 --> 00:01:46,640
For instance,
udacity.com is a domain, and

29
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,985
it has the subdomain review.udacity.com.

30
00:01:49,985 --> 00:01:53,856
On review.udacity.com,
you'll find webpages, images, and

31
00:01:53,856 --> 00:01:58,060
other resources that are related
to Udacity project reviews.

32
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:01,626
So if we were to set
NSIncludesSubdomains to yes for

33
00:02:01,626 --> 00:02:06,820
udacity.com in our info.plist file, that
means we'd want to extend any settings

34
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:12,002
of udacity.com to all its subdomains,
like review.udacity.com,

35
00:02:12,002 --> 00:02:16,050
discussions.udacity.com and any others.

36
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:19,190
I just wanted to make you aware that
these properties have been updated for

37
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:20,680
my favorite movies.

38
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,050
If you want to read more
about these properties,

39
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:26,850
the ones that you can use for ATS, I've
posted a link in the instructor notes.
