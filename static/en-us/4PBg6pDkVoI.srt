00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,972
iOS now includes a new system for
positioning UI elements on screen,

2
00:00:03,972 --> 00:00:05,107
called Auto Layout.

3
00:00:05,107 --> 00:00:09,891
You can think of Auto Layout as a simple
adaptive system to help iOS figure out

4
00:00:09,891 --> 00:00:14,100
how to size and
position your user interface element.

5
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:17,620
You can use it to ensure that
your UI elements are sized and

6
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:21,840
positioned correctly, from the smallest
iPhone to the largest iPad.

7
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:26,020
In this course, we're going to go
further in-depth on Auto Layout.

8
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:28,280
And in particular, constraints.

9
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:32,189
How to use constraints on user
interface elements and views.

10
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:33,940
Auto Layout is very powerful.

11
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:37,430
But it takes a little bit of practice
for it to become second nature.

12
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:39,320
Right now, you're just starting.

13
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,930
Remember, it's okay to be frustrated and

14
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:44,400
not to get it right on
the first few tries.

15
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,300
Keep on it.

16
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:49,310
And with very little time, you will
become comfortable with this powerful

17
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:53,050
and flexible system for
positioning and sizing UI elements.
