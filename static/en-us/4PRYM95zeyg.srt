In this lesson we'll talk about the why

2
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:06,510
and how of programming SDNs. Unfortunately programming OpenFlow is

3
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:09,310
not easy. It offers only a very low level

4
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:13,280
of abstraction in the form of match action rules.

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,710
The controller only sees events that switches don't know

6
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:18,320
how to handle. And there can be race conditions

7
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,270
if switch level rules are not installed properly, as

8
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:24,040
we've already seen in the lesson on consistent updates
