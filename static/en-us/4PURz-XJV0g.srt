1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Each of these things can cause more errors. The answer is all of them marked.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The poll being taken before the election can certainly affect its accuracy because

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
sentiments shift over time.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Some being under-represented in the samples.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Certainly, if voters who favor one candidate versus another are under or over-represented

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
that will change the results.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Similarly if we tend to have people who are more likely to vote

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
represented the same as those who are less likely to vote,

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
they're not being over-represented enough.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
So these two things ideally should be linked.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
And in a well-designed poll, they try to do this although it's hard to do this perfectly.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 99:59:59,999
And responses that differ of course will cause additional error.
