1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
For this exercise, I want you to solve this game.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
So it's a 2 x 2 zero-sum game.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
We're showing the utilities to the player Max, and so tell me what Max's strategy is

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
by putting in probabilities in these 2 boxes for his 2 plays--1 and 2.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Tell me what Min's strategy is by putting in probabilities in these boxes,

6
00:00:22,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and then tell me the value of the game, the expected utility to Max.
