1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:07,840
As like any e-commerce
company should do, we

2
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:14,147
constantly optimize the conversion rates
as we think about the purchase flow.

3
00:00:14,147 --> 00:00:20,290
In traditional e-commerce, when you
have a visitor come to your page, and

4
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:25,058
a visitor actually checking out, it's
just a really big drop-off anywhere from

5
00:00:25,058 --> 00:00:30,844
90% to 98% depending on
the e-commerce site.

6
00:00:30,844 --> 00:00:35,556
This is because there's a lot
of different barriers in

7
00:00:35,556 --> 00:00:40,720
that process as you're
trying to understand

8
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:44,250
what type of product do I want,
what type of color, what type of size,

9
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:48,260
now I have to put in all my address
information and payment information.

10
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:52,670
We constantly try to optimize
that experience to make it as

11
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:56,969
easy as possible and making it as few
clicks and things people are typing in.

12
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:05,420
An example of that was as we
are thinking about, we have

13
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:12,600
people coming into Teespring and they
have already purchased from us before.

14
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,150
What is a way we can make
that process easier for

15
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:20,980
them to actually be able to then import
all their previous address information?.

16
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:24,970
This was a feature which
we hadn't ever built prior.

17
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:31,290
As we looked at this, one of the things
that we really wanted to optimize for

18
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:36,640
was around speed and especially for
people on their devices,

19
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:44,081
like on their phones being able to type
in a lot of fields is really painful.

20
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:49,030
That's just one example of how
we tried to optimize for this,

21
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:53,720
is to say that if you're a buyer
who's come to Teespring before,

22
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:56,270
what are the different
ways that we can actually

23
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:59,180
import your previous information
into the checkout experience?
