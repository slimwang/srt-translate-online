00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,270
When dividing bases, we subtract the exponents. So we have 3 to the 2 minus 4 or

2
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:09,935
3 to the negative 2. This negative exponent moves the base of 3 to the

3
00:00:09,935 --> 00:00:15,187
denominator with the power of 2. So we'll have 1 over 3 squared or 1 9th. Here

4
00:00:15,187 --> 00:00:20,530
I'll subtract the exponents again, f to the 5 minus 8 or f to the negative 3. We

5
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:25,249
know this f will be moved to the denominator with a positive power. So 1 over f

6
00:00:25,249 --> 00:00:29,782
cubed. In both this first example and the second example, you want to think,

7
00:00:29,782 --> 00:00:34,538
where did you have the higher exponent? It was in the denominator. The 3 to the

8
00:00:34,538 --> 00:00:38,929
4th had the higher exponent than 3 squared. And f to the 8th had a larger

9
00:00:38,929 --> 00:00:43,732
exponent than f to the 5th. If we look at expanded form, we can see that the 3's

10
00:00:43,732 --> 00:00:48,394
will simplify, and we're left with 3 of the 2's in the denominator or 1 9th. The

11
00:00:48,394 --> 00:00:53,334
same is true with the f's. 5 of the f's simplify to 1, and then we're left with

12
00:00:53,334 --> 00:00:57,469
f cubed in the denominator. This should make sense. I have more f's in the

13
00:00:57,469 --> 00:01:01,964
denominator than I do in numerator. We use a similar resoaning to figure out the

14
00:01:01,964 --> 00:01:06,585
last one. We should have five more w's in the denominator than the numerator. So

15
00:01:06,585 --> 00:01:10,861
I know w to the 5th is that my denominator. Now I need to figure out the other

16
00:01:10,861 --> 00:01:14,888
two numbers, 8 divides into 16 and 40 so I'd be left with 2 5th. So I have 2

17
00:01:14,888 --> 00:01:19,090
divided by 5 times w to the 5th. There's my last fraction. I hope you found a

18
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:23,368
lot of different ways to make sense of these exponents. There's no one way or

19
00:01:23,368 --> 00:01:27,842
wrong way to figure them out. You can apply the properties of power or look at

20
00:01:27,842 --> 00:01:32,200
the expanded forms to get your answers. Just be sure that it's making sense

21
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,057
along the way.
