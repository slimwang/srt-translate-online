Physiologically, marijuana increases heart rate, bronchodilation, reddening of

2
00:00:05,789 --> 00:00:11,478
the eyes, and dryness of the throat and mouth. In addition, there's some

3
00:00:11,478 --> 00:00:15,894
perceptual changes such as difficulty estimating time, sometimes referred to as

4
00:00:15,894 --> 00:00:21,309
time expansion, verbal behavior decreases. Whereas there's an increase in

5
00:00:21,309 --> 00:00:26,496
nonverbal behaviors or interactions. Sometimes people report feeling giddy, but

00:00:26,496 --> 00:00:31,120
sometimes people also experience anxiety and its these users who report feeling

like will not return back to normal. Acute administration of marijuana can

8
00:00:37,166 --> 00:00:41,856
disrupt cognitive performance including slowed cognitive processing, impaired

9
00:00:41,856 --> 00:00:47,050
short term memory. Impaired inhibitory control. Loss of sustained

10
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:53,394
concentration. And impaired visuospatial processing. Medically, marijuana has

11
00:00:53,394 --> 00:00:59,140
been shown to be beneficial for some chronic pain, nausea, and anxiety.

12
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:03,361
However, medical acceptance of marijuana is still under debate. Now, let's go

00:01:03,361 --> 00:01:05,780
back to Susan for the last class of drugs we're going to be covering in this
