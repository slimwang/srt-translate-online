1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,509
So let's start again by looking at where ten and 16 fall in the distribution.

2
00:00:05,509 --> 00:00:11,019
Ten is three points less than the mean, and 16 is three points greater than the

3
00:00:11,019 --> 00:00:16,295
mean. So, if this is the mean, 13, this is ten, and here is 16. We're looking

4
00:00:16,295 --> 00:00:21,959
for the area in between those two. How might we figure this out? Well, what

5
00:00:21,959 --> 00:00:28,199
we'll do is, we'll find the area under 16, and then we'll subtract the area less

6
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:34,815
than ten. So what's the area less than 16? First, let's convert 16 to a z-score,

7
00:00:34,815 --> 00:00:41,137
16 minus 13 divided by 4.8. So this is 0.625. Since ten is equidistant from 13

8
00:00:41,137 --> 00:00:46,710
as 16 is, then the z-score for 10 is going to be negative 0.625. You can go

9
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:52,580
ahead and calculate that if you want. Sometimes that helps things make more

10
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:58,367
sense. So let's find the area less than a z-score of 0.625. We'll find 0.6 in

11
00:00:58,367 --> 00:01:03,823
the vertical column and we'll have to round to the hundredths place, since

12
00:01:03,823 --> 00:01:09,415
that's as detailed as the z-table gets. So we'll round to 0.63, so that's this

13
00:01:09,415 --> 00:01:15,920
column and we should get 0.7357. And then, we'll subtract the area less than

14
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:23,274
ten, which has a z-score of negative 0.625. So here is negative 0.6 and here is

15
00:01:23,274 --> 00:01:30,782
the column for 0.03, so the area less than negative 0.63 is 0.2643. Notice that

16
00:01:30,782 --> 00:01:37,737
since these are the same values, just one is positive and one is negative, then

17
00:01:37,737 --> 00:01:44,796
the area less than 0.625 plus the are less than 0.625 adds to one. So basically,

18
00:01:44,796 --> 00:01:52,211
this area here, plus this area here equals one. That's because the area here is

19
00:01:52,211 --> 00:01:59,121
equal to the area here. So, if you add 0.7357 and 0.2643, you should get one. So

20
00:01:59,121 --> 00:02:06,344
that's just a property of the symmetry of the normal distribution. So if we

21
00:02:06,344 --> 00:02:13,354
subtract them, we get 0.4714, and that's the area here in between 10 and 16.
