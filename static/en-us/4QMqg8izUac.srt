00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:04,840
This type of statistical analysis is prone to misinterpretation. As we

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:08,470
discussed in the last solution video, it's possible that those who were able to

3
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:11,935
view the musical lesson happened to be more engaged students already and we

4
00:00:11,935 --> 00:00:18,140
wrongly attributed the high mean engagement score to the song. Of course it's

5
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:22,838
unlikely we found the probability of getting that sample mean engagement score

6
00:00:22,838 --> 00:00:27,374
was about 0.007, but it's still possible to have randomly obtained a sample

7
00:00:27,374 --> 00:00:33,622
with that mean. But this means that one of four things can happen, here's a

8
00:00:33,622 --> 00:00:37,846
diagram that's no completely filled out, but it shows the four possible things

9
00:00:37,846 --> 00:00:43,676
that can happen. The columns represent the decision we made, we either rejected

10
00:00:43,676 --> 00:00:49,264
the null or retained the null, based on, the results of our sample. The state

11
00:00:49,264 --> 00:00:53,930
of the world is, what is actually happening. And we don't know what it is.

12
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:57,987
We're just making a guess. Either the null is true, that there is not any

13
00:00:57,987 --> 00:01:02,786
significant effect from the treatment, or the null is false. There is a

14
00:01:02,786 --> 00:01:08,422
significant effect. Each of these four boxes represents a different situation.

15
00:01:08,422 --> 00:01:13,578
The truth, and then the decision we made. In two of these four cases, we made

16
00:01:13,578 --> 00:01:17,604
the correct statistical decision, but in the other two, we made the wrong

17
00:01:17,604 --> 00:01:22,670
decision. Check the two cases in which we've made the wrong statistical

18
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:23,883
decision.
