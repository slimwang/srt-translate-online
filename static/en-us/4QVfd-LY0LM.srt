1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:00,950
To get the answer,

2
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:04,480
remember that you need to perform
a boolean matrix-vector product.

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:07,720
You'll focus on rows
corresponding to the frontier.

4
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:12,460
You'll mark an entry in u for any column
in which either entry 1 or 6 are set.

5
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:15,400
Here are those entries.

6
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,996
So, let's just scan the columns and
mark the right ones.
