00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,520
Time to take what you've learned, and
add some dependencies to a Gradle build.

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:05,900
Check out the exercise
in the course code.

3
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:09,080
Then, how long does it take to run
Gradle refresh dependencies for

4
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:10,840
the print dependencies task?

5
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:13,880
How about Gradle print dependencies
without the refresh dependencies

6
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:15,180
command line option?

7
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:16,640
Write the time it takes in these boxes.
