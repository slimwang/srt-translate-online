00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,727
I want to give you a taste of how materials can be represented in a more

2
00:00:02,727 --> 00:00:06,050
general way. You'll also learn a great term to impress your friends and

3
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:10,452
confound your enemies. Think about a surface and how it reflects light. The two

4
00:00:10,452 --> 00:00:13,098
variables we use are the light's incoming direction and the amount of light

5
00:00:13,098 --> 00:00:17,506
reflecting towards the eye. So at it's simplest, a material can be represented

6
00:00:17,506 --> 00:00:22,452
by this function,given a light and eye direction, give back an intensity. This

7
00:00:22,452 --> 00:00:25,990
function is called the BRDF which stands for Bidirectional Reflectance

8
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:30,732
Distribution Function. Let's look at that phrase. First, it's a function. The

9
00:00:30,732 --> 00:00:33,815
inputs are the light and the eye. The function depends on two directions so

10
00:00:33,815 --> 00:00:37,462
it's bidirectional. These directions are normally given with respect to the

11
00:00:37,462 --> 00:00:40,176
surface itself, that is, each vector is often given as two numbers, the

12
00:00:40,176 --> 00:00:44,719
altitude angle and the azimuth. The altitude is the angle away from the normal,

13
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,335
and the azimuth is the angle of the vector when projected onto the plain. The

14
00:00:48,335 --> 00:00:52,735
phrase reflectance distribution means how the light is spread. One simple

15
00:00:52,735 --> 00:00:56,047
example is a perfect mirror. The reflectance distribution in this case is that

16
00:00:56,047 --> 00:00:59,037
when the eyes direction is exactly equal to the lights reflection direction,

17
00:00:59,037 --> 00:01:03,412
all light is reflected towards the eye. Every other eye direction gets no

18
00:01:03,412 --> 00:01:07,062
light. Another basic distribution is diffuse reflection. For some given

19
00:01:07,062 --> 00:01:10,896
incoming light direction, the direction to the eye doesn't matter. That's the

20
00:01:10,896 --> 00:01:14,198
definition of diffuse reflection. Since this value is constant, diffuse is then

21
00:01:14,198 --> 00:01:18,259
represented by the surface of a hemisphere. Specular highlights are represented

22
00:01:18,259 --> 00:01:21,838
by lobes. This distribution represents a glossy surface, where light is

23
00:01:21,838 --> 00:01:25,767
reflected in a general direction. The lights direction determines where most of

24
00:01:25,767 --> 00:01:29,010
the lights energy is reflected. If the load gets wider, the specular

25
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:33,110
reflections spreads out. Written this way, our BRDF needs four numbers, two for

26
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:37,230
the light and two for the eye. But if you think about it, most materials really

27
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:41,580
only need three. These two altitude angles and this azimuth between them. For

28
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:45,713
example if you put a sheet of paper on a table top and rotate it. Both the

29
00:01:45,713 --> 00:01:48,898
light azimuth and eye azimuth angles change with respect to the paper, but the

30
00:01:48,898 --> 00:01:52,877
angle between the two remains the same. Most materials are fine with three

31
00:01:52,877 --> 00:01:53,520
numbers.
