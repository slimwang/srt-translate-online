Let's see if this summing of the logs of factors works for other factors, apart

2
00:00:04,035 --> 00:00:08,880
from just powers of 10. We've already seen these 2 logs before. I've just

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,656
written more decimal places out this time. We have log based 10 of 2, and log

4
00:00:13,656 --> 00:00:18,715
based 10 of 3. Note that both of these are still rounded numbers. Using these

5
00:00:18,715 --> 00:00:23,650
two values. What do you think log base 10 of 6 is? First I would like you to

6
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:25,946
make a guess and then I would like you to find the actual answer with a

7
00:00:25,946 --> 00:00:30,030
calculator. Please find both of these to to 5 decimal places.
