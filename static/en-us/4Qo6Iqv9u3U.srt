00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:03,670
David, which one of these do
you think are AI problems?

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:06,180
>> Science has said that all
of these are AI problems.

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:09,070
All of these are things that we
humans do on a fairly regular basis.

4
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:10,590
And if the goal of
artificial intelligence is

5
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:13,370
to recreate human intelligence,
then it seems like we need to be able

6
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:15,780
to design agents that can
do any of these things.

7
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:16,890
>> I agree.

8
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:19,560
In fact,
during this class we'll design AI agents

9
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,630
that can address each of these problems.

10
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:24,250
For now,
let us just focus on the first one.

11
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:27,070
How to design an AI agent that
can answer Jeopardy questions.
