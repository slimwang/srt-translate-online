00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:02,485
So in our last section, we talked a little about culture, language, and

2
00:00:02,485 --> 00:00:06,975
thought. And now, we're going to jump to focusing on thought in more detail.

3
00:00:06,975 --> 00:00:10,147
First we're going to begin by looking at thinking, reasoning, and decision

4
00:00:10,147 --> 00:00:14,648
making, but there's a couple words you should know before we start. So, here,

5
00:00:14,648 --> 00:00:18,400
we have "cognition". "Cognition" is the mental processes involved in acquiring,

6
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,310
processing, and storing knowledge. If you remember from lesson one, we talked

7
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:27,065
about cognitive psychology. Which is the study of how people perceive,

8
00:00:27,065 --> 00:00:31,060
remember, think, and solve problems. When you're at home on the couch relaxing,

9
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:33,876
thinking about a vacation you want to take, or of the great movies you saw last

10
00:00:33,876 --> 00:00:38,700
week, or even thinking about a new way to solve problems you may encounter.

11
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,908
What's happening? How are you able to do that? Did you ever stop to wonder

12
00:00:41,908 --> 00:00:44,858
about what was going in in the brain? That is, how do we use our brains to

13
00:00:44,858 --> 00:00:49,840
solve and maintain these mental processes? So thinking is our cognition.
