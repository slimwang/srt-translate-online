1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,280
So maybe this becomes
clear with an example so

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:05,080
we go back to the Pac-Man example,

3
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:09,990
at all times you want to eat ghosts, eat
dots, eat big dots, and avoid ghosts.

4
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:11,650
It's sort of all happening
at the same time.

5
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:17,490
It's just at any given point in time
one of them happens to be ascended.

6
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:19,820
>> Okay, yeah that example
makes more sense to me than

7
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:21,950
in the navigation example.

8
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:24,900
>> Sure, but I think conceptually
they're the same it's just it's easier

9
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:25,860
to think about it.

10
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:26,940
In fact we actually have a name for

11
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:30,808
these kind of things,
we call them predator-prey scenarios.

12
00:00:30,808 --> 00:00:32,188
>> Who's we?

13
00:00:32,188 --> 00:00:34,030
>> You and me.

14
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:36,947
So here-
>> No, no, no I don't call them that.

15
00:00:36,947 --> 00:00:41,368
>> Yes you do this is a pretty, yeah
well okay the literature is replete with

16
00:00:41,368 --> 00:00:44,133
examples of things called predator-prey.

17
00:00:44,133 --> 00:00:47,396
Where you basically want to go around
eating as much as you can, but

18
00:00:47,396 --> 00:00:49,683
there's some predator
who's trying to you.

19
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:51,577
So you're always trying to eat,
because you have to eat or

20
00:00:51,577 --> 00:00:53,340
otherwise you die of starvation.

21
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:56,120
But you have to avoid a predator
otherwise you die while the other one is

22
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,410
not dying of starvation.

23
00:00:57,410 --> 00:00:59,680
And Pac-Man is just
an example of predator-prey.

24
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,270
Right?
Pac-Man

25
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:01,649
needs to eat all of these things.

26
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:06,860
Meanwhile there are predators out
there trying to eat it and so

27
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:09,890
they're kind of competing goals
happening at the same time.

28
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:12,428
I need to eat,
I need to avoid being eaten.

29
00:01:12,428 --> 00:01:14,645
[BLANK_AUDIO]

30
00:01:14,645 --> 00:01:15,213
Right?
And

31
00:01:15,213 --> 00:01:16,693
all of these are really
examples of that,

32
00:01:16,693 --> 00:01:18,207
they even use the word eat and
avoid them.

33
00:01:18,207 --> 00:01:22,070
>> [LAUGH]
>> So I need to eat my food and

34
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:24,070
at the same time I need
to avoid being eaten.

35
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:27,320
And occasionally because I live
in a magical world where suddenly

36
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:32,040
rabbits become as big as wolves,
I can occasionally the wolf.

37
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,420
>> I see.

38
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:39,100
>> Right, but once you think about it
that way you can stop thinking about,

39
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:43,600
I mean, so I'm not trying to
make a gigantic point here.

40
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,060
Other than we can think about actions
as actions we're executing or

41
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:50,490
we can think about these options as
things that are accomplishing goals.

42
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:54,040
And this is where goal abstraction
comes from in my title here.

43
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:57,410
That really all of these options
are about accomplishing different goals,

44
00:01:57,410 --> 00:01:59,370
you're trying to always
accomplish those goals.

45
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:02,600
Some goals are more important
others at any given point in time.

46
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:07,370
And options in fact really make this
sort of nice to think about because

47
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:08,558
of beta.

48
00:02:08,558 --> 00:02:11,620
Because beta captures sort of
the probability that we might terminate

49
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:12,580
in a state.

50
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:16,870
From this sort of goal obstruction point
of view you could think about this as

51
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:21,000
either the probability that I've
succeeded in executing that option,

52
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,530
that is I have accomplished my goal.

53
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:26,130
Or that another goal has
become important and

54
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:29,830
I need to interrupt whatever goal I
was paying attention to at the time.

55
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:30,630
>> That makes sense.

56
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:31,130
>> Right.

57
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:36,185
So I like this notion of thinking about
options, or thinking about actions

58
00:02:36,185 --> 00:02:40,290
as always accomplishing goals and
always sort of happening in parallel.

59
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:43,460
Options are easier to think about than
primitive actions that way because

60
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:47,020
in fact when we define the options I
think we sort of naturally think of them

61
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:48,050
as accomplishing goals.

62
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:49,305
That's sort of the whole point.

63
00:02:49,305 --> 00:02:52,350
And primitive actions are sort of so
low level they don't really have,

64
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:55,210
other than primitive goals like
moving left or moving right, they

65
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:58,440
don't really have big high level things
that they're trying to accomplish.

66
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:01,374
But options almost always do, that's why
they're useful and that's why people

67
00:03:01,374 --> 00:03:05,150
tend to come up with the ones they tend
to come up with, so it seems to me.

68
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:08,210
And so we think about managing
goals then we actually end up

69
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:11,070
with a different way of
thinking about this problem.

70
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:15,230
And we move from a world where
we're worrying about sequencing and

71
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:18,988
hierarchical abstractions to a world
where we think about managing and

72
00:03:18,988 --> 00:03:20,925
arbitrating between goals.

73
00:03:20,925 --> 00:03:23,640
Yeah, so let me write down different
ways you might do that because

74
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:26,630
it turns out there's a whole
subfield that worries about

75
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:27,930
thinking about the problem this way.
