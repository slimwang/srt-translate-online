00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,758
Point B over here is a relative maximum, point D is a relative minimum, and

2
00:00:04,758 --> 00:00:09,670
point G is a global minimum. So, just think about what the words global and

3
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:14,724
relative mean here. Relative maximum, for example, when applied to a certain

4
00:00:14,724 --> 00:00:19,740
point on the curve implies that the y-coordinate or the output of that function

5
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:24,614
is higher than the values of the y-coordinates surrounding it. The opposite is

6
00:00:24,614 --> 00:00:28,481
true for relative minimum. Although the graphicals all the way down to negative

7
00:00:28,481 --> 00:00:31,953
infinity down here, there are other points where the graph gets to make the

8
00:00:31,953 --> 00:00:35,693
awesome transition from having a negative slope to making a positive slope.
