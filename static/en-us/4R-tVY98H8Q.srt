1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,600
So the goal of this lecture is to start,
for

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:06,550
us to start thinking about how we can
control the illumination in the scene.

3
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:08,700
So this was our projector system, and

4
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:11,770
using this I'll actually
showcase two different examples.

5
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:13,990
One, I'll actually talk
about the Lightstage,

6
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:18,830
where a light is shown on a subject
from these controllable light sources.

7
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:21,390
And, of course,
based on how this light are,

8
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:25,620
is illuminating the scene,
we can now create a model of

9
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:29,070
learning the illumination of this
person from different light sources.

10
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:31,600
And of course that will
allow us to do re-lighting.

11
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,760
Another example, that we've looked
at when we actually talked about

12
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:37,470
extracting depth
information from images,

13
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:41,320
was this concept of a trimensional
device on an iPhone, or

14
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:45,670
software for trimensional on an iPhone,
which let us basically take pictures

15
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:49,170
with different illuminations and
allowed us to capture a 3D model.

16
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:52,660
Let's look at them again just briefly
to help us understand the importance of

17
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:55,510
controllable light or
controllable illumination for

18
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:56,900
variety of applications.
