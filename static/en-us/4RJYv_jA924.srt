00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:04,505
Before we move on, let's get to know ETA squared a little bit more. Eta squared

2
00:00:04,505 --> 00:00:09,818
ranges from what to what? Write in the lower bound and the upper bound. I

00:00:09,818 --> 00:00:13,414
haven't taught you this, but intuitively by understanding what it is, you

4
00:00:13,414 --> 00:00:16,239
should be able to figure this out.
