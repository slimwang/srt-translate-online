1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,080
Fundamentally at the heart of calibration is this idea of

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,820
having some points whose three dimensional location in the world we know,

3
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:12,280
and that we identify them in an image.

4
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:14,880
That is, we can find the correspondence between this point in

5
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,640
the image is that point in the world.

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:21,320
And then we have to compute some sort of a mapping from a, a scene to the image.

7
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:24,848
And one thing you can do is you can actually put an object like this in

8
00:00:24,848 --> 00:00:27,061
the scene that has a bunch of points on it.

9
00:00:27,061 --> 00:00:31,005
And you've measured or you know something about the shape of that object and

10
00:00:31,005 --> 00:00:32,689
you know where all the points are.

11
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,548
Another way of doing it is to make use of, I mean, it's sort of the same math,

12
00:00:37,548 --> 00:00:40,020
but it's typically referred to as Resectioning.

13
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:43,461
Which I'm pretty sure is a term that came from photogrammetry,

14
00:00:43,461 --> 00:00:47,155
which is a science that predates computer vision by about a century,

15
00:00:47,155 --> 00:00:51,169
that talked about going between images and three dimensional world,

16
00:00:51,169 --> 00:00:55,310
typically used for mapping, cartography, and stuff like that.

17
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:58,710
So in Resectioning which is what we're going to do here.

18
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:01,590
The basic idea is we're going to have some known points.

19
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:04,530
So on the right here we have a picture of one of our labs.

20
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:08,990
And one of the times one of my colleagues was using a theodolite.

21
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:12,412
That's the thing that surveyors use in order to measure things out,

22
00:01:12,412 --> 00:01:14,690
you know, for property or houses.

23
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:16,650
And we set up the theodolite in the lab and

24
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:18,450
we established a world coordinate system.

25
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:20,329
And you'll notice we put down these markers.

26
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:24,980
These are actually sort of printouts of what surveyor marks look like.

27
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:29,050
And what we did was we measured the three dimensional location in the world,

28
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:32,920
with respect to this coordinate system, of those points, all right?

29
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:36,590
So what that does is that's going to give us a set of points, X, Y, Z.

30
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:39,850
And then of course, given an image like this one,

31
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:44,760
we can find the location of uv in that image.

32
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:50,580
Notice again that I'm using the homogenous version of the points.

33
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:51,380
Here I'm calling it w.

34
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:55,370
So this is w, u scaled by w v scaled by w, and that's w.

35
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:57,830
And this was that original equation.

36
00:01:57,830 --> 00:02:00,510
So clearly, given enough points in the world and

37
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:04,710
the image, I should be able to calibrate, recover the calibration matrix.

38
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:05,310
And here's how.
