1
00:00:00,146 --> 00:00:02,395
So, I’m now going to teach you a concept that

2
00:00:02,395 --> 00:00:05,830
is very deep, called the density of a probability.

3
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:08,647
And it’s kind of like a probability for continuous

4
00:00:08,647 --> 00:00:12,178
spaces but not exactly. It’s just a good motivator

5
00:00:12,178 --> 00:00:13,938
to think of a density as a – of a probability for

6
00:00:13,938 --> 00:00:16,011
continuous spaces. Let’s take the bottle

7
00:00:16,011 --> 00:00:18,933
example. We know that the outcome of turning

8
00:00:18,933 --> 00:00:23,363
the bottle lies between 0 and 360 degrees.

9
00:00:23,363 --> 00:00:25,636
So, given what we learnt, you want to assign

10
00:00:25,636 --> 00:00:27,915
0 to anything outside that range but inside

11
00:00:27,915 --> 00:00:32,900
this range, we’d love to give a value and say,

12
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:35,148
look, there is a function here that renders

13
00:00:35,148 --> 00:00:39,250
every outcome in this interval equally likely.

14
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:40,700
So, you’re going to construct this function for

15
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:42,762
So, you’re going to construct this function for c

16
00:00:42,762 --> 00:00:45,731
number one, each outcome in the range of 0

17
00:00:45,731 --> 00:00:48,323
to 360 has an equal value, and, constraint

18
00:00:48,323 --> 00:00:52,593
number two, the area under this function sums

19
00:00:52,593 --> 00:00:57,558
up or integrates to 1 which means this area

20
00:00:57,558 --> 00:01:00,576
over here is just 1. So, tell me what is this

21
00:01:00,576 --> 00:01:05,935
function for X’s that are between 0 and 360

22
00:01:05,935 --> 00:01:07,863
degrees. There is a single numerical value

23
00:01:07,863 --> 00:01:11,000
that goes in here and you have to guess it.
