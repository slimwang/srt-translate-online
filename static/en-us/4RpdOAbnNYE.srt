00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,160
Here I'm showing a simple 256 by 256 sample image.

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:09,424
And what we will do now is look at how we can apply various types of Gaussian,

3
00:00:09,424 --> 00:00:10,649
kernels to it.

4
00:00:10,649 --> 00:00:12,414
Let's start off with the most simplest one.

5
00:00:12,414 --> 00:00:18,568
Now here I'm using sigma of 1 pointed, kernel, round, and

6
00:00:18,568 --> 00:00:25,251
as you go away from the center, 0 0, it gets closer to, to being 0 values.

7
00:00:25,251 --> 00:00:30,240
The resulting image here is blurred, but not extremely blurred.

8
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,380
It's got a little bit of defocusing going on.

9
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:37,470
But as I increase the variance to sigma 3, you can start noticing more blurring.

10
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:42,110
Similarly as I move to sigma 6, even more blurring is visible.

11
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:46,772
And, finally moving all the way up here, we can basically sigma 9, and

12
00:00:46,772 --> 00:00:50,603
it's the most blurred image there is of the sequence here.

13
00:00:50,603 --> 00:00:54,909
And that's an important part for us to remember, that basically now by changing

14
00:00:54,909 --> 00:00:59,407
sigma, which is basically the variance, we've basically increased the extent of

15
00:00:59,407 --> 00:01:02,450
the smoothing from one point across the whole image.

16
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:04,607
And again the kernel here was different sizes.

17
00:01:04,607 --> 00:01:08,760
And we can play around with, of course, the neighborhood size of the kernel too.

18
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,740
So this basically now shows us we can use Gaussian Filters for smoothing.

19
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:15,010
It's something we will actually play around with a lot in the rest of

20
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:18,270
the lecture as we start getting into things like kernel filters and

21
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:18,870
stuff like that
