1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,220
As we said at the outside
of this course,

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:07,300
one of the promises of the adoption
of digital records by providers and

3
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:12,210
patients would be the availability of
huge quantities of new data from which

4
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:17,430
analysis could yield insights into how
to diagnose and treat patients better.

5
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:20,750
And even how to improve our
system of care delivery.

6
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:24,070
You've now seen early
examples of each of these.

7
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:26,960
There are still problems
with the data itself.

8
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,750
It is often noisy,
inconsistent, or even wrong.

9
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:33,070
Some patients may have
a rich data set for

10
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:37,700
a particular clinical concept,
while others may have no data at all.

11
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:40,730
The interoperability problems we've
stressed throughout the course

12
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:42,460
are still an impediment.

13
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:46,530
Finally, as we discussed with
Don Detmer, we may have gone too far

14
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:50,315
with patient privacy and
made it too hard to obtain the data

15
00:00:50,315 --> 00:00:55,095
that could make a valuable contribution
to health and healthcare delivery.

16
00:00:55,095 --> 00:00:56,945
The solutions are ahead of us.

17
00:00:56,945 --> 00:01:01,005
And it will continue to assure that
health informatics will be an exciting

18
00:01:01,005 --> 00:01:03,005
and dynamic field for years to come.
