1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,960
So, now the second thing to
know about humans, all right?

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:05,458
Human vision.

3
00:00:05,458 --> 00:00:09,422
Humans are much more sensitive to
changes in what's referred to as

4
00:00:09,422 --> 00:00:14,250
luminance, how bright something is than
they are sensitive to what color it is.

5
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:15,200
Now here's an example.

6
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,830
Now this example may work better or

7
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:19,130
worse depending upon how
your monitor is set.

8
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:21,090
So if you're not seeing
the illusion I'm about to show you,

9
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:22,590
play with your monitor.

10
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:27,230
Here's two images with text on them,
and in the top,

11
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:31,940
the background and the text are now, now
I'm going to have to change the color of

12
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:36,580
the pens, they're the same color, but
they're the different brightness.

13
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:38,442
Okay, different,
the technical term is luminance.

14
00:00:38,442 --> 00:00:39,260
All right?

15
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:42,090
And probably all of you have
no problem seeing that it

16
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:45,970
says text in color without intensity
differences, blah, blah, blah, fine.

17
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:49,680
On the bottom, actually on the Mac
monitor, I can hardly read it.

18
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,690
On this monitor, I can read it
just fine because it depends upon

19
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:55,320
how each monitor, and
we're going to talk about monitors and

20
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,470
gamuts in a little bit,
how they show it.

21
00:00:57,470 --> 00:01:02,175
But you could have adjusted
the color of the text in there so

22
00:01:02,175 --> 00:01:07,375
that the color became almost,
what's called isoilluminant.

23
00:01:07,375 --> 00:01:09,946
All right?
So the same amount of luminance, okay,

24
00:01:09,946 --> 00:01:13,842
but different color so you just
basically take the, the cyan there and

25
00:01:13,842 --> 00:01:15,708
just make it brighter or darker.

26
00:01:15,708 --> 00:01:19,602
Don't change its, what we're going to
learn is called the hue, the color, and

27
00:01:19,602 --> 00:01:21,470
you can make it go away, right?

28
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:24,753
So the bottom line is that
the human system is much

29
00:01:24,753 --> 00:01:28,208
better at dealing with
differences in luminance.

30
00:01:28,208 --> 00:01:31,258
So these phenomena, trike,
tri-stimulus color theory,

31
00:01:31,258 --> 00:01:35,443
difference in luminescence, this has
been luminescence, has been known for

32
00:01:35,443 --> 00:01:38,042
a very long time,
since the very early 1900s.

33
00:01:38,042 --> 00:01:41,465
So starting in the 1920s, people
started doing some what are called

34
00:01:41,465 --> 00:01:44,162
psycho-physics experiments
by psycho-physicists,

35
00:01:44,162 --> 00:01:47,489
because who else would do psycho-physics
besides psycho-physicists?

36
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,260
Of basically showing people
different kinds of stimuli and

37
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:52,370
asking them what they see.
