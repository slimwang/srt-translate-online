1
00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:05,330
Okay, so that's called the essential matrix.

2
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:07,689
And it's maps between calibrated systems.

3
00:00:07,689 --> 00:00:11,160
And what was really important about this whole operation is that we

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:15,740
converted the geometric constraint that we had talked about back in the stereo

5
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:19,450
days where we were talking about epipolar planes and, and looking for them.

6
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:22,990
We converted a geometric constraint into an algebraic constraint.

7
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:23,490
All right.

8
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:28,435
But, you ask, suppose I have uncalibrated cameras?

9
00:00:28,435 --> 00:00:33,010
Geometrically, thinking about, if you gave me enough points that you told me,

10
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:35,980
this point corresponds to that and this point correspond to that.

11
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:39,510
It feels like I should be able to figure out

12
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:42,460
how the epipolar lines are constrained.

13
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:46,720
So what I need to do is to somehow figure out the algebraic relation between

14
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:51,760
images, given those correspondences, and that algebraic relation will give us

15
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,860
the relation between a point in one image and its epipolar line in the ima,

16
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:59,400
in the other image, if you gave me enough correspondences.

17
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,560
That's what's called a fundamental matrix, and

18
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:02,850
that's what we'll do in the next lesson.
