00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,600
Welcome to unit 7. This unit will start with a brief summary of the course,

2
00:00:03,687 --> 00:00:07,350
recapping the major themes we've seen. Then the rest of the unit will be all fun

3
00:00:07,362 --> 00:00:10,975
field trips and interviews. We'll start by looking at the past of computing by

4
00:00:10,987 --> 00:00:14,700
visiting the computer history museum. Then we'll look at the present and how you

5
00:00:14,712 --> 00:00:18,450
can contribute by visiting SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, and talking to

6
00:00:18,462 --> 00:00:22,482
the folks at Mozilla and Benetech. Finally we'll get a glimpse into the future

7
00:00:22,494 --> 00:00:26,160
of computer by visiting UC Berkley and looking at what people there are doing

8
00:00:26,172 --> 00:00:29,992
research on. We'll start by summarizing the course, and I want to highlight the

9
00:00:30,004 --> 00:00:32,762
three main themes that I think are most important in computing.
