1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:00,940
Okay, for

2
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:06,440
book value, brand name doesn't count
because that's an intangible asset.

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:10,260
So we've got 10 airplanes at $10
million each, that's $100 million.

4
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:13,840
And we've got a $20
million loan liability.

5
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:17,540
That means the book value for
this company is $80 million.

6
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:21,040
Intrinsic value,
we calculated that before.

7
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:24,970
It's just $1 million divided by 5%.

8
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:27,470
The intrinsic value then is $20 million.

9
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:32,430
Finally, market capitalization, remember
that's just the number of shares

10
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:36,970
outstanding times the stock price and
in this case, that's $75 million.
