00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:04,219
>> So okay, so this is kind of a plastic material. You have sort of a, there's

2
00:00:04,219 --> 00:00:07,669
this guy who's kind of rubbery or, so what kind of materials are there? >> So

3
00:00:07,669 --> 00:00:11,479
there's lots of different kinds of 3D printing but right now you can almost

4
00:00:11,479 --> 00:00:14,996
three d print any material that you can think of. I've seen things that are

5
00:00:14,996 --> 00:00:18,196
bronze, we've done things out of different types of metals. >> All sorts of

6
00:00:18,196 --> 00:00:22,320
plastics. This one has a rubberized fading into a plastic texture. >> Hm. >>

7
00:00:22,321 --> 00:00:26,525
Which is kind of crazy, so this is all one print also. And it has the rubber

8
00:00:26,525 --> 00:00:31,694
going right into the hard clear plastic, which is pretty crazy. This was also

9
00:00:31,694 --> 00:00:36,902
designed in a super easy program called 123 3D design that I mean, children

10
00:00:36,902 --> 00:00:40,026
could do it. I mean, all the parts are in there native and you just stick them

11
00:00:40,026 --> 00:00:42,930
together and this is what you get out at the end. >> Uh-huh. >> You know, no

12
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:45,944
other time in history. >> Yeah right. >> Could you ever put something together

13
00:00:45,944 --> 00:00:47,300
this quickly that of this caliber.
