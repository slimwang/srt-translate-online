1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:04,919
This is going to be an improvement
upon our previous header design.

2
00:00:04,919 --> 00:00:08,118
We have a form of text and

3
00:00:08,118 --> 00:00:13,519
I want the text field to be all the same
size and they must also be aligned.

4
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:18,150
Seems pretty straight forward so
let's give it a try.

5
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:21,701
Let's layout the views first,

6
00:00:21,701 --> 00:00:26,794
now let's stack this stuff into
three horizontal StackViews and

7
00:00:26,794 --> 00:00:31,710
one StackView, a vertical
StackView that contains them all.

8
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:35,317
And let's give them names.

9
00:00:35,317 --> 00:00:37,786
[BLANK_AUDIO]

10
00:00:37,786 --> 00:00:43,920
And now we're going to pin this
header to these three sizes.

11
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,829
Top, left, and right.

12
00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:50,429
Not the bottom, otherwise it
would deform the StackView and

13
00:00:50,429 --> 00:00:50,979
we don't need that.

14
00:00:52,109 --> 00:00:53,390
Fix the misplacement.

15
00:00:55,829 --> 00:00:59,609
Okay so once again it doesn't
look exactly the way we want.

16
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:03,189
However, some of the issues
are easy to fix.

17
00:01:03,189 --> 00:01:06,109
We already know how to set a space here,

18
00:01:06,109 --> 00:01:11,450
a space here, here, and
here between the stack views.

19
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:14,560
And also, we know how to make

20
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:19,810
these StackViews stretch
all the way horizontally.

21
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:20,840
So let's do this first.

22
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,409
Change the alignment to fill.

23
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:29,011
Let's add some spacing, eight, and

24
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:33,046
I'll add some spacing to
these StackViews too.

25
00:01:33,046 --> 00:01:35,742
[BLANK_AUDIO]

26
00:01:35,742 --> 00:01:41,810
So internally it looks better but
it doesn't look exactly the way I want.

27
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:45,510
I want all of these text fields
to have the same size and

28
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:46,469
they should be aligned.

29
00:01:48,069 --> 00:01:52,319
So let's go back to your commandments
and see if we find one that matches.

30
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:56,559
Number one,
tweak the properties of the stack view.

31
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:56,939
No.

32
00:01:56,939 --> 00:02:01,450
The whole thing's about text views,
text fields.

33
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:05,159
Use another stack view,
that's number two.

34
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:06,579
No, not really.

35
00:02:06,579 --> 00:02:08,469
Commandment number three.

36
00:02:08,469 --> 00:02:11,504
Tweak the compression resistance or
at the hugging priority.

37
00:02:11,504 --> 00:02:12,694
Mm-hm.

38
00:02:12,694 --> 00:02:14,323
I don't think so.

39
00:02:14,324 --> 00:02:17,459
Add constraints to the stat view?

40
00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:18,389
Nope.

41
00:02:18,389 --> 00:02:20,371
Absolutely not.

42
00:02:20,371 --> 00:02:23,600
Add constraints to the views?

43
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,939
Close, but no cigar.

44
00:02:25,939 --> 00:02:31,169
Number six, to connect views
within different StackViews,

45
00:02:31,169 --> 00:02:33,149
use commandment number five.

46
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:34,580
This is the one.

47
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:37,620
What we need to do, is to relate views,

48
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:42,830
the text fields that are Within
different stack use.

49
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:46,260
So in that case we need
to use constraints.

50
00:02:46,259 --> 00:02:50,000
What you jump ahead and
a bunch of constraints,

51
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,188
let's think what we
are really looking for.

52
00:02:54,259 --> 00:02:57,819
We want the text fields to be
aligned and have the same size.

53
00:02:58,979 --> 00:03:01,199
There's another way of putting this.

54
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:04,539
A way that makes it easier for
the sec view to do it's job.

55
00:03:05,569 --> 00:03:06,219
Let me show you.

56
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:07,790
Editor.

57
00:03:09,659 --> 00:03:11,939
Show layout rectangles.

58
00:03:11,939 --> 00:03:13,729
What I really want.

59
00:03:13,729 --> 00:03:20,810
If the labels should have the same size,
the size of the biggest one, this one.

60
00:03:21,969 --> 00:03:25,199
The remaining space will
be given to the text field.

61
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:26,759
This is much better.

62
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:28,689
So lets go for it.

63
00:03:28,689 --> 00:03:35,400
Press Ctrl drag and
move here equal width.

64
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,930
And now same thing.

65
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:40,420
Ctrl drag equal width.

66
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:43,469
This is what we want.

67
00:03:43,469 --> 00:03:48,340
So the objective of this case study
is to practice connecting views

68
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:52,069
within different StackViews and
also understanding

69
00:03:52,069 --> 00:03:55,680
that there's more than one way
of doing things in auto layout.

70
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,849
Always strive for
the one that requires less constraints.
