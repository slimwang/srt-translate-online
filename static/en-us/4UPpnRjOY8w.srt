1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
We already look into the rate of change of the number of infectious persons.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:11,000
It was a constant times the number of infectious persons times the number of susceptible persons.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
If this is the number of persons per day that move from susceptible to infectious,

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
the same number has to get lost from the susceptible compartment.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
So the rate of change of the number of susceptible persons has to be minus the same quantity,

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and then there's the second effect mainly that people recover.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
We've already looked at that term.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
This is the increase of the number of recovered persons per time.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
If this number of persons is added to the recovered compartment each day,

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
we have to subtract it from the infectious compartment as well.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
We have to subtract it from the infectious compartment because these persons leave

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
the infectious compartment and join the recovered compartment.

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
This completes the equations of the SIR model. Obviously, this is a very rough model.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
In particular, as the numbers that we are dealing with here are not integer numbers,

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:10,000
in real life they should be say 1,000 or 1,000 at 1 or 1,000 at 2 persons, but with these equations,

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
we're dealing with say 1,000.1, 2 , 3, 4, 5 persons.

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
These equations can only make sense for large numbers of persons so that the fractional part

18
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
can be ignored, but if these numbers are large, the numerical constants that we're using here

19
00:01:26,000 --> 99:59:59,999
may for instance be used to model influenza.
