1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:02,880
Why didn't that work? We put n equals 1 in

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:04,540
our div parameter but when we checked for it in

3
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:07,790
our template, it was saying n does not equal 1.

4
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:11,230
Is it because n was modified going into the template? Is

5
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:14,200
it because jinja has a different notion of equality? Maybe

6
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:17,270
it evaluates double equals differently? Was it cause we have a

7
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:20,560
syntax error, or is it because n is a string,

8
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:25,340
but we're comparing it as an int. These are plausible situations,

9
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:28,270
see if you can figure out which is the cause of the

10
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:31,420
error in this particular case, because what we just did, should work.
