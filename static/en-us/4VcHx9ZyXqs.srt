00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:04,220
We can continue this problem solving process further and solve this guards and

2
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:08,830
prisoners problem. I'll not do that here, both because it will take a long time,

3
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:12,070
and because the entire picture will not fit into the screen. But

4
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:15,290
I would like you to do it yourself. And I want you to do it and

5
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:19,540
tell me how many moves does it take to move all the guards and

6
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:22,700
all the prisoners from one side to the other side of the river?

7
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:25,750
Once you are done. Once you have solved the problem and moved all the guards and

8
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:29,230
prisoners to the other side, write the number of moves here in this box.
