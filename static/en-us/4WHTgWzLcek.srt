00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,640
Traditionally, the standards
community often seeks standards for

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:04,930
virtually everything.

3
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:08,410
So it should not be surprising
that there is an HL7 standard for

4
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:11,000
developing HL7 standards.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,890
It's called the HL7 Development
Framework, or HDF for short, and

6
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:18,130
is diagrammatically shown here.

7
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:20,570
For the purposes of
this overview course,

8
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:23,010
it is sufficient to know that it exists.

9
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:25,840
And to be familiar with
these linked circles

00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,410
showing the standards
development process.
