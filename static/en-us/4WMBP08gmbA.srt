1
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:05,400
In the first lesson of this course I
will discuss some of the basic concepts

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:06,310
of web security.

3
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:09,480
Including the difference between
authentication and authorization, and

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:12,390
some of the related security
concerns that they address.

5
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:15,700
You will also learn the necessary
flow of information for all security.

6
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:17,610
And play with some of
Google's OAuth features

7
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:18,880
in the Google OAuth2 playground.

8
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:23,299
[SOUND] In lesson two we will go more in
depth on the different types of OAuth2

9
00:00:23,299 --> 00:00:27,436
options for clients and servers,
implement logins and logouts, and

10
00:00:27,436 --> 00:00:31,951
secure our menu pages for authenticated
users using Google Plus sign-in.

11
00:00:31,951 --> 00:00:34,563
[SOUND].

12
00:00:34,563 --> 00:00:37,240
In the third lesson you will
create a local permission system.

13
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:40,260
Protecting the data of each user
from being modified by other users.

14
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:44,992
[SOUND] And in lesson four, we will
explore other oauth2 providers such as

15
00:00:44,992 --> 00:00:49,437
Facebook and GitHub to allow multiple
sign in options for our users.

16
00:00:49,437 --> 00:00:53,800
[SOUND] [NOISE] To better understand
what you will be learning,

17
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:58,417
I would like to point out a few
similar topics that will be outside

18
00:00:58,417 --> 00:01:00,315
the scope of this course.

19
00:01:00,315 --> 00:01:04,430
Cybersecurity and cryptography are very
complex topics that form the foundation

20
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:05,330
of web security.

21
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:08,770
OAuth handles a lot of
this complexity for us.

22
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:11,650
Therefore, this course will
focus on implementation more so

23
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:13,719
than the mathematics and
theory behind this technology.

24
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:17,740
In a bit, we will see some of the
challenges of implementing your own web

25
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:20,980
security to better advocate the use
of trusted frameworks like OAuth 2.

26
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:24,940
In this course you will leverage
existing OAuth 2 providers

27
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:25,700
such as GitHub and

28
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:28,820
Google to allow users to securely
sign in to your web applications.

29
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:31,580
But we will not cover creating
your own OAuth 2 server.

30
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:35,200
If you're interested in more
details on these subject though,

31
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,430
