1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
At every point of our fluid we have a velocity, but also we have pressure.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Velocity has direction. Pressure doesn't.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Now let's try to find out how to incorporate pressure in our equations.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
To make things simple, we look at a one-dimensional situation--

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
a straight pipe filled with fluid.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Capital a is the cross-section area of that pipe.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Let's replace some amount of that fluid with the piston of width Δx,

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and let's assume that the pressure to the left of that piston is p₁

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
and the pressure to the right of that piston is p₂.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Then this force is proportional to the difference of those two pressures.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
If p₁, the pressure on the left, is larger than p₂, the pressure on the right,

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
the force is to the right.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
So we have to choose sides like that.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
The proportionality constant is simply the area.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
If you double the area, you double the force.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
If we say that this piston has a volume of v,

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
then the area, of course, is the volume of the piston divided by its width.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
If we want to use this as part of our differential equations, what should we be writing?

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
What's the force per volume?

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The partial derivative of pressure with respect to x?

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Minus the partial derivative of the pressure with respect to x?

22
00:01:18,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Half the partial derivative or the pressure divided by the square root of the area?
