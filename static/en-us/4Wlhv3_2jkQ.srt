>> Well, the inline script would block on CSS, so anything we can do to

00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:10,830
make the CSS faster would help. In fact, what if we just inline the CSS?

00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:13,220
>> Yeah, that would remove an extra request and that could definitely

00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:17,330
help. What about the JavaScript itself? Do you think it should block rendering?

00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:20,530
>> Now that you ask, I don't think so. It's reporting a visit

00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:23,500
to some analytic service and there's no reason for it to block rendering, right?
