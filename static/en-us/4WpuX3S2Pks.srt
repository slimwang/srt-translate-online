1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:04,975
And Java use packages to organize related classes. Now, everyone likes packages

2
00:00:04,975 --> 00:00:09,210
particularly on Christmas, but in Java, we, we use them all year long. Classes

3
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:12,750
that have one responsibility, get put in one package and classes with a

4
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:18,620
different responsibility, in a different one. For example, you've seen the

5
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:24,808
package called java.util quite a bit. It contains, various utility classes such

6
00:00:24,808 --> 00:00:30,687
as Scanner, ArrayList, Arrays, Random, and so on. That's one aspect of

7
00:00:30,687 --> 00:00:36,557
packages, to group related classes together. There's another useful aspect, the

8
00:00:36,557 --> 00:00:42,742
second aspect has to do with names. Unfortunately, in real life, names aren't

9
00:00:42,742 --> 00:00:46,512
always unique. There may be more than one person called Fred. And if you refer

10
00:00:46,512 --> 00:00:51,468
to Fred, they may all feel that they are the one. That's of course why last

11
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:57,724
names were invented. So that hopefully the first and last names are unique. Now

12
00:00:57,724 --> 00:01:00,556
with people that's no longer the case, but with packages and classes it

13
00:01:00,556 --> 00:01:07,130
actually is. A package name is intended to be unique around the entire world.

14
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:10,705
There's only 1 java.util package, and even though there may be other packages

15
00:01:10,705 --> 00:01:15,925
that have a scanner class, java.util.Scanner is unique. And you can actually

16
00:01:15,925 --> 00:01:23,210
reference in your programs, the scanner class as java.util.Scanner everywhere.

17
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:26,977
And say things like java.util.Scanner in equals new java.util.Scanner. That's a

18
00:01:26,977 --> 00:01:33,208
little tedious, of course, which is why the import statement was invented. When

19
00:01:33,208 --> 00:01:37,816
you say import java.util.Scanner, that means that from then on, you can drop

20
00:01:37,816 --> 00:01:44,366
the family name, and just use Scanner. These two statements then mean the exact

21
00:01:44,366 --> 00:01:48,687
same thing. This is the sole purpose of the import statement, to allow you to

22
00:01:48,687 --> 00:01:52,345
use only the class name, or the first name so to speak, without having to use

23
00:01:52,345 --> 00:02:00,138
the package name. Now let me show you, how to use packages in your own code. So

24
00:02:00,138 --> 00:02:03,804
let's suppose that you have a class that you want to put into a package. All

25
00:02:03,804 --> 00:02:07,516
you have to do, is put this statement starting with the word package, and then

26
00:02:07,516 --> 00:02:12,635
the name of the package, on the top of the source file. Package names are

27
00:02:12,635 --> 00:02:16,665
supposed to be unique, and most companies use their domain name written in

28
00:02:16,665 --> 00:02:23,200
reverse order. Such as com.udacity instead of udacity.com. Because domain names

29
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:27,148
are guaranteed to be unique. Maybe you have your own domain name. But if you're

30
00:02:27,148 --> 00:02:31,325
not. Udacity, in its infinite generosity, it will allow you to use theirs for

31
00:02:31,325 --> 00:02:36,068
the following exercises. Now, when you want to use this class, you do what

32
00:02:36,068 --> 00:02:40,659
you've always done, when you imported a class. You just use the import

33
00:02:40,659 --> 00:02:44,569
statement, and then you get to use the class in the normal way. Now Sara will

34
00:02:44,569 --> 00:02:50,598
practice this with you. And you get to reorganize the car pool classes.
