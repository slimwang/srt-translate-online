1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:02,780
>> So, these are the four steps that will help us

2
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:06,120
complete the task of Dorm Room Debbie going from being hungry,

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:09,790
to being satisfied with pizza. It's important that we start with

4
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:12,550
these high level steps, before we start thinking about any of

5
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:16,140
the details. As part of the wire framing process, we need

6
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:19,650
to remind ourself of our persona and their Use Cases. So

7
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:22,340
her Use Cases are, she's up late, and she wants pizza

8
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:25,700
right away. Or, it's been a long week, and she wants

9
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:26,750
to try something new and fun.

10
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:30,200
>> Now this is a mobile app so, regardless

11
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,850
of who the user is, we cannot the violate

12
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:34,610
the following mobile user constraints, such as limited data

13
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:37,910
and battery life, handedness, divided attention, and so on.

14
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:40,820
>> And the next step is our Feature List. The feature list

15
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:44,710
is driven by Dorm-Room Debbie's attributes and her use cases. Let's not

16
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:47,170
focus too much on how we're going to put these features in our

17
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:50,670
application just yet. But let's just look at them in a list.

18
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:50,890
>> Look

19
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:54,370
below in the instructor notes and you'll find a link to this prezi. Open

20
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:57,360
it up in the web browser and follow along for the rest of lesson.

21
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,610
>> And now we're going to dig a little bit deeper into the flow

22
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:03,230
of our app. So, we showed you the four high level steps, that we

23
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:06,880
need to go through to complete the task of Debbie going from hungry,

24
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:11,430
to being satisfied. Now let's jump into the flow for each of these steps.

25
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:13,160
>> So, here's step one. This is the screen that

26
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,920
a user sees when they first enter the application. And honestly,

27
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,370
there's only one of three things they could do. They can

28
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:21,430
build a brand new pizza, if they've never used the application before.

29
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:24,430
Or they can re-order a previous pizza, if they've used this app

30
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:27,750
before. And if they have a pizza that's already in order, they

31
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:30,890
can check its order status. So in order to begin we will

32
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:33,390
pick the first option, which is they're going to build a new pizza.

33
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:38,220
Step two is where the user is going to configure their pizza, and

34
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:41,100
make sure that it's exactly what they want by choosing the size,

35
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:45,190
the crust, the toppings side orders and so on. Now, if they don't want to

36
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:46,630
actually build the pizza, they can view

37
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:49,760
the daily specials and pick one of those.

38
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:53,260
>> And the third step is where they checkout and pay. If the user hasn't

39
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:54,920
already signed in, they'll do so here.

40
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,280
If they've already saved their payment and delivery

41
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,290
information, they can easily just skip through

42
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:01,520
those steps or they can enter it in.

43
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,830
Then they place their order. So if you've

44
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:06,200
used this application before, step three will be

45
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,060
really fast. All you have to do is click,

46
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:11,210
Place your Order. Once Debbie's placed her order, she'll

47
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:13,690
see the order status. And if she has a

48
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:16,230
question about her order, she can contact her driver.

49
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:19,690
>> So let's say that Debbie has placed an order for a pizza already,

50
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:22,950
that was a couple of days ago. She like the pizza. She likes the app.

51
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:26,769
She came back in. And now she wants to re-order the same thing again. This

52
00:02:26,769 --> 00:02:28,441
is where she would select option two,

53
00:02:28,441 --> 00:02:31,290
which is re-order a previous pizza. This flow

54
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:34,570
was actually really, really simple. She's probably signed in already.

55
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:36,970
If she hasn't, then she will be asked to sign

56
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:39,840
in. This might seem a little bit strange, but consider

57
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,910
the possibility that Debbie has more than one phone, or more

58
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:45,810
than Android device. She can have a tablet, multiple phones

59
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:48,550
and so on. Anyway, so if she signed in, then she'll

60
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:50,830
be able to see all the order history for previous

61
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:53,360
orders. And then select one, and place an order for you.

62
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,460
>> Now we're back to step three, which is check out pay. Because she's

63
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:58,420
already signed in, all she'll have to press is

64
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:00,690
Place order. And step four will be the same.
