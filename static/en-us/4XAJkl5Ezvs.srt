1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So now it's time for a quiz to see how well you understand lists.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Your goal is to define a variable with the name "stooges"

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
whose value is a list of the names of the Three Stooges.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
If you're rusty on who the Three Stooges were,

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
the names of the Three Stooges were Moe, Larry, and Curly.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
And remember that a list is ordered, so it's important

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
that those values are in the list in the correct order,

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
which is Moe first, Larry second, and Curly third.
