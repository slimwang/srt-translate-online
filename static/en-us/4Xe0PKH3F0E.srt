00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,200
I mentioned these concepts briefly
earlier in the lesson, but

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:05,900
it's worthwhile to explore
them in some more depth.

3
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:11,200
We say that two vectors are parallel if
one is a scalar multiple of the other.

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:17,065
So if v is a vector,
then v and 2v are parallel,

5
00:00:17,065 --> 00:00:22,240
as are v and one-half v,
as are v and -v.

6
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:27,520
In fact, since the 0 vector equals
0 times v, it follows that v and

7
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:29,690
the 0 vector are parallel too.

8
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:35,170
Also it's worth noting that v is
parallel to itself, since 1v=v.

9
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:39,010
Note that we consider two vectors to be
parallel even if they point in opposite

10
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:43,120
directions, such as
the case of the v and -v.

11
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:47,640
All that matters is that we can multiply
one by scalar to get the other.

12
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:52,740
In contrast, we say two vectors are
orthogonal if their dot product is 0.

13
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:58,920
Recall that if v dot w = 0,
then there are two possible cases.

14
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:03,070
Either one of the vectors v or
w is the 0 vector, or

15
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:05,910
else they're at right
angles to each other.

16
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:08,640
This is where we get
the terminology orthogonal.

17
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,360
Orthogonality is sometimes difficult
to imagine in higher dimensions, so

18
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:15,640
this algebraic definition comes
in handy when we lose our ability

19
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,460
to picture our vectors.

20
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:20,920
An interesting fact is that the 0
vector has the unique property

21
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:25,440
that it is parallel and
orthogonal to all other vectors.

22
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:30,190
In fact, the 0 vector is the only
vector that is orthogonal to itself.

23
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:33,135
To see why, suppose that v is a vector,

24
00:01:33,135 --> 00:01:38,370
some vector, maybe not 0, but it has the
property that it's orthogonal to itself.

25
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:41,070
That means that v dot v = 0.

26
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:45,480
But recall that v dot v equals
the magnitude of v squared.

27
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,520
So that means the magnitude
of v squared equals 0.

28
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:51,900
In turn,
that means that the magnitude of v = 0.

29
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:55,260
Since the 0 vector is the only
vector with 0 magnitude,

30
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:59,690
that means the 0 vector is the only
vector that v could possibly be.

31
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:03,920
So if some vector is orthogonal to
itself, it must be the 0 vector.
