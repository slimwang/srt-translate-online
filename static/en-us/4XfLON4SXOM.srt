1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:01,550
So here's how I did it.

2
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:05,270
This first part should
look pretty familiar, but

3
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:08,480
there's one new line, this right here.

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:13,012
I went ahead and return the response
from the second getJSON.

5
00:00:13,012 --> 00:00:16,280
This getJSON is getting
the URL of the first planet.

6
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:18,030
By returning it,

7
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:22,110
it will get past to the next .then
which happens to be right here.

8
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:26,000
When it receives the planetData,
it then creates a thumbnail with it.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,900
Before we go on, I want to show you
a slightly different syntax here.

10
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:33,545
Instead of an anonymous function,
I can actually just pass this function,

11
00:00:33,545 --> 00:00:37,290
createPlanetThumb, this function
will receive the same argument.

12
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:40,620
And as the argument that
the anonymous function was receiving

13
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:45,940
is the same one that createPlanetThumb
was receiving, this works totally fine.

14
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:49,009
I've also got two catches,
here and here.

15
00:00:49,009 --> 00:00:51,622
I've got this first one here
in case there is an error with

16
00:00:51,622 --> 00:00:53,030
the search results.

17
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:56,150
And I've got the second in
case anything else went wrong.

18
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:58,810
Your error handling strategy may
have looked slightly different and

19
00:00:58,810 --> 00:00:59,680
that's totally fine.

20
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:04,280
So the real question is
does this code work?

21
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,600
Let's see.

22
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,900
And it sure does.

23
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,960
Very, very cool.

24
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,990
Okay, but that's about as far as we can
go just by manually chaining vents.

25
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:15,000
It's time to make chains
a little bit more interesting.
