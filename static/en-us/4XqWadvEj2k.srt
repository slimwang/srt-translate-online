1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,240
So now let's talk about Markov Models.

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,970
And my apologies if you already
know what Markov Models are,

3
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:07,880
because we're going to go through this
a little bit, then move into HMMs and

4
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:09,360
maybe that'll be new for you.

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:13,770
And if it's not, you can just write in a
postcard telling me that you're unhappy.

6
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:15,130
Send it to Megan.

7
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:16,720
All right.
We're going to pretend for

8
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:21,480
the moment that weather, as in
the weather outside is a Markov Model.

9
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,770
And if it were,

10
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:25,910
I'll also pretend that there's only
three types of weather you could have.

11
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:28,880
You could have a sunny day,
a rainy day, or a snowy day.

12
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,540
It's kind of like a little kid's book.

13
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:34,580
And the Markov Model says
we have to specify, for

14
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:39,790
any given one of these,
what's the likely next day going to be?

15
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:44,080
So for example, suppose I tell you that
if it's sunny today there's an 80%

16
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,430
chance that it'll be sunny tomorrow,

17
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:48,850
15 that it'll be rainy,
5% that it'll be snowy.

18
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:50,170
Likewise if it's rainy,

19
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:53,240
I may tell you well there's a 60%
chance that it'll rain tomorrow,

20
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:57,340
if it's raining today there's only
a 2% chance that it'll be snowy.

21
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:01,170
So it's a place that gets very cold so,
so once it's rainy,

22
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:03,728
when it's rainy it's not going to
snow and vice versa maybe.

23
00:01:03,728 --> 00:01:09,920
And 38% of it will be sunny,
and likewise, if it's snowing

24
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,890
there's a 20% chance that it'll keep
snowing, 75% chance that it'll be sunny,

25
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:18,100
and for the same reason before,
very unlikely that it'll rain.

26
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:20,210
This is referred to as
a Markovian system.

27
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:24,320
And in particular, if the only thing
you need to know to make a prediction

28
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:29,170
about what the weather tomorrow will be,
is what the weather today is,

29
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:33,090
that's referred to as a 1st
Order Markovian System.

30
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:36,070
So I don't look at today, and
yesterday, and the day before.

31
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:39,400
I'm just looking at today in order
to make a prediction about tomorrow.

32
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:43,642
If I was looking at today and yesterday,
that would be a 2nd order Markovian.

33
00:01:43,642 --> 00:01:44,780
All right?

34
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:48,050
So the probability of moving, of being
in a particular state of getting to

35
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:51,640
a state, depends only on
the state I'm currently in.

36
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:55,310
In order to specify our Markovian Model
we need a couple of things, right?

37
00:01:55,310 --> 00:02:01,590
So, we need a set of states and these
are labeled here as S1, 2, through SN.

38
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:06,220
And those, the S's, those are, there's
state one, state two, state, that's not

39
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:09,160
a particular time, or particular day,
there's three different states.

40
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:12,140
So in this example, N would be three.

41
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:16,700
We also need transition probabilities,
and that's written as AIJ.

42
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:21,820
So that is the probability that
if you're in some state I,

43
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:24,490
that the next time you
would be in state J.

44
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:27,660
And then finally to kick things off,
we need a initial distribution.

45
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:31,040
That's just the probability that Q1, and
I'm going to talk about Q a little bit

46
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,590
more in a minute,
that Q1 is equal to Si.

47
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:39,670
So, Q sub t Is whatever state I'm at,
at time t.

48
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:44,810
So q sub 1 is the time, is the state
at the first day, or time one.

49
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:47,270
So for this particular example,
as I showed you here,

50
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:50,420
you've got three states,
sunny, rainy, and snowy.

51
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,460
We've got the state
transition probability.

52
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:57,680
So, this matrix A, that's
the encoding of all of these links,

53
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,040
of all of these transition values.

54
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:04,990
And then, I have an initial distribution
which just says well to start off with,

55
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:09,770
maybe, 70% chance that it's sunny,
25% chance that it's rainy and,

56
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:13,840
if my math is right 5% chance that
it starts out as being snowy.

57
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:19,520
So, given this Markovian Model,
you can ask certain questions.

58
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:23,680
For example, you could say
if I give you this series so

59
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,260
that's sunny, rainy,
rainy, rainy, snowy,

60
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:32,830
snowy, you could say what's
the probability of getting that series?

61
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:33,490
Okay.

62
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:34,980
Well you have all
the information you need.

63
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:38,490
In fact it's written down here below,
I've got A and pi, right.

64
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:42,660
It's just, the probability that
I start out sunny, that's here,

65
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:47,040
times the probability that it becomes
rainy given that it's sunny, so that

66
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,100
would be here, times the probability
of rainy given rainy which is there.

67
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:53,990
All the way through,
I just have to chain it through, right?

68
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:58,531
And when I multiply all those
number together, 0.7 times 0.125,

69
00:03:58,531 --> 00:04:02,154
times [INAUDIBLE] I get some number,
0.0001512.

70
00:04:02,154 --> 00:04:03,890
Okay.
They tend to be small numbers,

71
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:07,260
by the way, probabilities and
HMMs, or in, in market models,

72
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:10,920
because whenever I multiply a lot of
numbers that are probabilities together,

73
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,410
since all numbers that are probabilities
are less than or equal to one,

74
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:16,459
when I multiply a lot of them,
I get small numbers.

75
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:19,620
And when you implement these things,
you sometimes have to be careful and

76
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:22,550
do things like take the log but
that's all I'm going to say about that.

77
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:25,650
All right, so that's a Markov Model.
