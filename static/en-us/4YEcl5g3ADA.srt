00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,940
Okay, so, I just had you implement your own HTML escaping

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:07,040
function and then promptly showed you that you didn't actually have to

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,480
do that, because it was already built into Python. Well, the

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:12,520
exercise is important, because now you know what actually goes into the

5
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:15,710
escaping function that's built into Python. But you should probably use

6
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:19,400
the one that's built in, because it's been written by professionals and

7
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:22,460
seen by thousands of people and used in production, so it's probably

8
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:25,500
pretty safe. If you don't use the safe one, sometimes you can

9
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:29,770
run into trouble, like we did at Reddit once. So,

10
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:32,820
we had our own HTML escaping function, nearly identical to the

11
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:36,110
one you just wrote, except it had a few extra features

12
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:37,770
in it, because we had a few extra features in our

13
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:41,580
comment pages. Now we, at one point re-wrote this function in

14
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:44,225
C, from Python, because C is much faster and we needed

15
00:00:44,225 --> 00:00:48,790
that function to be particularly fast. Well, when we open-sourced Reddit,

16
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:51,330
we did a quick scan of our code for security holes,

17
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:54,080
and, we weren't too concerned about this because most of Reddit

18
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:57,580
is written in Python which is a fairly secure simple language.

19
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:01,040
C, that's not quite the same case. So, on the day

20
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:04,819
we open-sourced Reddit, somebody found a security hole in our HTML

21
00:01:04,819 --> 00:01:07,380
escaping function that we wrote in C. It was only like

22
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:10,570
20 lines, but within there, there was a hole. And, it

23
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:13,650
was super embarrassing. We fixed it right away, but it just

24
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:16,420
goes to show, you know, unless you have a really good excuse,

25
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:18,850
you should probably just use the built-in functions. Otherwise,

26
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:20,410
you're going to end up looking like dorks, like we did.
