00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:03,300
Okay, the same quiz but backwards. This time,

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:05,270
if we're visiting one of these domains in

3
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:08,720
our browser and the response from the server

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,810
gave us this header to set this cookie, which

5
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:13,230
of these domains are allowed to set this

6
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:15,708
cookie? And these are the same domains from

7
00:00:15,708 --> 00:00:20,617
before, udacity.com, ide.udacity.com, other.ide.udacity.com

8
00:00:20,617 --> 00:00:22,610
or other.udacity.com. And the

9
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:25,238
domain for the cookie is, of course, is ide.udacity.com.
