00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:04,320
So, let's take a look at some
DB-API code in the editor.

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:07,070
On the next page,
you'll see a short Python script that

3
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:09,980
fetches student records out
of our pretend database.

4
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:11,250
When you go to the next page,

5
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:14,630
try running that code as it
is with the test run button.

6
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:17,230
Then look through the results
printed out below.

7
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:20,030
This will give you some more idea
of what the various functions in

8
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:25,740
the DB-API do and of how the DB-API
returns data to your Python code.

9
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:28,910
When you're done with that,
I'd like you to make one change.

10
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:32,080
Make the script sort the student records
alphabetically by the students' name.
