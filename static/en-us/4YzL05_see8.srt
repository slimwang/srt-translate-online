00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
[Thrun] Well, the answer follows the exact same scheme as before,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
with S being replaced by not S.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
So this should be an easier question for you to answer.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:20,000
P of R given H and not S can be inverted by Bayes' rule to be as follows.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Once we apply Bayes' rule, as indicated over here where we swapped H to the left side

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
and R to the right side, you can observe that this value over here

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
can be readily found in the table.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
It's actually the 0.9 over there.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
This value over here, the raise is independent of the weather

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
by virtue of our Bayes network, so it's just 0.01.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:52,000
And as before, we apply total probability to the expression over here,

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
and we obtain off this quotient over here that these 2 expressions are the same.

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
P of H given not S, not R is the value over here,

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
and the 0.99 is the complement of probability of R taken from over here,

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:16,000
and that ends up to be 0.0833.

16
00:01:16,000 --> 99:59:59,999
This would have been the right answer.
