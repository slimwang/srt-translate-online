1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,930
Now since this is a variable length
array it will be compiled in C,

2
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:07,620
the length of the array len,
and the pointer,

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:11,896
the address where the actual
data structure is stored, val.

4
00:00:11,896 --> 00:00:13,640
Len is an integer.

5
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:15,310
So that is four bytes.

6
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:17,310
And val is an address.

7
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:21,440
And given that this is a 32 bit
machine val will also be four bytes.

8
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:24,950
To add to that,
the memory that's required for

9
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:28,760
five integers, that's four bytes each.

10
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:31,700
The total amount of memory is 28 bytes.
