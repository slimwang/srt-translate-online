00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
[Narrator] The answer is 0.32, and we're computing this using the conditional probability rule,

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
so that means we need the probability of A intersect B,

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
divided by the probability of B.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
In this case, B is the case where X is not A so that's 1 minus the probability where X is A,

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
which is equal to 0.92.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Since the probability that X is A is 8%.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
The intersection probability is the probability that X is a vowel intersected with the probability that X is not A.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:42,000
That's the probability for all the vowels other than A, which is adding 0.13 + 0.07 + 0.07 + 0.03,

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
and there we get 0.30, and when we do the division, we get 0.32,

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
and this makes sense.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Previously, we computed the probability that X is a vowel by itself with 0.38.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
If we know X is not A, we expect that probability to go down,

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
which is why we get the lower value 0.32 here.
