What if I try to code the removeMeanFriends method this way. What's wrong with

2
00:00:04,775 --> 00:00:07,869
this code? Sometimes it will not remove enough friends, sometimes it will

3
00:00:07,869 --> 00:00:10,578
remove too many friends, or sometimes an Index Out of Bounds exception will

4
00:00:10,578 --> 00:00:15,729
occur. As a hint, this condition means, this person is not in person i's

5
00:00:15,729 --> 00:00:20,185
friends list. This question is diffuclt. You don't have to get it right on the

6
00:00:20,185 --> 00:00:21,422
first try.
