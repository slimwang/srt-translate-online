1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,380
The world is awash in data.

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:06,320
It's growing in exponential rates.

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:11,520
People have even coined the term big
data to refer to this phenomenon,

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,670
but can't quite agree
on what that means.

5
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:18,810
What separates big data from what
I guess you could call everything

6
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:20,740
else little data.

7
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:26,960
Caesar Hidalgo at MIT's media lab says
that to qualify for this distinction,

8
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:32,450
data must be big in size,
resolution, and scope.

9
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:36,722
To reframe this idea in a way that is
directly relevant to transforming health

10
00:00:36,722 --> 00:00:40,360
care delivery systems,
data must represent many patients and

11
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:45,460
providers, must do so in great detail,
and must be combined with

12
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:50,460
other data to give a context within
which that care is delivered, and

13
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:55,630
the external rules and policies within
which that delivery system must operate.

14
00:00:55,630 --> 00:01:00,080
The data must, in summary,
be sufficient to represent the behavior

15
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:03,810
of the complex adaptive health
care system we've been discussing.

16
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:10,320
Where in the health IT landscape
might you best go to find big data

17
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,850
as we just defined it for health care?

18
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:16,160
Would that be in an enterprise EHR for
a major health system,

19
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:21,165
all the installations of a specific
EMR in a state or region,

20
00:01:21,165 --> 00:01:26,020
a service area health information
exchange, or none of these?
