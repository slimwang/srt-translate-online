Congratulations on making it this far in the class.

2
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:06,200
These next series of videos will cover two important topics,

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:08,370
interaction and animation.

4
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:11,700
I'll be showing you specific examples of how these ideas are played out in

5
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:12,850
narrative structures overall.

6
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:17,700
>> You'll see how D3 enables you to add both animation and

7
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:19,980
interaction to your visualizations.

8
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:23,150
And we'll really push the boundaries of what's possible by using

9
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:26,570
geographic features to create a map with D3.

10
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:29,530
>> But first, let's go through a few examples of how others have

11
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:33,150
used interaction to add additional depth to their visualizations, and

12
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:34,350
also tell a compelling narrative.
