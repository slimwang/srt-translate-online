1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:02,840
Now, suppose that instead of letting each thread

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:05,300
have its own local variable, we create a single

3
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:08,600
global variable for who's better. How does this change

4
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:12,140
affect the program's behavior? Will it create a compilation

5
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:14,420
error? Is it that a seg fault will occur

6
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:17,810
when the second thread accesses this global variable? Will

7
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:20,610
the threads eventually agree on who's better? Or, does

8
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:22,380
the behavior of the program not change at all?
