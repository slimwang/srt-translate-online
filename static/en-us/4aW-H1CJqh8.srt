All right, so we've added this label on our app, but

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:05,660
it is currently hidden at all times.

3
00:00:07,268 --> 00:00:10,300
We want you program our app such that when the user presses on

4
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:13,740
the microphone button, we want this label to show up in the correct place.

5
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:19,240
To do this we have to create something called an outlet.

6
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:24,170
Now, before we understand what outlet means in iOS, I have a question for you.

7
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:26,940
What comes to mind when I say the word outlet?
