00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,336
We know angle M and angle T are vertical angles, so they must be equal. T is 32

2
00:00:05,348 --> 00:00:10,803
degrees. This last part is a little trick. Maybe you saw it. This is a straight

3
00:00:10,815 --> 00:00:15,986
line. So, angles M and A are supplementary, they add to 180 degrees. Notice,

4
00:00:15,998 --> 00:00:21,514
angle A and T are also supplementary. They both add up to 180 degrees. This also

5
00:00:21,526 --> 00:00:26,538
is a result of the vertical angles. There's only one possible value for A. We

6
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:31,585
know supplementary angles add to 180 degrees. So, if I subtract off 32 degrees,

7
00:00:31,695 --> 00:00:36,221
I get angle A. So, angle A is 148 degrees. Angle H also shares this same

8
00:00:36,233 --> 00:00:41,218
supplementary relationships. So, it's forced to have the same value. Pretty

00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:42,388
interesting, huh?
