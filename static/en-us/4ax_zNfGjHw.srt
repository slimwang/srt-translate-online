1
00:00:00,267 --> 00:00:09,432
So the loaded coin example is clearly partially observable, and the reason is it is actually useful to have memory

2
00:00:09,433 --> 00:00:14,432
if you flip it more than one time, so you can learn more about what the actual probability is.

3
00:00:14,433 --> 00:00:20,332
Therefore, looking at the most recent coin flip is insufficient to make your choice.

4
00:00:20,333 --> 00:00:28,832
It is stochastic, because you flip a coin. It is not continuous because there's only one action, the flip,

5
00:00:28,833 --> 00:00:38,267
and two outcomes. And it isn't really adversarial because while you do a learning task, no adversary interferes.
