00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,145
The trick here was to identify the pattern. If we look at the total number of

2
00:00:04,157 --> 00:00:08,050
wiper blades that have been made at the end of any one of the days on this

3
00:00:08,061 --> 00:00:12,125
table, and then we look at how many have been made by the end of the next day,

4
00:00:12,222 --> 00:00:16,465
that is where we see the pattern. After the first day, there are 23, but after

5
00:00:16,477 --> 00:00:20,403
the second day, there are 46. The difference between 46 and 23 is 23.

6
00:00:20,403 --> 00:00:25,126
To get from 46 to 69, we have to add 23 again. And we do the same thing to get

7
00:00:25,138 --> 00:00:30,246
from 69 to 92. So, you can see that as each day goes by, we're adding 23 wiper

8
00:00:30,258 --> 00:00:35,266
blade sets to the total number of wiper blade sets that have been made. So,

9
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:40,925
logically, we do that again when we move from day 4 to day 5. This means we need

10
00:00:40,937 --> 00:00:46,558
to add 23 to 92 to get the number that belongs in the teal box. 92 plus 23 is

11
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:52,514
115. At the end of day 5, 115 wiper blade sets will have been produced in total.
