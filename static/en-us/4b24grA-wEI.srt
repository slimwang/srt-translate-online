1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:06,320
As I mentioned, the core of the doing
of this class are the problem sets.

2
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:07,779
It says 8.

3
00:00:07,779 --> 00:00:11,394
The first one is a very simple thing
just to make sure that you can get your

4
00:00:11,394 --> 00:00:15,080
images in, do some basic manipulation
of the pixels, and submit them.

5
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:18,530
It's a way of making sure the mechanics
of everything are working for you.

6
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:22,120
Then problem sets one through seven
are actually to implement a variety of

7
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:25,010
the algorithms that we talk
about sometimes some simplified

8
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:26,290
versions of them.

9
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:28,410
Apply them to imagery
that we'll give you and

10
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:29,930
see what sort of results you can get.

11
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:35,140
A quick thing also,
we'll be using Piazza.

12
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:39,410
Piazza is a social network thing for
academics.

13
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:40,160
I've been using this for

14
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,480
a couple of years now in my
class here at Georgia Tech.

15
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:44,670
Is a great way for

16
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:47,460
students to communicate about
whatever's bothering them.

17
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:48,363
Now what's bothering them?

18
00:00:48,363 --> 00:00:50,380
It's always the problem sets.

19
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:53,620
Every now and then it's the lecturer but
mostly it's the problem sets.

20
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:56,650
And you'll see, you know, Piazza used
and then all of the sudden the problem

21
00:00:56,650 --> 00:01:00,190
set is due and Piazza use goes like
this and then it goes like that.

22
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:03,679
So I encourage you strongly
to use the forums.

23
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:05,880
If you have a question,

24
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,580
almost certainly somebody else
has that same question too.

25
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:11,550
So go ahead and post it, and
somebody's going to say,

26
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:13,050
man I'm glad you asked that question.

27
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:17,059
Or, you may find they already asked
that question, and either or I or

28
00:01:17,059 --> 00:01:19,789
somebody else has already
answered that question.

29
00:01:19,789 --> 00:01:22,810
So I encourage you to
actively use that forum.

30
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:27,450
Whenever you have a sharing system
like this, people always say, well,

31
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:30,450
how much exactly are we
allowed to share?

32
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:35,360
And it's always a challenge, and
here's what I tell students.

33
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,200
Full blackboard or
whiteboard collaboration is fine.

34
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:41,830
So if you guys want to stand or talk to
each other in front of a whiteboard and

35
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:43,790
sketch out how the code works and

36
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:48,150
what you had to do and how you had to
change the parameters, that's great.

37
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:51,580
What I want you to do, though,
is write your own code.

38
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:55,790
So, if you're posting an answer to
Piazza, don't post big chunks of code,

39
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:59,040
because it's just going to be too
tempting for somebody to just take that.

40
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,840
Post sort of what you had to do.

41
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,070
If you don't write your own code,

42
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:08,070
you won't understand why it is that
certain things make things happen.

43
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:10,407
I every now and
then get a complaint from people,

44
00:02:10,407 --> 00:02:13,903
why is it that we're implementing
things that just exist in libraries?

45
00:02:13,903 --> 00:02:16,881
And the real answer is,
"so when it doesn't work,

46
00:02:16,881 --> 00:02:19,330
you'll know why." Because guess what?

47
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:23,590
It often won't work in the library
either or won't work as well.

48
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:26,580
And then you'll have no
understanding of what goes on.

49
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:29,910
So, yes some of what you will do
will say you're not allowed to use

50
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:31,500
now that function A, B or C.

51
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,440
We'll talk about that in a minute.

52
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,410
And it's not just because it's good for
your health right it's not

53
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:38,870
just like you're eating spinach,
it actually is important for

54
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:41,590
you to develop some understanding
as to how these algorithms work.

55
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,640
There will be a final exam.

56
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,380
It is not designed to be hard.

57
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:51,040
It is simply designed to force you to
go back and look at the material and

58
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:55,110
just for a second time get it into your
head, and it also allows us to ask some

59
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:58,010
questions about stuff that didn't
show up on the problem sets.

60
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:01,060
Normally when I give the exam
here it's a three-hour slot and

61
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:02,890
it takes people an hour.

62
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:06,990
But it just basically
covers the base material.

63
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:12,040
The grading, current rubric is
that 85% of the grade is based

64
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:16,380
upon the problem sets, which means 15%
of the grade is based upon the final,

65
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:18,480
and the other 10% of the grade
is based upon how I feel.
