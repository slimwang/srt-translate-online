00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,650
The most important field in a Snort
rule header is the action field.

2
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:09,300
It tells Snort what to do when it
finds a packet that matches the rule.

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:10,970
Here are the possible actions.

4
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:16,510
The last three are only applicable when
Snort is configured as an inline sensor.

5
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:20,730
To summarize, a Snort rule has
a header and multiple options.

6
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:25,890
Each option consists of an option
keyword which defines the option,

7
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:29,770
followed by arguments which
specify the details of the option.
