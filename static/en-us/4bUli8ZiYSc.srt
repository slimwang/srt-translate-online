00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,760
So let's wrap up with a quiz.

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:04,422
What techniques are computer
designers today using to build more

3
00:00:04,422 --> 00:00:06,010
power-efficient chips?

4
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:08,280
Having fewer more complex processors.

5
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:10,830
Having more or less complex processors.

6
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:13,370
Maximizing the speed of
the processor clock, or

7
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:15,890
increasing the complexity
of the control hardware.

8
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:17,210
Check the ones you think are correct.
