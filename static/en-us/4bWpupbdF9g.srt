1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:01,830
So here's a tiny little example, so

2
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:05,440
let' say we're in this state here that
we know has a self loop of plus five.

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:09,110
And the discount factor is 0.5.

4
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:10,030
>> Okay.

5
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:12,820
>> So what's the value of actually
going around this self loop over

6
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:13,490
and over again?

7
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:17,290
>> Five times 1 over 1 times 0.5, so 10.

8
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:19,510
Good, and let's say the Rmax is 10.

9
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:22,740
And we know that the only other action
that we can take from this state

10
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:26,160
goes to this state which
has only one action.

11
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,180
And it takes us to this state and
we have no idea what happens from there.

12
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:30,090
So what do we assume?

13
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:32,830
>> Well, we assume that you can
always stay there forever doing 10.

14
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:36,130
>> And the value of that
at this state would be 20.

15
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:37,350
>> Right, for the same reasons.

16
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:39,360
>> And the value of that
at this state would be 10.

17
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,980
And the value of this action
At this state would be five.

18
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:44,880
So from this state,
from this bottom state here.

19
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:49,490
Even if this has the maximum
possible reward in the self loop,

20
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:53,470
the most value we can get out of that,
from this state, is five.

21
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,150
So, double discounted, ten loop.

22
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:59,730
So that means that we know that
the optimal action from this state

23
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:01,460
is this plus 5.

24
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:04,790
It's going to be better than even the
best that could possibly be out there,

25
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:05,430
so we're good.

26
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:08,620
It might be lower, it could be that
this unknown thing is even lower, but

27
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:11,420
that only strengthens our case,
that we were doing the right thing.

28
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:14,940
So the point is that we can
actually be in a loop that

29
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:19,425
uncovers no new unknown edges, it never
visits something that we haven't seen.

30
00:01:19,425 --> 00:01:20,430
>> Mm-hm.

31
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:23,480
>> But we still are not making mistakes
and we know we're not making mistakes

32
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:28,140
because, if we're choosing this
path over something that uses these

33
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:32,295
optimistic estimates or
these optimistic assumptions.

34
00:01:32,295 --> 00:01:35,185
Then, we're doing at least as
well as the best we could do.

35
00:01:35,185 --> 00:01:35,835
>> Sure, I'll buy that.

36
00:01:35,835 --> 00:01:38,325
I mean, although, that takes advantage
of something that's always bothered me.

37
00:01:38,325 --> 00:01:40,655
>> What's that?
>> You set gamma to be one half right?

38
00:01:40,655 --> 00:01:44,545
>> Yeah, it could be bigger,
I just didn't want to do the math.

39
00:01:44,545 --> 00:01:45,095
>> No, I'm with you.

40
00:01:45,095 --> 00:01:46,865
So, you set gamma to
be equal to one half.

41
00:01:46,865 --> 00:01:48,695
And so, with the gamma one, that's true.

42
00:01:48,695 --> 00:01:52,215
But in reality, when we keep track of
whether an algorithm is doing well or

43
00:01:52,215 --> 00:01:54,815
not, we don't actually discount
the rewards that we see.

44
00:01:54,815 --> 00:01:56,010
We just add them up.

45
00:01:56,010 --> 00:02:01,560
So we are not going to go down
that philosophical rabbit hole.

46
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,830
We are going to accept
discount factors for now.

47
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:06,920
I agree with you that discount factors
are a little bit hard to swallow.

48
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:10,880
If we don't though,
I don't think we can make any progress.

49
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,730
>> No I agree.

50
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:12,630
It does make sense.

51
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:14,510
It just seemed like it
was worth mentioning.

52
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:18,510
That you have to take
the discount factors seriously.

53
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:21,310
That the future really is going to
be discounted from any given point

54
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:22,110
where you are.

55
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:25,290
Because otherwise, it actually
makes sense to get to that 10.

56
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:25,810
>> Yes.

57
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:27,460
Yes, you're absolutely right.

58
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:30,140
If we don't have a notion of
a discount or the discount is really,

59
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:32,820
really high, then it could be that

60
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:37,270
the highest this could be is going to
give us better than the repeated plus 5.

61
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:41,570
So yes, we are definitely leaning hard
on the notion of a discount factor.

62
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:42,070
>> Right.

63
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:45,450
And in fact, if the discount were 1 or
essentially 1 and

64
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:47,580
we know that our max is actually right.

65
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:49,510
Whatever our max is, is right.

66
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:57,360
You basically, unless you encounter
the actual self-loop, plus ten or Rmax.

67
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,710
Then you have to explore the entire MDP,
you must.

68
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:02,110
It'll just sort of force you to.

69
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:04,740
>> Well, okay, we'll do that
as step three of the analysis.

70
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:06,420
So let me finish this step two first.
