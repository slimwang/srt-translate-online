1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,553
We can understand the ranking that we're going to assign to this hand,

2
00:00:02,553 --> 00:00:05,833
by the way a Poker player would call out his hand,

3
00:00:05,833 --> 00:00:07,283
when asked to reveal it.

4
00:00:07,283 --> 00:00:10,280
So our player declares "Straight Flush, Jack high!"

5
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:12,811
That's all you have to know about the hand.

6
00:00:12,811 --> 00:00:15,159
A straight flush, the highest ranking,

7
00:00:15,159 --> 00:00:17,600
and then the tie-breaker.

8
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:22,135
All we have to know is that the Jack is the high card.

9
00:00:22,135 --> 00:00:25,267
So the number 8 stands for straight flush,

10
00:00:25,267 --> 00:00:27,811
and the number 11 stands for Jack,

11
00:00:27,811 --> 00:00:30,238
and that completely describes the hand.

12
00:00:30,238 --> 00:00:31,547
Here's another hand.

13
00:00:31,547 --> 00:00:33,911
Let's see what our player would declare for this hand.

14
00:00:33,911 --> 00:00:36,263
"Four Aces, and a Queen kicker!"

15
00:00:36,263 --> 00:00:40,994
So, four Aces is the major rank, which is a 7.

16
00:00:40,994 --> 00:00:44,073
Ace is card rank number 14,

17
00:00:44,073 --> 00:00:47,568
and the Queen is card rank number 12.

18
00:00:47,568 --> 00:00:49,479
So that's the complete description of the hand:

19
00:00:49,479 --> 00:00:51,390
<7, 14, 12>

20
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:52,824
Let's do another one. What's this hand?

21
00:00:52,824 --> 00:00:55,369
"Full house, eights over Kings."

22
00:00:55,369 --> 00:00:57,836
So even though a King is higher than the 8,

23
00:00:57,836 --> 00:01:00,483
The 8 is what counts more importantly,

24
00:01:00,483 --> 00:01:02,139
because there's three of them.

25
00:01:02,139 --> 00:01:05,269
So a full house is major ranking number 6,

26
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:08,793
then the 8 because there's three of them,

27
00:01:08,793 --> 00:01:10,666
then the King, which is 13.

28
00:01:10,666 --> 00:01:12,405
That's the remaining card.

29
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:15,219
That three element tuple completely describes this hand.

30
00:01:15,219 --> 00:01:17,684
Here's another hand. How do we declare this one?

31
00:01:17,684 --> 00:01:21,186
Our player has called "Flush 10, 8,"

32
00:01:21,186 --> 00:01:23,434
describing the two highest cards in his hand,

33
00:01:23,434 --> 00:01:25,737
because that's usually enough to distinguish the the hand

34
00:01:25,737 --> 00:01:27,921
from all other flushes that might be out there.

35
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:32,003
But in actuality we might need all the hands to break the ties.

36
00:01:32,003 --> 00:01:34,939
Now a flush is ranked number 5,

37
00:01:34,939 --> 00:01:37,174
and in order to break the ties,

38
00:01:37,174 --> 00:01:39,332
we look at all the cards in the hand.

39
00:01:39,332 --> 00:01:41,667
Highest first, and working all the way down.

40
00:01:41,667 --> 00:01:44,106
So something in there should be able to break the tie.

41
00:01:44,106 --> 00:01:48,665
Although, it certainly is possible, although unlikely,

42
00:01:48,665 --> 00:01:52,322
that somebody else has those five exact cards in another suit,

43
00:01:52,322 --> 00:01:54,303
and it actually would be a tie.

44
00:01:54,303 --> 00:01:56,052
There would be no tie-breaker.

45
00:01:56,052 --> 00:01:57,083
Let's look at this hand.

46
00:01:57,083 --> 00:01:59,539
Our player describes "Straight, Jack high."

47
00:01:59,539 --> 00:02:01,087
That's all he needs to say,

48
00:02:01,087 --> 00:02:02,389
because if it's a straight,

49
00:02:02,389 --> 00:02:04,235
if you know Jack is the high card,

50
00:02:04,235 --> 00:02:07,888
then you know the other cards have to be "10, 9, 8, 7."

51
00:02:07,888 --> 00:02:10,564
So we only need two numbers to describe this.

52
00:02:10,564 --> 00:02:14,527
4 meaning "straight," and then an 11 meaning "Jack."

53
00:02:14,527 --> 00:02:16,588
Next hand, "Three sevens!"

54
00:02:16,588 --> 00:02:18,797
Usually that's enough to disambiguate a hand,

55
00:02:18,797 --> 00:02:21,204
but if we really need to break the ties,

56
00:02:21,204 --> 00:02:24,423
then we would look at the next highest ranking card.

57
00:02:24,423 --> 00:02:26,346
Next is the 5, and then finally the 2.

58
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:28,268
So to describe the hand,

59
00:02:28,268 --> 00:02:31,489
we have the rank number, which is 3.

60
00:02:31,489 --> 00:02:33,538
Then the 7's,

61
00:02:33,538 --> 00:02:36,571
then the complete list of the five cards.

62
00:02:36,571 --> 00:02:39,972
Next hand "Two pairs, Jacks and Three's!"

63
00:02:39,972 --> 00:02:42,273
That describes most of the hand,

64
00:02:42,273 --> 00:02:44,638
but we also need to compare all the cards,

65
00:02:44,638 --> 00:02:46,151
including the two pairs,

66
00:02:46,151 --> 00:02:48,453
but it's the highest ranking pair, first.

67
00:02:48,453 --> 00:02:52,888
So first, the 2, meaning "two pairs."

68
00:02:52,888 --> 00:02:57,117
Then, the 11 for the Jack (the highest of the two pairs).

69
00:02:57,117 --> 00:03:00,765
Then, the 3 for the three's.

70
00:03:00,765 --> 00:03:03,100
And now we need the final card.

71
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:06,555
I happen to have all of the ranks standing around,

72
00:03:06,555 --> 00:03:10,224
so I use that as a stand-in for the final card.

73
00:03:10,224 --> 00:03:14,184
Either way, that fifth card can completely disambiguate the hands,

74
00:03:14,184 --> 00:03:16,399
if you happen to tie on the Jack's and the 3's.

75
00:03:16,399 --> 00:03:21,116
Here our player declares "Pair of two's, Jack high."

76
00:03:21,116 --> 00:03:23,405
That partially describes the hand.

77
00:03:23,405 --> 00:03:25,816
Notice we lost the exclamation point.

78
00:03:25,816 --> 00:03:28,003
He's not so excited about his hand this time.

79
00:03:28,003 --> 00:03:30,886
So a pair of two's, that's down to ranking number "1."

80
00:03:30,886 --> 00:03:34,150
Then the pair of two's is the first tie-breaker.

81
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:36,249
And then all of the cards in the hand.

82
00:03:36,249 --> 00:03:41,152
Our final hand, and our poor player declares "I got nothing."

83
00:03:41,152 --> 00:03:42,688
Now he's REALLY crying.

84
00:03:42,688 --> 00:03:45,604
But sometimes nobody else has anything either,

85
00:03:45,604 --> 00:03:49,252
and then we still have to decide among the players who have nothing, who wins.

86
00:03:49,252 --> 00:03:52,669
And we just go in order of the ranks of the cards.

87
00:03:52,669 --> 00:03:54,280
So "nothing" is 0.

88
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,545
And then the ranks of the cards

89
00:03:57,545 --> 00:04:01,000
from highest to lowest.
