1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:04,540
So what class would you think
keep is associated with?

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:07,000
Who's doing the keeping?

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,240
>> The pile is keeping parts.

4
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:13,920
The pile?

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,330
>> Well, it's keeping a pile.

6
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:18,260
Okay.
One way of answering the question is

7
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:19,529
who's doing the keeping here?

8
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:22,390
Okay, and in fact, its the system.

9
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:25,220
Its the solution that we're
building that's doing the keeping.

10
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:30,810
In general,
every system that you design,

11
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:36,566
you can think of the system itself
as a class, or an object in a class.

12
00:00:36,566 --> 00:00:41,148
But usually you don't explicitly
represent that system class

13
00:00:41,148 --> 00:00:42,708
in your class model.

14
00:00:42,708 --> 00:00:47,550
Okay, so in this case, what
the system is keeping is a pile, and

15
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:52,305
so we're not going to worry about
keeping an operation of one of

16
00:00:52,305 --> 00:00:54,388
the constituent classes.

17
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:58,138
It's an operation of the overall system,
okay?

18
00:00:58,138 --> 00:01:03,338
And now count,
what is it that is doing the counting?

19
00:01:05,257 --> 00:01:08,390
>> Counter is doing
the counting of leaves.

20
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:08,890
>> Okay.

21
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:17,610
And in the text, what does it say about
counted, in that first line at the end?

22
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,270
>> Have not been counted.

23
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:21,690
So-
>> So, the parts have not yet

24
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:22,320
been counted.

25
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,350
So, the operation is counting parts.

26
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:32,116
We can think of parts as being
an argument to the count's operation,

27
00:01:32,116 --> 00:01:38,780
and the counter, as Jared said,
is going to be doing the counting.

28
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:39,840
How about get and put?

29
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,050
We'll lump those together.

30
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:47,880
>> This seems similar to
the system is getting and putting-

31
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:48,680
>> Well-

32
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:54,060
>> We're getting trees.

33
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:57,480
Once again, the trees
are the arguments to the operation.

34
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:02,170
Getting and putting or
taking them off of the pile.

35
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:06,010
So we're going to get them from
the pile and put them on the pile.

36
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:06,590
So in this case,

37
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:09,889
we're going to associate those
operations with the pile class.

38
00:02:11,505 --> 00:02:12,750
Okay, how about is set to?

39
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,430
>> Is set to.

40
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:18,180
Leaves, count of the leaves is set to 0.

41
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,000
This seems to belong to the counter.

42
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,470
>> You're right on there.

43
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:22,670
Okay?

44
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:28,000
Take off is similar to get and
put, or taking it off of the pile.

45
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,583
>> How about examine?

46
00:02:33,583 --> 00:02:35,846
>> Take a tree off the pile.

47
00:02:35,846 --> 00:02:39,960
The pile could be examine it.

48
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,945
It seems like the pile and
the system are this overarching thing,

49
00:02:42,945 --> 00:02:46,122
like they're the ones
driving this operation.

50
00:02:46,122 --> 00:02:51,080
>> Well, the pile is going to be a part
of this system, but then again, so

51
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:51,718
is the counter.

52
00:02:51,718 --> 00:02:53,510
And the counter is not the pile.

53
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:56,420
>> It sounds like the counter's
actions though are usually

54
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:59,950
on behalf of an operation maybe that
started with what the pile was doing,

55
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:02,395
which is examining parts of trees.

56
00:03:02,395 --> 00:03:03,210
>> Okay.

57
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:08,500
And at this stage,
we're doing a static analysis.

58
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,390
The interplay of

59
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:17,165
the classes is more behavioral analysis,
which would come later.

60
00:03:17,165 --> 00:03:20,890
Okay, so you're right that that's
an important element of understanding

61
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:22,380
the intended system.

62
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:26,150
But as far as this initial analysis,
we're going to do it and look for

63
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:28,000
the structural elements
that are involved.

64
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:32,310
Okay, here should be an easy one.

65
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:33,870
How about increment?

66
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:34,740
>> Counter is increment.

67
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:37,850
>> Okay, so we need an operation
to increment the counter.

68
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:40,500
How about throw away, or throw?

69
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,160
>> Increment the leaf counter and
throw away the tree.

70
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:50,940
So the counter increments and
then throws away the tree?

71
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:53,130
So it could be the counter
that's throwing it away.

72
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:59,470
>> Well, a synonym for
throw might be delete.

73
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:01,443
Okay, and
we're deleting it from the pile.

74
00:04:01,443 --> 00:04:01,988
>> Correct.

75
00:04:01,988 --> 00:04:05,331
>> So there might be an operation
in the pile class for

76
00:04:05,331 --> 00:04:08,048
deleting or throwing away the element.

77
00:04:08,048 --> 00:04:09,310
Okay, how about splitting?

78
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:11,520
>> Splitting?

79
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:15,100
The pile splits trees into trees and
sub-trees?

80
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:17,250
>> I don't think that
the pile does any splitting.

81
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:21,130
>> The pile's looking
at the split sub-trees.

82
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:23,010
>> That's correct.

83
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:24,100
Or storing them.

84
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,421
>> Correct.

85
00:04:26,421 --> 00:04:27,950
Who is doing that?

86
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:29,615
>> The system?

87
00:04:29,615 --> 00:04:33,215
The-
>> So it's an operation, your splitting.

88
00:04:33,215 --> 00:04:38,200
Okay, who would you send instructions
to actually to do the split?

89
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:40,860
>> The tree.

90
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:41,744
>> The tree.
Okay, so

91
00:04:41,744 --> 00:04:43,750
we are going to have
an operation on a tree.

92
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:47,940
It says split thyself and
getting out two results from that.

93
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:48,650
How about display?

94
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:53,440
>> Display,
the counter's displaying its count.

95
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:53,960
>> Sure.

96
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,949
Okay, so you can see the back and

97
00:04:55,949 --> 00:04:59,500
forth in trying to understand
these things that goes on.

98
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:04,911
All the process we saw before of
combining words together, stemming and

99
00:05:04,911 --> 00:05:09,890
now trying to associate the various
operations with the classes.
