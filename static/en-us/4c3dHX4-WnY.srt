00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:02,670
Let's take the steps to
complete postToWatchList.

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:05,750
I'm going to start by
copying the code over

3
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:08,140
from postToFavorites since
they should be similar.

4
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:13,460
Now wait a minute, you may be thinking
to yourself, Jared's copying code again,

5
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:15,450
this means that we have duplication,

6
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:19,000
so should be abstracting this
away into something more elegant?

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,510
Well the answer's yes and no.

8
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:23,520
These methods do share some of the code
but it's really just indicative of

9
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:27,290
the fact that these two methods
use similar kinds of data.

10
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:30,780
Now think of it this way, if you're
going to abstract some of this code into

11
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:33,870
another method,
how often would that method be called?

12
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:37,140
Would it be reused as often as
something like task forget method or

13
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:39,240
would it only be called once?

14
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:42,170
This is the kind of thinking you're
going to have to do as a developer, and

15
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:44,200
that's the real beauty of design.

16
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:48,780
My advice would be to abstract away
functionality into methods as necessary,

17
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:50,510
but don't overdesign something.

18
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:52,450
You want to strike a balance.

19
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:54,150
Anyways, back to the code.

20
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:56,840
The first thing I need to change
is the method that's being used.

21
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:01,010
So in this case we want to
use the AccountID watchlist.

22
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:02,360
There we go.

23
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:05,800
Then I want to change the JSON body
to use the watch list key, and

24
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:08,052
the watch list value,
that's passed into this function.

25
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:10,910
There we go.

26
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:14,560
We'll also need to change over
the name of the completion handler.

27
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,720
And we may also want to
change our error string here.

28
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:20,100
Outside of this, the rest of
the code can remain the same.

29
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:22,030
So, lets give this one more run.

30
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:25,138
Click through to authenticate.

31
00:01:29,958 --> 00:01:33,040
I'll go to my watch list and
let's go to the Lego movie.

32
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:38,130
Now let me pull it off my watch list,
that looks like it's working.

33
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:40,656
It's no longer there,
and let's add it back.

34
00:01:44,788 --> 00:01:47,190
And I'll check our watch list.

35
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,810
And there it is.

36
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:51,800
If you've made it this far then
you're done with the Movie Manager.

37
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,750
Congratulations.
