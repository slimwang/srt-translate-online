00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Okay, the next thing I'd like you to do

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
is implement this function called build link index.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
What this is going to do is it's going to iterate over the list of links we have,

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
and it's going to return a dictionary

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
that maps a links ID as an integer

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
to the link itself.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
So just return that dictionary.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
All right, good luck.
