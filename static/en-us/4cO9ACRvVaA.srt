1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:01,690
Here's the answer.

2
00:00:01,690 --> 00:00:04,870
The process of filling out
the table was rather mechanical, so

3
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:05,850
I won't walk through that step.

4
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:12,650
We end up with a cost of 3.5, so
that must have come from this neighbor,

5
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:15,960
here, which also has a value of 3.5.

6
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:20,520
Diagonal steps like this correspond
to matching the two letters.

7
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,860
So we write down that alignment here.

8
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:27,790
Next we have 3.5, which could've come
from either these two neighbors here.

9
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:32,400
Let's choose this one for now,
that corresponds to leaving w unmatched.

10
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,850
So we'll write that
down in our alignment.

11
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:37,163
Next we have a cost of 2.5,

12
00:00:37,163 --> 00:00:42,380
which must have come from this north
west neighbor here, who has a cost one

13
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:46,380
and that corresponds to matching these
two characters together o and n.

14
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:51,950
Then we have a cost one which must have
come from this north west neighbor so

15
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:54,040
these ends get matched.

16
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,000
Again we have a cost of one and

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,120
since u doesn't match s this must
have come from the west neighbor.

18
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:06,530
Meaning that u is left unmatched and
we can write that down like so.

19
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:10,020
And, lastly,
the s's must be matched together.

20
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:12,810
Often there will be more than
one path through the grid.

21
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:16,920
In this example there was some
ambiguity at this step here.

22
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:20,728
Instead of skipping w,
I could have matched it with n and

23
00:01:20,728 --> 00:01:23,492
then we could have left the o unmatched.

24
00:01:23,492 --> 00:01:26,654
And that would of left us with
this alignment here which

25
00:01:26,654 --> 00:01:28,240
has the same minimum cost.
