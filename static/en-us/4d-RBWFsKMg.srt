>> We've done a lot so far. We know how to graph lines using tables, and using

2
00:00:03,673 --> 00:00:07,493
slope intercept form. Let's look at one last method. We're going to use x and

3
00:00:07,493 --> 00:00:11,143
y-intercepts to make our graph. And you might be wondering, why all these

4
00:00:11,143 --> 00:00:15,071
different methods? Well, some ways are easier than others, and you might find

5
00:00:15,071 --> 00:00:19,154
that graphing using the intercepts will be more quick than solving for y. This

6
00:00:19,154 --> 00:00:24,227
is one of those cases. So for this equation, what's the x-intercept, and what's

7
00:00:24,227 --> 00:00:27,077
the y-intercept? Put the coordinates here.
