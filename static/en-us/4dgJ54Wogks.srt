00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,730
Now, what are the between group and within group degrees of freedom? If you

2
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:08,628
forget, think about it logically. How many groups did we use when we calculated

3
00:00:08,628 --> 00:00:13,451
this sum of squares? And how many values did we use when we calculated this sum

4
00:00:13,451 --> 00:00:18,930
of squares? Then how much did we subtract from each one.
