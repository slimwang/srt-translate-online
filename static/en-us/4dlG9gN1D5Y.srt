A lot of people were having questions about YAML files.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
People had problems getting the YAML files configured correctly.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Could you go on to what exactly that is and what you need in it?

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Sure. To the extent that I can. I, like you, am also a little bit new to Goggle App Engine.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
A YAML file is just this configuration file that App Engine uses.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
It defines what the main file of your app is going to be.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Like what file is going to load first Python. What libraries need to be loaded.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
App Engine runs in this kind of sandbox situation. That might not be the right word.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
But basically libraries that you have installed on your system aren't necessarily accessible,

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
and libraries that ship with App Engine aren't necessarily accessible in App Engine

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
unless you tell the YAML file, "Hey I want to use this library."

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
This helps Google, presumably, deploy your code properly when they deploy it on their machines.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
So it's not a difficult piece of technology.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Basically, if you don't know, I would ask in the forums.

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I've been doing a lot of googling myself to get my YAML file in order.

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
That's sort of the nature of the business.

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Try to stay out of these configuration files as much as you can.

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
When we make my cut available, I'll include the YAML file that I've been using

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
which is very simple.

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I just based it on the "hello, world!" examples from the App Engine website. Okay.
