00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:04,019
Jess, you were trying to move all
this code around in the last video.

2
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:05,470
It was really hard for me to follow.

3
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:06,826
What was up with that?

4
00:00:06,826 --> 00:00:09,859
>> Okay, so with that, I wanted to
create a compact repeatable set of

5
00:00:09,859 --> 00:00:13,111
instructions that could repeat
multiple times, and then take that and

6
00:00:13,111 --> 00:00:14,700
put it into a loop in Java.

7
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:15,870
>> Wait, a loop?

8
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:16,540
>> Yeah, yeah.
So remember,

9
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:19,630
the loop allows you to execute
the same instruction over and

10
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:22,840
over again, until certain conditions are
met, and then you pop out of the loop.

11
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:26,567
>> Okay, so the instructions could be,
create a new text field and

12
00:00:26,567 --> 00:00:30,720
then display this string, and
then add this TextView to the ListView.

13
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,770
>> Yes, exactly, so we repeat
that same set of instructions for

14
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:35,110
every element in the list.

15
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:35,730
So for example,

16
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:38,930
we start with index zero, take that
value and display it as a TextView.

17
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:42,170
And then we do index one, take that
value and display it in the TextView.

18
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:45,260
And then we move up to index two, take
that value and display as a TextView.

19
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:47,430
>> Okay, I think we got it.

20
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:48,700
Okay, so then in the end,

21
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:52,660
you end up with a list of ten TextViews
that show the numbers one through ten.

22
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:53,670
>> Yeah, exactly.

23
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:54,170
>> Okay.
