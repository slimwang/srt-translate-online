1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,030
So to answer this question, let's look at each and one, each and

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:04,410
every one of them separately.

3
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:07,939
For example this one, if you notice there is no distinguishing mark here

4
00:00:07,939 --> 00:00:12,100
anywhere that would allow me to kind of find this repeatable, any point here,

5
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:14,460
here, here would actually have the same characteristics but

6
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:16,050
this is definitely not a good feature.

7
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:21,110
Similarly, here if this was the feature anywhere along this line, and

8
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:25,370
with rotation anywhere along this line or this line would also match this.

9
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:26,750
So this is not a very good feature.

10
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:28,160
It's not easily matchable.

11
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:32,770
This one, the feature is here, and any point along this line, or

12
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:36,420
for example, even with rotation, anywhere along this point, and

13
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:39,870
many other points on this image, this would match exactly.

14
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:41,290
Not a good feature.

15
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:42,270
Same problem here.

16
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:45,780
Basically it's got a line here, and anywhere on this point and with rotation

17
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:50,750
around here and here, this would of match as a feature, not a good feature.

18
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:54,010
This one, again, a line anywhere across this one or

19
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:59,890
on the other side here, would match all of this point here, not a good feature.

20
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:03,750
So, so far, we've gone gone ahead and negated out one, two, three,

21
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:06,220
four, five of these features.

22
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:08,700
Now, let's look for what would be good features.

23
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,430
Here is a point.

24
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:12,930
If you notice, this is a corner.

25
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:18,590
Which basically is rather unique and yes, exactly this corner with blue and

26
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:22,860
the kind of the beige color doesn't really repeat anywhere else.

27
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:25,510
This actually would make for a good feature.

28
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:30,910
This one also has kind of a corner information here.

29
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:34,630
And in fact maybe would be one of the ideal ones again because just by looking

30
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:39,170
at it, I don’t find this picture again, in this locality here, a good feature.

31
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:42,570
This one also has a bit of repeating pattern.

32
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:46,440
And again, a very unique corner makes for a good feature.

33
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,920
So these three are good.

34
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:53,540
These, one, two, three, four, five are bad features.

35
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:56,270
Let’s look into, in more detail of what’s going on here
