1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:03,617
With reflection mapping, we get sharp reflections. This is good as far as it

2
00:00:03,617 --> 00:00:08,295
goes, but many reflective surfaces are glossy. They're shiny but they're not

3
00:00:08,295 --> 00:00:12,470
mirror like, reflections are a bit blurred. One way to simulate this effect is

4
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:16,230
to blur the reflection map. This blurring is usually done in advance and the

5
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:19,840
texture stored. Some cleverness is needed to properly filter from face to face

6
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,815
of the cube map, but utilities exist that perform this function for you. Think

7
00:00:23,815 --> 00:00:27,360
about the Blinn-Phong specular reflection model for a moment. Blinn-Phong and

8
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:31,630
other reflection models work by taking the lights direction in eye direction.

9
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:34,668
They use these to decide at a point on a surface how much that point is likely

10
00:00:34,668 --> 00:00:39,282
to be a perfect mirror, whatever portion is a mirror reflects this light. In

11
00:00:39,282 --> 00:00:41,783
reality, much of the world most of the time is sending photons to any given

12
00:00:41,783 --> 00:00:45,936
point in space from many different directions. Look around and everything you

13
00:00:45,936 --> 00:00:48,792
can see is sending light your way. It doesn't matter if the light is from an

14
00:00:48,792 --> 00:00:52,280
emitter or a surface, except that emitters are usually brighter. What an

15
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:55,025
environment map does is treats the whole surrounding world as a source of

16
00:00:55,025 --> 00:00:59,528
light. While blurring an environment map is not entirely physically correct, it

17
00:00:59,528 --> 00:01:02,807
is extremely convincing. There is less of a problem of a reflection not

18
00:01:02,807 --> 00:01:05,226
matching up with what's in the environment, since you can't see a clear

19
00:01:05,226 --> 00:01:09,975
reflection on a burnished surface. Another advantage is that these blurry cube

20
00:01:09,975 --> 00:01:14,375
maps can be considerably smaller in size and still look good. For the two cube

21
00:01:14,375 --> 00:01:18,470
maps I showed, the original had faces that were 512 by 512 texels in size, the

22
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:23,590
blurred version only 128 by 128. A lower resolution is all that's needed since

23
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:27,298
the color changes more slowly. If you want a wider range of materials, you can

24
00:01:27,298 --> 00:01:30,004
blur the original reflection map by different amounts and get different gloss

25
00:01:30,004 --> 00:01:34,092
textures. You can also mix and match between sharp and blurred reflections on

26
00:01:34,092 --> 00:01:38,227
the same surface, giving an impression of a multi-coat material. Combining

27
00:01:38,227 --> 00:01:41,108
these ideas with different reflectivities, illumination models, and surface

28
00:01:41,108 --> 00:01:43,360
colors can give a wide range of effects.
