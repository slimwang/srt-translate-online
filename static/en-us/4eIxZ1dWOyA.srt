00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,870
It turns out that when we add, subtract, multiply or divide, we can do it to

2
00:00:03,882 --> 00:00:08,032
both sides of the scale. This also works for equations. These properties have a

3
00:00:08,044 --> 00:00:12,005
special name, and they're called the properties of equality. Let's use these

4
00:00:12,017 --> 00:00:16,091
properties of equality to solve a more challenging problem. We know equations

5
00:00:16,104 --> 00:00:20,357
work like scales, so when we write an equation, we know the side on the left, or

6
00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:24,489
that value, matches the value on the right. Equations work just like scales.

7
00:00:24,587 --> 00:00:28,807
We're saying that this number, or this value on the left, is the same as this

8
00:00:28,819 --> 00:00:33,222
number, or the value on the right. So, using what you know about the properties

9
00:00:33,234 --> 00:00:37,576
of equality, what do you think the unknown weight m is? Can you find it's value?
