1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:05,118
We need multiply the first fraction by x plus 6 divided by x plus 6. We know

2
00:00:05,118 --> 00:00:09,712
that because this denominator is missing a factor of x plus 6. If we multiply

3
00:00:09,712 --> 00:00:14,327
the numerator and the denominator by x plus 6, we're multiplying by a form of 1,

4
00:00:14,327 --> 00:00:19,084
and we changed this denominator into our lowest common denominator. For the

5
00:00:19,084 --> 00:00:24,248
second fraction we need to multiply by x plus 2 divided by x plus 2. This

6
00:00:24,248 --> 00:00:29,345
denominator is missing our factor of x plus 2 to form the LCD. If you got these

7
00:00:29,345 --> 00:00:31,333
correct, excellent thinking.
