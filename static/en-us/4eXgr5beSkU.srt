00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,838
Okay just a couple of helpful tips, to reiterate the one

2
00:00:02,838 --> 00:00:06,078
I just gave you before is, always automatically escape variables when

3
00:00:06,078 --> 00:00:08,990
possible. Not every template language will allow you to do so,

4
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:11,590
but always give it a look. Jinja certainly allows you do to

5
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:14,230
so. So in this class you should definitely do that. Next

6
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:18,140
is, minimize the code that you include in templates. What I've showed

7
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:21,740
you so far is statements and foreloops. That's about it. Jinja

8
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:25,700
will allow you to put almost, like arbitrary Python into your templates.

9
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:27,820
But, you remember the whole reason we're using templates

10
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:29,480
in the first place is, so we don't have to

11
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:35,570
have HTML in our code, likewise we don't have code

12
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:38,560
in our HTML. Because it makes it very difficult to,

13
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,980
to modify, to edit, to debug, all those things.

14
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:44,090
It's a total pain. So, and of course, the inverse

15
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:47,520
of this is minimize your HTML in code. I generally,

16
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,940
I have a rule generally, where we have zero HTML

17
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:54,360
in our code. Even if it's a little one-line thing,

18
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,730
we put it in a template. That way all your HTML

19
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:59,340
is in one place, all your code is in one place,

20
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:01,810
and you don't, your not using the wrong tool for the

21
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:04,910
job. Which inevitably will bite you down the road as

22
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:08,950
your projects get more complex. Those are just some things you

23
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:11,060
know, these aren't hard and fast rules but these are things

24
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:13,850
that I've found that have served me well over the years.
