1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,200
Now that we have shown clique to be NP-complete,

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:05,290
we can easily say that independent set is NP-complete

3
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:09,010
because we can transform a graph for which you want to solve clique

4
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:12,780
easily into a graph on which you can solve independent set,

5
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:15,340
and then that will give you a solution for clique.

6
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:19,810
So we already have that reduction down here, which of course will make Carol quite unhappy.

7
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:24,760
And we also had the reduction from independent set to vertex cover

8
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:28,110
because we showed that solving vertex cover on the graph

9
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:31,480
is basically the same thing as solving independent set.

10
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,890
So vertex cover is also NP-complete.

11
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:35,890
So Alice is now unhappy as well.

12
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:38,060
And what this means is the following:

13
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:43,480
The problems that Alice, Bob, and Carol are trying to solve

14
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:47,760
are as hard as any problem in NP can become.

15
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,180
Any problem that you can solve in polynomial time,

16
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:57,380
if you have had this magic "if-better" function available, would also be solvable

17
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:03,340
in polynomial time if we found a polynomial-time algorithm for any of their problems.

18
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:08,300
Or even, in other words, if you found a polynomial-time algorithm for vertex cover,

19
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:14,270
independent set, clique or SAT, what this would mean is that you have found a way

20
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:19,380
to simulate the if-better function in polynomial time.

21
00:01:19,380 --> 99:59:59,999
You can simulate a nondeterministic RAM on a deterministic RAM in polynomial time.
