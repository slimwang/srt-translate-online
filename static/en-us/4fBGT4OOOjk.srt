00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,540
When you're logging a message in your app, you need

2
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:06,100
to determine what log level it should be displayed at.

3
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:08,710
Verbose logs should never be compiled into your app, except

4
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:12,600
during development. Debug logs are compiled in, but they're stripped

5
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:16,210
out at run time. Error, warn, and info logs are

6
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:19,650
all kept. And this is what the logging API looks

7
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:23,100
like. The first parameter is the log tag, which can

8
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:26,320
be any string that you want to identify the log message.

9
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,790
It's good practice to define the log tag as a

10
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:32,009
constant in your class. Usually it's the name of your class

11
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:35,060
or the app. The second parameter is the actual log

12
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:38,380
message. If we go back to monitor, we can see that

13
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:40,840
this is the log tag column and this is where

14
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:44,330
the log message is. If you click on this drop down

15
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:47,710
here you can filter the logs by log level. For example

16
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:50,600
you can click on Error to see all the error messages.

17
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:54,060
If you click on warn, you'll see all the warning

18
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:57,500
messages as well as anything more severe than that. The

19
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:00,550
same goes for the other levels. And verbose means that

20
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:03,130
you can see all the logs at all log levels.

21
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:08,650
As a PROTIP, you should avoid log spam for your sake and

22
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:13,400
the sake of other developers. The log buffer could fill up and important

23
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:16,500
error messages that you really need to see will either roll of the

24
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:20,780
logs or it will get lost in the sea of unimportant log messages.
