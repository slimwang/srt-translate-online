00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,121
Remember, we want to be able to go between decimals and percents. All right here

2
00:00:04,133 --> 00:00:08,236
are some percents, and here are some decimals. For this quiz, I want you to fill

3
00:00:08,248 --> 00:00:12,170
in the boxes with the appropriate decimal or percent. You'll need to convert

4
00:00:12,182 --> 00:00:15,930
either to a decimal or to a percent. And again with the percent, don't worry

5
00:00:15,942 --> 00:00:19,889
about entering percent. I've already done it for you. Just enter the numbers.
