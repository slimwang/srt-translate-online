Now, our critical regions are both here and here, not just in one tail. If we

2
00:00:05,458 --> 00:00:09,478
use this alpha level and do a two tailed test to see if getting this sample

00:00:09,478 --> 00:00:15,672
mean is likely or unlikely, what can we say? Can we say it is unlikely to have

4
00:00:15,672 --> 00:00:21,953
gotten a mean engagement score of 7.13? A mean engagement of 7.13 does not fall

00:00:21,953 --> 00:00:27,761
in critical region. There is evidence that my singing made students less

6
00:00:27,761 --> 00:00:33,260
engaged or a mean engagement score of 7.13 is significant at probability less

00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:35,673
that 0.05.
