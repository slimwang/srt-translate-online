1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,450
As much as I wish this would work,

2
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:05,950
because it would make performance optimization so much easier.

3
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:08,460
The actual answer is the second one.

4
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:11,460
Knockout will update the changed data in the view,

5
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:13,630
rather than re-rendering everything.

6
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:17,810
This means if you only change one little part of your array,

7
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:21,160
Knockout will know that only that piece has changed, and

8
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:24,260
it won't have to re-render the entire view.

9
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:25,380
Only the part that changed.
