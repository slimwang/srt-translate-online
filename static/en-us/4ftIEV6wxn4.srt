1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,249
So, Lauren just mentioned that depression is a very common symptom of war

2
00:00:03,249 --> 00:00:08,102
veterans. So, let's move on now, and talk about major depressive disorder. But

3
00:00:08,102 --> 00:00:12,662
before we do so, remember that there's a continuum in all disorders. So from

4
00:00:12,662 --> 00:00:17,025
the everyday fluctuations to the disordered. Same is true for depression. In

5
00:00:17,025 --> 00:00:20,275
fact, think also about what's happened in your own life when something bad has

6
00:00:20,275 --> 00:00:24,754
happened. maybe you failed an exam or a boyfriend or girlfriend broke up with

7
00:00:24,754 --> 00:00:28,694
you. For me, it was in 2009 for instance, when my mother passed away, I was

8
00:00:28,694 --> 00:00:33,273
really upset for quite a while. But these things are not necessarily

9
00:00:33,273 --> 00:00:38,314
depression. They're normal everyday fluctuations. So what are the criteria for

10
00:00:38,314 --> 00:00:42,320
major depression? And for that we're going to move over to Lauren and she's

11
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,743
going to tell us.
