1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:06,558
The answer is 22,339 days. The way that we would figure this out, is that we

2
00:00:06,558 --> 00:00:09,886
would open up Bluejay, and we would go into this days alive printer, and start

3
00:00:09,886 --> 00:00:14,586
editing it. And the main method right here, we would first create a variable

4
00:00:14,586 --> 00:00:21,312
birthday. Initialize to Sally Ride's Birthday, and another variable, Last Day,

5
00:00:21,312 --> 00:00:27,250
initialized to Sally Ride's Last Day. Then we do the calculation and put that

6
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:34,205
in another variable. Here you can see that the daysAlive is an int. And then we

7
00:00:34,205 --> 00:00:38,725
print out the result. Which is in daysAlive. I compiled, and I got no syntax

8
00:00:38,725 --> 00:00:45,413
errors, so let's try running this thing. I go to the daysAlive printer, run the

9
00:00:45,413 --> 00:00:52,775
main method, and I get my answer, 22,281. That doesn't match what I got before,

10
00:00:52,775 --> 00:00:58,655
one second. Looks like there was a bug. This shouldn't be May 26th, it should

11
00:00:58,655 --> 00:01:06,797
be July 23rd. Let's compile this again. Close it. Try running our main method

12
00:01:06,797 --> 00:01:13,943
again. And this time we got the answer I expected, 22,339.
