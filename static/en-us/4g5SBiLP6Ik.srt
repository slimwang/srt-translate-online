1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,308
For this first one you have four pieces that are shaded out of sixteen total.

2
00:00:04,414 --> 00:00:08,132
four sixteenths is the same as 1 4ths. I can think about moving these three

3
00:00:08,145 --> 00:00:12,930
pieces over into this region. I move this one here, this one here and this one

4
00:00:12,942 --> 00:00:17,658
here, I'll get one triangle just like I have over here. This is what it would

5
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:22,028
look like. For the circles, I have two out of three circles shaded. So 2 3rds.

6
00:00:22,342 --> 00:00:27,699
On this side, I have one, two, three, four, five, six pieces shaded, out of

7
00:00:27,711 --> 00:00:33,542
three, six, nine. So I know 2 3rds is the same as 6 9ths. I could also think

8
00:00:33,554 --> 00:00:39,077
about moving this piece over here and moving this piece over here, and I'd have

9
00:00:39,089 --> 00:00:44,697
two full circles shaded and one circle left empty. It would look like this. Okay

10
00:00:44,709 --> 00:00:49,409
on this one, I know I have two pieces shaded out of six, here I have four pieces

11
00:00:49,421 --> 00:00:54,539
shaded out of twelve I know two sixths is the same thing as 4 12ths I can think

12
00:00:54,551 --> 00:00:59,463
about shading this piece and moving it here, this one here and this one here.

13
00:00:59,578 --> 00:01:05,722
That way I'd have 2 6ths and 4 12ths What's also interesting is that both 2 6ths

14
00:01:05,734 --> 00:01:11,591
and 4 12ths is really 1 out of 3, or 1 3rd, these are all equivalent fractions.

15
00:01:11,715 --> 00:01:17,274
For the last one I have 3 out of 7 pieces and in this last one I have 6 out of

16
00:01:17,286 --> 00:01:22,248
14 pieces. So 3 7ths is the same as 6 14ths. Nice work on that quiz.
