00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,900
Big O notation is very useful because we can use it to concentrate

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:08,720
just on the fastest growing part of the function and even without all the involved constants.

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:13,150
I now want to show you a few examples to make this more concrete.

4
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:20,640
So 3n+1 for example would be contained in O(n) because we do not care about the +1

5
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,190
and 3n grows at the same rate.

6
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:26,670
It does grow at least as fast as n.

7
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:36,669
The function 18n²-50 would be contained in O(n²) because again n² here is the fastest growing term.

8
00:00:36,669 --> 00:00:39,320
We do not care the minus 50 and we don't care about the constants.

9
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:50,710
Now very similarly here, if you have 2ⁿ+30n⁶+123 that would be in O(2ⁿ).

10
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:55,709
We do not care about the constant and those two terms here, they both depend on n but

11
00:00:55,709 --> 00:01:06,910
2ⁿ outgrows the 30n⁶ and since we add those two terms here, 2ⁿ is really just the fastest growing part.

12
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:15,600
Now if we don't add those two parts here but for example we multiply 2ⁿ*n²,

13
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:20,600
we need to include that into the O notation because just having 2ⁿ

14
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:24,670
that grows slower than 2ⁿ*n².

15
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:36,820
We just have 2ⁿ here. That statement would not be true because 2ⁿ grows slower than 2ⁿ *n² .

16
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:47,770
So what about a statement like 3n+1 is contained in O of n² because n² really grows at least as fast as n.

17
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:54,660
This one must also be true and it is true the only thing it would unusual to write this

18
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:59,700
because usually we're trying to state this bound here as tight as possible.

19
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:07,700
Similar down here, you could also say that 18n² -50 is contained in O of to the n³

20
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:14,560
but again this would be unusual to write because if we have a tighter bound that we can state,

21
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,690
we would state this part over here.

22
00:02:16,690 --> 99:59:59,999
Enough with the examples, I'm going to let you figure out the rest as our next quiz.
