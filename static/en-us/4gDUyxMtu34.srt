00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,731
Let's have another look at an inequality involving an absolute value sign. We

2
00:00:03,731 --> 00:00:07,403
have the absolute value of x is less than 5. Now, I'd like you to get rid of the

3
00:00:07,403 --> 00:00:11,231
absolute value signs around x, in a mathematically correct way, of course, and

4
00:00:11,231 --> 00:00:15,256
write the solution as a chained compound inequality. Remember, that's a compound

5
00:00:15,256 --> 00:00:18,847
inequality where we get rid of the and sign, and just write everything as one

6
00:00:18,847 --> 00:00:20,637
connected mathematical statement.
