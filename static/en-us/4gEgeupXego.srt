1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,130
So one question I usually get is, what are the requirements for

2
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:05,260
this class, and what is expected, and

3
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:09,400
specifically, what is expected of students who are enrolling in this class.

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,830
Let me try to outline some of those things now.

5
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:16,149
So just to re-emphasize, this is a computational photography class, and

6
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:20,610
we're interested in trying to understand the computational pipeline of how

7
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:26,260
an image is formed, how a camera captures an image, the rays of light.

8
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:30,280
And also, how do we actually process this information?

9
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:33,500
To do this, you will need to know things like linear algebra, calculus,

10
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:34,540
and probability.

11
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:36,630
Linear algebra, because as you will learn,

12
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:40,870
we will represent a whole lot of things as matrix, matrices, and vectors.

13
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:42,940
Calculus because we'll be looking at differential and

14
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:46,800
integration types of processes to understand the math.

15
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,010
Some of the concepts of what happens within an image, and probability because at

16
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:53,520
the end of the day there's a lot of sampling associated with it.

17
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,580
Look at these images and we need to be able to look at

18
00:00:56,580 --> 00:01:00,410
from the statistics of this and probability distribution function of these.

19
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:01,930
Another thing that would be important is the comp,

20
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:08,310
the computational release associated and what happens when an image is formed.

21
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:10,970
To support this we're going to provide you with

22
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:13,800
tools one an experimental one within browser for

23
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:17,960
you to track images, but then to really do this kind of stuff in real,

24
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:23,080
you'll have to play around with a toolkit called or, or an API called openCV.

25
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,930
CV stands for computer vision.

26
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:28,950
Python and C++ are the languages associated with that.

27
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:32,100
We'll give you examples on how to get started on these types of things.

28
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,830
In fact, some of the same things will be used within a browser.

29
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:36,590
The good thing with this is you will be able to

30
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:39,880
put this on your own workstations and actually do the assignments.

31
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:42,810
And more importantly play around with the concepts we will be

32
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:44,720
discussing in class.

33
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,350
Another thing that is available to you would be things like Matlab and

34
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:52,000
Octave, where you can actually also do these types of things.

35
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,510
That are, actually we going to be covering in class.

36
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:57,180
One question I always get is do I need a high-end camera?

37
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:00,270
Well, having any kind of camera would be useful because you'll be

38
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:03,420
taking a few pictures and playing around with this on your own.

39
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:07,540
But really there's no need for high-end SLR camera or something like that.

40
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:09,090
Of course, if you feel like buying one.

41
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:10,580
Use this class as an excuse.

42
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:12,140
Feel free to.

43
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:16,950
We will also provide you with images of various types of you know, for

44
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:20,765
example, different exposure levels to do HDR and stuff like that,

45
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:24,490
that'll help you do your assignments and all the work that is needed.

46
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:28,220
But remember, the biggest goal of this class is start opening black boxes on

47
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:31,180
the kinds of things that you've been using with images and

48
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:32,780
photography all the time.

49
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:36,510
How does a camera work, what are the processes that go within a camera?

50
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:39,560
Your fave, favorite software that you use is Photoshop.

51
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,950
In this class, we learn how to open the black boxes and

52
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:44,640
how some of the tools that you've been using regularly.

53
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,910
What do they really do to images?

54
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:50,240
So that's really more about the technical aspects of photography that

55
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,130
we're going to be looking at.
