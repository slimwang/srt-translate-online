00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:03,093
Keyframing is a basic tool in the animator's box, perhaps the first one

2
00:00:03,093 --> 00:00:06,545
learned. The whole idea is this: to animate an object, save its state at

3
00:00:06,545 --> 00:00:10,670
various times and interpolate among these. For example, I have an object I

4
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:14,226
want to move from one position to another over time. At time A, I record the

5
00:00:14,226 --> 00:00:18,918
position in time. At time B, I do the same. When I want to run the animation,

6
00:00:18,918 --> 00:00:22,844
given a time, I can get the position. This is a linear interpolation between

7
00:00:22,844 --> 00:00:26,955
positions A and B. The process of generating these frames in between the

8
00:00:26,955 --> 00:00:30,677
keyframes is called tweening. We can do the same thing with the drinking bird,

9
00:00:30,677 --> 00:00:34,590
interpolating between its two rotation angles, down and upright. Here's a set

10
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:38,530
of keyframes, A and B, and what we've shown is the times that they occur. Since

11
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:42,666
we want to loop, we give two keyframes and then we go back and repeat. A is the

12
00:00:42,666 --> 00:00:46,135
bird in the down position about to go up. B is the bird in the up position

13
00:00:46,135 --> 00:00:50,586
about to go down. Here's the timeline of our animation. We start with the bird

14
00:00:50,586 --> 00:00:53,810
down, he goes up over two seconds and then he goes back down again over three

15
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:58,371
seconds. A is our keyframe for down, B is our keyframe for up, and they have

16
00:00:58,371 --> 00:01:02,758
associated angles. We can use these two keyframes to form a loop for our

17
00:01:02,758 --> 00:01:06,420
animation. One improvement we can easily add with keyframes is making the

18
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:10,025
drinking bird pause while it's drinking. We add another keyframe to our

19
00:01:10,025 --> 00:01:14,708
timeline, call it C, where the object is held in the down position. C and A are

20
00:01:14,708 --> 00:01:17,332
identical, the same down position, they're just different locations on the

21
00:01:17,332 --> 00:01:22,003
timeline. The bird is held in place while the time is between C and A. Here's a

22
00:01:22,003 --> 00:01:25,740
graph of time versus the drinking bird's angle. With our initial drinking bird

23
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:29,829
animation, the end of the swing backwards is particularly unconvincing. The

24
00:01:29,829 --> 00:01:34,507
bird abruptly stops and moves forward again. With linear interpolation you get

25
00:01:34,507 --> 00:01:38,066
just that, linear motion. As you transition from one pair of keyframes to

26
00:01:38,066 --> 00:01:42,203
another the motion can suddenly change. To make the transition look smoother

27
00:01:42,203 --> 00:01:44,887
its common to use spline curves of various sorts to change the motion from

28
00:01:44,887 --> 00:01:48,665
keyframe to key frame. You'll also see the terms ease in or ease out which

29
00:01:48,665 --> 00:01:52,705
means to start or end the animation gradually from a stop. 3JS has an add-on

30
00:01:52,705 --> 00:01:58,240
library called Tween.min.js that lets you set up a series of keyframes. With

31
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,340
this library, here's my attempt to improve the drinking bird by using five

32
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:05,400
keyframes total. I added an extra two keyframes at the end to get a wobble.

33
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,949
You'll get to take a closer look and critique it in a minute.
