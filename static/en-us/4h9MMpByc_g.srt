00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:05,286
First we want the squared deviation of 2 from 3. Then we add the square

2
00:00:05,286 --> 00:00:13,440
deviation of 4 from 3. Then of 3 from 3. Then 6 from 6, then 5 from 6. 7 from

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:21,012
6, 8 from 9. 9 from 9 and finally 10 from 9. Turns out all the squared

4
00:00:21,012 --> 00:00:25,066
deviations are either zero or one because this is a simple example. Then we get

5
00:00:25,066 --> 00:00:28,700
that the the sum of squares for within group variability is six.
