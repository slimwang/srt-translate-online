1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,830
Adding support for the location insert
looks almost identical

2
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:05,826
to adding support for weather.

3
00:00:05,826 --> 00:00:07,842
We just have to
select the right table name

4
00:00:07,842 --> 00:00:10,430
and return the right location URI.

5
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:12,820
But there's one more thing to do.

6
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:14,250
All we have to do is call

7
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:17,200
getContext().getContentResolver
().notifyChange

8
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:20,130
on the URI that was actually
passed into our function,

9
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:22,670
to notify any observers
that need to know

10
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:25,050
that URI has changed.
And that's it.

11
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:26,640
We've now finished insert.

12
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:30,510
However, of course, we're never done
without also adding a test.
