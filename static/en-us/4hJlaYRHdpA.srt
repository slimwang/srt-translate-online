Let me ask you a different question.

2
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:04,750
Does the major axis dominate?

3
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:09,340
And by dominate, I mean that the kind of importance value, or the eigenvalue of

4
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:14,610

5
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:17,770
After running PCA, can you answer this for the three different cases?
