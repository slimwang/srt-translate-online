Thanks for doing that. So now remember we're trying to decide if me singing a

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:07,806
song that I wrote about hypothesis testing is going to increase your engagement

3
00:00:07,806 --> 00:00:13,385
in learning. In the last example, confidence intervals were really great when

4
00:00:13,385 --> 00:00:18,904
we were trying to estimate the actually population parameters. For example the

5
00:00:18,904 --> 00:00:24,530
engagement from our example before. In this case, the dependant variable, so

6
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:30,790
the engagements ratio, makes sense by itself, we understand what that means.

7
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:34,354
The number of minutes students spend watching the course to the total amount of

8
00:00:34,354 --> 00:00:38,824
minutes that are available. But in this case, your self-reported measures of

9
00:00:38,824 --> 00:00:43,430
engagment and learning aren't as well defined. And there subject to your

10
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:48,214
individual perceptions of what good, engagement and learning are. Obviously

11
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:51,854
higher numbers, like nines and tens are better, but what does it really mean if

12
00:00:51,854 --> 00:00:57,183
you report your engagement as seven. In this case we don't care as much what

13
00:00:57,183 --> 00:01:02,790
the actually between one and ten will be. We just want to see if the

14
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:06,733
intervention or the song possibly has an effect.
