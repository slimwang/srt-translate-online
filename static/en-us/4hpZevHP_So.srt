1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:01,184
The first statement.

2
00:00:01,184 --> 00:00:04,771
The attacker does not have to use
his own computer in the attack.

3
00:00:04,771 --> 00:00:10,270
As we just illustrated, the attacker
used botnets to launch such attack.

4
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:11,260
Second statement.

5
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:14,260
Since there are so
many computers involved in the attack,

6
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:18,530
it is difficult to distinguish
legitimate from malicious traffic.

7
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:20,140
This is true.

8
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:22,790
A victim, say, for
example, a web server,

9
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:26,800
receives traffic from computers all over
the internet, and it is difficult to

10
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,870
distinguish legitimate connection
requests from malicious ones.

11
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:31,890
The third statement.

12
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:37,210
The characteristics of DNS servers help
mitigate the effect of DDOS attacks.

13
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:39,120
And this is false.

14
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,370
Because DNS servers can send a lot
more traffic to a web server than

15
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:44,590
an individual computer.
