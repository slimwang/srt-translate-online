00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,969
We're going to show that
subset sum is np complete.

2
00:00:02,969 --> 00:00:05,960
But, here is a simple
algorithm that solves it.

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:09,262
w is a two dimensional array of bulions,
and

4
00:00:09,262 --> 00:00:15,167
wij indicates whether there's a subset
of the first i elements that sums to j.

5
00:00:15,167 --> 00:00:16,940
There are only two ways
that this can be true.

6
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:23,490
Either there's a way to sum to j
using the elements one through i-1,

7
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:27,660
or there's a way to sum to j-ai,

8
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:33,670
using elements 1 through i-1, and
then ai brings the total up to j.

9
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:36,930
For now, I just want you to
give the highest valid bound

10
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:39,890
on the running time of this algorithm
on a random access machine.
