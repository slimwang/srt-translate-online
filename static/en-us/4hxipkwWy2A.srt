1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:02,690
To move from one activity -

2
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:05,090
in this case, the MainActivity
in our Sunshine app,

3
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:07,493
to another, here the DetailActivity -

4
00:00:08,223 --> 00:00:10,446
we call StartActivity.

5
00:00:10,446 --> 00:00:12,930
But note that when using 
the StartActivity method,

6
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:16,760
rather than specifying the class name 
of the activity to start directly,

7
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:20,420
that class name is packaged 
explicitly within an Intent.

8
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:22,120
The basic premise is simple:

9
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:24,790
Whenever you need your app components 
to communicate with each other,

10
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:28,710
or the system, you use Intents 
to identify the target destination.

11
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:32,920
Starting activities within your app
is the simplest example...

12
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,810
with your Intent explicitly indicating
the target using the context

13
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:43,306
and a class name of the activity.

14
00:00:43,306 --> 00:00:46,406
Intents that use the name 
of the component you're targeting directly

15
00:00:46,406 --> 00:00:48,119
are known as Explicit Intents.
