00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:04,319
So people diagnosed with narcissistic personality disorder, are characterized

2
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:09,584
by an overly inflated sense of self, a very positive view of themselves. All

3
00:00:09,584 --> 00:00:14,013
their attention is self focused. Like the world kind of revolves around them.

4
00:00:14,013 --> 00:00:17,795
and because of this they really do disregard the needs of other people, and

5
00:00:17,795 --> 00:00:23,576
make really strong demands on other people. Now, they appear to be very

6
00:00:23,576 --> 00:00:28,394
confident but this confidence is very fragile and vulnerable. They get really,

7
00:00:28,394 --> 00:00:32,784
really upset when other people criticize them. And, in fact, also the

8
00:00:32,784 --> 00:00:37,005
relationships, having a relationship with someone with this disorder is very,

9
00:00:37,005 --> 00:00:41,510
very difficult and trying because it's all about them.
