1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,355
Naturally, we don't like feeling uncomfortable. Therefore we're motivated to

2
00:00:04,355 --> 00:00:08,675
try to decrease that overall level of discomfort. Remember in the lesson on

3
00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:12,514
consciousness, I talked about drugs? And specifically I talked about all the

4
00:00:12,514 --> 00:00:17,033
negative effects of smoking tobacco. In that lesson I asked students who were

5
00:00:17,033 --> 00:00:21,030
smokers to consider that negative information. And I did so in a hopes to try

6
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:25,876
to motivate some people to quit smoking. Now what happens when you realize

7
00:00:25,876 --> 00:00:30,264
there are negative consequences for smoking? Well, we want to decrease those

8
00:00:30,264 --> 00:00:34,446
negative feelings that we experience. So how do we do this? Well, there are

9
00:00:34,446 --> 00:00:36,924
three options that we can use to help to decrease the discomfort that we

10
00:00:36,924 --> 00:00:41,036
experience. And the first is that we can change our behavior to make it more

11
00:00:41,036 --> 00:00:45,731
consistent with our dissonant cognition. So here for example the person may try

12
00:00:45,731 --> 00:00:50,956
to quit smoking using a nicotine patch or perhaps a self help group. The second

13
00:00:50,956 --> 00:00:54,678
way we can do so is to try to justify our behavior. And to justify our

14
00:00:54,678 --> 00:00:58,242
behavior, we try to make our cognitions more consistent with the behavior that

15
00:00:58,242 --> 00:01:03,258
we're engaging in. So the person may say to themselves that smoking's not that

16
00:01:03,258 --> 00:01:08,480
bad for me and all that research is mostly correlational. And the third way we

17
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:12,000
can attempt to decrease said discomfort is by adding new cognitions that are

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,990
consistent and support our behavior. Here the person may say, I just enjoy

19
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:20,910
smoking and I think it's worth it, therefore I'm not concerned about the risks.
