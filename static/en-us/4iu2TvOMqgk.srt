1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
So again now the question with 5% confidence, tell me should we return the coin

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
because the given one is more fair than the one I wanted or should I accept it.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:21,000
To make it a little easier, I will calculate for you the binomial probabilities and of the null hypothesis

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
0.3 for the 12 possible outcomes from 0 heads all the way to 11 heads.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
So here are the approximate values in this table and before you make your decision,

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
let me ask you a couple of easier questions--what is the most likely outcome for 11 coin flips

7
00:00:39,000 --> 99:59:59,999
assuming that the Hâ‚€ is correct and the answer is 3.
