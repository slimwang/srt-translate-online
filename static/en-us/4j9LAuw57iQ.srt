1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,791
This is just another case we need to
substitute in new values for these two

2
00:00:03,803 --> 00:00:08,117
quantities, money from all original orders
and money from canceled orders into this

3
00:00:08,129 --> 00:00:11,416
expression using these other two
equations. As we learned about

4
00:00:11,428 --> 00:00:15,593
substitution very early on in the course,
if we have a system of equations that we

5
00:00:15,605 --> 00:00:19,745
know is allowed to work together and one
quantity in one of the equations is equal

6
00:00:19,757 --> 00:00:24,365
to another quantity in another one of the
equations. We can replace that quantity

7
00:00:24,377 --> 00:00:29,040
with the other way to express it. So in
the case of these equations that means we

8
00:00:29,052 --> 00:00:33,655
can replace money from all our original
orders right here with this expression,

9
00:00:33,655 --> 00:00:36,915
87w+72n.
Since this equation tells us that, that is

10
00:00:36,927 --> 00:00:41,632
equal to the money from all the original
orders. We can do the same thing with the

11
00:00:41,644 --> 00:00:45,516
money from the canceled orders or the
amount of money that Grant would have

12
00:00:45,528 --> 00:00:49,318
gotten if these orders hadn't been
canceled. So we'll replace money from

13
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:53,081
canceled orders with 3w+12n.
So this is what the equation looks like if

14
00:00:53,093 --> 00:00:57,168
we just replace that one word money from
canceled orders with the mathematical

15
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:01,323
expression we know that it's equal to. But
we need to do one thing to change this

16
00:01:01,335 --> 00:01:04,516
equation. We need to add parenthesis
around 3w+12n.

17
00:01:04,516 --> 00:01:08,443
Now the reason we need to do that is
because we know what we want to subtract

18
00:01:08,455 --> 00:01:12,844
the entire amount of money that Grant
would have earned from the orders that are

19
00:01:12,856 --> 00:01:17,187
now cancelled. So to show that this is one
quantity, one sum of money, the money he

20
00:01:17,199 --> 00:01:21,405
would have earned from the wipers and the
money he would have earned from the

21
00:01:21,417 --> 00:01:23,532
nozzles, we put parenthesis around it.
