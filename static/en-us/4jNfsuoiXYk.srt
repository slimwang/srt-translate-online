00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:04,610
My name's Ingrid Avenda単o and I'm an intern at Jawbone. I'm, I've been going to

2
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:07,175
school for art for three years and then I switched over to electrical

3
00:00:07,175 --> 00:00:11,578
engineering. The reason I started that was it started off as a bet with another

4
00:00:11,578 --> 00:00:17,560
friend and then the notion started off that I couldn't learn how to program.

5
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:20,518
And I kind of feel a little bit spiteful, and be like no I can do this, I, I

6
00:00:20,518 --> 00:00:24,995
can prove them wrong. I, I signed up for, or into the computer science course

7
00:00:24,995 --> 00:00:29,785
and that whole semester like it was really, really like terrifying to get into.

8
00:00:29,785 --> 00:00:33,018
Because I had no idea what I was doing, but by the time finals rolled around

9
00:00:33,018 --> 00:00:37,091
and I'm just. The whole semester had passed where I'm like, I can't do this, I

10
00:00:37,091 --> 00:00:41,203
don't think I can do this and I got my final grade. And then I was like, wow, I

11
00:00:41,203 --> 00:00:45,318
actually enjoyed this. Which was kind of something I wasn't expecting, but

12
00:00:45,318 --> 00:00:49,287
after that I kind of decided, you know what, this is something that I haven't

13
00:00:49,287 --> 00:00:54,890
enjoyed in years. Just having challenging problems that, like I'm excited to

14
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:59,240
sit there and program for hours. I'm like I'm going to solve this, I'm going to

15
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:02,290
do it and so I decided I had to do something different and I decided well I'm

16
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:07,206
going to try to do electrical engineering. Its a little bit more hands on with

17
00:01:07,206 --> 00:01:11,354
hardware. But I still got that programming element. So that's what leads me to

18
00:01:11,354 --> 00:01:14,526
do an internship at Jawbone and I've been doing three years of electrical

19
00:01:14,526 --> 00:01:17,870
engineering at the University of Pittsburgh.
