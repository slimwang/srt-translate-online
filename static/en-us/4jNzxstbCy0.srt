00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,310
So, the next thing we need to understand about the problem is what are the

2
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:06,696
outputs? The statement of the question gives some idea of what the outputs

3
00:00:06,696 --> 00:00:10,401
should be, and then, calculate your age in days part. But it doesn't specify

4
00:00:10,401 --> 00:00:14,522
really explicitly what we want the output to be. So, let's make that a quiz. See

5
00:00:14,522 --> 00:00:18,682
if there's enough information here for you to decide how we should specify the

6
00:00:18,682 --> 00:00:22,022
output. The choices are, print a number, giving the number of days between the

7
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:25,270
first date and the second date. The second choice is return a number, giving the

8
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:28,660
number of days between the first date and the second date. And the third choice

9
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:32,560
is output 3 values, giving the number of years, months and days between the two

10
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,903
input dates. Select the one you think is best.
