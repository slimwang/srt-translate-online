1
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:05,960
Let's suppose we have a function, g, which is just f convolved with h.

2
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:08,990
Maybe h is a filter, f was the original image, doesn't matter,

3
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:13,620
it's f convolved with h, and suppose I want the Fourier transform of g.

4
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:18,270
All right, well, that's going to be written as follows, 'kay?

5
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:23,870
Our definition right, G of u, is just the Fourier Transform of g of x.

6
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:27,360
But g of x is just the convolution, so

7
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:31,630
that's sort of in here, this part here, of f with h.

8
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:36,190
Remember that was my definition of G, the convolution of f with h.

9
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:40,470
What I can do is I can rearrange this, and you'll see what I did here was,

10
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:45,932
this was u x, so here we have u tau, and here we have x minus tau.

11
00:00:45,932 --> 00:00:46,620
All right, and so

12
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:50,170
if you multiply those together, you would just get u x, so it's the same thing.

13
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:53,600
But I've rearranged it, so all the tau stuff is here.

14
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,890
And all the x stuff is there, with this tau in there.

15
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:00,230
And so, we're going to make a quick change of variables, right?

16
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:05,170
I'm going to say, let's define a new variable of x minus tau is x prime.

17
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:08,690
So, now I've just, just converted that to x prime.

18
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:13,530
So, now I've got one integral here, and one integral there.

19
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:17,680
And if you stare at those, and you ask yourself, get ready.

20
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,870
What are those integrals?

21
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:20,540
>> What are those integrals?

22
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:21,830
>> Well, what are those integrals?

23
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:24,860
Well, let's take a look at just this integral.

24
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:28,222
That's the fourier transform of f, right?

25
00:01:28,222 --> 00:01:30,991
You happen to use tau instead of x, but it's the same thing.

26
00:01:30,991 --> 00:01:34,583
This is the Fourier transform of H, so

27
00:01:34,583 --> 00:01:38,299
that can be written as just F u times H u.

28
00:01:38,299 --> 00:01:41,068
Megan laughed when I said F u, by the way.

29
00:01:41,068 --> 00:01:47,476
So G of u is just F u times H of u.

30
00:01:47,476 --> 00:01:53,647
In other words, remember G was the convolution of F with H.

31
00:01:53,647 --> 00:01:59,299
G of u, the frequency domain is just the product

32
00:01:59,299 --> 00:02:04,930
of the Fourier transforms of F and H, okay?

33
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:09,850
So the idea here is that when you do convolution in the spatial domain,

34
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:13,290
you're essentially doing multiplication in the frequency domain.

35
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:15,810
And this is going to be really important, for

36
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:18,650
the next lesson when we talk about aliasing, and also for what we're going to

37
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:22,460
talk about here in terms of how convolution does frequency manipulation.

38
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:25,890
So this is just written here, is that if in if the spatial domain I

39
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:30,180
do convolution, in the frequency domain, I'm doing multiplication.

40
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:33,710
Also by the way, because of the symmetry of how the transforms work.

41
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:37,910
If I were to multiply in the spatial domain, that is, if I took two functions

42
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:42,140
and I multiply them together, I don't convolve it, I just multiply them.

43
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:46,070
The Fourier transform of that new function is going to be

44
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:50,670
the convolution of the Fourier transforms of each of the individuals, okay.

45
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,854
We're going to make use of that, both here, and

46
00:02:52,854 --> 00:02:54,850
a little bit when we talk about aliasing.

47
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:58,230
So, in the spatial domain you do convolution in the,

48
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:01,449
in the frequency domain it's multiplication or vice-a-versa.
