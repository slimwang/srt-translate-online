1
00:00:00,136 --> 00:00:03,657
So if you could sort and scan, and more importantly understand the kinds of

2
00:00:03,657 --> 00:00:08,179
algorithms that we study in using sort and scan and why they're good and bad for the GPU,

3
00:00:08,179 --> 00:00:13,049
you are in fine shape. The ideas you've learned will carry over to many other algorithms.

4
00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:15,553
You'll be using these techniques in the assignment this week

5
00:00:15,553 --> 00:00:19,073
where you'll do automatic red-eye removal using template matching.

6
00:00:19,073 --> 00:00:24,258
This algorithm relies on sorting a vector by key which indirectly relies on scan,

7
00:00:24,258 --> 00:00:28,000
so go apply your new found knowledge to the assignment.
