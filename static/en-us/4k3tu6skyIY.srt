1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,770
So it started when I was looking for
someone to help me with a marketing task

2
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:12,570
and I searched for someone on Elance and
he said, hey I can do it.

3
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:15,200
Said okay let's do it and
we started talking,

4
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,210
we had our first our discovery meeting.

5
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:20,300
Scary phone call and he said,

6
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:23,980
you know what by the way I
also have another R&amp;D company.

7
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:26,060
And I said, really?

8
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:28,900
Yeah, we have like ten people here.

9
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:31,850
And I told him, I'm looking for
an R&amp;D company,

10
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:33,480
do you think you can do this project?

11
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:38,970
And I was just working on my first
project working with a similar web and

12
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:40,100
he said yeah.

13
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:44,220
And since then we
started working together

14
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:50,400
in almost everything that they did.

15
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:54,580
He became a part of the company,
a real part of the company and

16
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:56,910
we became partners.

17
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:00,759
Because he understood what I need,
I understood what he needs,

18
00:01:00,759 --> 00:01:02,552
we wanted to help each other.

19
00:01:02,552 --> 00:01:07,762
And in our relationship became so solid
that eventually I came to visit him and

20
00:01:07,762 --> 00:01:12,653
to visit his employees because they
wanted to personally know the people

21
00:01:12,653 --> 00:01:15,238
who are working for us on the project.

22
00:01:15,238 --> 00:01:16,875
I wanted them to know that I care.

23
00:01:16,875 --> 00:01:20,380
I do care, one of them just
invited me to his wedding.

24
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:26,800
And they are really great people, and
I wanted to know them more in person

25
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:31,276
because they're just like employees
they just happen to live far, far away.

26
00:01:31,276 --> 00:01:35,110
And and that I was there for

27
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:40,220
36 hours but that really changed
everything for us because

28
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:44,030
all the sudden it's a real person,
it's not an email, so it's not a Skype.

29
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:46,110
It's not someone on Slack.

30
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:50,120
It's a real person that you're going and
having fun with went all for drinks and

31
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:54,270
dinner and play ball and
all of a sudden we're

32
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:58,910
part of the siame group that actually
meet not also only work remotely
