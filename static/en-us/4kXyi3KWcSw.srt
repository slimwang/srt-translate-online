1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
My answer is, there seems to be a roughly linear relationship,

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
maybe not quite linear, between the house size and the price.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
So we look at a linear graph that best describes the data--

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
you get this dashed line over here.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
And for the dashed line, if you walk up the 2500 square feet,

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
you end up with roughly 800K.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So this would have been the best answer.
