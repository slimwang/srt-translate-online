00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,497
Here's the whole meaning for the dot product. For any two arbitrary coordinates.

2
00:00:04,497 --> 00:00:08,338
We'll go through a piece at a time. This first part we're used to. If you have a

3
00:00:08,338 --> 00:00:12,559
normalized a and b vector, then the cosine of the angle between the two is the

4
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:17,202
dot product. However, when a or b are not normalized, in other words the length

5
00:00:17,202 --> 00:00:21,735
is not equal to one, the dot product also consists of these two factors. The

6
00:00:21,735 --> 00:00:26,094
length of a times the length of b times the cosine of the angle between the 2.

7
00:00:26,094 --> 00:00:30,069
To sum up, you can think of a coordinate as moving due to a rotation or staying

8
00:00:30,069 --> 00:00:34,508
still, and just being recategorized by a new set of axes. To throw 1 more term

9
00:00:34,508 --> 00:00:39,876
at you, these 3 axes are called a basis, and this is a term you'll see as soon

10
00:00:39,876 --> 00:00:42,443
as you get into vector math at all.
