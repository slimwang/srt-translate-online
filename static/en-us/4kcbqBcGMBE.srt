00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,240
Containers were developed to solve
problems with installing and

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,500
running software across different
operating environments.

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:08,328
You saw the problems
of just installing and

4
00:00:08,328 --> 00:00:10,374
running the applications
on a single machine.

5
00:00:10,374 --> 00:00:11,936
Now imagine trying to run and

6
00:00:11,936 --> 00:00:15,395
install EngineX on multiple
machines across different OSes.

7
00:00:15,395 --> 00:00:17,535
It would be a nightmare.

8
00:00:17,535 --> 00:00:18,336
With containers,

9
00:00:18,336 --> 00:00:22,100
you get independent self-contained
packages that avoid version conflicts.

10
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:24,530
This is part of the appeal
of container images.

11
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:26,660
They're easy to distribute
because they carry all of their

12
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:28,550
dependencies with them.

13
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:33,620
Now, the point of containers is that we
want isolation from various processes.

14
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:35,790
We've already talked about
isolation of the file system level,

15
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:38,150
but there are other
kinds of isolation too.

16
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:40,620
For instance,
network isolation means that

17
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:43,250
each instance gets its own IP address.

18
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:47,120
They're all free to buy in port 80,
which is EngineX's default port,

19
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,480
without us having to deal with any
init scripts or startup files.

20
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,430
An important concept to note,
whereas two separate virtual

21
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:57,090
machines on a computer will
run two whole separate OSes,

22
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:59,850
multiple containers run in
the same operating system,

23
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:03,070
because containers are a logical
construct we use within the OS.

24
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:06,150
That's what makes them so lightweight,
and easy to start up and shut down.
