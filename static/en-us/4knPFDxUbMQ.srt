00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,180
This center would be at the point 4 comma 3. This is a graph of the circle, and

2
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:11,160
we can see that the graph has been shifted 4 units right and 3 units up. This

3
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:17,067
black circle is the equation x squared plus y squared equals 25. It's a circle

4
00:00:17,067 --> 00:00:22,945
with a radius of 5 units. And notice that it's center is at 0 comma 0. We'll

5
00:00:22,945 --> 00:00:27,986
we're really just shifting this equation. We're going to shift it right 4 units

6
00:00:27,986 --> 00:00:34,745
since we have minus 4 and up 3 units since we have minus 3. So, this is how our

7
00:00:34,745 --> 00:00:39,825
center shifts from 0 comma 0 to 4 comma 3.
