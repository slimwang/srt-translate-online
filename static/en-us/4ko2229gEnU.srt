Here were the three answers. Great work if you got at least two of these

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:07,934
correct. Lets see how we can simplify each one. The quickest way to simplify

3
00:00:07,934 --> 00:00:12,965
the square root of 80, is to rewrite 80 as 16 times 5. We take the square root

4
00:00:12,965 --> 00:00:16,155
of 16, which is 4, and then we leave the 5 inside of the radical, since we

5
00:00:16,155 --> 00:00:20,820
can't simplify it. It's not a perfect square. You might of thought to do this

6
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:25,170
as well. You might of said 80 equals 8 times 10, and then you might of split 8

7
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:31,770
into 4 times 2 and 10 into 2 times 5. We know 2 times 2 equals 4 so we really

8
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:37,153
have a group of two 4s. Because we have two 4s, and our index is a 2 since

9
00:00:37,153 --> 00:00:42,372
we're taking a square root. We can pull one 4 out in front of the radical. So

10
00:00:42,372 --> 00:00:47,194
we have 4 times the square root of 5. For 120, we split this number up into 12

11
00:00:47,194 --> 00:00:53,510
times 10, and then 3 times 4 times 2 times 5. The only perfect square factor in

12
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:58,685
this radical is the 4. So we take the square root of 4, which gives us 2. The

13
00:00:58,685 --> 00:01:02,340
other factors are not perfect squares. So they need to stay within the radical.

14
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:08,740
So we have 3 times 2 which is 6. Times five which equals 30. For this last week

15
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:14,374
and split of 180 into 10 times 18. We split up the 10 into 5 times 2 and the 18

16
00:01:14,374 --> 00:01:19,840
into 2 times 9. Notice that we have a perfect square of 9 here, also we have a

17
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,711
perfect square of 4. We use our product rule, to split up this one radical into

18
00:01:23,711 --> 00:01:28,769
the multiplication of three radicals. We know the square root of 4 is 2 and the

19
00:01:28,769 --> 00:01:33,580
square root of 9 equals 3. And finally, we multiply 3 times 2 which equals 6

20
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:39,158
which is multiplied by the square root of 5, since we can't simplify it. This

21
00:01:39,158 --> 00:01:42,888
was perhaps the longer way to do the problem. Notice that we have two smaller

22
00:01:42,888 --> 00:01:48,758
perfect squares here. Well if we multiply these together we would get 36. So we

23
00:01:48,758 --> 00:01:55,590
really know that 180 is the same thing as 5 times 36. So instead, if we rewrote

24
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:59,930
180 as 5 times 36, we could have 6 times the square root of 5, since the square

25
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:05,500
root of 36 equals 6. We can get to this answer more quickly, by splitting up

26
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:09,639
our original radicand into the largest product of a perfect square and another

27
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:14,679
factor. By using the largest perfect square here, we get directly to the

28
00:02:14,679 --> 00:02:15,933
answer.
