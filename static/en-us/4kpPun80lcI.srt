00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:02,360
Here's how I came up with the answer. Since

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:04,700
the first 17 bits are fixed, that also means that

3
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:06,740
the first 16 are fixed. So I can go

4
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:12,720
ahead and write 130.58 in here. Now, there's one more

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:16,059
bit that's fixed. So, the one that represents a

6
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:19,790
128 here must also be 0. So the biggest that

7
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:22,600
I can make this eight bit address while sending

8
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,650
that top bit to zero is a 127, so I'll

9
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:29,330
write that. And then these bits are free, so the biggest I can make that is 255.

10
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:32,259
Actually, this IP would never get assigned to a

11
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:35,760
particular computer, because the highest in the range usually

12
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,470
indicates broadcast. That is to say this IP

13
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:42,020
means send the data to the whole subnet. Similarly,

14
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:44,800
the lowest address doesn't get assigned either. This is

15
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,550
used to refer to the subnet as a whole.
