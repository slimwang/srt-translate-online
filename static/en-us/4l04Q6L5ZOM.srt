1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,540
This notion of coherently
moving objects actually comes

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:09,430
from some very early work in vision that
was done by, the Gestalt psychologist.

3
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:12,950
Gestalt psychology,
which is really sort of the turn of,

4
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:17,060
I was about to say the turn of the
century, turn of the previous century,

5
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:21,480
really around 1900 or so, is when
they first started thinking about

6
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,210
the types of processes of the brains,
the brain does.

7
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:28,760
In terms of what actually has
to be constructed, if you will.

8
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,340
That is, what sort of processing
does the brain have to do.

9
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:34,730
Now, it, they didn't really have
computational models yet, so

10
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:36,320
it was very descriptive.

11
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,130
But it really was the precursor to
a lot of the computational stuff,

12
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:41,860
that we all do now.

13
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:46,787
So, one of the founders pictured
here is Max Wertheimer.

14
00:00:46,787 --> 00:00:51,080
And if you, if you read, it says that
one of the things that really interested

15
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:55,830
him was, at a train station, you could
see a set of moving lights going.

16
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:57,520
You know, one, then another,
then another, then another,

17
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,160
and of course these lights
would just come on.

18
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,190
But his, he and everybody else,
saw it as moving, right?

19
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:07,220
Saw these sequence of lights as motion.

20
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:09,490
And his question was,
how does that happen?

21
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:10,670
What is the brain using?

22
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:11,780
And he took a bunch of his assistants,

23
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:14,930
who later went on to also become
famous Gestalt psychologists, and

24
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:19,910
they started looking at the way
the human system groups things together.

25
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:22,200
And they came up with a bunch of rules.

26
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,340
So up here we have the not grouped,
right?

27
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:26,110
We just have a bunch of black dots.

28
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:29,530
Well it turns out if you just
move them a little bit, right?

29
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:34,030
Proximity will cause you to say oh
I have three sets of two there.

30
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:38,350
Likewise appearance, though you see
that there's black, white, black.

31
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:39,010
All right?

32
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:40,850
Similarity also in shapes,

33
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:44,290
we've got a horizontal ellipsis and
vertical ellipsis.

34
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:47,180
But one of the ones that they
did that was kind of cool

35
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:49,730
was called common fate and

36
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:55,230
you can see what common fate here means
is that they're moving the same way.

37
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:58,295
And then this gets studied tremendously
by all sorts of people doing work in

38
00:01:58,295 --> 00:02:00,350
psycho-physics and trying to understand

39
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:06,920
how far could a point move between
two frames for you to see it moving?

40
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,810
And then it turned out that they
were actually different things.

41
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:13,170
If you do it a very small amount, you
actually see the point moving, right?

42
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:16,340
You actually see that it went
through all those little stages.

43
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:20,330
And then, if I put the point further
away, it'd be off and then on.

44
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:22,730
You would get a sense of motion but

45
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:25,780
you didn't think you
actually saw the point move.

46
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:28,270
You would think it disappeared here and
reappeared there.

47
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:30,120
So you had this idea
that something move but

48
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,610
you didn't actually
see the things moving.

49
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:33,380
That was called a long range process.

50
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:38,340
I think these were done by Oliver
who was a famous psycho-physicist.

51
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:42,150
And so anyway, so this is, this idea of
how does the brain process such motion?

52
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:45,780
Sometimes, common fate is
the only cue you have.

53
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:48,440
So for example,
I'm showing you a random dot image.

54
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,410
You probably don't see very much there.

55
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:51,490
What do you see?

56
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:52,840
You see random dots.

57
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,670
Good.

58
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:54,430
All right?
Take it away.

59
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:56,160
Yawn.
[NOISE] Well don't yawn,

60
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,469
you'll go to sleep.

61
00:02:57,469 --> 00:02:59,160
All right, put up another one.

62
00:02:59,160 --> 00:02:59,910
There it is.

63
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:01,600
Is that the same random dot image?

64
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,280
You have no idea.

65
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:03,950
Okay?

66
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:05,850
But let me go to the next one.

67
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:08,150
This is a gif I made myself,
I'm very happy.

68
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:14,100
Now you're seeing two random dot images
sequenced right after the other.

69
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:18,700
So what you're probably
seeing is a square moving.

70
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:21,570
Back and forth, right and
left, all right.

71
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:25,820
You probably see a pretty
sharp boundary of that square.

72
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:27,970
You actually think there's
like an edge there.

73
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:31,230
Well, let me stop it, no edge, okay.

74
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:36,970
That edge was manufactured in your
head based upon the motion field.

75
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:42,580
Okay, and our goal is to understand this
computation of motion that would allow

76
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:46,170
a system to say there is a boundary
here based upon different motion.
