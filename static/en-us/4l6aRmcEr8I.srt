00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:04,866
The only solution for this equation, is positive 8. Great algebra skills for

2
00:00:04,866 --> 00:00:08,850
getting this one correct. We'll take the same steps to try and solve this.

3
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:12,740
First we'll isolate the radical on one side of the equation. And lucky for us,

4
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:16,415
it already is. Next we'll square both sides, and then try and factor our

5
00:00:16,415 --> 00:00:20,621
quadratic. When we square both sides, we'll get ax squared minus 6a plus 9 on

6
00:00:20,621 --> 00:00:25,826
the left, and 3a plus 1 on the right. We move these terms to the other side of

7
00:00:25,826 --> 00:00:30,653
the equation, so that way we can set it equal to 0. We factor a squared minus

8
00:00:30,653 --> 00:00:34,960
9a plus 8, since the factors of 8 that sum to negative 9 are negative 1 and

9
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:42,400
negative 8. We solve for the factors of a by setting each factor equal to 0.

10
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:48,094
So, a could be positive 8 or a could be positive 1. Next we want to check

11
00:00:48,094 --> 00:00:53,819
positive 8 and positive 1 in the original equation. Plugging in x equals 8, we

12
00:00:53,819 --> 00:00:58,558
get a true statement of 5 equals 5. When we plug in x equals 1, we don't end up

13
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:04,489
with a true statement. We'll have negative 2 equals 2. Since this doesn't

14
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:09,744
check, we know x equals 1 is not part of our solution set. We'll just have the

15
00:01:09,744 --> 00:01:11,503
answer x equals 8.
