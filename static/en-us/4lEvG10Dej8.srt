00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,860
All right, so now it's your turn
to implement an interstitial ad.

2
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:07,010
Here's a check list so you can keep
track of all the things you need to do.

3
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:10,130
First of all in the load
interstitial method, I want you to

4
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:14,400
create an interstitial ad object and
assign it to the member of the class.

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,410
Then set the ad unit id to
the test interstitial ad unit id

6
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:20,070
that we just looked at.

7
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:23,870
Create an ad listener that
inherits from toast listener and

8
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:25,990
overloads the following methods.

9
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:29,950
When onAdLoaded is called,
the show button should be enabled.

10
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:33,450
And when onAdFailedToLoad is called,
there should be an error message, and

11
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,820
the button should remain disabled.

12
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:39,420
Then create an AdRequest and
load the interstitial ad.

13
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:43,680
For the showInterstitial method check
to confirm that the ad is loaded and

14
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:44,940
then show it.

15
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:47,490
Then reset the button
by disabling it and

16
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:50,900
setting the text to loading
interstitial again.

17
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:52,360
Check this box when you are finished.
