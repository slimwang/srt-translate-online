00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,150
Now that we have a better idea
of what makes up Sunshine,

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:05,920
let's talk about the ideal state
where a production-quality

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,490
Android app should be.

4
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:11,350
While it's easy to immediately dive into
the minutiae, let's take a step back and

5
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:12,860
look at the big picture.

6
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:15,260
What are the goals of
an amazing Android app?

7
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:18,870
It actually starts with create
a vision for all of Android.

8
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:20,320
Create a vision for Android.

9
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,160
And all Android apps
have three main pillars.

10
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:27,030
Enchant Me, Simplify My Life,
and Make Me Amazing.

11
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:31,720
Enchant Me revolves around the idea
that your app should both look and

12
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:35,170
act effortlessly,
through well-placed animations and

13
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:38,970
a feeling that the app was designed
specifically for the user.

14
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:42,970
Simplify My Life involves making
the app easy to understand.

15
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:46,570
Whether it's for a new user just trying
to figure out what exactly your app

16
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:48,590
does, or a returning user,

17
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:51,660
where you're trying to make the
experience as frictionless as possible.

18
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:56,920
Make Me Amazing is about leveraging the
strengths of Android to build apps that

19
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:00,670
contribute to building a whole
greater than the sum of its parts.

20
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:04,519
Integrating into one another, and
extending beyond a single entry point

21
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:07,820
app, you need to remember to
launch to get any benefit.

22
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:10,480
Many of these concepts
shouldn't be foreign to you.

23
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,660
Making a great experience for

24
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:14,610
users should always be in
the forefront of your thoughts.

25
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:18,290
Let's take a look at Sunshine to see
exactly where we are with each of these.
