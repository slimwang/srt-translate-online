Cay and I are going to help make sure you get BlueJ and the course code

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:08,189
installed and downloaded. Installing BlueJ will have two main parts, installing

3
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:13,500
Java and installing BlueJ. You might not notice this part if you are on a Mac.

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:17,020
There are links below that will help guide you. There are written installation

5
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:21,930
instructions and some videos of the installation process. You'll need to pick

6
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:27,690
the right instructions for your operating system, Mac or Windows. If you can't

7
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:31,180
get BlueJ running, it's not your fault. It just means your computer's set up

8
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:35,886
differently from ours. We can help. Post your questions on the forums. Below

9
00:00:35,886 --> 00:00:40,600
this video, there's a section called discussions. You can read other people's

10
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:45,979
questions and answer, or you can ask a question yourself. When you're asking a

11
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:50,645
question, give us as much information about what you did and what the result

12
00:00:50,645 --> 00:00:56,190
was, as you can. The more you tell us, the clearer our advice will be. Once

13
00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:01,098
you've successfully installed BlueJ, open BlueJ and go to the Help menu. Select

14
00:01:01,098 --> 00:01:06,472
About or Copyright, whichever one you see. Who's the first contributor on the

15
00:01:06,472 --> 00:01:10,080
team? In other words, what's the first name that comes up?
