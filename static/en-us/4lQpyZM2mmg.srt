00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Let's explore a bit more in this brave new world of finite state machines.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Over here, I've drawn a different finite state machine, again with 3 states.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I'm going to draw some possible strings down here,

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and I want you to check each one that would be accepted by this finite state machine.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
So in this multiple multiple-choice quiz, mark each one of these that's accepted

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,092
by this finite state machine.
