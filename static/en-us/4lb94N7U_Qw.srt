00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:05,870
Time for a question. In exokernal we have this mechanism of downloading code

2
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:11,430
into the kernel. Spin has a similar functionality, which is to extend

3
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:16,890
logical protection domains. The question to you is, which one of these two

4
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:21,170
mechanisms compromises protection more. Does spin

5
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:25,580
compromise protection more? Or exokernal compromise protection

6
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:31,460
more by this idea of either downloading code in into the kernel as is done

7
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:37,160
in exokernal or extending spin using the logic and protection domain idea?
