00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,460
Congratulations, it's final project time.

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:05,050
For your final project, our boss needs a real-time,

3
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:09,940
dynamic visualization of tweets that contain worldwide top hashtags.

4
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:11,550
To implement this final project,

5
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:15,580
begin with a Storm Topology that calculates the TopN Hashtags.

6
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:19,930
Write a new Bolt that takes in TopN Hashtags

7
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:22,990
with a streaming join of real-time tweets.

8
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:27,970
Next, visualize only real-time Tweets that contain the TopN Hashtags.

9
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:32,229
If dynamically calculating and joining TopN Hashtags is difficult,

10
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:36,550
you may pre-calculate the TopN hashtags, halt your Topology, and

11
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:38,980
enter these statically into a new Spout.

12
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:42,450
However, you must use at least one new Bolt and

13
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:47,230
a streaming join to complete the basic implementation of your final project.

14
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:50,480
After this basic implementation is complete, update your screencast or

15
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,390
screenshot to the forum at the end of this lesson.

16
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:56,140
You may then add on as many extensions as you like,

17
00:00:56,140 --> 00:01:00,310
including changing the entire project, using any number of data sources and

18
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:03,190
any visualization you either find or create.

19
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:06,120
You do not need to use the Tweet stream after you've implemented your

20
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,820
basic project.

21
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:10,470
We hope you continue on through this lesson as you work on your

22
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:14,530
final project to work alongside our hackathon participants.

23
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:19,000
See the types of questions come up, particularly around designing topologies.

24
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,110
Finally, at the end of this lesson when you see this screen, post your final

25
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:27,490
project basic implementation to the forum and comment on two additional posts.

26
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:30,910
If you like, Tweet out your image to your followers using Twitter.

27
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:32,760
Next, again, at the end of this lesson,

28
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:36,790
if you've worked on extensions throughout the hackathon along with our students,

29
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:40,830
post them at the final project extension forum and comment on two other posts.

30
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:42,250
Tweet your projects to your followers.

31
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:45,290
I hope you have fun exploring your final project, and good luck.

32
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:48,010
We can't wait to see your basic implementation and

33
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:50,000
any extension ideas that you come up with.
