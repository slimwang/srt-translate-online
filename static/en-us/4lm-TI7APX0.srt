1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The answer is that for +t we look up the 2 possible values for r,

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
and we get 0.08 or 0.09.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Sum those up, get 0.17,

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
and then we look at the 2 possible values of R for -t,

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
and we get 0.02 and 0.81.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Add those up, and we get 0.83.
