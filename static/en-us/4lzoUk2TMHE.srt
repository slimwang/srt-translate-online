00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,884
>> We know that we want the distance between 2x, wherever that lies on the

2
00:00:04,884 --> 00:00:09,865
number line, and 4 to be less than 6. So we can start at 4 and count over 6 in

3
00:00:09,865 --> 00:00:15,154
one direction. Let's mark that. And then over 6 in the other direction. So we

4
00:00:15,154 --> 00:00:20,454
know where we'll need to put symbols now. We want 2x to be closer to 4, then 6

5
00:00:20,454 --> 00:00:25,325
units away. So these are the upper limits of the range it can fall in, and we

6
00:00:25,325 --> 00:00:30,516
need to shade in the area in between them. Neither end point is included because

7
00:00:30,516 --> 00:00:35,309
we just have a less than sign, not a less than or equal to sign. So these two

8
00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:39,739
values are negative 2 and 10. Written as an interval, we have this.
