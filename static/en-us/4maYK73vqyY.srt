00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:01,850
Hey everybody.

2
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:05,090
We are joined right now by my friend Neil Williams,

3
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:07,550
who is currently the lead engineer at Reddit.

4
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:11,400
Maybe you can tell them a little bit about what your job entails these days.

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:16,530
>> Well, I basically focus first on fixing anything if it's broken, and

6
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:22,380
otherwise I try to figure out what's, what's the path for the site, like what's

7
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:28,120
becoming a bottleneck and then try and fix that and make the site fast again.

8
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:31,220
>> How much traffic does Reddit get these days?

9
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:33,490
>> Last month we got 2.7 billion page views.

10
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:35,938
>> That's billion with a b.

11
00:00:35,938 --> 00:00:37,824
And I think when I left Reddit,

12
00:00:37,824 --> 00:00:42,262
which was in 2009, we were nowhere close to that amount of traffic.

13
00:00:42,262 --> 00:00:45,338
I don't remember specifically but I think it's like 10x difference.

14
00:00:45,338 --> 00:00:50,250
I thought Reddit was pretty big when I left, and it was, but

15
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:55,510
it's a lot bigger now and, and Neil and his team are basically the guys

16
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:59,710
responsible for keeping the site fast, online and functional.

17
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:00,880
Which, you know,

18
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:03,910
over the course of Reddit's history, has that always been the case?

19
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:07,240
>> We try. >> Yeah, you know, you guys do a very good job.

20
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:09,660
It's a very impressive job.

21
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:10,950
So what we're going to do in this,

22
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:13,890
in this interview here, is I'm going to kind of, I'll,

23
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:17,770
I'll start off by describing how things worked with Reddit before I left.

24
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:21,870
And then as we said, traffic increased dramatically.

25
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:25,330
And Neil will show which parts of the system are gone and what they're doing

26
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:29,160
now towards the future because a lot of things have, have really changed.

27
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:32,690
You know when a site grows, grows by huge, huge amounts you,

28
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:34,120
you have to keep adjusting.

29
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:38,060
So so the way things were when I left if I recall,

30
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:39,608
Neil will jump in it's been a few years for me.

31
00:01:39,608 --> 00:01:44,535
The first piece of infrastructure we had was the load balancer, and

32
00:01:44,535 --> 00:01:47,740
we talked about load balancers in unit six.

33
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:51,667
The one we used was called HA proxy, and

34
00:01:51,667 --> 00:01:56,080
you guys still use HA proxy, is that right?

35
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:00,830
>> Yes we do. Yeah, it's fast, it never breaks and works for us all the time.

36
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:02,158
I remember the day I found HA proxy.

37
00:02:02,158 --> 00:02:06,291
It was probably in 2007 and for, god, I mean even after I left for a while I,

38
00:02:06,291 --> 00:02:10,395
is this still the case, do you have, you have multiple HA proxys now, right?

39
00:02:10,395 --> 00:02:11,797
>> Yes. >> Like we were for

40
00:02:11,797 --> 00:02:16,743
a long time, like we had this super scalable architecture and one HA proxy.

41
00:02:16,743 --> 00:02:19,044
We had one machine running one HA proxy and

42
00:02:19,044 --> 00:02:21,355
that handled millions of requests a day.

43
00:02:21,355 --> 00:02:22,800
It was pretty incredible.

44
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:29,320
So of course, outside of HA proxy is the internet and

45
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:34,412
all of the Redditors, the unwashed masses of the world, users of the site.

46
00:02:34,412 --> 00:02:35,856
We also used Akamai.

47
00:02:35,856 --> 00:02:37,509
>> Yes.

48
00:02:37,509 --> 00:02:38,036
>> Do you guys still use Akamai?

49
00:02:38,036 --> 00:02:38,715
>> Yes we do.

50
00:02:38,715 --> 00:02:44,059
>> Remember we talked about CDN's, Content Delivery Networks in the,

51
00:02:44,059 --> 00:02:45,269
in the last unit.

52
00:02:45,269 --> 00:02:47,630
Basically these are third-party caches.

53
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:52,780
So Reddit pays Akamai to ping the site periodically, cache the content and

54
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:57,140
deliver it to users who, can view cached content.

55
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:00,510
>> We use that for logged out users only.

56
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:04,010
Since everybody has their own personal page if they're logged in.

57
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:05,680
>> But logged out users all see.

58
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,630
>> The same content.

59
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:07,810
>> The same stuff.

60
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:10,450
>> So, so logged out users hit Akamai.

61
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:14,670
And logged in users who have custom content, you know their username,

62
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:19,960
their votes, all that stuff come in via the internet, and hit HA proxy directly.
