1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:04,372
Your organization has done a few trials looking at treating post traumatic

2
00:00:04,372 --> 00:00:09,276
stress disorder with MDMA. And a few questions, one, why MDMA out of all the

3
00:00:09,276 --> 00:00:12,772
drugs, to use, if you could address that first.

4
00:00:12,772 --> 00:00:18,800
>> Yeah. Actually the, the last surviving person with legal permission to give LSD

5
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:24,674
was a Doctor Bostians in Holland. And he worked with LSD with concentration

6
00:00:24,674 --> 00:00:29,360
camp survivors. And a lot of the concentration camp survivors, not were only

7
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:32,496
Jews, but Dutch resistance fighters, and they later became part of the Dutch

8
00:00:32,496 --> 00:00:37,490
Government. And they protected him, and there was a book that was written by an

9
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:40,740
Isreali holocaust survivor who went to the Netherlands to receive LSD as part

10
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:46,868
of his treatment. And the book is terrific. It's called Shivitti, A Vision. But

11
00:00:46,868 --> 00:00:50,733
it's very difficult to read. Not only because he's sharing some of the things

12
00:00:50,733 --> 00:00:54,373
that happened to him during the concentration camp, but because LSD itself is

13
00:00:54,373 --> 00:01:02,002
very challenging. And MDMA on the other hand is gentle in a profound way. So,

14
00:01:02,002 --> 00:01:05,404
when they tried to figure out what would be the drug that would be most likely

15
00:01:05,404 --> 00:01:08,860
to make it through the system first and become approved as, as a medicine with

16
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:15,382
psychedelic drug would make it first. And then also, what clinical conditions

17
00:01:15,382 --> 00:01:19,504
should we pick? And so, I spent a lot of time strategically trying to evaluate

18
00:01:19,504 --> 00:01:24,710
that. the reason why MDMA, I think, is the top choice is because it's not that

19
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:30,728
fundamentally different from our normal way of processing. That people when

20
00:01:30,728 --> 00:01:34,433
they take MDMA, they don't have the same kind of challenge to their logical

21
00:01:34,433 --> 00:01:39,230
train of thought. So, we felt that MDMA would be something that psychiatrists

22
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:44,049
and psychotherapists would be more willing to experiment with on their own. So

23
00:01:44,049 --> 00:01:48,757
that they could be more effective therapists. And then, MDMA, because of the

24
00:01:48,757 --> 00:01:54,238
way that it reduces fear reactions, it's got an ideal treatment for post

25
00:01:54,238 --> 00:02:01,349
traumatic stress disorder. It works really well. And also there's not a lot of

26
00:02:01,349 --> 00:02:05,636
effective treatments for PTSD out there. Zoloft and Paxil are the only

27
00:02:05,636 --> 00:02:10,560
medications that are available. And they are marginally effective. Most people

28
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,249
say they're not very effective at all. And then, there's a lot of

29
00:02:13,249 --> 00:02:17,901
psychotherapies that have been developed, like prolonged exposure. And they

30
00:02:17,901 --> 00:02:22,664
work in a significant group of people. But there's a lot of people for whom the

31
00:02:22,664 --> 00:02:27,784
available treatments don't work. So, all of that came together. And the other

32
00:02:27,784 --> 00:02:32,269
thing about MDMA, we, we call it our aikido strategy of research, which is that

33
00:02:32,269 --> 00:02:39,088
there are hundreds of millions of dollars, about $300 million. We estimate have

34
00:02:39,088 --> 00:02:45,265
been spent on scientific studies about what's bad with MDMA. And they're all in

35
00:02:45,265 --> 00:02:48,017
the public domain, and they've been funded by governments in the world since

36
00:02:48,017 --> 00:02:53,109
the middle 80s to try to justify prohibition. And, because of that, we're a

37
00:02:53,109 --> 00:02:57,780
small non-profit. If we had to think about making a drug into a medicine and we

38
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:02,358
had to spend 300 million on safety studies, we, we'd never get it. So, we're

39
00:03:02,358 --> 00:03:06,648
taking all of this energy to demonize MDMA and turning it around, and saying we

40
00:03:06,648 --> 00:03:12,766
have an incredible information about the safety profile. So, in a way, we

41
00:03:12,766 --> 00:03:16,246
want to focus on demonized drugs that have been used by tens of millions of

42
00:03:16,246 --> 00:03:21,338
people illegally. Because the FDA, when they approve a drug, it's been approved

43
00:03:21,338 --> 00:03:27,058
on the basis of several thousand people, at the most. But the 100,000 risk that

44
00:03:27,058 --> 00:03:31,470
happens, somebody dies from this or that. Or like allergies to penicillin, or

45
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:35,124
aspirin. People die from those things. But you don't find it in the context of

46
00:03:35,124 --> 00:03:39,234
working with a few thousand people. So, with MDMA, where it's been used by

47
00:03:39,234 --> 00:03:44,076
millions and millions of people, we know the risk profile. So, it was a

48
00:03:44,076 --> 00:03:48,236
combination of the gentleness and the profound nature of MDMA and it's effect

49
00:03:48,236 --> 00:03:53,433
on fear. And there's a disease, PTSD, that's accepted by FDA, and there's an

50
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:59,046
excellent measure, the CAPS, the clinician administered PTSD scale. And what's

51
00:03:59,046 --> 00:04:02,822
really good is that the progress that people make therapeutically is mapped

52
00:04:02,822 --> 00:04:08,089
very carefully by the CAPS, in contrast to work with end of life. So that we

53
00:04:08,089 --> 00:04:12,184
have people so the whole work was psychedelics with LSD and Psilocybin and

54
00:04:12,184 --> 00:04:17,945
MDMA, for end of life, it's more difficult to make that into a medicine.

55
00:04:17,945 --> 00:04:22,040
Because when people become ready to die, that's not so clearly captured on the

56
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:25,946
state trade anxiety inventory or measures that have been used by the FDA to

57
00:04:25,946 --> 00:04:32,026
approve drugs for anxiety. So, it's, it's a combination of all these factors

58
00:04:32,026 --> 00:04:37,716
that lead us to think about MDMA as our drug and PTSD as our condition. So,

59
00:04:37,716 --> 00:04:41,746
that's our basic model and people, because of what we're trying to do, meaning

60
00:04:41,746 --> 00:04:45,962
making this drug into a prescription medicine and because there's such concerns

61
00:04:45,962 --> 00:04:52,805
about the risks of MDMA, we've decided to work with the hardest cases. So, we

62
00:04:52,805 --> 00:04:56,120
work with people that are chronic PTSD, which means they've had it for at least

63
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:00,264
six months. And once somebody has had PTSD for six months, they're not likely

64
00:05:00,264 --> 00:05:04,281
to get better on their own. And we work only with people that have failed on

65
00:05:04,281 --> 00:05:07,609
other treatments, so we were with chronic treatment resistant, people with

66
00:05:07,609 --> 00:05:13,301
PTSD. Our first study mostly women, survivors of childhood sexual abuse, had

67
00:05:13,301 --> 00:05:16,795
PTSD an average of over 19 years. >> Wow.

68
00:05:16,795 --> 00:05:20,890
>> And had failed on multiple courses of drugs and therapy. And over 80% of them

69
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:26,015
no longer had PTSD at the end of the, two months after their last MDMA session.

70
00:05:26,015 --> 00:05:30,214
So, the setting, we call it our psychedelic bed and breakfast. It's [LAUGH]. >> [LAUGH].

71
00:05:30,214 --> 00:05:36,140
>> It's a really beautiful, it's actually, it's an office that used to be a home.

72
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:39,691
So, it's, and it's an area of Charleston, South Carolina that's been renovated,

73
00:05:39,691 --> 00:05:44,470
so it's all commercial. But it has a kitchen in it. It has a place for a night

74
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:48,930
attendant to spend the night. we let people bring in some of their family

75
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:53,242
members, if they want to at night. we tend to let people at the end of the day

76
00:05:53,242 --> 00:05:58,398
bring their family members in also, if they wanted a the therapy session. And

77
00:05:58,398 --> 00:06:00,424
it's a male-female co-therapist team. So, the essence of their model is this

78
00:06:00,424 --> 00:06:08,160
two person team because they're there for eight hours. And the other, you know,

79
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,092
they can take breaks a little bit to go eat or go to the bathroom. But we want

80
00:06:12,092 --> 00:06:16,388
one person there always with the subject. And then, the idea of the male female

81
00:06:16,388 --> 00:06:20,158
team is that if we can sort of model successful communication lot of people

82
00:06:20,158 --> 00:06:24,160
have not had you know, supportive parents or their relationships haven't been

83
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:30,362
so good. And also, for safety. Some women have been raped or something, to have

84
00:06:30,362 --> 00:06:36,012
just one person there. You know, a man therapist is kind of risky also. So, for

85
00:06:36,012 --> 00:06:40,230
all these different reasons, we have a male female team. We're experimenting

86
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:43,365
now, where one of the team would need to be a licensed psychiatrist or

87
00:06:43,365 --> 00:06:47,782
therapist. And the other could be a student learning to be a social worker or

88
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:52,960
learning to be a psychologist or psychotherapist. And so, that accomplishes two

89
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,965
things. It reduces our costs, so that, because we're able to fund this only

90
00:06:56,965 --> 00:07:01,314
through donations. But it also provides a way to train the next generation of

91
00:07:01,314 --> 00:07:02,528
therapists.

92
00:07:02,528 --> 00:07:05,549
>> Can you talk a little bit about the properties and how you can use that

93
00:07:05,549 --> 00:07:08,941
therapeutically and why kids say it's a psychedelic, what they're trying to

94
00:07:08,941 --> 00:07:11,190
experience?

95
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:14,940
>> Yeah. I think there's a, maybe it will help to describe the difference between

96
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:20,654
LSD and MDMA. And so, there's a way in which LSD dissolves the ego, dissolves

97
00:07:20,654 --> 00:07:26,690
the, the control structures of our brain. And then, people are sort of flooded

98
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:31,222
with more material that they've been trying to suppress. And then, also they

99
00:07:31,222 --> 00:07:34,699
can have the sense of connection, where a lot of information that they've

100
00:07:34,699 --> 00:07:39,496
suppressed. Once the things come to the surface, they can feel more connected

101
00:07:39,496 --> 00:07:43,034
and the sense of unity is what then is the epitome, sort of the mystical

102
00:07:43,034 --> 00:07:48,150
experience. So, the classic psychedelics lead more towards this kind of

103
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:53,064
psychedelic mystical experience. MDMA, on the other hand, strengthens the ego,

104
00:07:53,064 --> 00:07:58,206
it strengthens self acceptance. And it doesn't challenge the ego. But you

105
00:07:58,206 --> 00:08:01,846
become so comfortable in yourself that you can become less self-centered in a

106
00:08:01,846 --> 00:08:08,143
way and see the wider world. there was a linguist at Harvard that was looking

107
00:08:08,143 --> 00:08:13,752
for reading the transcripts of our sessions. And she did an analysis. And she

108
00:08:13,752 --> 00:08:17,596
figured out how to tell who got the placebo and who got the MDMA, in a way that

109
00:08:17,596 --> 00:08:22,795
none of us noticed. And what she figured out is at one point or another the

110
00:08:22,795 --> 00:08:27,668
people who got the MDMA asked the therapists how they were feeling.

111
00:08:27,668 --> 00:08:29,792
>> Oh. [LAUGH].

112
00:08:29,792 --> 00:08:32,438
>> So that you, you're more attenuated to the other, which is why its so good for

113
00:08:32,438 --> 00:08:36,847
couples therapy or couples for relationships. The other thing is that MDMA

114
00:08:36,847 --> 00:08:41,089
stimulates oxytocin and prolactin. So, the hormones of nursing of bonding of

115
00:08:41,089 --> 00:08:45,115
love, of relationships are stimulated by MDMA, so people feel more related and

116
00:08:45,115 --> 00:08:51,032
more connected. Which is why we're starting a new project for MDMA for autistic

117
00:08:51,032 --> 00:08:52,208
adults.

118
00:08:52,208 --> 00:08:53,712
>> Wow.

119
00:08:53,712 --> 00:08:56,226
>> And it's not, I mean logically, it makes sense. >> Mm-hm.

120
00:08:56,226 --> 00:08:58,978
>> But what really started us is that they're in the age of the Internet, there's

121
00:08:58,978 --> 00:09:01,515
all of these people who are doing all these different drugs and posting

122
00:09:01,515 --> 00:09:06,470
reports. And there's a large number of reports on the internet of people who

123
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:10,010
are Asperger's or autism who took MDMA on their own and could understand

124
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:13,918
emotions and could communicate better.

125
00:09:13,918 --> 00:09:14,649
>> Fascinating.

126
00:09:14,649 --> 00:09:18,477
>> And there's a woman Alicia Danforth, who's speaking at the conference, who did

127
00:09:18,477 --> 00:09:22,305
her PHD dissertation on contacting all those people as many where she could

128
00:09:22,305 --> 00:09:28,980
identify and ask them how MDMA was useful to them. And on the basis of that,

129
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:32,052
we've designed a protocol and we've submitted to the FDA we should be hearing

130
00:09:32,052 --> 00:09:35,076
any day now or next week whether the FDA will accept this protocol or whether

131
00:09:35,076 --> 00:09:40,680
they want us to make some changes. But we feel pretty good that the FDA will

132
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,605
say yes.

133
00:09:41,605 --> 00:09:45,259
>> But I think the application of MDMA to Autism to people that don't know how to

134
00:09:45,259 --> 00:09:50,666
read emotions in others and don't really understand their own emotions. Its a

135
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:53,704
tremendous opportunity, and I think a lot of it has to do with this hormonal

136
00:09:53,704 --> 00:09:55,760
release aspect of MDMA.

137
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,063
>> Right, excellent. Well, fascinating stuff. Thank you so much for your time we

138
00:09:59,063 --> 00:10:00,230
really appreciate it.
