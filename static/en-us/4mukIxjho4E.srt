00:00:00,309 --> 00:00:02,906
You maybe surprised by some of the traits that you can learn

2
00:00:02,906 --> 00:00:07,463
about through your DNA. Those include eye color, hair color and whether you

3
00:00:07,463 --> 00:00:11,929
have a preference for sweet or savory foods, how well you metabolize

4
00:00:11,929 --> 00:00:16,669
caffeine and whether you are at risk for a disease such as diabetes.

00:00:16,669 --> 00:00:18,097
>> And there are a lot of traits that we know a

6
00:00:18,097 --> 00:00:20,067
lot of about. And I want you to hold on to the

7
00:00:20,067 --> 00:00:22,827
trait that you out in, and as we go through the course,

8
00:00:22,827 --> 00:00:25,442
see what you learn about it And if not much is known

9
00:00:25,442 --> 00:00:28,887
yet about the trait you have in mind, maybe 23 me can conduct a

10
00:00:28,887 --> 00:00:33,310
research with your help to figure out the connection between DNA and your trait.
