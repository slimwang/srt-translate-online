1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,430
Well, 10,000 is kind of too small but
it's not quite a million.

2
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:06,760
The answer is 150,000.

3
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:10,134
That's relatively small for
something that has to essentially take

4
00:00:10,134 --> 00:00:12,809
the hardware resources,
do the direct management and

5
00:00:12,809 --> 00:00:15,966
make those available to the various
virtual machines and so on.

6
00:00:15,966 --> 00:00:20,900
So this Xen is about this size, which
is relatively small compared to tens

7
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:23,860
of millions that other
operating systems.

8
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:27,430
Their size is in those
multi million numbers.
