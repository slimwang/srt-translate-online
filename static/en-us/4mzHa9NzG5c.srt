00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,892
We want the quantity x squared plus 2x minus 35, which is equivalent to the

2
00:00:04,892 --> 00:00:09,778
product of x plus 7 and x minus 5. To be either less than 0 or equal to 0, which

3
00:00:09,778 --> 00:00:14,804
corresponds to these 3 squares right here. The intervals that go with those rows

4
00:00:14,804 --> 00:00:18,952
are x equals negative 7, negative 7 is less than x is less than 5 and x equals

5
00:00:18,952 --> 00:00:23,692
5. 5 that gives us the inequality negative 7 is less than or equal to x, which

6
00:00:23,692 --> 00:00:28,060
is less than or equal to 5, awesome. That means that any values of x from

7
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:32,825
negative 7 to 5 including those 2 numbers, work to make this inequality true.
