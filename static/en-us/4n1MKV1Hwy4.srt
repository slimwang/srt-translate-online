1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:01,286
So let me motivate the problem.

2
00:00:01,286 --> 00:00:05,062
Remember stereo twice good.

3
00:00:05,062 --> 00:00:08,930
All right, if you have two views of the scene, and these are two cameras that

4
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:13,050
are not necessarily going to have parallel image planes, just two views.

5
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:18,230
What is the relationship between the location of a scene point in one camera and

6
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:20,370
its location in the other camera.

7
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:21,420
That was what we wanted to know,

8
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:24,390
we wanted to know if we could know something about that relationship so

9
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:28,780
when we went looking for the matches, we could use it as a constraint.

10
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:31,160
Just to animate it a little bit, if we have of points, so

11
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:34,550
the idea is we have a point P, out there in the scene.

12
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:39,370
That point images to some location in the left image plane, center projection 1

13
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:45,720
here, and that line maps to a line in the center projection number two, and

14
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:50,810
that was what was referred to as an epipolar line with respect to that point.

15
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:51,510
So if you're looking for

16
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:54,610
that point, it's going to have to be somehow on that line.

17
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:58,890
Likewise the ray from the other center of projection maps to

18
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:04,400
the corresponding epipolar line in the other image, its center projection.

19
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:09,780
And those pair of epipolar lines, we showed before, that they're defined by

20
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:15,180
a plane called the epipolar plane, and that plane is defined, well, the simplest

21
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:19,430
way of thinking about it, is that it's defined by this base line vector.

22
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:23,780
So the translational vector between the two centers of projection and

23
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:25,350
this world point.

24
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:28,120
Or you could think of it as being defined by the three points,

25
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:32,090
P, CP2, CP1, that's the epipolar plane.

26
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:36,690
So we have a different epipolar plane for each point out in the world.

27
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:39,880
We then talked about what we call the epipolar constraint.

28
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:43,230
Right? The idea was, if I know about my epipolar lines or

29
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:45,230
I know about the epipolar planes.

30
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:48,880
The epipolar constraint means that if I have a point P

31
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,040
in the image on the left hand side.

32
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,940
There's only a one dimensional search in the right hand image to look along.

33
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:56,670
That was the epipolar line.

34
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:58,900
For the parallel image planes, everything lined up,

35
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:01,140
it was the same horizontal line.

36
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:04,650
But in general, if I have verged cameras we showed your

37
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:06,910
epipolar lines weren't going to be parallel.

38
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:10,460
And here was this example where we had converged cameras and

39
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:13,150
corresponding epipolar lines.

40
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:15,980
It also allowed us to define a couple of terms.

41
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:22,190
So the baseline was just the vector separating the two centers of projection.

42
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:25,050
The epipolar plane we just talked about, given a world point and

43
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:27,640
that baseline defines the plane.

44
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:31,860
The epipolar lines were the intersection of the epipolar plane and

45
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:36,180
each of the image planes, so that's a pair of corresponding epipolar lines.

46
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:40,710
The epipole of each image was the point in

47
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:43,530
the image plane that intersected the baseline.

48
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:47,440
And we said sometimes you don't actually see that, in fact if we, if we go

49
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:52,340
back to this pair of images here, all of these would have intersected over here.

50
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:56,410
So if this image had been huge, you would have been able to see the epipole, but

51
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:59,630
because it's in some sense cropped out, you can't always see the epipole.
