1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:04,760
As we said, one major component of bipolar disorder is depression. A person

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:07,760
needs to be clinically depressed for the most part, but they also need to

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:12,324
experience mania. Now to help you remember the symptoms of the mania stage,

4
00:00:12,324 --> 00:00:19,219
there is a mnemonic device that you can use. And that's DIGFAST. First we have

5
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:24,512
distractability, then indiscretion, grandiosity, flight of ideas, activity

6
00:00:24,512 --> 00:00:29,647
increased, sleep, which during the mania stage, you have a decreased need for

7
00:00:29,647 --> 00:00:35,200
And talkativeness. There are different types of bipolar disorder, but we're

8
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,905
only going to discuss three here. Let's start with bipolar I and bipolar II.

9
00:00:39,905 --> 00:00:45,898
Bipolar I is more severe. That's because the person meets the clinical criteria

10
00:00:45,898 --> 00:00:52,120
for major depression and for mania for at least seven consecutive days. On the

11
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:55,840
other hand, with bipolar II the individual meets the criteria for major

12
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:01,764
depression and the criteria for hypomania. Hypomania episodes are similar to

13
00:01:01,764 --> 00:01:06,753
the symptoms of mania. So think about that DIGFAST mnemonic device that we just

14
00:01:06,753 --> 00:01:11,782
spoke about. However, these episodes are much shorter in duration, they last

15
00:01:11,782 --> 00:01:16,742
for at least four consecutive days. So we see the difference between hypomania

16
00:01:16,742 --> 00:01:19,914
and mania as the distinction between someone having a more severe form of

17
00:01:19,914 --> 00:01:25,426
bipolar or less severe form. Nevertheless, whenever it's bipolar I or II, it's

18
00:01:25,426 --> 00:01:31,018
clear to see how it can be a difficult disorder to live with. In fact, it can

19
00:01:31,018 --> 00:01:34,870
be exhausting. However, there are treatments available which we'll discuss in

20
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:41,490
our next lesson. Of the third disorder we'll discuss is called cyclothymia.

21
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:47,020
This is the milder, but longer-lasting form of bipolar disorder. This has both

22
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:50,980
manic and depressive episodes, but it's less severe than bipolar II disorder,

23
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:54,820
because in the manic and the depressive symptoms never reach the criteria of

24
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:58,783
major depression or even hypomania.
