1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,189
So in 2000 I started
a company called Glare Soft.

2
00:00:03,189 --> 00:00:06,917
And Glare Soft was interesting because
right around then personal computers

3
00:00:06,917 --> 00:00:10,756
were becoming powerful enough to sort of
replace what you would go to a recording

4
00:00:10,756 --> 00:00:12,520
studio to use as a musician.

5
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:17,693
And so, a handful of us around the world
started these small tiny software

6
00:00:17,693 --> 00:00:22,702
companies, building this pioneering
technology that actually could

7
00:00:22,702 --> 00:00:27,969
replace some analog synthesizer in
your PC and we did that until 2006.

8
00:00:27,969 --> 00:00:31,151
We sold the company to a larger
audio software company and

9
00:00:31,151 --> 00:00:32,884
it was an amazing experience.

10
00:00:32,884 --> 00:00:35,451
We grew a lot,
we sold a lot of products at one point

11
00:00:35,451 --> 00:00:38,029
we were in Apple retail
which was super exciting.

12
00:00:38,029 --> 00:00:41,623
Send my parents the to Apple store and
I wrote the software.

13
00:00:41,623 --> 00:00:43,834
So yeah that was the company
that I created and

14
00:00:43,834 --> 00:00:45,880
I'm still to this day
really proud of it.
