Here is that formula written out in Java. Have a close look at the parenthesis.

2
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:10,165
I was very careful to compute the entire expression, then have parenthesis

3
00:00:10,165 --> 00:00:16,406
around it, and only then take the integer part of the final answer. Now we are

4
00:00:16,406 --> 00:00:19,960
almost home free. The red tiles was the same as the pairs and the y tiles as

5
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:25,189
the pairs plus one. Here I'm running the program and when I supply the same

6
00:00:25,189 --> 00:00:31,078
inputs as in the example problem, a 100 inches for the width. Tile size of 5,

7
00:00:31,078 --> 00:00:35,910
then I get the expected answer. Now the important part of this entire exercise

8
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:40,235
is to first do it by hand. If you can't do it by hand, you can't program it.

9
00:00:40,235 --> 00:00:44,141
And doing it by hand gives you valuable intuition that you need to write the

10
00:00:44,141 --> 00:00:47,988
Java code. You'll get to practice this with another example that Sarah will

11
00:00:47,988 --> 00:00:48,860
show you.
