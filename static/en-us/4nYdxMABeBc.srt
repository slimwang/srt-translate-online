>> Well, it looks like the mean, median and mode are about the same. You can see

2
00:00:05,387 --> 00:00:11,019
that the mode occurs here in this bin and same with this bin, which is 40,000 to

3
00:00:11,019 --> 00:00:16,344
50,000. And that the mean is probably about here at 50,000. And the median is

4
00:00:16,344 --> 00:00:21,839
about in the middle as well, because the distribution is pretty symmetrical for

5
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:22,307
both.
