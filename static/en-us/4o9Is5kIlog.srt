00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:04,150
Let's repeat this exercise, but this time using discrimination tree for

2
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:07,350
organizing the case memory. So here is a discrimination tree,

3
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:11,110
containing the cases currently in the case memory. And here is the,

4
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:14,620
new problem. You could go to the initial location, to the goal location.

5
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:18,830
Given this problem, what case would be retrieved from this discrimination tree?
