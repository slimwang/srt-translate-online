1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:02,860
>> So, we talked about needing a text editor.

2
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:05,230
Which one, give any preferences? Which one should we use?

3
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:06,650
>> I personally use Sublime. I mean, there's,

4
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:08,380
there's lots of good choices out there but.

5
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:09,030
>> Okay.

6
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:10,070
>> Sublime is what I use.

7
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:14,100
>> So, and is that available in Windows, Mac, both?

8
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:15,030
>> It's on both, yeah.

9
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:15,170
>> Okay.

10
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:17,290
>> So I think I actually use Sublime two.

11
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:17,970
>> Sublime two, okay.

12
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:20,978
>> This is, this is a slightly older version so.

13
00:00:20,978 --> 00:00:23,192
>> Okay cool, so I'm going to download for OS X, and I

14
00:00:23,192 --> 00:00:27,010
mentioned that if I had a Windows machine I would get something similar.

15
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:27,160
>> Yup.

16
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,860
>> And we will let that do it's thing.

17
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,260
Alright, so we just downloaded it and I am going to

18
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:37,200
search for it now, for some reason it didn't open

19
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,850
automatically. And I am going to drag it over to applications.

20
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,520
And now we're in Applications and if she scroll

21
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:49,550
down, we've got Sublime. So let's open it up.

22
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:58,790
>> Oop, there it is.

23
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:00,470
>> Fine, that's it? We're ready to start going?

24
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:01,150
>> We're ready.

25
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:01,820
>> Okay, cool.
