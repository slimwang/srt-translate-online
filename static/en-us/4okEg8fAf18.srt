00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,536
To make our Algebra a little bit easier, I'm going to call the length of the

2
00:00:03,548 --> 00:00:07,073
hypotenuse l for just a moment. We're just going to use this other variable to

3
00:00:07,085 --> 00:00:10,635
describe it. We know from the Pythagorean Theorem, that if I square each of

4
00:00:10,647 --> 00:00:14,477
these sides and add them together, I'll get l squared. Then, we just need to

5
00:00:14,489 --> 00:00:18,870
simplify this left side of the equation. I could distribute the exponent of 2 to

6
00:00:18,882 --> 00:00:23,875
all of the factors and then add like terms. Since we want to get l by itself, we

7
00:00:23,887 --> 00:00:28,620
need to take the square root of both sides. Or in other words, I need to take

8
00:00:28,632 --> 00:00:33,250
both sides to the 1 half power. On the right side I just get l and on the left

9
00:00:33,262 --> 00:00:37,735
side, I get 2x. So, our final answer is, that the length of the hypotenuse

10
00:00:37,747 --> 00:00:38,345
equals 2x.
