1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:03,719
Selecting by tag is less than helpful.

2
00:00:03,719 --> 00:00:08,140
In fact, if you think you need to use jQuery to select all of a specific tag on

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:11,060
a page, you might want to rethink what you're doing

4
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:14,310
because there's probably a better way to accomplish what you're trying to do.

5
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,880
Usually, we only want to select a handful of DOM elements for changes.

6
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:23,530
Classes offer a more specific selector that's much more

7
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:25,470
applicable to the real world.

8
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:27,810
To select all elements of a certain class name,

9
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:32,900
simply pass the class name with a dot in front as a string to the jQuery object.

10
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:36,990
For instance, if you want to select all elements of class green, you could call

11
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:41,320
the jQuery object and pass it a string of a dot followed by green.

12
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:46,640
This string that you're passing in looks a lot like a CSS selector, and

13
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,090
that's because it is.

14
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:52,820
In fact, any valid CSS selector is also valid in jQuery.

15
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:55,800
For this quiz, you'll be working with the sample page again.

16
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:59,820
I want you to select all elements of the class article-item, and

17
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,090
save them to variable articles.

18
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:05,560
Once again, you can check your work by console.logging the resulting

19
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,370
jQuery collection.
