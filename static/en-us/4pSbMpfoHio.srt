00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,220
I would like to do a little quiz with you here and have you tell me if I give this algorithm here

2
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:13,390
the best possible input, what it's running time will be and again I would like you to state that

3
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:18,520
the function of n, a and the constant and the same thing for the pessimistic view.

4
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:24,670
If I give the algorithm the worst possible input that it can receive, what will be its running time.

5
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:28,880
And I should also note that I haven't told you yet what the best and worst possible input

6
00:00:28,880 --> 99:59:59,999
for the algorithm will be but I'll have you figure that out.
