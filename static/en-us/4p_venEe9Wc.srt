00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,066
To find the product, we add up the areas of the rectangles. I've listed out all

2
00:00:05,066 --> 00:00:09,980
my areas, or my terms here, and I've listed the x squares together and the x's

3
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:15,484
together. These are my like-terms, 3x squared plus 2x squared, makes 5x squared,

4
00:00:15,484 --> 00:00:20,299
and 6x plus 3x equals 9x, so here's my total sum. If you haven't made the

5
00:00:20,299 --> 00:00:25,943
connection before between this diagram and this diagram, we've simply replaced

6
00:00:25,943 --> 00:00:31,177
the 10 with an x. And in fact if we plugged in a 10 for x into this expression,

7
00:00:31,177 --> 00:00:34,028
we would get 1599, the same number here.
