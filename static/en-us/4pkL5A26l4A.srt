00:00:00,159 --> 00:00:04,488
Within the app code, if you look
at the make HTTP request method,

2
00:00:04,488 --> 00:00:08,358
you'll see the line that
says urlConnection.connect.

3
00:00:08,358 --> 00:00:12,501
This is where we actually establish
the HTTP connection with the server.

4
00:00:12,501 --> 00:00:16,850
Everything before this line of code
was about setting up the HTTP request.

5
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:19,910
Everything after this line of code
is about receiving the response and

6
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:21,990
making sense of it for our app.

7
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,250
If you check the documentation,
it says that the connect method opens

8
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:29,200
a connection to the given resource which
was the URL that we specified earlier.
