00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:02,020
Consider six processes.

2
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:04,630
Each of which has a buffer named x.

3
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:07,040
X is large enough to
hold a single value.

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,580
The initial values of x are as shown.

5
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:12,120
Suppose we run this pseudocode program.

6
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:17,150
If this is the initial state, what is
the final state of x on all the nodes?

7
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:20,810
I want you to fill in these
blanks with the final values.

8
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:21,630
And if for some reason,

9
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:24,530
you think a value is undefined,
put in a question mark.
