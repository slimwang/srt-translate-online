00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:03,260
On the surface, creating a list of items
is simple enough.

2
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:07,270
Android includes a ScrollView
into which you can place any linear layout

3
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:11,740
that in turn arranges each item
it contains into a vertical list.

4
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:15,320
Note the items which have fallen off
the bottom off the linear layout,

5
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:18,520
and therefore aren't
currently visible in that UI.

6
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:21,860
The ScrollView, as the name suggests,
will let the user scroll through

7
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:24,090
the contents of the layout it contains.

8
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:26,100
But there's a challenge
associated with that approach

9
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:27,630
on a device with limited memory,

10
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:30,840
and where touch responsiveness
is critically important.

11
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:35,860
If you have 50 items in a list and can
fit 10 items on screen at any given time,

12
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:38,496
what's the minimum number of views
you'd need to create

13
00:00:38,496 --> 00:00:42,222
in order to scroll through
every item on the list?

14
00:00:42,222 --> 00:00:44,690
The answer might not
be immediately obvious,

15
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:46,955
but think about ways in which
you can be more efficient

16
00:00:46,955 --> 00:00:50,365
in your use of the views
used to display the entire list.
