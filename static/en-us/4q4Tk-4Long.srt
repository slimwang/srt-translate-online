1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,436
And just as before

2
00:00:02,436 --> 00:00:04,538
we count the word secret

3
00:00:04,538 --> 00:00:06,139
in SPAM and in HAM

4
00:00:06,139 --> 00:00:07,808
as I've underlined here.

5
00:00:07,808 --> 00:00:11,411
Three out of 9 words in SPAM

6
00:00:11,411 --> 00:00:12,098
are the word secret

7
00:00:12,098 --> 00:00:14,781
so we have a third over here

8
00:00:14,781 --> 00:00:18,088
or 0.333

9
00:00:18,088 --> 00:00:21,054
and only 1 out of all the 15 words in HAM

10
00:00:21,054 --> 00:00:22,022
are secret

11
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:23,009
so you get a fifteenth

12
00:00:23,009 --> 99:59:59,999
or 0.0667.
