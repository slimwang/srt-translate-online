1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
[Evans] So we've reached the end of Unit 1.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Let me remind you what we've covered.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
We covered symmetric cryptosystems and introduced the terminology

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and definitions we need to talk about encryption.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
In particular, we know what it means for a cryptosystem to be correct--

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
that encryption and decryption are indeed inverses.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Defining security is a much trickier thing, and we talked about ways we could define security

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
for a symmetric cryptosystem.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
We introduced the one-time pad, which is a very simple but important cryptosystem,

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
and it's all based on using the XOR operation.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
As long as we have a perfectly random key that's as long as the message,

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
the one-time pad gives us perfect security.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
We looked at a formal way to define what a perfect cipher means

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
and prove that the one-time pad has that property.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
We also saw that in order to be perfect, a cipher has to be impractical--

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
that the number of keys has to exceed the number of messages,

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
and that means that every cipher that's used in practice is potentially breakable.

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
We saw one very interesting example of that with how the Allies at Bletchley Park

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
were able to break the Lorenz cipher.

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
We talked about modern symmetric ciphers which take advantage of computing power,

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
following many of the same principles of the historical mechanical ciphers like Lorenz

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
but using modern computing power and new ideas about how to scramble data

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
to produce much more confusion and make things much more challenging for cryptanalysis

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
even when attackers have access to the huge amounts of computing power

25
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
available today.

26
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I hope you enjoyed Unit 1 and have a good understanding

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
of some of the theory behind symmetric ciphers and how they're constructed.

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
In Unit 2 we'll look at how to actually use symmetric ciphers

29
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
to solve problems like sending a message securely between 2 parties

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
over an insecure channel like the Internet

31
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
and being able to use symmetric ciphers to play games online

32
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
and to do important things like managing passwords.

33
00:01:54,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Hope to see everyone back for Unit 2.
