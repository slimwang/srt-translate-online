>> So it looks like the entire goal of that chunking process was to help us

2
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:10,400
figure out between these two operators which one we should actually select.

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:15,080
We decided that, if a fast ball is suggested, which it was, and

4
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:19,220
if two operators are suggested, which they were, and the batter is Parra,

5
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:23,250
which it is, then to dismiss the throw-fast-ball operator. That means we only

6
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:26,710
have one more operator suggested, throw-curve-ball. So that would be selected.
