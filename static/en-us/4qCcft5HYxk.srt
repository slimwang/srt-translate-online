1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So let's make sure that we really understand list comprehensions by doing them backwards.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Suppose what I really want is for the output to be the list 1, 2, 3.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I have 5 expressions here, each one of which is a list comprehension.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
In this multiple, multiple choice quiz,

5
00:00:14,000 --> 99:59:59,999
mark each one that's going to produce 1, 2, 3 as its output.
