1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,585
Well it's super bumpy but still flat.

2
00:00:03,585 --> 00:00:06,278
That would be the point right here.

3
00:00:06,278 --> 00:00:09,420
What I want to get you to understand is that these individual driving

4
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:13,360
conditions can be plotted in a two dimensional diagram where each

5
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,710
situation becomes a data point.

6
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:22,590
That's called a scatter plot and for the three examples that are circled

7
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:24,405
these three data points are kind of identical.

8
00:00:24,405 --> 00:00:27,380
They have a scatter plot of those three situations.

9
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:30,930
So very often, instead of looking at the raw data,

10
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:33,380
we plot the data in a diagram just like this.
