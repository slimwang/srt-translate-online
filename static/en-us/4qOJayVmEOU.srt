00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:03,820
Now, having reviewed the conceptual tool

2
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:06,910
of an abstraction and the physical resources

3
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:12,290
that is contained in a computer system, we turn our attention now to the

4
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:15,370
major subject, the operating system. What

5
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:18,840
exactly is the operating system? Come help

00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,450
me describe one. So we want to

7
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:24,570
understand the functionality of an operating system.
