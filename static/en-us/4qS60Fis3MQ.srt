00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
So here's a multiple choice question for particle filters.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Say we implement a particle filter such as a mobile localization,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
and we use exactly 1 particle.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Which one of the following statements are true?

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Check any or all of the following statements.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Measurements will be ignored? Check this box if you believe that's the case.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
The result is generally poor.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
It cannot represent mulit-model distributions.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
The initial state, if known, is ignored.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
The state transitions are ignored.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 99:59:59,999
If none of the above applies, check the final box down here.
