1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,257
So in understanding our customer segments,

2
00:00:03,257 --> 00:00:06,158
it was really helpful to pictures up and as

3
00:00:06,158 --> 00:00:10,175
we build an archetype of who our three potential

4
00:00:10,175 --> 00:00:12,909
customer segments are. The first one we

5
00:00:12,909 --> 00:00:15,624
called Gasol, the next one we called Junior,

6
00:00:15,624 --> 00:00:17,947
and then the third we called Becky. And

7
00:00:17,947 --> 00:00:20,142
we talked about their age, their income,

8
00:00:20,142 --> 00:00:22,072
their demographics. Whether they were

9
00:00:22,072 --> 00:00:24,039
buyer, or whether they were – they were

10
00:00:24,039 --> 00:00:26,657
wearing the jersey as a social statement or

11
00:00:26,657 --> 00:00:29,123
whether they were actually a social sports viewer.

12
00:00:29,123 --> 00:00:31,304
What kind of fan type were they Avid,

13
00:00:31,304 --> 00:00:33,878
In-Season, Casual. What kind of class were

14
00:00:33,878 --> 00:00:36,542
they? Were they upper class and could

15
00:00:36,542 --> 00:00:37,534
they afford anything? Or were they

16
00:00:37,534 --> 00:00:38,908
middleclass or could they barely – they

17
00:00:38,908 --> 00:00:41,424
don’t even have a credit card. What

18
00:00:41,424 --> 00:00:43,823
was their Facebook status, and more

19
00:00:43,823 --> 00:00:45,641
importantly, what kind of rental type

20
00:00:45,641 --> 00:00:47,441
would they like. And it turned out that

21
00:00:47,441 --> 00:00:50,158
it was really helpful to kind of understand

22
00:00:50,158 --> 00:00:52,707
our pricing model and our revenue streams.

23
00:00:52,707 --> 00:00:56,231
So archetypes really helped us understand

24
00:00:56,231 --> 00:00:58,457
our customers, they value prop, the

25
00:00:58,457 --> 00:01:01,628
revenue and some of our pricing tactics.
