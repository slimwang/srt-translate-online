00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,719
Now there are a few other features we'd like to enable for our sound effects.

2
00:00:03,719 --> 00:00:07,943
For example, what if a player enters a menu or switches to another tab? We

3
00:00:07,943 --> 00:00:11,249
might want to be able to cut out all sound effects immediately in those

4
00:00:11,249 --> 00:00:16,715
circumstances. The way we do that, is by simply disconnecting our main node

5
00:00:16,715 --> 00:00:20,810
from the node graph, creating a new one in its place, and connecting it to our

6
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:26,369
output. The new node won't be connected to any of the sound effects the old one

7
00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:31,686
was, so we can start from a clean slate. For the next assignment, we've

8
00:00:31,686 --> 00:00:36,165
provided this stop all method, for you to implement this functionality. You

9
00:00:36,165 --> 00:00:38,950
should be able to do this in just a couple of lines of code.
