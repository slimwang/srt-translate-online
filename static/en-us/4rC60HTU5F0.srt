1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,133
Now a mistake that a lot of people make

2
00:00:02,133 --> 00:00:06,166
is to confound slope and correlation.

3
00:00:06,166 --> 00:00:07,533
In other words, if they find that

4
00:00:07,533 --> 00:00:11,467
the slope of the line fits the data is 1,

5
00:00:11,467 --> 00:00:13,400
that the data are correlated,

6
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,867
and that's not true.

7
00:00:15,367 --> 00:00:17,800
The slope is just the slope.

8
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:21,000
Correlation is a measure of

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,100
how tightly do these individual
points fit that line?

10
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:30,200
So you could have a shallow slope but

11
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:34,266
the data tightly fitting that line,
and thus a higher correlation.

12
00:00:34,266 --> 00:00:37,734
Or you could have a steeper line and

13
00:00:37,734 --> 00:00:40,900
the data fitting that line
at a higher correlation.

14
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:47,467
Correlation is just a measure of how
tightly do those dots fit the line.

15
00:00:47,467 --> 00:00:52,433
And you can have
a correlation from 0 to 1.

16
00:00:52,433 --> 00:00:55,400
0 meaning it's not correlated at all,

17
00:00:56,001 --> 00:00:58,333
And 1 meaning itâ€™s very highly correlated

18
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,367
Now add a scatter plot for
another stock, ABC,

19
00:01:02,734 --> 00:01:08,200
and again each one of these dots represents
the daily return of SPY versus ABC, 

20
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:12,066
and we fit a line to it, and
it turns out it's got a slope of two, so

21
00:01:12,066 --> 00:01:14,467
now we're going to ask you
a couple of questions about it.
