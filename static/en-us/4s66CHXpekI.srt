00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:02,850
The first optimizations we
do are easy to implement and

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:04,850
make our code load faster.

3
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:09,020
We first glue our CSS and JavaScript
files together through concatenation,

4
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:10,330
then crunch them with a minifile.

5
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:14,448
In previous lessons,
we applied a couple tasks to our CSS.

6
00:00:14,448 --> 00:00:17,073
But this time it's
mostly about JavaScript.

7
00:00:17,073 --> 00:00:20,438
I say mostly because these
topics still apply to CSS.

8
00:00:20,438 --> 00:00:22,970
It's simply that we're
already mostly covered.

9
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:25,970
Sass does both concatenation and
minification for you.

10
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:28,873
Manual concatenation isn't necessary,

11
00:00:28,873 --> 00:00:31,648
because you can simply include
a single Sass file in your HTML.

12
00:00:31,648 --> 00:00:35,432
Then use the import directive in
your Sass to input other files

13
00:00:35,432 --> 00:00:36,757
into your base file.

14
00:00:36,757 --> 00:00:39,531
When the Sass compiler
processes the Sass into CSS,

15
00:00:39,531 --> 00:00:43,450
it will automatically inline those
inputs and generate one big CSS file.

16
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:47,020
A minification is just an optional way.

17
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:51,330
Just modify the Sass pipe slightly and
add outputStyle: 'compressed' as config,

18
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:53,610
which will produce
a nicely compressed file.
