00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:04,430
Let's see how well you understand all
of the ideas we've discussed so far.

2
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:08,650
Here's a loop nest which implements
a matrix vector multiplication.

3
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:12,180
That is, suppose you're given a matrix
A which is of size n by n, and

4
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:14,630
two vectors, each of length n.

5
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:19,780
Then this loop nest
computes y = y + A times x.

6
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:24,140
Now the complexity of this operation is
O(n squared) since I have nested loops,

7
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:25,530
each with n iterations.

8
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:27,250
Here's my question.

9
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:29,660
There are two for-loops.

10
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:33,730
Which ones can I convert
into a parallel for-loop?

11
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:37,780
Your options are,
you can only safely convert loop 1 or

12
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:39,700
you can only convert loop 2.

13
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:43,420
Or you can convert both loops or
you can't convert either loop.

14
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:44,960
Choose one.
