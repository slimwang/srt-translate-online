1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,887
So now we have, from the last quiz, the equation, negative x squared over 8 plus

2
00:00:04,887 --> 00:00:09,947
4 x minus 14 equals 0. We already saw though that these two equations, which we

3
00:00:09,947 --> 00:00:15,074
know both describe our parabola here, are equivalent to one another. So that

4
00:00:15,074 --> 00:00:19,617
means, we know that negative x squared over 8 plus 4 x minus 14 is equal to

5
00:00:19,617 --> 00:00:24,191
negative 1 8th times x minus 4 times x minus 28. So, we can set the right-hand

6
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:28,806
side of this equation equal to zero through simple substitution. Wonderful, now

7
00:00:28,806 --> 00:00:33,432
we have another equation. This one, however, is actually pretty easy to solve if

8
00:00:33,432 --> 00:00:37,905
we think of a little trick. First things first, we're going to simplify. Can you

9
00:00:37,905 --> 00:00:42,372
think of a really, really easy way to simplify this? In particular, I'd really

10
00:00:42,372 --> 00:00:46,423
love to get rid of this factor of negative 1 8th. The first thing I'd like you

11
00:00:46,423 --> 00:00:50,263
to tell me is what we can do to both sides of this equation to get rid of this

12
00:00:50,263 --> 00:00:54,260
factor of negative 1 8th. In this little blue box, please write some sort of

13
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:58,350
operator and then a number. Plus, minus, multiply or divide, and then whatever

14
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:02,586
number you think we should do that with. Once you figure out how to get rid of

15
00:01:02,586 --> 00:01:06,678
this negative 1 8th, I'd like you to write the new version of the equation in

16
00:01:06,678 --> 00:01:10,921
this box right here. So, the equation I want here is just the equation that we

17
00:01:10,921 --> 00:01:13,834
have after we get rid of that factor of negative 1 8th.
