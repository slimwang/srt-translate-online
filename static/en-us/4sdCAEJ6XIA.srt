1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:04,580
So, now let's get started. Running code in the Python interpreter.

2
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:07,260
For this class you don't need to install any new software. You

3
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:09,840
can run Python right in your web browser, and you should

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,290
see something like this in your web browser once the video stops.

5
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:17,140
There are two parts to this, there's the environment where you

6
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:21,030
can edit code, so let's type code to print 3. So print

7
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:23,810
is a Python command that prints something out, and then after

8
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:26,180
the print, we can have any expression that we want that is

9
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:28,990
valid Python, and we'll talk more about what expressions are

10
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:31,360
in Python. Now we're just going to print the number 3,

11
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:35,660
and when we click Run, it will run this code

12
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:38,540
and show us the result down here. And the result of

13
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:41,630
printing 3, we see the output 3. We can do

14
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:45,150
more interesting things. So, we can print an arithmetic expression, so

15
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:48,690
I've got 1 plus 1. Now we run this. We

16
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:51,265
see both outputs, so first we printed 3, we see the

17
00:00:51,265 --> 00:00:54,100
3 here. Then we printed 1 plus 1. We see

18
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:57,170
the result of 1 plus 1 is 2. We can write

19
00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:00,160
this more clearly by having spaces. We can have spaces

20
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,180
between the parts of our expressions. So we can have one

21
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:05,760
plus one with spaces between there. that's a little easier

22
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,210
to read, when we run that, we see the same result.

23
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:12,100
The result is still 2. And we can make more and

24
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:17,049
more complex expressions, so let's print to result of 52 times

25
00:01:17,049 --> 00:01:23,970
3 plus 12 times 9. This will print out the result of multiplying

26
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:30,030
52 times 3, and adding that to multiplying 12 times 9, and we get 264.

27
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:35,540
You can check that yourself to see that Python got the right answer. We can use

28
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:42,100
parentheses to group expressions. So, if we use parentheses, we can do what

29
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:44,630
we did before, but putting parentheses around grouping

30
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:48,220
the multiplications and grouping the other multiplication. And we

31
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:52,030
run this, we see the same result without the

32
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:54,930
parentheses, that means the same thing as we had

33
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:58,370
when we add the parentheses like this. If

34
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:00,310
we put the parenthesis in different places it means

35
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:04,650
something different. Now what it means is 52 times

36
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:07,330
the result of adding 3 plus 12 which is

37
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:14,240
15 times 9. And so we get the result 7020. So we can combine any expressions

38
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:17,860
that we want like this. For example if we wanted to compute the number of

39
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:20,530
seconds in a year, we can compose many

40
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:25,530
multiplications. So we'll multiply 365 days times 24

41
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:32,060
hours in a day times 60 minutes in an hour times 60 seconds in a minute.

42
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:35,310
We can do all those multiplications together and we get

43
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:39,140
this result. Which is about 31 and a half million

44
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:41,450
seconds in a year. So now it's time for your

45
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:45,310
first programming quiz. You've seen enough to be able to write

46
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:48,140
a Python program. And your goal is to write a

47
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:51,180
Python program that prints out the number of minutes there are

48
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:54,440
in seven weeks, which is the amount of time we

49
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:58,760
have for this course. You'll do that by entering your code

50
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:02,120
in here. And then you can try different things.

51
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,730
You can try running the code. See the result.

52
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:05,750
And then when you've got an answer, you can

53
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:08,230
click to submit that answer and see if it's correct.
