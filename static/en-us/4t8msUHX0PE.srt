1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,890
In this case, even though coding is involved, the files are not

2
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:06,480
really interrelated, so it's fine to track each of the files separately, so

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,100
we don't need to check this one.

4
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:10,740
In this case the files will be highly interrelated.

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:15,280
The CSS file will define styles that refer to elements in the HTML file, so

6
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,870
there will likely be changes involved both files.

7
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:20,820
For example, you might have a single change that both adds an element to

8
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:25,020
the HTML file and also adds in a rule to the CSS file to position and

9
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:26,450
style that element.

10
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:27,060
For this third one,

11
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:30,040
it's probably fine to track the files separately since it's unlikely that

12
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:32,840
changes to one image will have anything to do with changes to another file.

13
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:35,940
For this last one you could sort of go either way.

14
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:39,210
In most cases, changing a single chapter won't have as much effect on the other

15
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:43,670
chapters, but if you want to make a big change like changing a character's name,

16
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:47,490
you probably want to change it across all the chapters all at once so

17
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:48,650
checking this would be reasonable too.
