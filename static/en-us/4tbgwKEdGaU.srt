1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,490
Time for aside number two.

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:04,660
This one's kind of cool, actually.

3
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:05,950
It's more about cross products.

4
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:09,550
So you might remember, there's a simple formula for

5
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:11,420
how you can get, a cross product.

6
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:14,330
You basically do IJK, and then you do a1,

7
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:16,580
b1, c1, you, you do your first vector, second vector,

8
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:19,450
and then you do essentially the determinant, and that gave you the vector.

9
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:20,290
Remember that? Remember that?

10
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:21,130
Remember that?

11
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:22,380
Okay. Maybe you don't remember that.

12
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:25,280
That was the formula for cross product.

13
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,570
If you had been really smart,

14
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:33,460
you would say, you know, I can just write this as a matrix multiplication, okay.

15
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:38,180
So I just build this little matrix here from my a.

16
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:41,730
Okay, and I take my vector b here, and so

17
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:45,550
that says that the first component of c is going to be what?

18
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:51,230
Well, it's going to be minus a3 b2 plus a2 b3,

19
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:55,890
and that is the first component of the cross product of a and b.

20
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:58,400
Same thing for the second component and the third component.

21
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:03,030
So we can just write cross product as matrix multiplication.

22
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:06,100
So I'm going to define a little operator, and

23
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:08,280
this little operator is written here.

24
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,750
This x, that means cross product okay?

25
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:15,180
So when I do this little bracket a x cross, that means that I'm going to

26
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:20,860
substitute in this matrix, which is sort of the cross product in matrix of a.

27
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:25,930
So if I want to do a cross b I would just multiply this matrix times b.

28
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:30,560
So the notation as I wrote here is a cross b equals and just this bracket and,

29
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,030
and here the font's fixed.

30
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:35,300
It's just this bracket a x times b.

31
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:38,070
Something that we're going to make use of, not this lecture but

32
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:41,140
next lecture is and I'll, I'll leave, you know I love it,

33
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:44,540
I used to love it when professors said this, the proof is left to the reader.

34
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:46,820
Okay, but you can actually do this.

35
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:50,010
Figure out what the rank of this matrix is, and if you come out with

36
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:55,010
any number other than 2, try again, because the rank of this matrix is 2, okay.

37
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:58,350
So it's a three by three matrix, but the rank of the matrix is 2.

38
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:01,700
Now we're going to make use of that later, because as you may remember,

39
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:05,230
if you multiply matrices together, ranks can only get smaller.

40
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:09,250
I multiply a rank 2 matrix by some other matrix, I've got a rank 2 situation.
