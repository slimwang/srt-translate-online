1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:02,776
Hey Chris, what are you looking at?

2
00:00:02,776 --> 00:00:05,040
>> Hey Katherine, checking out
this fantastic snow report app.

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,960
I think it's time to
head to the mountains.

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:07,800
>> Cool.
>> What are you up to?

5
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,560
>> Well, I'm heading to New York, so

6
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:11,660
I just want to check that
my flight is on time.

7
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:12,410
>> Nice.

8
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:14,160
Joe, what's going on over there?

9
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,676
>> I'm just catching up on the latest
celebrity tirade on Twitter.

10
00:00:16,676 --> 00:00:18,154
>> [LAUGH] Nice.

11
00:00:18,154 --> 00:00:19,720
How about you, Jessica?

12
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:22,070
>> I'm still playing with
the Miwok app we made.

13
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:24,430
But there's one thing that's
bugging me about it though.

14
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:25,170
>> What's that?

15
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:26,640
>> Well with all the apps you're using,

16
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,350
they all retrieve data
from the Internet.

17
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:30,890
But with the Miwok app we had to
know all the words ahead of time.

18
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:31,810
>> That's true.

19
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:33,270
>> Yeah,
what if we want to create an app

20
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:36,080
that displayed data about information
we can't know ahead of time?

21
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:40,534
So things like the weather, or-
>> [SOUND] My gosh.

22
00:00:40,534 --> 00:00:41,868
What was that?

23
00:00:41,868 --> 00:00:43,514
It's an earthquake, get down.

24
00:00:43,514 --> 00:00:48,464
>> [SOUND] No, my latte.

25
00:00:48,464 --> 00:00:50,900
>> Earthquake tweet.

26
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:52,640
>> Joe,
how can you be tweeting right now?

27
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,000
The ground is literally moving.

28
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,860
>> It's okay, just breath Chris.

29
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:57,960
Sometimes this happens in California.

30
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:01,648
Wait, I think it just stopped.

31
00:01:01,648 --> 00:01:08,329
[BLANK_AUDIO]

32
00:01:08,329 --> 00:01:12,327
>> Whoa, I am definitely going
to need another cup of coffee.

33
00:01:12,327 --> 00:01:13,830
>> Are you okay, Chris?

34
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:16,200
>> I think that was my first earthquake.

35
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,440
How strong do you think that was?

36
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,410
>> That was pretty strong.

37
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:19,660
Let me check.

38
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:22,260
Actually, this could make
a really good app idea.

39
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:23,060
>> Yeah, what would it do?

40
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:26,540
>> Well it could show you like
the recent earthquakes in the world,

41
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:27,550
like this one.

42
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:28,110
>> Yeah, and

43
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:31,160
you could use it to make a more informed
decision about where you want to live.

44
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,870
>> Yeah, I guess so.

45
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:35,220
But seriously, if we were
going to build an app like this,

46
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,280
well we would need the earthquake data.

47
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,420
But then how would we
get it onto the phone?

48
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:41,740
>> You know,
I think Joe could help us out with this.

49
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:43,960
He seems to know a thing or
two about networking.

50
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:44,520
>> Yeah, totally.

51
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:47,620
We can pull data into an app
just like we browse the web.

52
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:48,470
>> Yeah.

53
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:49,620
>> Cool.

54
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:52,490
In this next course, you're going to
be building an earthquake app.

55
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:54,990
I'm going to let Chris and
Joe guide you along the way.

56
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:55,870
>> Sounds a like of fun Joe.

57
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:57,410
Let's get started.

58
00:01:57,410 --> 00:02:02,794
>> Building an earthquake app, #ohyeah.
