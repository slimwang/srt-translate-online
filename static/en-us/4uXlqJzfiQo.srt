00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,120
Now that we have seen
an address translation,

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:04,960
let's do an address translation quiz.

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:09,300
Suppose that we have a process with
a page table that only has four entries

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:12,310
that contain these frame numbers.

5
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:16,449
Suppose that this machine has
a 16-bit virtual address base, and

6
00:00:16,449 --> 00:00:19,130
a 20-bit physical address space.

7
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:22,140
That is,
the virtual address is a 16-bit address.

8
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:25,030
But the physical address
is a 20-bit address.

9
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:28,080
Then, given this 16-bit virtual address,

10
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,460
what is the physical
address it translates into?

11
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:36,240
And given this virtual address, what
physical address does it translate into?
