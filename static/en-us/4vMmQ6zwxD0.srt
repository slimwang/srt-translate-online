1
00:00:00,355 --> 00:00:01,430
Here's sort of the last thing.

2
00:00:01,430 --> 00:00:03,510
I guess I'm kind of done with
solution concepts, right?

3
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:06,060
So I said that we've
done Nash Equilibrium.

4
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:07,400
We did Subgame Perfect.

5
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:10,240
We have now done Correlated Equilibrium,
and

6
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,990
we're not going to talk about
any of these other things.

7
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:12,698
So I guess we're done.

8
00:00:12,698 --> 00:00:15,990
>> I was really hoping that we would
talk about at least the Coco thing.

9
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:19,430
I think we said in a summary that
there's more to say about that.

10
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:21,400
>> Well there's more to say
about everything, Michael.

11
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:22,552
But that doesn't mean
that we have to say it.

12
00:00:22,552 --> 00:00:25,826
Just because we can do something
it does not follow that we should.

13
00:00:25,826 --> 00:00:28,580
>> So but, I mean, Coco is interesting
in some of the same ways that

14
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:30,525
Correlated Equilibrium
are interested in.

15
00:00:30,525 --> 00:00:33,734
Sort of sort of goes a little
bit beyond it in some ways.

16
00:00:33,734 --> 00:00:36,953
I feel like it would kind of round
out the story really nicely.

17
00:00:36,953 --> 00:00:39,414
>> Okay, well, you know I'm a big
fan of story rounding-outing.

18
00:00:39,414 --> 00:00:42,870
So
>> [LAUGH] With TD TD MDT.

19
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:44,730
>> I am more than happy
to let you do that.

20
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:45,521
Would you like to?

21
00:00:45,521 --> 00:00:46,697
>> Sure!
Yeah, I can do that.

22
00:00:46,697 --> 00:00:48,357
>> Okay, well then, here's the pen.

23
00:00:48,357 --> 00:00:50,749
>> Great, so if you just don't mind.

24
00:00:50,749 --> 00:00:51,608
Wait, no, aah!

25
00:00:51,608 --> 00:00:54,900
[BEEP] Great,
now I will take it from there.
