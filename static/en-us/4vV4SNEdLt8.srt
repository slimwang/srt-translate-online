1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Now, how do we do Q Learning?

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Well, we start off with this table of Q values--

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
and notice that there's more entries in this

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
table than there were in the utility table.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
So for each state, I've divided it up

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
into different actions--so here's the action of going north, south, east or west

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
from this particular state.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
They all start out with utility--

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
or rather Q utility, at zero.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
But as we go, we start to update,

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
and we have an update formula that's very

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
similar to the formula for TD learning.

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
It has the same learning rate, Alpha,

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
and the same discount factor, Gamma;

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
and we just start applying that.

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
So we start tracking through the state space,

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
and when we get a transition--say we go

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
east from here,

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
and then east and then north and then north;

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
and then east--

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
and then we would back up this value;

22
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
and depending on what the values of Alpha and Gamma were,

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
we might update this to .6 or something;

24
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
and then the next time through,

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:16,000
we might update that to .7, and update this one to .4, and so on.

26
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
In each case, we'd be updating

27
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
only the action we took,

28
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
associated with that state, not the whole state.

29
00:01:24,000 --> 99:59:59,999
We'd keep repeating that process until we had values filled in for all the action state pairs.
