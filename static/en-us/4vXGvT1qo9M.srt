00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,380
Learning a programming language is
a bit like learning a spoken language,

2
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:05,520
at least at first.

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:06,730
Take a look at this paragraph.

4
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:08,830
It's made up of multiple sentences,
which are,

5
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:11,740
in turn, made up of words and
punctuation marks.

6
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:14,930
We can reuse these elements in different
combinations to change the meanings of

7
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:16,490
these sentences.

8
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:18,090
Code isn't all that different.

9
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:20,980
All these symbols might seem like random
patterns that don't amount to much

10
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:23,730
right now, but that's just because
you haven't learned the words,

11
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:27,250
parts of speech, and
punctuation marks of this new language.

12
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:28,960
Let's take a look at some
of the basic elements that

13
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,240
make up a line of code in Ruby.
