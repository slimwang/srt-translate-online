1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:02,969
Users of a system want the cake and

2
00:00:02,969 --> 00:00:06,400
to eat it too. They want good performance from

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,980
the operating system, but they also want the

4
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:12,050
operating system to be robust and recover from such

5
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:14,950
failures. That is, they want the operating system

6
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:19,560
to be reliable. Conventional wisdom is that performance and

7
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,920
reliability are opposing concerns. That is, you can

8
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,364
have one or the other, but not both. Quick

9
00:00:26,364 --> 00:00:29,060
Silver's approach is that if recovery is taken

10
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:32,210
seriously from the get-go, you can design the

11
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:35,380
system to be robust to failures without losing

12
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:38,490
much on performance. Let's have another trivia quiz.
