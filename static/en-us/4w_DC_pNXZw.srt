1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:03,380
PAS allocated a private
IP address by default and

2
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:04,915
cannot be reached
outside of the cluster.

3
00:00:04,915 --> 00:00:09,010
I used a kubectl port-forward
command to map a local port

4
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:11,320
to a port inside the monolith pod.

5
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:12,710
Use two terminals.

6
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:15,460
One to run the kubectl
port-forward command and

7
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:17,850
the other to issue kernel commands.

8
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:21,550
Now in our new terminal we'll
start talking to our pod.

9
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:22,490
Okay.

10
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:24,935
Let's see what happens when
we hit the secure end point.

11
00:00:24,935 --> 00:00:30,760
Uh-oh, let's try logging in to get
it off token back from our monolith.

12
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:35,030
I'll use the super secret
password password as my password.

13
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:40,535
We'll use the JWT token from the output
to hit our secure endpoint and

14
00:00:40,535 --> 00:00:44,245
it works and
everything is good in the world again.

15
00:00:44,245 --> 00:00:48,145
Here is the kubectl logs command to
view the logs for the monolith pod.

16
00:00:49,535 --> 00:00:51,230
Let's open another terminal and

17
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:54,710
use the -f flag to get a stream
of logs happening in real time.

18
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:59,120
And as you can see,
the logs are updating in real time.

19
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:04,239
We can use kubectl exec command
to run an interactive show

20
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,140
inside the model of POD.

21
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:09,650
This come in handy when you want
troubleshoot from within the container.

22
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:13,082
For example, once we have a shell
into the mile of container we

23
00:01:13,082 --> 00:01:16,250
can test external connectivity
using the ping command.

24
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:18,282
[BLANK_AUDIO]

25
00:01:18,282 --> 00:01:22,060
Then when you're done with the
interactive show, be sure to log out.

26
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:27,550
As you can see, interacting with PAS is
as easy as using the kubectl command,

27
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:30,240
whether you're trying to hit
your containers remotely or

28
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,680
trying to get a log in shell for
troubleshooting.

29
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:35,650
