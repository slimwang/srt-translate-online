Hi! I'm Miriam and I'll be the assistant instructor for CS222.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Now, I personally think that Math matters a lot but I know there's some skeptics out there

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
so hopefully by the end of this course you'll know better.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
This is the first course that I'm working at Udacity and I'm really, really excited to be part of it.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Aside from the fact that I really love Math and Physics and learning about pretty much anything,

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'm a yoga teacher and I really love to bake anything. I'm not really into cooking though.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I really only like baking sweet things like pie and cake and brownies and cheesecake

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
and kind of anything that taste good.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
In terms of this course, I'll be helping you guys out on the forums

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
and by filming to explain the problem sets.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
So now that you know a little bit more about me, I'm looking forward to seeing you in the forums

12
00:00:40,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and good luck in the class.
