00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:03,980
Here's the 1-D Block Row algorithm for
matrix multiply.

2
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:08,460
Let tau be the time per floating
point operation, or flop for short.

3
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:12,300
In this case flop is a shorthand for

4
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:16,390
say a floating point multiply or
a floating point add.

5
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:17,650
It does not mean a terrible movie.

6
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:23,010
So if tau is the time per flop, then the
total time this algorithm spends doing

7
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:26,000
multiplies and
adds is 2 tau n cubed / p.

8
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:30,570
Pause to convince yourself that
this is true before you move on.

9
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:32,150
Here's my question.

10
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:34,390
What is the time spent on communication?

11
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:38,280
I want you to type your
answer symbolically here.

12
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:41,970
As usual, assume our alpha
beta model of communication.

13
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:44,880
Type a little a for alpha,
and little b for beta.
