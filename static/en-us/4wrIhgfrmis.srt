00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,719
So far we've talked about functions from a mathematical perspective, but

2
00:00:03,719 --> 00:00:07,900
this is a computer and in a computer everything has to be digital and

3
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:10,690
that gives us even some more restrictions okay.

4
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:13,690
So let's take a look at the grid that was

5
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:16,900
a little chunk taken out of the Phyllis Diller picture.

6
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:20,980
So here you see, in fact I had a little Matlab code right, it says pd.

7
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:22,070
Pd Phyllis Diller.

8
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:23,220
That was my array.

9
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:25,660
And this says rows 40 to 60.

10
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:27,280
Columns 30 to 40.

11
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:30,390
And that's the middle of Phyllis's face.

12
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:33,370
You might not have known it, but that's the middle of Phyllis's face.

13
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,800
By the way, one of the things you should realize is this is exactly the same

14
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,620
representation as the picture on the screen.

15
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:46,210
But you happen to have a vision system that will look at bright dots and

16
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:47,960
dark dots and see things.

17
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:52,090
And when you look at these numbers, you don't immediately see those things.

18
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:55,130
Mathematically, these are identical.

19
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:55,970
Oh, and by the way,

20
00:00:55,970 --> 00:01:01,120
something that I just mentioned, which is going to bite us in some place.

21
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:09,120
These are rows and these are columns rows go down columns go over

22
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:14,410
so x and y okay remember that we're going to do that now.
