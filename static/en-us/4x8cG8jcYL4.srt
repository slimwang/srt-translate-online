00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,450
Looking again at our state diagram,

2
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:05,080
we can see that the diagram
is a directed graph.

3
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:09,340
That is, it's a set of nodes with
arrows leading between them.

4
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:13,260
Notice that BURLAP has a class
called GraphDefinedDomain,

5
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:16,050
which implements
the DomainGenerator interface.

6
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:18,990
Looking at the description for
GraphDefinedDomain,

7
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:23,960
we see that it indeed generates domain
objects that are represented as graphs.

8
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:26,630
This is the type of domain
generator that we will use.
