Hi, Micheal.

2
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:01,960
>> Hi, Charles.
How's it going?

3
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:03,440
>> It is going quite fine.

4
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:04,220
How's it going with you?

5
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:07,080
>> Well this seems really exciting
it looks like maybe you're going to

6
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:08,240
drive the next lesson.

7
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,490
>> I am going to drive the next lesson,

8
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:13,250
and the next lesson is
called Game Theory Three.

9
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:14,900
>> Game Theory Three.

10
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:18,740
I feel like that presupposes the
existence of Game Theories One and Two.

11
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:21,610
>> We have in fact done
Game Theories One and Two,

12
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:23,230
we did it in the last class.

13
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:25,573
And so there's no point in
doing it all over again.

14
00:00:25,573 --> 00:00:30,080
>> [LAUGH] Okay but
maybe people don't remember all of that.

15
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,660
>> Well I'm sure they
don't because I don't so

16
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:36,450
maybe what we should do is we should
do another Scooby Doo flashback.

17
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:38,520
>> Ahh, and
we can do this in a super special way.

18
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:39,400
>> Because?

19
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,830
>> We're actually in the same
place at the same time.

20
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:42,520
>> Yeah.
It's crazy.

21
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,658
>> When's the last time that happened?

22
00:00:43,658 --> 00:00:45,447
>> Yesterday right.

23
00:00:45,447 --> 00:00:46,254
That's true, but

24
00:00:46,254 --> 00:00:49,484
this is the first time we're actually
recording something like this that we

25
00:00:49,484 --> 00:00:52,520
are able to actually do that in a way
that it makes sense that the people.

26
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,832
>> Good.
>> So let's do this go to flash we're

27
00:00:53,832 --> 00:00:54,753
going to do it together.

28
00:00:54,753 --> 00:00:55,926
>> Sure.
>> Let's do it together, okay.

29
00:00:55,926 --> 00:00:56,448
You ready?

30
00:00:56,448 --> 00:00:56,987
>> Uh-huh.

31
00:00:56,987 --> 00:00:58,553
>> All right.Okay.

32
00:00:58,553 --> 00:00:59,749
You ready?

33
00:00:59,749 --> 00:01:00,608
Let's do it.

34
00:01:00,608 --> 00:01:05,279
