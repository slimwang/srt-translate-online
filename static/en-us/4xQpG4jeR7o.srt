1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:01,370
Do you remember Cat Clicker?

2
00:00:01,370 --> 00:00:04,510
Do you remember the pain on Andy's face as the project

3
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:07,600
requirements changed again, and again, and again?

4
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:10,840
I remember it very well.

5
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:11,400
Poor Andy.

6
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:13,620
Well, a, anyway.

7
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:15,630
Our final version has two main areas.

8
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:17,760
It's going to have a list of cats, and

9
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,410
a cat detail area, where you can click on the currently selected cat.

10
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:24,280
Well as it turns out, the last few lessons have gotten us ready to

11
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:27,780
build Cat Clicker, and this time we'll build it right.

12
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:29,960
Now, I'll tell you from personal experience.

13
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:33,350
Even though, I've built a lot of applications and structures with wood, too, for

14
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:36,740
that matter, one thing I hate doing, is planning.

15
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:40,460
But every time I don't plan things out, they end up taking much more time.

16
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:42,970
And by the end, I wish I'd spent the extra time to plan.

17
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:45,420
So, let's take some time and plan this out.
