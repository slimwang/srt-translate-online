00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,100
I hope you've been notice that the theme here in our units are different types

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:07,312
of expressions. We've been learning the skills into perform operations on

3
00:00:07,312 --> 00:00:12,166
polynomials, rational expressions, and now radicals. The last operation mean to

4
00:00:12,166 --> 00:00:16,776
learn radicals is division. We can think of the division of two radicals as

5
00:00:16,776 --> 00:00:21,793
fraction. We'll have root two divided by root five. But for radical

6
00:00:21,793 --> 00:00:26,430
expressions, we don't want a radical to appear in the denominator. There are

7
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:29,811
few reasons why we want to change this. First, it's typically easier to

8
00:00:29,811 --> 00:00:33,166
approximate this division if we divide it by an integer here rather than a

9
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:37,519
radical. Secondly, we can determine if the expressions are equivalent to other

10
00:00:37,519 --> 00:00:41,523
expressions by changing what this fraction looks like. Keep in mind that when

11
00:00:41,523 --> 00:00:44,437
we rationalize a denominator, we're going to change what the fraction looks

12
00:00:44,437 --> 00:00:48,850
like but we won't change it's value. What do you think we can multiply the

13
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:54,170
numerator and denominator by so that we have a denominator without a radical?

14
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:57,626
We want to multiply by a form of 1 here so whatever we multiply this

15
00:00:57,626 --> 00:01:02,730
denominator by, we'd also multiply this numerator by.
