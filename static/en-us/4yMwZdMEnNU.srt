1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,330
Let's check our understanding
of N-module redundancy.

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:07,970
Suppose we have a computer and we want
to tolerate faults that can occur there.

3
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:12,350
So we go to store and buy two more
computers just like the first one and

4
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:14,590
put all of them on the same desk.

5
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:17,780
And our approach to redundancy
is that we run every computation

6
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:21,020
on all three computers,
we compare their outputs, and

7
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:25,170
we take that output on which two or
all three agree.

8
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:30,110
And with this approach we think
we can tolerate any single event

9
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:31,660
of the following kinds.

10
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:34,960
Check each of those
that can be tolerated.

11
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,620
Can we tolerate any single alpha
particle strike in a processor?

12
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:42,220
Can we tolerate any
single building collapse?

13
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:45,960
Can we tolerate any single earthquake?

14
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,290
And can we tolerate any mistake
in single processor design?
