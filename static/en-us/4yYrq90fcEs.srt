00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
So I want you to program this in the IDE where there are three input parameters P⁰, P¹ and P².

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
For those values, you should get a 1/3 and for those values over here, 0.01 as a prior

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:21,000
0.7 as sensitivity and 0.9 as specificity, you'll get 0.066 approximately.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So write this code and check whether these examples work for you.
