00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:04,080
Power-ups are a classic game mechanic,
easily recognized by

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,117
anyone who has played a video
game in the last, actually ever.

3
00:00:08,117 --> 00:00:11,288
Well, the first power-up was probably
introduced back in 1980 with Pac-Man.

4
00:00:11,288 --> 00:00:14,866
And if there were power-ups
in video games before that,

5
00:00:14,866 --> 00:00:19,346
I neither confirm nor deny that I'm
old enough to have collected them.

6
00:00:19,346 --> 00:00:23,059
But anyway, a power-up is just an object
that gives the player some ability or

7
00:00:23,059 --> 00:00:26,870
other benefit, like super speed,
additional ammo, an extra life.

8
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:27,750
You get the idea.

9
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:31,220
Of course, it's up to you whether or
not they appear in your game.

10
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:34,113
What they do, how and
when you let players collect them, and

11
00:00:34,113 --> 00:00:35,430
there are a lot of options.

12
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:39,110
You can place them randomly or
at spots you preselect.

13
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:42,522
You can spawn them when an enemy dies or
a puzzle is completed.

14
00:00:42,522 --> 00:00:46,280
You can make it so a player collects
power-ups just by touching them.

15
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:50,512
Or require some other, more involved
process, like smashing a chest, or

16
00:00:50,512 --> 00:00:51,660
digging out a wall.

17
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:55,330
There's certainly nothing that says you
have to have power-ups in your game.

18
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:57,711
But they really have
stood the test of time.

19
00:00:57,711 --> 00:01:00,386
I think most game players would
agree that they add something to

20
00:01:00,386 --> 00:01:01,150
the experience.
