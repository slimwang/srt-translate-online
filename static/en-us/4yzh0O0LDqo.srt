1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,680
Logging into a Unix system checks your
user name and password against a special

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:07,310
table of user names and passwords that
can only be read by the group user.

3
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:09,870
Group authenticates you as a user,
and logs you in to the machine.

4
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:12,860
Once you're logged in,

5
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:16,170
if you attempt to access a file,
this is when authorization is at play.

6
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:20,380
Before you can read or
write a file to a Unix system,

7
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:24,030
the operating system checks to see if
you are authorized access to that file.

8
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:27,020
This isn't authentication because
since you are already logged in,

9
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:30,270
you do not have to authenticate
yourself again to access the file.

10
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:33,690
If you have the right password to a zip
file, you are authorized to open it

11
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:36,740
without having to identify who you are,
so this is authorization.

12
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:41,090
When you cross a border into a country,
you must first present a passport to

13
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:43,780
identify who you are and
what country you are from.

14
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:45,120
So that's authentication.

15
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,520
Although, between some countries,
a passport is sufficient for

16
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,360
entry, many countries require a visa for
entering another country.

17
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,800
The visa can specify the things you
can do, like work or study, and

18
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,910
how long you're allowed
to stay in the country.

19
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:59,050
So this is definitely
an issue of authorization.
