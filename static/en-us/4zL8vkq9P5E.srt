1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Here's our formula again. Let's assume I have the following the data.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
There's an x variable, y variable, and we have four data points.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,000
6 goes to 7, 2 to 3, 1 to 2, -1 to 0, and very quickly we can just look at the data diagram.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
In this case, a scatter plot. So here's the x axis and here's the y axis.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:28,000
And if I plug the data, 6 goes to 7, just about here, 2 to 3, 1 to 2, and 1- to 0,

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
not surprisingly this data is in fact, linear.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Whatever nonlinear you see is because of my poor drawing skills.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
And if you analyze carefully, you already saw that y is always respond larger than x.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
So before we apply the formula, let's just quickly guess what b and a would be,

10
00:00:45,000 --> 99:59:59,999
if y is always found larger than x. What are the coefficients of b and a?
