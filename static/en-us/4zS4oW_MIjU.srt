1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,890
I don't know about you,
but I'm very noncommittal.

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:06,160
I would have check nothing on
the grounds of insufficient info, or

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:07,830
maybe just laziness.

4
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:09,370
So why did I make this choice?

5
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:12,090
Well, remember our goals are low
work and high intensity.

6
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:15,905
In this case,
Algorithm 1 does less asymptotic work.

7
00:00:15,905 --> 00:00:17,525
But what about intensity?

8
00:00:17,525 --> 00:00:19,675
Intensity of Algorithm 1 is a constant,

9
00:00:19,675 --> 00:00:24,155
the intensity of Algorithm 2 grows
asymptotically with n and z.

10
00:00:24,155 --> 00:00:27,355
So knowing nothing else, we can't tell
if we can satisfy both our goals.
