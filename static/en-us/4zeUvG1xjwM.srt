1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,050
Alright, so we're going to go in the opposite direction now. And we're

2
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:05,040
saying, we're going to tell you what we want y to be, we

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,550
want y to be the or function. So it should be outputting

4
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:11,400
a one if either x one or x two is one, and

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,810
otherwise it should output a zero. And what you need to do

6
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:17,700
is fill in numbers for weight one, weight two, and theta so

7
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:21,380
that it has that semantics. Now, just so you know, there is

8
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:25,770
no unique answer here. There's a whole bunch of answers that will work,

9
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:27,570
but we're going to check to see that

10
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:29,530
you've actually typed in one that, that works.
