1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,020
All right, so to modify word costs,

2
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:05,320
to support an image,
we're going to need to add two things.

3
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:09,699
So, first we need to add a private
integer variable in order to hold

4
00:00:09,699 --> 00:00:11,275
our image resource ID.

5
00:00:11,275 --> 00:00:15,388
Because this is a member variable,
I'm going to call it mImageResourceId so

6
00:00:15,388 --> 00:00:19,710
that it matches the naming style
of our other member variables.

7
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:23,585
And secondly, we're going to need to
add a getter method for this variable.

8
00:00:23,585 --> 00:00:28,326
So here we made it a private variable
but we'll need to access it from outside

9
00:00:28,326 --> 00:00:31,225
so we're going to have to
write a public method.

10
00:00:31,225 --> 00:00:34,797
I'm going to call my method
getImageResourceId and

11
00:00:34,797 --> 00:00:38,804
notice that it takes no inputs and
it will return an int.

12
00:00:38,804 --> 00:00:43,925
So within this method, I'm going to
say that it returns mImageResourceId.

13
00:00:43,925 --> 00:00:46,560
All right, so those are all the changes
that we need to make to the word class.

14
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:50,730
All right, so run the app on your device
to make sure that this code change

15
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:52,220
didn't break anything.

16
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:55,480
So if we tap into a category, you'll
notice that there's no visible change in

17
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:59,420
the app, because we're not making use
of this new color variable just yet.

18
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:01,250
But we will be in the next coding quiz.
