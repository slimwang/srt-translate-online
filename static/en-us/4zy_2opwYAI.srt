00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:04,035
The domain is only going to contain values of x for which the function is

2
00:00:04,035 --> 00:00:08,734
defined. Let's start off with the domain. The domain is just the set of inputs

3
00:00:08,734 --> 00:00:14,380
over here, for which the function is defined. So, the only ones that actually

4
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:19,658
map two values over in the f of x oval are 1, 2, and 4. So, those values

5
00:00:19,658 --> 00:00:24,046
together are the set that is our domain. Since 3 and 5 aren't actually paired

6
00:00:24,046 --> 00:00:28,302
with anything, over here in f of x. In other words, if you plug these inputs

7
00:00:28,302 --> 00:00:32,806
into the function, you won't get a output, they are not part of our domain. Now,

8
00:00:32,806 --> 00:00:38,180
our range it's a set of values that the domain values map to. So that's going to

9
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:44,730
be 20 from the 1, the 2 maps to 80, and then 4 maps to 80 as well. But since 80

10
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:48,970
is already in the set, we don't repeat it. Now remember, this does still count

11
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:53,392
as a function even though there's a shared value in the range between two values

12
00:00:53,392 --> 00:00:54,300
in the domain.
