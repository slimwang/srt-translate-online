1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,106
Well we know that these two hypotenuses
must be the same.

2
00:00:04,106 --> 00:00:07,099
This hypotenuse, and this hypotenuse

3
00:00:07,099 --> 00:00:10,221
were both measured using a length of the string.

4
00:00:10,221 --> 00:00:12,553
The length of the string is 50cm

5
00:00:12,553 --> 00:00:17,688
and it hasn't changed since when we created
this triangle from the first triangle.

6
00:00:17,688 --> 00:00:21,192
We only change the position of the end of the string

7
00:00:21,192 --> 00:00:23,194
when creating a second triangle.

8
00:00:23,194 --> 00:00:25,432
So the length of the string didn't change

9
00:00:25,432 --> 00:00:29,432
so we know these two lengths must be equal.
