1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,380
So the bottom line is, cameras are everywhere, and

2
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:05,550
they're having an impact on everything.

3
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:09,520
And this is why computational photography, which is in the area of trying to

4
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:12,680
understand the best possible ways to capture images,

5
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:15,040
is becoming relevant and important.

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,770
To summarize, I basically talked about the pervasiveness of

7
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:20,840
a camera in our society.

8
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:23,760
Basically talked about how computational photography builds on

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,130
other disciplines.

10
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:28,100
And basically talked about relationship between photography, and

11
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:32,009
traditional photography, and digital photography, implying again that

12
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:36,630
computational photography sits above all of them, and can encompass all of them,

13
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:39,740
primarily with the assumptions that computers are ubiquitous and

14
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:43,902
so are cameras and by combining them we are actually generating new ways of

15
00:00:43,902 --> 00:00:46,450
capturing the environment and sharing them with each other.

16
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:50,010
Again, more information on this available on the web.

17
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:54,230
I'll be putting up a bunch of links on this stuff after the classes.

18
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:57,680
And basically I believe that there's a strong need for us to

19
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:01,650
continue working on computational photography, because of reasons like this and

20
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:05,419
also because it impacts how we capture our environment around us.

21
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:10,265
So now we will move to much more of the technical nuggets of this class.

22
00:01:10,265 --> 00:01:12,510
We will study what is an image and

23
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:15,430
basically start thinking about making things computational, so

24
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:18,990
that we can process and interact with the information that's in an image.
