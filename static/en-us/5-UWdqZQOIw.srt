1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
In addition to the questions on templates, we also got a lot of questions

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
about separating your data and your Python information

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
and your app handlers into multiple files.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Right now, we're basically doing everything in main.py,

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
which is okay because our web applications are small enough that it doesn't really matter.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
But if you're going to be writing something for production

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:34,000
for everyone potentially to be using, then that doesn't really work anymore.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Once you start getting into thousands or tens of thousands

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
or even more lines of code, it's just unfeasible.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
So there are a lot of ways you can do that depending on what language you're using

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
and what template engines you're using.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
The template editors we're going to be talking about in another video.

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
With Python it's actually pretty simple.

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Any Python files in the same folder you just say,

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
"import [the name of the file]" except for the file extension, .py,

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
and that's really about it.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
It's very simple to use.

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I will be linking to the docs on that, too, but that's essentially all you have to do for it.

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
And I would recommend if you're doing production web application design

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
or any kind of serious web application design, that you want to start separating that

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
into logical chunks so that it is easier for you to maintain,

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
and other people to maintain, too, if you're working with other people.
