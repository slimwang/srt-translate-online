1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Now I'd like to talk about the open discussion question

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
posted in the Homework 1.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
To review, Alice wants to send a message to Bob

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
using a one-time pad to let Bob know yes or no

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
if she's going to be taking CS387, and they're worried about Mallory,

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
who could possibly intercept the message and then change around the message

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
so that Bob would get the wrong message.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
And we saw in the question that Mallory could--

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
whatever she intercepts, she can't tell whether it's yes or no,

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,000
but she can XOR it with the difference between yes and no,

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
and that will flip the answer and some of this suggested--

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
solutions were to change yes and no to other things

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
thinking there was something special about yes and no, that those could be flipped.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
But you can flip anything, and you're flipping it by XORing it with the difference.

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Whatever was there was either yes or no XORed with some key.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
You don't know the key, but XORing that with the difference of them

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
will cancel out the Ys, or if this was an N, it would cancel out the Ns and leave the Y.

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
So whatever the message was, it can be XORed with the difference.

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
There's nothing special about Y or N.

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:20,000
It would work--let's say--if you replaced it with yes and not.

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
The difference is just Mallory would XOR it with the XOR of yes and not.

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
All of the solutions that were ideas about changing the content

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
don't really solve anything.

24
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Mallory knows the 2 options and can XOR them and can flip the content.

25
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
There are some other approaches that had better success, though.

26
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
There were 2 main styles.

27
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
For example, Steve Krenzel from Seattle suggested using

28
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
kind of more advanced crypto tools.

29
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,000
He wanted to append the nonce to the message and then hash the entire message.

30
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
So, I think what he was suggesting--which is a good solution to this--

31
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,000
is to take the yes or no, so you're still giving the response.

32
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
You're going to concatenate that with the nonce, which is just some random value.

33
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
We'll call it r.

34
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
This is long random value.

35
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:17,000
And then concatenate that with a hash of the y,

36
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
whatever the answer was, with the nonce.

37
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
And we haven't talked about hash functions yet in Unit 1,

38
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
but we do talk about them in Unit 2,

39
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
and a hash function is just a function that takes some input

40
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
and maps it in a complex and unpredictable way to some other value.

41
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
And that's useful because Bob can't predict what this value is

42
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
without knowing what the value of r is, and if the value of r is random

43
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
and not known to Bob, there's no way for Bob to predict the output of this hash.

44
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
If he tries to change this, well, there's no way to change it in a way

45
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
that knows the difference between what the result would be if this was an N

46
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
and when it was a Y, so Bob could flip these bits,

47
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
but then the hash value wouldn't be correct.

48
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I'm sorry, Mallory could flip these bits.

49
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Then the hash value wouldn't be correct, and Bob would know that it was wrong,

50
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
so this is a reasonable way to do it.

51
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
The difficulty with the solution is it involved cryptographic tools

52
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
that are much more complex than just the XOR hash functions are,

53
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
things we'll talk about in the next unit but involve a fair amount of computation.

54
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
It's not something you could easily do by hand.

55
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
What we want is some solution that would allow Alice and Bob to do this

56
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
without using any more advanced cryptographic tools.

57
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Yeah, the other style solution was one proposed by StirCat,

58
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
which involves sending a number of dashes--maybe 8 or 16 dashes in a row--

59
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
and then randomly picking one character to set to Y or N,

60
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
and what are your thoughts on that?

61
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
This is a really interesting idea.

62
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
We're going to take--instead of sending just one character,

63
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
we've got a string of 8 dashes, and we're randomly going to pick one of those

64
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
and replace it with either the Y or the N.

65
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
That's going to be the answer.

66
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
And now this means when Mallory intercepts it,

67
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
if she doesn't know which one was randomly picked,

68
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,000
well, she can XOR out the difference between a Y or N from any one of these 8,

69
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
but if she picks the wrong one, she's going to change a dash into something else.

70
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
And I don't know what it would be. We'd have to look at the numbers.

71
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
But it's not going to be a dash anymore, and so when Bob

72
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
looks at the result, it's going to look wrong.

73
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Bob will know the message was tampered with.

74
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
It's only if Mallory was lucky enough to guess the right one to flip

75
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
that she could change the answer, and her probability of guessing it correctly

76
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
is 1 over the number of positions here.

77
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
If we have 8, she has a 1 in 8 chance of guessing the right one and flipping that one.

78
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
The other times when she doesn't guess correctly she'll get caught.

79
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
This is pretty good. This has a nice property.

80
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
It means if we make a message long enough, we can make Mallory's success

81
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
probability as low as we want, but we need a really long message.

82
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,000
If we want her success to be less than 1 in 256,

83
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:58,000
we need a string that's 256 bytes long, which is not a big deal but is less elegant.

84
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
We could get a similar property with a shorter message

85
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
if instead of having only one of them depend on the choice

86
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
we make a short message where each of the characters in the message

87
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
depend on the yes or no value, but Alice randomly picks

88
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
either to send a Y or a 1 if the answer is yes

89
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
or to send an N or a 0, so let's say those are the 4 choices.

90
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
She's going to randomly pick.

91
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
If the answer is Y, she's going to send something like YY1Y,

92
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,000
randomly picking for each position whether to send a Y or a 1.

93
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
When Mallory intercepts this,

94
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:42,000
the XOR between Y and N is different from the XOR between 1 and 0.

95
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Those two are not equal, so for Mallory to flip an answer,

96
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
she's got to guess whether it was a Y or an N or a 1 or a 0,

97
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
and she can guess and flip one.

98
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
If she guesses them all correctly, then she could flip them all,

99
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
and Bob would see the wrong answer.

100
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
But if she guesses the one wrong, then Bob will see one of the characters

101
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:08,000
in the string doesn't match, and so now Mallory's probability

102
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,000
of guessing them all correct is ½ to the power of how many there are,

103
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,000
so if there were 4 characters, it would be ½ to the 4th or 1/16,

104
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
but this is a much lower success probability than we had

105
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
having the string of dashes where Mallory only had to guess

106
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
one position correctly out of that whole length.

107
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Now she's got to guess each position correctly with ½ chance for each time.

108
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
This just involves Alice picking randomly,

109
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
so we didn't need to add something beyond the one-time pad.

110
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Alice has to be able to flip a coin or some other source of randomness

111
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
to decide whether to send the Y or the 1 for each of these 4 positions

112
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
or more positions if she wants the success probability

113
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
to be lower than ½ to the 4th.

114
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Could you also do a lowercase y and a t for true and a lowercase t?

115
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
You could, yeah.

116
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Probably what you'd have to be careful about is if you did a lowercase y and a lowercase n.

117
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
The XOR of those might be the same as the difference between

118
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
the uppercase Y and uppercase N.

119
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I would guess if you did true and false,

120
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
those would be different, but you should be careful

121
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
and know that the XOR is not the same.

122
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
But as long as the XOR is different, then each byte

123
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Mallory has just ½ chance of making a change in the right way.

124
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Okay. I think that's all we have.

125
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Cool, so thanks for joining office hours, and thanks for all the discussion.

126
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
It looked like we got a lot of good responses to open discussion questions,

127
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
so hopefully we'll see that again in Homework 2.

128
00:07:31,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Thank you.>>Thanks.
