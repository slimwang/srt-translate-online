00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,740
There are four kinds of query standards,

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:07,730
each of which specifies a different
key element of distributed query.

3
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:12,270
Envelope standards define the package
for sending and receiving the queries.

4
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:17,300
Format standards provide a declarative
specification of the query.

5
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:21,130
We'll explain what that
means in the next exercise.

6
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:26,500
Results standards such as QRDA
we discussed in the last lesson

7
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:30,910
specified the format and
packaging of query results.

8
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:36,570
Data model standards such as CEDD,
Common Data Element Definitions

9
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:40,580
specified the data model that will link
data from the contributing systems.
