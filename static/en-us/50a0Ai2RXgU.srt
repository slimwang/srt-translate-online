1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,500
If the learning goals
are what you should know,

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:03,740
and the learning outcomes are what
you should be able to do.

3
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:06,410
Then the learning assessments
are how we assess whether or

4
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:07,730
not you know what you need to know.

5
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:10,940
And can do what you need to be able
to do by the end of this course.

6
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:12,930
Here the assessments are going
to be very authentic.

7
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:14,250
The overall outcome we aim for

8
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:17,900
is that you should be able to contribute
to the field of educational technology.

9
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:19,290
So the assessment will
be based on whether or

10
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:22,170
not you contributed to the field
of educational technology.

11
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:25,270
You'll build a tool, conduct some
research, evaluate some technology.

12
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:28,040
But by the end of this course
you'll have actually contributed to

13
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:29,705
the community of educational technology.

14
00:00:29,705 --> 00:00:32,390
Now, there will be a lot of
milestones along the way.

15
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:33,650
Before you can get to your contribution,

16
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:36,440
you need to demonstrate
your mastery of some topic.

17
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:37,550
You need to propose your idea.

18
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:42,140
You need to execute your plan, and then
you need to deliver your final results.

19
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:45,200
By the end of it you will have created
a real contribution to the educational

20
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,120
technology community.
