00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:04,680
When building forms, you've got one main
objective, getting more conversions.

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:08,640
That's when a new visitor to your
site sign up or make a purchase and

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:12,460
nothing is more effective than making
forms quick and easy to finish.

4
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:15,500
>> Yeah, that makes sense because
the less users have to type,

5
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,930
the less that's in the way
between them and converting.

6
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:19,200
It's pretty simple.

7
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,180
You know, in my mind the best
example of a super fast form

8
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:24,310
is Amazon's One Click Ordering.

9
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:26,690
It's great because you're
just done in milliseconds.

10
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:29,840
>> True, that's a fast form but
it only works for

11
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:33,520
some products and
only if the users are already signed in.

12
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,150
For all other situations,
it pay to help out your users.

13
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:39,770
Guide them through useful labels,
pronged validation, and

14
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:41,150
progress indicators.

15
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:43,990
Build their confidence and
watch your conversions go up.

16
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:45,690
>> That's great advice, let's do it.
