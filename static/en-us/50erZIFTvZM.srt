Here's our second challenge problem for U-substitution. Now again, there won't

2
00:00:04,279 --> 00:00:07,594
be a solution video for this problem, but there are two different ways that you

3
00:00:07,594 --> 00:00:11,974
can solve it. You can either use U-substitution by making some sort of

4
00:00:11,974 --> 00:00:16,827
substitution for these negative exponents and this variable. Or if you remember

5
00:00:16,827 --> 00:00:20,589
what a negative exponent means, you can rewrite this entire equation and solve

6
00:00:20,589 --> 00:00:25,584
it using something you've already done before. I hope you take on this

7
00:00:25,584 --> 00:00:26,290
challenge.
