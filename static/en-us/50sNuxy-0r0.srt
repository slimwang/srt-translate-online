We're trying to develop a linear equation based off of two points of data that

2
00:00:04,364 --> 00:00:08,705
we have. Remembering that our graphs earlier had c on the horizontal axis and n

3
00:00:08,705 --> 00:00:13,244
on the vertical axis, we can translate this information into two points. We have

4
00:00:13,244 --> 00:00:17,660
the point 20,14,000 and the point 80, 2,000, we can now use these two points to

5
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:22,007
find the slope of a line connecting them and then pick one of these two points

6
00:00:22,007 --> 00:00:26,812
to use with the slope in the point-slope form. The slope of the line connecting

7
00:00:26,812 --> 00:00:31,647
these two points, we can find is negative 200. I chose to use the point 80,

8
00:00:31,647 --> 00:00:36,847
2,000, along with the slope, to create a point-slope form of this equation for

9
00:00:36,847 --> 00:00:42,219
this line, and then I transform that to be in slope-intercept form. So our final

10
00:00:42,219 --> 00:00:45,383
answer is, n equals negative 200 c plus 18,000.
