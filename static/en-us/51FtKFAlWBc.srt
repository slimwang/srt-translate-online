00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,606
I'm here with Stephen Jones, who's a senior software engineer at Nvidia.

2
00:00:03,613 --> 00:00:05,312
Stephen, tell us about your job.

3
00:00:05,312 --> 00:00:10,449
>> I am the CUDA lead at Nvidia, which means that I'm responsible for the

4
00:00:10,449 --> 00:00:14,877
programming model and for the engineering which goes behind that.

5
00:00:14,877 --> 00:00:20,219
So, when we look at the set of things we could do for CUDA, for example,

6
00:00:20,219 --> 00:00:23,088
the list is long--50, 60 things that we could do.

7
00:00:23,088 --> 00:00:25,670
We've got time for maybe 5 or 10 of them.

8
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:30,093
And so I sit and evaluate what we can do, what's useful to do, what's the right direction.

9
00:00:30,093 --> 00:00:32,008
I'm not the only person who makes these decisions.

10
00:00:32,008 --> 00:00:34,458
But I'm the engineering end of that.

11
00:00:34,458 --> 00:00:36,649
So I, I sit there and figure out what the resources

12
00:00:36,649 --> 00:00:39,487
are going to need to be, and what different groups we

13
00:00:39,487 --> 00:00:42,000
have to pull together to make these things happen.
