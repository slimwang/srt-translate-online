1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:02,240
Well for question one, how many outer most states?

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:03,830
There's two we've already said this dead and

3
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:08,520
alive states. Which button must be pressed to turn on the alarm clock feature?

4
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:13,340
That's button a. In the alive state how many current machines are running?

5
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:18,280
Well there's five. There's the main one, the power state, the light state and

6
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:22,770
the two that are labeled alarm-st and chime-st.

7
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:27,780
When the C button is pressed to set the time, which part is first,

8
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:32,880
that's, the user changes the second setting first. And then

9
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:38,150
the question about what unexpected side effect. When Harel was at Georgia Tech,

10
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:42,710
he told us about how when doing the modeling of his digital watch.

11
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:46,280
He found a bug in the way that it ran. Whenever you hit that B-button,

12
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,290
it turned on the light whether you needed the light turned or not.

13
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:54,160
Going back to the garage door opener for a minute, when I modeled the garage

14
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,300
door opener of my house, I found that there was a bug in its system as well.

15
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:01,200
The bug arose when I was going on vacation and I was hitting

16
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:05,160
the security feature. Now this wasn't in the example that I showed you, but.

17
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:09,310
The real state machine for the garage door opener has a security feature and

18
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:14,470
that turns off the remote the remote control so you can't open the garage on

19
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:20,050
the outside and what I was going to do was start the door go, door going down,

20
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:25,280
hit the security feature and duck out underneath. Okay the system had

21
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:30,660
not been designed to change that security feature as the door was going down and

22
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:35,330
I lock myself out. Okay, and it's another

23
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:40,750
indication that getting these reactive systems correct is quite difficult and

24
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:44,930
careful modeling of things is important. To make sure that you don't get

25
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:50,000
into these embarrassing or possibly situations that lead to safety problems.
