00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,131
Now that we have what equation, we need to set up another one. The other

2
00:00:04,131 --> 00:00:08,313
equation needs to involve interest. I know if I add the interest from one

3
00:00:08,313 --> 00:00:12,863
account and the interest from the other account, I'll get my total interest of

4
00:00:12,863 --> 00:00:17,350
$787.50. But I need to find the interest first. To find the interest, we take

5
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:22,108
the rate and multiply it by the amount of money. For example, one of their rates

6
00:00:22,108 --> 00:00:26,363
is 7 point 5 percent. And, the amount of money that I invested at 7 point 5

7
00:00:26,363 --> 00:00:31,156
percent was, well, x. I don't know it. Remember, our equation should involve two

8
00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:35,533
variables, x and y. So, we need to make sure that it appears in the terms. We

9
00:00:35,533 --> 00:00:40,219
convert the percentage rate, 7 point 5 percent, to a decimal, and multiply it by

10
00:00:40,219 --> 00:00:44,882
x. So, this is the first term. So what are the other terms in the equation. What

11
00:00:44,882 --> 00:00:48,897
should go here in the second interest. What should go here in the total

12
00:00:48,897 --> 00:00:51,762
interest. You can write the terms in these boxes.
