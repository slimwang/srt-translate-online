00:00:02,428 --> 00:00:07,228
There's the standard fields that
supervised machine learning is

3
00:00:07,228 --> 00:00:12,028
typically applied to,
including things like ads optimization,

4
00:00:12,028 --> 00:00:17,440
ranking hotel research results for
Expedia and things along those lines.

5
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,160
All the use cases that we've read in
that area have been very successful.

6
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:24,870
We've also touched the large number of
use cases where it was unknown what

7
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:28,960
the current state of the art is or how
well machines could do in our problem.

8
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,350
Another one of my favorites touched
natural language processing.

9
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:35,930
We took a dataset of about
28,000 student written essays

10
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:38,400
from middle school and
high school students,

11
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:42,860
that were given a state standardized
exams across four different states.

12
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:47,160
And then we challenged our community to
develop automatic methods to grade these

13
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,190
essays.

14
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:52,382
So they can learn from training
stats how teacher grades

15
00:00:52,382 --> 00:00:57,017
correspond to both the prompt and
the content in the essays and

16
00:00:57,017 --> 00:00:59,976
then apply that to a new test of essays.

17
00:00:59,976 --> 00:01:03,816
And it turns out that at the end of the
competition, we had two teachers grade

18
00:01:03,816 --> 00:01:07,960
each essay, as well as the machine score
from each of those solutions submitted.

19
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:12,294
And for the top solutions the machine
scores as great as often with one

20
00:01:12,294 --> 00:01:16,643
of the teachers as the other teacher
at grade with the first teacher.

21
00:01:16,643 --> 00:01:21,126
One of the ones that we recently
hosted was around a cardiac

22
00:01:21,126 --> 00:01:25,794
diagnostics problem,
where we had a dataset of about 500

23
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:31,020
patient MRI images that were
videos of their beating hearts.

24
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:34,970
And we've challenged participants to do
the same work that a cardiologist would

25
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:39,920
do in estimating certain properties
of the heart from the MRI images.

26
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,590
This is a task that takes a trained
cardiologist about 20 minutes.

27
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:46,790
And it's pretty much wasted time for the
cardiologist when they could be doing

28
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:49,970
more valuable things
in a clinical setting.

29
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:53,360
So this really enables the cardiologists
to help focus on higher leverage

30
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,760
activities instead of being able to do
the grunt work that machines can do

31
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,830
a very effective job at now.

32
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:04,910
The top Kaggle performance in this
competition for about the top 20 or

33
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:07,880
so teams approximated that
of a human cardiologist.
