00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:04,166
Welcome back. Let's do a quick summary of what you learned in Lesson 7. So we

2
00:00:04,166 --> 00:00:08,825
started with a population, in this case Klout scores. The number in this

3
00:00:08,825 --> 00:00:16,346
population was 1,048. The mean Klout score was 37.72. And the population

4
00:00:16,346 --> 00:00:21,900
standard deviation was about 16.04. Then, we know from the central limit

5
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:26,940
theorem, that if we took all possible samples, all of the same size, and then

6
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:32,060
found the mean of each sample and then graph the distribution of those sample

7
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:37,180
means, we would get a normal curve with a mean equal to the population mean and

8
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:42,540
a standard deviation equal to the population standard deviation divided by the

9
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:47,490
square root of the sample size. Remember that this is called the sampling

10
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:53,585
distribution. In Lesson 7, we specifically looked at the sampling distribution

11
00:00:53,585 --> 00:00:59,259
created from all samples of size 35. So, if we take all samples of size 35 from

12
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:03,990
this population, we find the mean of each sample, and then we plot the

13
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:09,370
distribution of sample means. The mean of the means will be the same as the

14
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:14,921
population mean, and the standard deviation of this distribution is the

15
00:01:14,921 --> 00:01:21,018
population standard deviation, divided by the square root of 35, which came out

16
00:01:21,018 --> 00:01:25,440
to about 2.71. Remember also, that the standard deviation of the sampling

17
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:29,654
distribution is called the standard error. Now, if we plot this sampling

18
00:01:29,654 --> 00:01:37,478
distribution, it'll look something like this. One standard deviation away from

19
00:01:37,478 --> 00:01:45,016
the mean would be 37.72 plus 2.71 and minus 2.71. So, we know what the

20
00:01:45,016 --> 00:01:51,434
distribution should look like of all sampled means of size 35. So then we said,

21
00:01:51,434 --> 00:01:56,802
what if we get this sample of size 35 and the mean is 40, and everyone in this

22
00:01:56,802 --> 00:02:01,692
sample uses the app the Bieber Tweeter? The first part of this lesson is all

23
00:02:01,692 --> 00:02:06,112
about estimating what the mean Klout score would be if everyone started to use

24
00:02:06,112 --> 00:02:07,272
the Bieber Tweeter.
