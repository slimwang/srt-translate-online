00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:01,760
So team Awesome thanks so much for

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:05,150
walking us through your really cool hackathon project.

3
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:07,280
And, I was wondering if you had any advice for

4
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:10,890
students as they are walking through their own final project.

5
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:13,910
>> I guess we benefited by working with other people.

6
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:16,950
So it always helps if you, have friends that could help on the,

7
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:20,770
you know, your project via, you know, first, we had some developers, and

8
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:23,810
modelers, and just a wide array of people.

9
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:24,570
So it he-,.

10
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:27,631
helped that everyone had different skill sets, so.

11
00:00:27,631 --> 00:00:32,756
>> Also, just by the nature of Storm, VPI is actually not too complicated.

12
00:00:32,756 --> 00:00:37,313
You only have a couple of things you have the spout, the topology, the bolts,

13
00:00:37,313 --> 00:00:41,388
and then, you got your shuffle grouping, your fields grouping, and

14
00:00:41,388 --> 00:00:45,190
maybe plus a couple of other things but that's basically it.

15
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:49,688
You have a bunch of little steps, that by themselves, are trivial, and

16
00:00:49,688 --> 00:00:52,858
then you just add ten of them together and you come up

17
00:00:52,858 --> 00:00:57,471
with something that's very nontrivial and actually looks pretty cool.

18
00:00:57,471 --> 00:01:02,487
>> So, in the end my advice is basically to just learn what all those ten

19
00:01:02,487 --> 00:01:07,956
commands do, and have some good design ideas of how to put them together.

00:01:07,956 --> 00:01:08,456
