1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The mean is obviously 3, the variance will be 0, and the standard deviation will be 0.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
The reason is when you subtract 3 from the sequence you have 0s left.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
The squares of those are 0s, the sum of those is 0.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
If you then complete the variance, it's 0.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 99:59:59,999
The square root of that is 0 as well, which means there is no spread at all in the data.
