1
00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:05,510
We can do the same with normal distributions, which are modeled by a special

2
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:10,570
probability density function. We're not going to go over the equation for this

3
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:14,288
probability density function in this course. But if you want, you can easily

4
00:00:14,288 --> 00:00:18,562
look it up and see what it is. And that might be pretty cool for some of you

5
00:00:18,562 --> 00:00:22,856
who want a little more information. But basically, since we have this

6
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:28,228
theoretical curve, we can model it with an equation. And using this equation,

7
00:00:28,228 --> 00:00:32,595
we can use Calculus with a curve. But, we don't need to use Calculus, because

8
00:00:32,595 --> 00:00:36,820
someone else already did. And then, they created a special table, so we can

9
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:42,140
always figure out the area under the curve between any two value. We're going

10
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:46,495
to use this table later. First, let's make sure we're all up to speed on the

11
00:00:46,495 --> 00:00:52,120
normal probability density function and the area underneath. First, the tails

12
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:58,549
never actually touch the x-axis, they get closer and closer to the x-axis. So,

13
00:00:58,549 --> 00:01:03,505
the x-axis is a horizontal asymptote. The reason the tails of this thoretical

14
00:01:03,505 --> 00:01:07,665
model don't touch the x-axis is basically because we can never be 100% sure of

15
00:01:07,665 --> 00:01:14,576
anything. In other words, we could have a value way out here, really far from

16
00:01:14,576 --> 00:01:21,743
the mean, like five standard deviations away. But the probability of getting

17
00:01:21,743 --> 00:01:27,701
this value or lower is very small. And it's equal to the area under the curve.

18
00:01:27,701 --> 00:01:32,201
So, if we could zoom in, we would see this tail get closer and closer to the

19
00:01:32,201 --> 00:01:38,640
x-axis but never touching. And then, the area in between the tail and the

20
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,995
x-axis, all the way to negative infinity is the probability of getting this

21
00:01:43,995 --> 00:01:51,665
value or lower. We'll go more into depth in that in a second. And similarly, we

22
00:01:51,665 --> 00:01:57,266
could get a value way out here. But the probability is very small. So

23
00:01:57,266 --> 00:02:01,938
basically, what you have to remember is that if we have a certain value, let's

24
00:02:01,938 --> 00:02:08,220
just call it x for now. That the area under the curve from negative infinity to

25
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:12,746
x is equal to the probability of randomly selecting a subject in our sample

26
00:02:12,746 --> 00:02:19,276
less than x. And this is equal to the proportion in the sample or population

27
00:02:19,276 --> 00:02:27,422
with scores less than x. If this probability is 80%, then we say x is the 80th

28
00:02:27,422 --> 00:02:32,540
percentile. If this probability is 90%, we say x is the 90th percentile, etc.

29
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:35,985
If this is a little confusing, don't worry. That's the whole point of this

30
00:02:35,985 --> 00:02:40,204
lesson. You're going to get really comfortable with using the probability

31
00:02:40,204 --> 00:02:45,160
density functions and analyzing this area, and finding this area.
