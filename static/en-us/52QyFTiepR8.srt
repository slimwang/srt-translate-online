1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Let's say we have a friend Bob.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Bob is blue, he's had a nasty run in with a can of paint.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Now let's assume that Bob has a Boolean formula,

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
not necessarily this one but just some Boolean formula.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
And suppose Bob comes to us and tells us I've already

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
found out that this Boolean formula is satisfiable.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Now let's say we don't necessarily trust Bob.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Bob is given to exaggeration.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
We'd like to be able to figure out in polynomial time

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
whether or not Bob is telling us the truth.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
So how would be go about doing that?

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Let's say Bob came to us with a complete series of snapshots

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
from a nondeterministic RAM solving SAT on his formula.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Would that be enough for us to believe that he had a satisfiable formula?

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
How about if he had a list of satisfiable clauses?

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
For example, he had a list that had x as the satisfiable clause

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
and not Y as a satisfiable clause.

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Then for the entire Boolean formula,

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
could we then determine whether it was satisfiable or not?

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
What about if you had a satisfying assignment for all

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
of the variables in the formula?

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
What if we had all the calls to if_better on the Boolean formula?

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
So not necessarily a complete series of snapshots

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
from a nondeterministic RAM solving SAT on his formula,

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
but just all the calls to if_better.

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Would that be enough for us to believe Bob?

27
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
And finally, what if we had a satisfying assignment

28
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
for not all the variables but 90% of the variables in Bob's formula.

29
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Could we believe him then?

30
00:01:31,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Please check all that apply.
