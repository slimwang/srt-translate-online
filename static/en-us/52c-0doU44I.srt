1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,550
So to answer the first question, we
need to look for the birth date column,

2
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:08,050
in the row that talks about Max
the Moose, not Max the Gorilla though.

3
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:09,720
And there it is.

4
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:12,900
Max the Moose was born on February 20th,
2012.

5
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:18,590
Next we want to know if there were any
llamas born between 1995 and 1998.

6
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:21,690
Well here are all the animals
whose species is llama.

7
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:22,870
And we can scan through these,

8
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:26,160
to see if any of the birth
dates are between those years.

9
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,510
And sure enough, here's Alison.

10
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:29,890
So the answer is yes.

11
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:33,100
Number three,
which gorilla was George's mother?

12
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:37,770
Nothing in this table tells us anything
about the family relationships between

13
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:40,000
gorillas or any of the other animals.

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,960
So we can't tell which
gorilla was George's mother.

15
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,470
You might guess that it was Sue,

16
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:47,290
but we don't know, so
this should be left blank.

17
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:50,670
And finally,
how many gorillas are there?

18
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:53,450
This question's a little bit trickier.

19
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:57,830
Obviously as humans we can answer
this question just by counting rows.

20
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:00,240
But in turns out that
a database can do that too.

21
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:03,960
Whenever we look for an answer that
combines the values from several rows.

22
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,570
Whether by counting them, or
adding up numerical values, or

23
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:11,170
finding the average, we're doing
what's called an aggregation.

24
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:14,120
Counting is about the simplest
aggregation there is, and

25
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:16,400
in this case the answer is
there are three gorillas.
