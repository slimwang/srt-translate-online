00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,780
In the documentation for
GraphDefinedDomain,

2
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:06,800
we see that there is a static message,
returning a state object

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:11,350
called getState, which takes
a domain object as an argument and

4
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:15,790
an int representing the state
object from the domain to retrieve.

5
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:19,168
So we can call
GraphDefinedDomain.getState with

6
00:00:19,168 --> 00:00:21,530
arguments this.domain, and 0.

7
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:26,580
In order to retrieve the zeroth state
for the domain we generated in line 14.

8
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:29,890
One thing to keep in mind is
that there isn't an intrinsic

9
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:34,510
notion of an initial state built
in to the domain object itself.

10
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:38,160
We are specifying the initial
state outside of the domain.

11
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,770
This allows us more flexibility
in building our MDP.

12
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:44,630
For example, we can specify
different initial states for

13
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:46,420
different runs of a planning algorithm.
