1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:02,570
To make the preferences 
appear on the phone,

2
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:05,860
we need to modify settings activity. 
In the on-create method,

3
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:08,550
we're going to replace 
this to do with some code.

4
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,911
We're going to call 
addPreferencesFromResource

5
00:00:11,911 --> 00:00:16,510
with the pref_general xml that we defined. 
Then we need to bind

6
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:20,120
the preference summary to the value 
of the location preference.

7
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:23,300
This means that when 
the user changes the preference,

8
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:25,970
the summary value underneath 
the label will be updated.

9
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:29,060
If you look at the declaration 
of this method,

10
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:33,340
we see that for a given preference, it sets 
a preference change listener on it.

11
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:36,860
If you scroll to the top,
you see that the settings activity

12
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:40,670
actually implements the interface 
on preference change listener.

13
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:43,690
That method is found down below, 
where we override

14
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:47,570
the on preference change method. 
Remember that our location preference

15
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:51,840
is actually an edit text preference. 
So it won't fall into this case,

16
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,720
but it will fall in this case down here. 
Then, in the settings UI,

17
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:58,110
you can see that the summary
is now the value.

18
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,060
Make these changes in your app.

19
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,820
See the instructor notes 
for the lines of code you need.
