1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:05,070
And finally, there's a follow up process. The author of the artifact should

2
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:08,440
report to the moderator the results of the reworked process.

3
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:11,900
The moderator should confirm that the fixes have been properly implemented.

4
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:15,350
Also, the moderator should collect data on the review itself.

5
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:19,170
Such as the number and types of defects detected, the number of participants,

6
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:22,470
and the total time spent reviewing. This data should be recorded and

7
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:27,930
saved, so that the process of reviewing itself is being reviewed and, and

8
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:30,530
possibly improved if it, if it can be.

9
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:34,670
Finally, the moderator should suggest these improvements to the review process.

10
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:40,600
And, take them up with, the organizational, quality people, so

11
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,820
that o, over time, the effectiveness of the review process itself can improved.
