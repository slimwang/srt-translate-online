00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:04,680
Here's a UML diagram we might come up with. On this we have the viewport at

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:08,810
the top, the scrollbar in the middle, and the file manager at the,

3
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:14,080
at the bottom. Notice that the, whereas in the earlier diagram

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,600
we had associations among the components, here we've converted these into dash

5
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:24,500
lines which in UML correspond to dependencies amongst, amongst the components.

6
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:29,560
Dependencies are something which the ultimate implementation languages have many

7
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:34,560
mechanisms such as procedure calls to implement. So we don't have to worry about

8
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:38,450
vague concepts of associations. We can deal directly with, with dependencies
