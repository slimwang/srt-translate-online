00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,307
So your task is to multiply this perspective matrix by three points and give

2
00:00:03,307 --> 00:00:07,878
the results. I want all four coordinates. Don't do anything beyond multiplying

3
00:00:07,878 --> 00:00:10,474
the points times the matrix, and don't forget that points have a fourth

4
00:00:10,474 --> 00:00:12,340
coordinate equal to one.
