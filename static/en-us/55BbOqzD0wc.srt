00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:05,050

00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:09,030
over the Eager RC model, and I want you to write in free form

00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:12,350
what you think are the pros. And I want you to think about

00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:16,700
what are the cons of the Lazy over the Eager in memory consistency model.
