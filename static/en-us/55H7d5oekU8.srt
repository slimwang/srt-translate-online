1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,830
We start off with an input for vertex cover then apply pre-processing

2
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:09,300
using the rule that we just discovered, which means we then already know that this vertex here

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:13,560
must be put into the vertex cover as well as this one here and this one here

4
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:17,610
and these all do not have to be in the vertex cover and this of course is

5
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:19,920
dramatically effective in this case here.

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:25,670
It's unfortunately not always the case in practice but as you can see it only leaves a very small part

7
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:29,340
of the network actually where we have to find an assignment but the main point is that

8
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:35,150
we now put this into a search tree to find the best possible vertex cover for those vertices

9
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:37,360
where we have not yet found an assignment.

10
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:42,480
And now my point is this, the search tree that we had so far was as follows.

11
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:47,150
We started out by looking at an uncovered edge and then we branch into three possibilities.

12
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:52,300
We either put exactly one of the vertices into the vertex cover or both.

13
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:59,130
And now comes the cool part, if we have applied pre-processing then we can redesign

14
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:06,170
our search tree because what this pre-processing step means basically is that we have eliminated

15
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:10,490
or we have already assigned all vertices now to have just a single neighbor.

16
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:15,560
Now that we have applied pre-processing, we know a little bit more about these vertices here

17
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:19,770
because we know that this vertex here will have at least one more neighbor

18
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:23,120
because otherwise we would have already found it in the pre-processing

19
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,560
and this one here will also have another neighbor.

20
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,910
There can be more. The same thing here.

21
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:32,340
What we can now do is we can do a more sophisticated search tree

22
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:40,220
and that sophisticated search tree is going to be based on this part here, these three vertices.

23
00:01:40,220 --> 99:59:59,999
You can do more sophisticated search trees but I just want to show you the basic principle here.
