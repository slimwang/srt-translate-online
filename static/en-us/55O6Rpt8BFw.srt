00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,285
Over the course this lesson, we discover a super powerful tool because of

2
00:00:04,297 --> 00:00:08,793
Grant's airplane situation. We can now find the distance between any two points

3
00:00:08,805 --> 00:00:13,087
on a graph. And, I don't just mean points that we can count squares on graph

4
00:00:13,099 --> 00:00:17,290
paper to find the distance between. I mean, any two points on a coordinate

5
00:00:17,302 --> 00:00:22,015
plane. Think about how you used triangles, right triangles in particular, to

6
00:00:21,642 --> 00:00:25,640
find the distance from Grant's hometown to the city Udacity. Can you do

7
00:00:25,652 --> 00:00:29,950
something similar to find the distances between these points on this graph? To

8
00:00:29,962 --> 00:00:34,170
make your life easier, I only want you to find the distance from A to B, from B

9
00:00:34,182 --> 00:00:38,800
to C, from C to D and from D to A. Please write your answers in exact form. In

10
00:00:38,812 --> 00:00:43,441
other words, I don't want you to round. Instead, I would like you to write them

11
00:00:43,453 --> 00:00:48,075
in whatever form you need to write them to represent the actual exact number

12
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:52,859
that each length is equal to. To help you do this, I'd like to remind you that

13
00:00:52,871 --> 00:00:58,123
if you want to enter a square root sign, using MathQuill, you need to type the

14
00:00:58,135 --> 00:01:05,495
keys back \sqrt, and then the space bar. Then, you can use your arrow keys to

15
00:01:05,507 --> 00:01:07,656
move your cursor around.
