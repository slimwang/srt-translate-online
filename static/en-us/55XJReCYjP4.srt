1
00:00:00,138 --> 00:00:03,510
So, this is the general equation for any circle.

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:05,555
The number on the end is "r" squared,

3
00:00:05,555 --> 00:00:08,828
and so the square root of this number is the radius.

4
00:00:08,828 --> 00:00:12,548
And then if there's a number next to the "x", and a number next to the "k",

5
00:00:12,548 --> 00:00:15,587
these are the numbers that form our center.

6
00:00:15,587 --> 00:00:19,385
We take their opposite sign from the one that's in parenthesis.

7
00:00:19,385 --> 00:00:25,029
So, for example, if this is negative and this is negative, then both "h" and "k" will be positive.

8
00:00:25,029 --> 00:00:28,092
Whereas if there were positive signs inside of our equations,

9
00:00:28,092 --> 00:00:31,206
that means that these two values would be negative.

10
00:00:31,206 --> 00:00:34,208
Let's check out a few examples to see this in action.

11
00:00:34,208 --> 00:00:38,346
Here's a circle centered at the origin with a radius of 5.

12
00:00:38,346 --> 00:00:42,526
Notice that this equation is really the same as this one.

13
00:00:42,526 --> 00:00:49,127
If we subtracted or added zero to the "x" and "y" value, we'd still be at a center of (0,0).

14
00:00:49,127 --> 00:00:52,402
This is our "h" and this is our "k".

15
00:00:52,402 --> 00:00:57,627
I'm gonna switch between these graphs. Right now I only have this one being shown as graphed.

16
00:00:57,627 --> 00:01:03,933
When I turn this one off, and turn this one on, I notice that I get the same exact graph as before.

17
00:01:03,933 --> 00:01:08,643
And that should make sense because if we subtract zero from anything, it doesn't change the value.

18
00:01:08,643 --> 00:01:13,330
Here's another circle and this one has a center at (3,3).

19
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:19,186
We took our old circle and shifted it three units to the right and three units up, vertically.

20
00:01:19,186 --> 00:01:22,925
We can even see that if we examine two of the points on the circle.

21
00:01:22,925 --> 00:01:29,964
This one, at (0,5) for this circle, has now been moved to (3,8), for this circle.

22
00:01:29,964 --> 00:01:34,465
We moved it three units right for the "x", from 0 to 3,

23
00:01:34,465 --> 00:01:38,072
and three units vertically from 5 to 8.

24
00:01:38,072 --> 00:01:42,176
And it turns out that this is true for all the points on this circle.

25
00:01:42,176 --> 00:01:47,769
We can examine another point and see that it was moved three units right and then three units up.

26
00:01:47,769 --> 00:01:50,044
And here's a different circle.

27
00:01:50,044 --> 00:01:55,873
This one's been shifted four units to the left, and then one unit up, vertically.

28
00:01:55,873 --> 00:02:01,294
And notice, too, that the center of this new circle is at (-4,1).

29
00:02:01,294 --> 00:02:07,712
This is the "h" value and it's opposite in sign of the equation, and this is the "k" value

30
00:02:07,712 --> 00:02:10,340
which is opposite of this number in the equation.

31
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:12,279
Here's one final graph.

32
00:02:12,279 --> 00:02:16,421
For this one, it's been shifted two units left and two units down.

33
00:02:16,421 --> 00:02:20,316
And if we examine its center, it's at (-2,-2).

34
00:02:20,316 --> 00:02:24,221
Notice that these two signs are opposite than the ones in the equation.

35
00:02:24,221 --> 00:02:28,147
Here's our "h" value, and its opposite which is -2,

36
00:02:28,147 --> 00:02:31,531
and here's our "k" value, which is opposite, so -2.

37
00:02:31,531 --> 00:02:35,091
Now that you've seen the general equation for any circle,

38
00:02:35,091 --> 00:02:40,164
I want you to try and figure out what are the centers and radiuses for each of these circles?

39
00:02:40,164 --> 00:02:45,117
Work carefully, and don't forget to pay attention to the minus and addition signs.

40
00:02:45,117 --> 00:02:46,633
Good luck!
