1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Who is being favored--the male students or the female students?

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
And looking at the data alone, it makes sense to say

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
the female students are favored because for both majors,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
they have a better admission rate than the corresponding male students.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
But now, let's do the trick.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Let's look at the admission statistics independent of the major.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
So, let's talk about both majors, and I would wonder how many male students applied.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And of course, the answer is 1000.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 99:59:59,999
How many were admitted?
