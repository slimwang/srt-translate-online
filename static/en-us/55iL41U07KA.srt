00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:04,200
Let's talk about permissions, when each app APK is installed,

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,290
it's given it's own unique Linux user ID. And each

3
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:10,175
app runs within its instance in the Android Virtual machine.

4
00:00:10,175 --> 00:00:16,946
[SOUND] As a result each app is completely sand boxed.

5
00:00:16,946 --> 00:00:19,831
[BLANK_AUDIO]

6
00:00:19,831 --> 00:00:23,051
Its files processes and other resources are inaccessible

7
00:00:23,051 --> 00:00:26,110
to other apps. This sandboxing approach is used to

8
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:29,210
ensure that by default no app can access sensitive

9
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:32,250
data or perform actions that could adversely impact other

10
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:36,210
apps, the OS, or users. Things like accessing the

11
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:39,320
internet, getting the user's location, or reading or modifying

12
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:42,660
the contacts database. Rather than asking the user each

13
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:45,660
time an app tries to access something sensitive you

14
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:48,720
declared permissions that your app requires in it's manifest.

15
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:52,130
You can get a list of all of the permission

16
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:56,090
your app may require here at the Android developer site.

17
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:58,390
So, why not just ask for all the permissions and

18
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:01,320
never worry about it again? Well, when users install

19
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,200
your app their greeted with this dialogue which lists all

20
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,645
of the permissions that you've requested along with the more

21
00:01:06,645 --> 00:01:10,770
user-friendly descriptions. Nothing says this app was built by hackers

22
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:13,380
who want to steal my data, rob my house, clear out my

23
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:16,560
bank account, and take and share nude pictures of me like

24
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,250
a weather app that wants access to every permission on the

25
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:24,100
device. Best practice is to request the absolute minimum of permissions.

26
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:26,340
Every time you need to request a new permission, take it

27
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:29,390
as a flag to stop and consider if there are other

28
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:32,970
alternatives that might achieve the same goal. For example, using an

29
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:37,140
intent to launch the camera app, rather than accessing the camera, directly.

30
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,550
Later, we'll look at ways to share your data with

31
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:43,370
other apps, using intents and content providers to create bridges

32
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:46,630
between these apps sandboxs. You can declare and use those

33
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:48,040
permissions in these instances to

34
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:51,080
similarly restrict access to sensitive information.
