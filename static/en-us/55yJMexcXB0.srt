When we think about Grant's situation with his suitcase, x can really only equal

2
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:08,445
a whole number. Remember that x stood for the number of wiper sets that Grant

3
00:00:08,457 --> 00:00:12,276
has packed in his suitcase. And since wiper sets are objects in the world,

4
00:00:12,372 --> 00:00:16,620
they're countable things. You can't really have half of a wiper set, or I guess

5
00:00:16,632 --> 00:00:20,914
you could, but Grant's only taking complete sets with him. Now, when I say that

6
00:00:20,926 --> 00:00:24,882
wiper sets can be counted, you might automatically think of the natural numbers.

7
00:00:24,973 --> 00:00:28,780
Since these are the counting numbers, 1, 2, 3, 4 and so on. But in principle,

8
00:00:28,871 --> 00:00:32,661
Grant could also pack zero glasses wipers. He could just not bring any wipers to

9
00:00:32,673 --> 00:00:36,484
the expo, probably wouldn't be that smart, but he could do it. And if we take

10
00:00:36,496 --> 00:00:39,854
this set of natural numbers and add zero to it, we get the whole numbers.
