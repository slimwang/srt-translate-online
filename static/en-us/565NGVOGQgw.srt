1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:01,790
You have all these ideas and

2
00:00:01,790 --> 00:00:06,180
at this point, you should be wondering,
which idea should I choose?

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:09,420
Well, to answer that question,
you have a lot to think about.

4
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:12,160
Here are some of the considerations
you should keep in mind.

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,740
First, is your idea a painkiller or
vitamin?

6
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:19,170
Pain killers address an obvious and
functional need for users,

7
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:23,380
while vitamins address user's emotional
needs and are really nice to have.

8
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:24,910
Now, both types, but

9
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:28,770
especially painkillers,
can lead to successful companies.

10
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:30,200
For vitamin type ideas,

11
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:33,340
you'll need to figure out how to
get your users to be sticky, so

12
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:36,520
that way they continue to come back and
use your product over time.

13
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:40,990
The second thing you should look for
is how easy it is to monetize the idea.

14
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:44,010
Now you don't need to
monetize an idea on day one.

15
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:46,330
But understanding how to make
money out of the service or

16
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:50,120
product is essential to
building an enduring business.

17
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:53,000
Next is the idea simple?

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,336
Can you explain your idea
in just a couple sentences?

19
00:00:55,336 --> 00:00:59,590
For example, bagborroworsteal.com
is like Netflix, but

20
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:04,290
instead of renting movies, you can rent,
buy, or sell designer items.

21
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:08,080
Law enforcement and judges might say
the simplest explanation is usually

22
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:12,630
the right, or truthful, one and this
should also be true of your product.

23
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:14,760
Users should be able to
describe the product and

24
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:18,140
its benefits to other
potential users easily.

25
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:20,170
And here's where we get to
the heart of the matter.

26
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:22,440
Is your idea personally relevant?

27
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:27,330
For example, you might be a diabetic and
want to develop affordable and

28
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:31,030
convenient blood sugar monitors for
other diabetics.

29
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:33,380
Now, don't underestimate this one.

30
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:36,480
This is of great importance,
as it relates to how likely you are to

31
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:41,400
persevere in the face of challenge,
uncertainty, or worse, looming failure.

32
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,690
You'll be more likely to see an idea
come to life if you care about the idea

33
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:46,080
in the first place.

34
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,800
Now another consideration for
an idea is whether or

35
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,620
not you can follow through on it.

36
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:53,600
Think about your ability
to organize a small team or

37
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,800
a large team to execute on that idea.

38
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,400
Can you get from a to b?

39
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:00,740
Next you should wonder if you have
a large enough size of the market.

40
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:03,200
You want a really big slice of the pie.

41
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,020
The market just refers to your
number of potential customers.

42
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:10,750
You should be able to calculate a lower
estimate as well as an upper estimate

43
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:12,240
for your market size.

44
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:15,620
If you're unfamiliar with market sizing,
refer to the Instructor Notes.

45
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:16,640
There's a resource link there.

46
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:21,920
And finally, does your idea
have a legitimate secret sauce?

47
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,100
Does your idea leverage technology or
patents in a unique way?

48
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:27,860
Or do you have talent and capital
that no one else would ever have?

49
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:31,230
For Google, the secret sauce
was the page rank algorithm.

50
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:34,110
The secret sauce has grown over
the years to include many features

51
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:37,880
that bring millions of page
results in fractions of a second.

52
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:41,785
Now that you have some considerations
for what makes a great product idea,

53
00:02:41,785 --> 00:02:45,485
I'd like you to evaluate the idea for
the SuperDuper Shopping App.

54
00:02:45,485 --> 00:02:49,095
You can find a survey that's
linked in the Instructor Notes.

55
00:02:49,095 --> 00:02:50,625
Once you've taken the survey,

56
00:02:50,625 --> 00:02:52,485
you can check this box to
continue when you're done.
