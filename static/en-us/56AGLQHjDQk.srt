1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The answer is we want to do the third thing.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
We want to show some way that if we had the totient of n

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
we could also factor n.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
That would show that finding the totient is not easier than finding the factors.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Of the other choices, the first one is actually not true.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
If we have p and q, it's actually easy to compute the totient of n,

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
and it's easy because we know the totient of n is (p - 1)(q - 1).

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:30,000
The second answer is not true, but if it were, it wouldn't help us prove that RSA is hard.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
It would just show that there might be an easier way to compute the totient of n

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
than there is to factor.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
This would be damaging for our security proof.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Fortunately, at least for the security of RSA, the third one is true,

13
00:00:43,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and next we'll show why.
