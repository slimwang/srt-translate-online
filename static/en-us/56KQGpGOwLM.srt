1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
[Dave:] I'm here with Dave Herman who works at Mozilla and directs research here.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Tell us how you go involved in Mozilla and open-source projects.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
[David Herman:] I was actually a graduate at the time that I first got involved.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I was interested in JavaScript, and I was doing research in programming languages.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I was spending some time learning about JavaScript, and I wrote web pages about.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Out of the blue, Brendan Ike, the CTO at Mozilla and inventor of JavaScript,

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
found the web pages that I had written and sent me an email and said

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
that he was interested in talking to me about some of the things that I

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
had learned and was doing.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
That experience alone was incredibly eye-opening to me.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It showed me that the assumptions that I had had about the boundaries

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
between research and industry, the boundaries between academia and industry.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The boundaries between just a person on the internet and the movers and shakers in industry

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
were a lot more porous than I realized, and it showed that the web is this place

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
that brings people together who might otherwise not have had any way of getting to know each other.

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
That was very exciting, and I started talking with Brendan and talking with Mozilla

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
and got involved with the ECMAScript Standards committee,

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,000
which is the standards committee that standardizes the JavaScript programming language.

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I was doing that while I was in grad school, and when I finished grad school

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I came to Mozilla full time.

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
[Dave:] A lot of the students in our class have only been programming for about 7 weeks.

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Can they still get involved in opensource projects or do they need a lot more experience than that?

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
[Dave Herman:] There are all sorts of ways of getting involved in open source projects.

24
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
You don't have to be a computer science wizard to contribute.

25
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:51,000
One of our largest sources of community volunteer work is localization,

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
which is basically translation.

27
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Firfox is developed in English and our official release is in English,

28
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:07,000
but we actually have close to 100 localized versions of Firefox in countries all over the world.

29
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
We have volunteers in communities that could be as large as many countries

30
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
or could be as small as a small community in one country

31
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:23,000
where anybody can simply provide translations of the menu items

32
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
and the windows and dialogue boxes--all of the stuff where we have to present

33
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
something to the user we do in English, and then you can translate it.

34
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Now you can have contributed to your native languages version of Firefox.

35
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Another project that we started is a project called universal subtitles

36
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
where you can take YouTube videos that were recorded in one language,

37
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:51,000
and you can provide translation and the software will automatically create subtitles

38
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
based on the translation that you provided.

39
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
There are all sorts of ways that people contribute to Mozilla software

40
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
and to opensource software in general, and it doesn't always have to be technical.

41
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
It can be code, and sometimes we end up hiring people who started out contributing code

42
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
and ended up working on some of the most advanced parts of our projects.

43
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,000
But it also can be as simple as editing documentation or providing translations.

44
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
[Dave:] We have a real wide range of different types of people in our class.

45
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Can you tell us is it possible for anyone to get involved in opensource software?

46
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
[Asa Dotzler:] One of the things that really appeals to me about opensource software

47
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,000
is the opportunity for a whole variety of people with backgrounds and different experiences

48
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
and different interests to get involved with the project.

49
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:45,000
A good example of this is if you look back to the Mozilla Project in 2002 and 2003,

50
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:52,000
we were sort of struggling along with this next general Netscape communicator browser suite.

51
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
And one day a young 15-year-old high school student showed up in one of our IRC channels

52
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
where we all get together as engineers and testers and the people

53
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
working all across the project and talk about the work we're doing,

54
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000
and he came in and said, "I don't like the way this particular button behaves in Mozilla."

55
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
"Can someone fix that?"

56
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I reached out to him, and I said, "That button is actually powered by some simple JavaScript."

57
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
"You could look at the source code and maybe you could fix it yourself."

58
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
He said, "Well, I've put together a couple of web pages. I know some simple JavaScript."

59
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
And before you know it he was a dedicated member of the team.

60
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Only a few short months later, he was one of the founding members

61
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
of the new Firefox project that would go on to reach 500 million users today.

62
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:41,000
This is a 15-year-old high school student with no background in computer sciences.

63
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
He got involved. He had mentors who helped him learn the pieces he didn't know.

64
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
He went and read books, and before you knew it

65
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
he was building one of the world's most successful software products.

66
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
We also have a number of students who come here, either for weekend work

67
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
as something to compliment their education.

68
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
We have people who are in the industry and have been developing software

69
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
for as far back as the Fortran and COBOL days

70
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
who are looking for something that's fresh and exciting and want to renew their skillset

71
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
and see participating in opensource software as a way

72
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
to work with some of the younger people on some of the newer technologies

73
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:28,000
and to refresh and get revitalized with their computer software skillset and interests.

74
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:36,000
We have people who are part-time Mozilla contributors working on it

75
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
because they're interested in a particular feature set.

76
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:45,000
We have retirees and people who have part-time jobs trying to fill the rest of their day

77
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
and who happen to know something about what we're doing somewhere on the Mozilla project.

78
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Sometimes that's writing client software code in C++,

79
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,000
but other times that's manning our volunteer support desk and helping Firefox users

80
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
fix problems with their browsing experience.

81
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
So opensource really does, and many opensource projects really do, have

82
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:13,000
multiple points where one can attach themselves to that project and find support and mentorship.

83
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Some of the places you attach yourself can be very simple.

84
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
We'll often put some of our most valuable programming resources

85
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:26,000
on very challenging projects and leave some of the easier or simpler features

86
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:34,000
or smaller bug fixing unowned, as it were, by a full-time staff member

87
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,000
with the idea that that staff member can instead mentor a volunteer or a student or a retiree

88
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
to go finish off that piece of the work.

89
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
This is a great learning experience and an opportunity to develop a set of skills

90
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,000
that you can advance and go and become more deeply with the project over time.

91
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Ultimately, this young 15-year-old, Blake Ross who helped launch the Firefox project

92
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:03,000
moved from fixing a couple of style issues using some JavaScript and CSS on toolbar buttons

93
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,000
to being the authority on a bunch of the C++ code that made up Firefox.

94
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
That was probably in a short time period, maybe less than 2 years

95
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
that he was able to make that progression almost exclusively through

96
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
opensource mentoring relationships on the Mozilla project.
