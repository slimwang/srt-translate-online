>> I just chose one of our two possible equations in point-slope form to see

2
00:00:04,272 --> 00:00:08,712
what we end up within slope-intercept form. We should get the same answer

3
00:00:08,712 --> 00:00:13,689
regardless of which of these versions of the point-slope form equation we used.

4
00:00:13,689 --> 00:00:18,122
Either way, in the end, we get y equals negative 5 over 4x plus 51 over 4.

5
00:00:18,122 --> 00:00:21,245
Remembering, of course, that 4 is equal to 16 over 4.
