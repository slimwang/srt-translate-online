1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,620
In the last level, we set up our
player and added the arrow key and

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:05,480
accelerometer controls.

3
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:07,530
Then we added the icicles.

4
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:10,040
I hope you've been having fun
with the game already, but

5
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:12,800
you kind of have to use the honor system
to keep track of when you've been hit.

6
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:16,170
In this level,
we'll add collision detection, so

7
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:18,560
you know when the player's
been hit by an icicle.

8
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,440
And we'll add a head-up display to keep
track of how many icicles you've dodged.

9
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:25,140
Finally, we'll add multiple
difficulty levels, and

10
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:29,390
a whole new screen, to allow the user to
change the difficulty level on the fly.

11
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:29,890
Let's dig in.
