1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,980
We've put lots of effort into our algorithm to make it 10 times faster

2
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:07,710
and we have gained only very little in terms of input size that we can handle.

3
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:13,650
Now, what if we were even bolder and had an algorithm that was a 100 times faster.

4
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:19,010
Imagine a 100 times--imagine your computer booting up a 100 times faster that it does today

5
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:25,610
or your computer game not running at 30 frames per second but at 3000 frames per second,

6
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:27,810
so 100 times faster--shoot speedup.

7
00:00:27,810 --> 99:59:59,999
What input size can we handle now?
