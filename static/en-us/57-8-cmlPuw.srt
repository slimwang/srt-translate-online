To achieve the memory efficiency of a single bit

00:00:03,315 --> 00:00:06,265
trie with the fast lookup properties of a direct

3
00:00:06,265 --> 00:00:09,005
trie, a compromise is to use what's called a

4
00:00:09,005 --> 00:00:12,480
multi-bit trie, or a multi-ary trie. Let's start with a

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,830
binary trie, where one bit is resolved at each

6
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:19,750
node. Here, the depth is big W, the degree of

7
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:22,590
each node is two, and the stride for each

8
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:25,520
lookup is one bit. Now we can generalize this to

9
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:28,550
a multi-ary trie, where the depth is now W over

10
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:31,410
K if the degree is 2 to the K, and

11
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:34,950
each level resolves K bits. The binary trie is a

12
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:39,737
simple case of the multi-ary trie, where K equals 1.
