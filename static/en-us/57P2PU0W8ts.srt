00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:02,570
To see the code changes
up until this point, and

2
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:04,680
integrate them into your
own version of Sunshine,

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:07,540
check out the GitHub commit
linked in the instructor notes.

4
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:10,910
Then take a look at the place
documentation to determine how to

5
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:12,860
retrieve the LatLong object.

6
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:15,070
From that object, you'll need to
get each value separately, and

7
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:18,200
write it as a float
into our preferences.

8
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,590
