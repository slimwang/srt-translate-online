1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:04,350
So there is, in fact, inheritable component to the development of bipolar, and

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:09,106
we see this in the fact that it tends to run in families. So, for instance, if

3
00:00:09,106 --> 00:00:12,034
a sibling or a parent has the disorder, it does increase the odds of anyone

4
00:00:12,034 --> 00:00:16,746
else in the family getting the disorder. But of course, again, this is by no

5
00:00:16,746 --> 00:00:23,930
means inevitable. We also have to have an environmental aspect to the disorder.

6
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:28,754
Fact in this case, exposure to alcohol while a fetus increases the odds of the

7
00:00:28,754 --> 00:00:34,388
development of bi-polar. It also, in fact, increases the odds of depression,

8
00:00:34,388 --> 00:00:39,832
schizophrenia, and alcoholism. So once again we see this complex interplay

9
00:00:39,832 --> 00:00:44,868
between the forces of Nature, and the forces of n-, nurture. In the development

10
00:00:44,868 --> 00:00:47,060
of a disorder, and, in this case, bipolar.
