00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:03,557
A lot of teachers have to add up all their students scores to calculate final

2
00:00:03,557 --> 00:00:07,263
grades. When I was in middle school a lot of my teachers had a paper grade

3
00:00:07,263 --> 00:00:10,463
book, but by putting scores into a computer, teachers might save themselves

4
00:00:10,463 --> 00:00:15,029
some work. We're going to build a HomeworkScores class that will read all of

5
00:00:15,029 --> 00:00:19,467
the scores for one student and give useful summaries of their work. Eventually

6
00:00:19,467 --> 00:00:23,460
it will be able to calculate the total and average scores, and drop the lowest.

7
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:26,732
But first it needs to read the scores for one student. I started the class for

8
00:00:26,732 --> 00:00:30,557
you. It'll save the scores in an array of doubles, which will be partially

9
00:00:30,557 --> 00:00:34,167
filled. We'll allow the teacher to enter whatever number of scores they feel

10
00:00:34,167 --> 00:00:37,320
like. Let's not worry about re-sizing for right now, we'll just make the array

11
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,490
very big to start with. Before I ask you to implement the readScores method I

12
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:44,848
want to show you one more thing that's going to help.
