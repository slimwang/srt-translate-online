1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,360
Now, to define max-min fairness, let's first assume

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,270
that we have some allocation of rates across

3
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:10,130
flows x i. Now, we say that this

4
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:14,380
allocation is max-min fair if increasing any rate

5
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:19,460
x i implies that some other x j that is smaller than x i must be

6
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:22,700
decreased. To accommodate for the increase in x

7
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:25,620
i. So in other words, the allocation is max-min

8
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:31,030
fair if we can't make, any one of these flow rates better off, without making

9
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:37,160
some flow rate worse off, that's already worse than the flow rate xi.

10
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:43,470
So the upshot results in small demands getting exactly what they asked for, and

11
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:46,670
the larger demands splitting the remaining capacity

12
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:50,730
among themselves equally. More formally, we perform this

13
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:54,580
procedure as follows. We allocate resources to users

14
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:57,830
in order of increasing demand. No user receives

15
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:00,470
more than what they requested. And users that

16
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:04,400
still have unsatisfied demands, split the remaining resources.
