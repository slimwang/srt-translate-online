00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,928
Let's try our second problem using area and perimeter. This time we're going to

2
00:00:03,928 --> 00:00:07,890
fence in a garden. You want to enclose a rectangular garden with 36 feet of

3
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:13,843
fencing. So, this would be the fencing around your garden. If you need 72

4
00:00:13,843 --> 00:00:17,235
square feet of garden to grow all the vegetables you want to plant, what should

5
00:00:17,235 --> 00:00:22,070
be the dimensions of the garden? Now, I don't want to find the dimensions of

6
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:26,406
the garden just yet. Let's do this problem in a couple steps. Start solving

7
00:00:26,406 --> 00:00:31,654
this problem by writing two equations for the perimeter and the area. Since you

8
00:00:31,654 --> 00:00:35,380
want to write two equations, these boxes need to have an equals sign in them.

9
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:39,210
Some expression on the left, and then some expression on the right.
