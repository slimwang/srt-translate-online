1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,180
In this lecture, we will contrast several approaches for

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:05,830
structuring applications that require concurrency.

3
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:10,329
This will include and comparison between multi-process and multi-threaded

4
00:00:10,329 --> 00:00:14,130
approaches, and we talked about both of these already in this course, and

5
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:18,810
in addition, we will present an alternative, a so-called event driven approach.

6
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:23,334
We will base the discussion of the event driven model on Vivek Pai's paper,

7
00:00:23,334 --> 00:00:26,180
Flash: An Efficient and Portable Web Server.

8
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:29,120
This paper describes the event-driven architecture, and

9
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:32,752
it also includes detailed performance comparisons between a multi-process,

10
00:00:32,752 --> 00:00:38,110
multi-threaded, and an event driven implementation of a web server application.

11
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:41,410
In addition, these results are put in contrast with Apache,

12
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:43,790
which is a popular open-source web server.

13
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:46,990
We will end this lecture with a more generic discussion on how to

14
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:48,340
structure good experiments.
