00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:06,040
I'm Brenna. I am Udacity's Community Manager. So I work with our students to

2
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:08,420
tell everyone about our classes, and support

3
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:11,750
everyone and celebrate our successes. I have

4
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:15,883
an Android. It's pretty [SOUND] janky. It's

5
00:00:15,883 --> 00:00:18,270
old, [SOUND] and it loses power almost

6
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:23,645
immediately if you turn the Internet on. So, I'm offline most of the time.

7
00:00:23,645 --> 00:00:25,970
>> [INAUDIBLE]

8
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:26,140
>> And

9
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:31,050
so if I'm lost, I will turn on the internet and I will go on to Google

10
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:36,500
Maps and if I really want to check my e-mail I'll turn it on by you know, it's

11
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:41,945
a, it's a big decision. Probably my favorite app is

12
00:00:41,945 --> 00:00:46,890
2048. We recently had a class called make your

13
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:52,080
own 2048 and I along with pretty much everyone in the office got addicted

14
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:56,160
to playing 2048. So I'll probably spend like

15
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,270
hours and hours playing 2048 on my phone. [LAUGH]

16
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:01,850
That was definitely worth losing battery. The last

17
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:06,950
app I uninstalled was Twitter because when I turn

18
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:12,660
the Internet on with my phone Twitter is a total energy hog and will not let any

19
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:14,790
other app do anything until it's updated like

20
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:17,140
all 80 million tweets that Udacity's gotten in the

21
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:20,290
meantime, and so it literally kills my phone. So

22
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:22,290
I had to take it off. I install it every

23
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:24,890
now and then if I need to tweet from my

24
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:27,390
phone, but in general, I can tweet from other devices.
