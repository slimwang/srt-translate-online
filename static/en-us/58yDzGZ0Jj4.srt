00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:01,609
I've created a single page here and

2
00:00:01,609 --> 00:00:06,689
I want you to use the monitorEvents
function to watch the image for events.

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,790
Review the log that the monitor
events function produces

4
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:13,180
then determine which of
the following are real mouse event.

5
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:16,500
Does the monitorEvents function
log out a mouse over event?

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,920
What about a mouse on event?

7
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:21,230
Select all that you find in
the monitorEvents log while

8
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:22,740
interacting with the image.

9
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:25,250
You can find a link to this able
page in the instructor notes below.
