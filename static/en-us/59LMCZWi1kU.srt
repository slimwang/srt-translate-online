00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,210
Now I'd like to show you a series of examples that basically best

2
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:10,060
showcase what the shutter speed does to a image that's captured on the sensor.

3
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:11,090
Remember again,

4
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:14,230
the amount of time the sensor is exposed to the light is the way,

5
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:18,500
the best way to kind of see what's going to be registered on the sensor.

6
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:24,510
Here we see an example of an image captured with a shutter speed of one second.

7
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:31,210
Of course, what comes out of it is a whole lot of blurry streaks of the water.

8
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:35,200
Here I'm showing you basically an image of a waterfall and

9
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,330
it's being exposed at different shutter speeds shown here.

10
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:42,730
So it starts of with one second all the way to

11
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:48,090
different shutter speeds of one-third, one-thirtieth, one-two-hundredth.

12
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:54,429
So this is one second, one-third, one-thirtieth, one-two-hundredth,

13
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:58,040
and one-eight-hundredth speed.

14
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:01,220
So again, you can see the different details when this happens.

15
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:05,160
We see, basically, water, and the water fountain becoming streaking.

16
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:08,670
Or becoming much more crisper.

17
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:14,710
So you can streaks of water, blurry water, and really crisp images there.

18
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:18,510
So the amount of time the sensor is exposed to light is

19
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:21,189
basically what allows you to have these different effects.

20
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:26,420
Usually these amounts are denoted by fractions of a second.

21
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,020
We saw various examples.

22
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:31,560
It could be 1/2000 would be a very fast shutter, or 1/1000.

23
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,930
All the way to even how long you want to keep it open.

24
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:37,880
You can actually keep a shutter open for 30 seconds.

25
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,620
And sometimes most cameras, in fact,

26
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:42,960
have a version called bulb where basically if the shutter's open for

27
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,880
the exact time that you've actually pressed the shutter and released it.

28
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,530
And basically now you kind of see how the effects of motion blur to streaks

29
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:54,720
are captured by a photographer who wants to control these types of parameters.

30
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,260
Another way of looking at the same thing is here I'm basically showing an

31
00:01:57,260 --> 00:02:03,340
example of a waterfall again at a faster shutter speed of 1/125th of a second.

32
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:05,922
Of course when I go to a slower shutter speed,

33
00:02:05,922 --> 00:02:10,889
one-tenth of a second you can start seeing a lot more of the streaks.

34
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:12,380
And even more blurriness and

35
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:15,730
streak kind of shows here with one-half of a second.

36
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:17,770
Another example, the same category.

37
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:21,740
Still sharp of this thing, basically shows each and every petal.

38
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:26,510
Very crisp, increase it and now I start seeing a little bit more.

39
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:29,390
And of course I really have a much wider or

40
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:33,130
much more open shutter then you'll see everything blurring.
