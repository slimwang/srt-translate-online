1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,066
We figure out before that the slope of r minus 2 so we definitely know that. And

2
00:00:05,066 --> 00:00:09,964
we have a y and x coordinate or an x and y coordinate peer that go together and

3
00:00:09,964 --> 00:00:14,893
they make the point 3600, 10000. So we know one point that lies on our line as

4
00:00:14,893 --> 00:00:15,321
well.
