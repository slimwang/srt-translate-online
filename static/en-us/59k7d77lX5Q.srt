00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,590
There are hundreds of billions
of planets in the Milky Way, but

2
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:05,470
they're really hard to spot.

3
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:06,410
Humanity's search for

4
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:11,020
other earths has only yield a small
fraction of the possibilities.

5
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:13,370
If you're interested in
learning about exoplanets and

6
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:17,840
the techniques astronomers use to spot
them, keep watching after this video.

7
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,590
Anyway, that was fun.

8
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:23,390
I hoped you enjoyed learning a little
astronomy alongside JavaScript.

9
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:27,570
Of course you came here to learn about
Promises, the easiest technique for

10
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:30,370
handling asynchronous
work with JavaScript.

11
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:33,790
You learned how to wrap asynchronous
work in Promises, you chained

12
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:37,790
asynchronous actions together,
and you practiced error handling.

13
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:40,760
You experimented with
sequences of Promises, and

14
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:44,690
you tried different strategies to
convert lots of asynchronous actions

15
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:48,300
into long chains of manageable promises.

16
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:49,727
It's been a lot of fun.

17
00:00:49,727 --> 00:00:53,471
I want you to go out there and
use Promises to simplify your life, and

18
00:00:53,471 --> 00:00:56,902
you know what, don't forget to
look up every once in awhile.
