00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:03,010
Here's the water cycle model. Which you were

2
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:05,360
likely taught years ago while in school. As

3
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:08,310
you can see, it explains that water in

4
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:13,330
the oceans evaporates. Forms clouds. And then goes

5
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:17,170
back to earth as rain, ice or snow.

6
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:19,270
And eventually, through rivers and streams, the water

7
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:22,480
goes back into the ocean. This conceptual model

8
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,580
is a highly simplified explanation. But for most

9
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:29,610
purposes, it's efficient. People form conceptual models all

10
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:32,770
the time. And it's the responsibility of the designer,

11
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:36,070
to help the person form a useful conceptual model.

12
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:38,190
It doesn't have to be complete. It can be

13
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:41,220
an approximation. But, it has to be usable.

14
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:44,440
In the absence of clues from the designer. The

15
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:48,390
person is very likely to develop an inaccurate model.

16
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:51,650
Which means they will eventually be confused. For your

17
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:55,850
next exercise, find a reasonably complex activity that

18
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:59,070
you frequently do. And explain your conceptual model

19
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:01,770
for it. You may use a combination of

20
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:05,260
text or drawings. Organization of your kitchen, how you

21
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:07,800
sort things in your room. Or the operation

22
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,280
of the equipment in your entertainment center. Are all

23
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:13,150
good examples of everyday situations, that can be

24
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:16,720
amazingly difficult to explain to others. You can use

25
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,030
one of these examples, or choose one of your own.
