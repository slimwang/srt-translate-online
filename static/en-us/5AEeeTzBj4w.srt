00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Now you're probably itching to write some code by now--so let's get started.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
What I want you to do first is write these two action functions, hold and role,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
which take a state and return a state.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Here the state that results from holding.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Here the state that results from rolling and getting a d.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
A state is represented by this four tuple of p, the player.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
It's either zero or one.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
The subsequent state would remain the same if the player continues

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
and would swap between one and the other otherwise.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Me and you, two integers indicating the score, the score of the player to play

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
and the score of the other player, and then pending,

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
which is score accumulated so far but not yet put onto the scoreboard.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Go ahead and write those functions.
