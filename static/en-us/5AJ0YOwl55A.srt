00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,040
Let's study some of the basic premises of how an image is

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:06,170
formed from a 3D scene.

3
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:09,390
We start off with just a simple representation of a 3D scene,

4
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:13,390
we have a lens, and of course, because of this lens, now we know that we

5
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:18,530
can actually create an image of this 3D scene on the other side of the lens.

6
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:21,620
Here, I'm basically just now showing you a simple paradigm where, again,

7
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:27,100
a lens, all the light goes through, the lens here generates a 3D scene.

8
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:29,800
And this is basically all the light from this thing is

9
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:32,780
now going through this lens and captured here.

10
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:35,930
Most of the time we will actually be putting a sensor,

11
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:39,920
where we want to capture the image, at the focal plane of a lens.

12
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,510
So at f, distance away from the lens, we want to be able to capture the image.

13
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:48,490
And this is where actually we want to be able to put our sensor.

14
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:53,305
And that, you will see various examples why that's important.

15
00:00:53,305 --> 00:00:58,280
Let's look at a few examples of what happens if certain things change in this

16
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,950
image formation pipeline.

17
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:03,460
Again we have a 3D object, lens, and

18
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:07,120
at the image being formed at the focal point of this lens.

19
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:10,590
So as I said, now I'm going to push the sensor or film or

20
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:15,120
any form of a screen here that's going to be where we want to capture images.

21
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:18,740
You may remember this was the concept that was there in the pinhole camera in

22
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:20,170
the previous lecture, too.

23
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:24,276
We always wanted to create an image at the focal plane away from the lens.

24
00:01:24,276 --> 00:01:31,430
So what happens if I was to now move this tree further away from the lens?

25
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:34,860
So everything else is the same, I've just moved the tree here.

26
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:39,440
By doing simple geometry on this one you will notice that when you take and

27
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:45,500
trace the rays of light through the lens, a tree is formed on the image sensor.

28
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,990
Except that now, of course, it's much smaller.

29
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:52,080
This is the image size here.

30
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,780
Of course it's much smaller on this side here.

31
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:59,220
And that's valuable because in essence as I move the tree farther away,

32
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:01,350
of course it should look more distant.

33
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:03,300
So this is exactly doing what we expect it to do.

34
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:05,580
And if I had let's say two trees, one in front and

35
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:08,268
one in back, the further one should be looking smaller.

36
00:02:08,268 --> 00:02:13,500
So this is kind of giving me a sense of depth of perspective,

37
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,740
which basically says things farther away would be smaller.

38
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:20,070
Now let's look at what happens if I move the tree inwards.

39
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:25,610
Same lens, same situation, same location of the sensor and, of course,

40
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:29,430
if you just draw the rays of light and do the projection again,

41
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:34,750
you will notice that this time, the tree is bigger.

42
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:38,310
So this tree is smaller and of course this tree is much bigger.

43
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:42,510
And again, same example applies, it's closer to a sensor,

44
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:48,390
therefore it appears to have more, size and it appears to be larger.

45
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:51,820
So this just demonstrates that by changing distances of the object to

46
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:56,200
the lensing system, the camera here, we can now actually see closer or

47
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,250
farther off objects.
