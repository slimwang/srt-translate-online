1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:04,240
Let's imagine I have 20 of these games. Okay?

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:04,890
>> Sure.

3
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:06,438
>> So I'm going to play these games 20 times in

4
00:00:06,438 --> 00:00:07,980
a row. Now what you've been doing is you've been

5
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:10,990
going forward. You've said, well, if I can get us

6
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:14,310
the right thing or if I can basically threaten you and

7
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:17,430
say. If you screw me over this time, I'll screw

8
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:20,080
you over from now on. Then maybe I can get you

9
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,800
to do the right thing and vice versa, since it's

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,410
a symmetric game. And then we'll end up doing the right

11
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:27,440
thing all along. And that makes a lot of sense, right?

12
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:28,820
>> Yeah.

13
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:30,160
>> If you're going forward. But what

14
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,694
if you're going backward, Michael? Let's imagine

15
00:00:32,694 --> 00:00:37,480
we are doing [CROSSTALK]. What is amazing

16
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:39,280
to me is that is exactly backwards what

17
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,160
you just said. So, let's imagine we are doing these 20 dot dot dot dot,

18
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:48,280
and now I'm on the 20th game, okay? What's going to happen on the 20th game?

19
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,490
>> Well, I mean, I guess I could have built up

20
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:52,440
trust in you from the previous games and

21
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,800
think that you're going to cooperate with me, because we've

22
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,670
been cooperating together. And then that would be

23
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:59,540
the perfect time to drop a dime on you.

24
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:01,882
>> Exactly. So, if this is the 20th game and we're

25
00:01:01,882 --> 00:01:03,834
in this situation, remember whatever value we've been adding up along

26
00:01:03,834 --> 00:01:11,526
the way, that's sunk cost. Right. The

27
00:01:11,526 --> 00:01:15,690
only thing that's left is the final game. And the final game looks like this,

28
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:18,020
which means we're going to end up here.

29
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:20,760
But guess what, Michael? The final one is

30
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:23,460
determined. So since we already know the outcome

31
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,970
of the final game, the only one that

32
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:29,920
we, the next one that we can look at is the 19th game. Well, we already

33
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,310
know what the outcome of the final game

34
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:34,550
is. So this is effectively the last game.

35
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:34,580
>> Oh.

36
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:36,580
>> And what is the outcome of that

37
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:40,620
going to be? It's going to be this and backwards,

38
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:43,770
backwards, backwards, backwards proof by induction because

39
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,340
the only that proves computer scientists know

40
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:49,920
how to do is proof by induction. It turns out that we will always defect

41
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,040
>> For what it's worth, those are the only proofs worth doing. But, okay.

42
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,001
>> That's true. It's a fine point. Truth by induction and

43
00:01:54,001 --> 00:01:58,890
perhaps by conduction [LAUGH]. So, there you go Michael, even if I

44
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:01,600
can play multiple, multiple games to try to build up trust,

45
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,650
the truth is the Nash equilibrium, if I filled out that eight

46
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:08,360
by eight matrix you wanted me to fill out. I would still

47
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,750
end up in the same place where I would defect both times.

48
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:14,260
>> Certainly if, yeah okay, so if you're going to be a jerk then, then I

49
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:16,410
have to be a jerk, but yeah, I

50
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:18,610
guess that's right. That's, that seems pretty horrible.

51
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:20,470
>> It is. And by the way this is not

52
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:22,840
just something I'm making up. This is another theorem that

53
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,570
comes out of Nash equilibrium. That if you have an

54
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:30,890
n repeated game then the solution is n repeated, Nash

55
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:34,300
equilibrium. So whatever the Nash equilibrium is

56
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:36,540
for the first game, the one version

57
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:40,220
of the game, is the repeated Nash equilibrium for all versions of that game.

58
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:42,810
>> Okay, wait a, hang on, hang on. So I. Okay, I buy that.

59
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:44,400
>> Mm-hm.

60
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,320
>> But couldn't you, well so, in a game that

61
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:49,680
has more than one Nash equilibrium, couldn't we like, al, alternate?

62
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,500
>> We could, and in fact you'll notice that in so far,

63
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:56,320
I have not talked about the case where you have multiple Nash equilibrium.

64
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,500
Because in fact, that's it's own problem. If I have one

65
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,960
Nash equilibrium, then we know what's going to happen. If I have two

66
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:04,870
Nash equilibria, which one do we choose? Now, what's important to know

67
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:08,510
here, is that if we have two Nash Equilibria then that means

68
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:11,110
that if you're in any one of them, you won't leave

69
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:13,590
it. So it's not like you'll move from one Nash Equilibrium to

70
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:17,900
another, sort of in the general case. Because the fact that it's

71
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:21,370
an equilibrium means that if everyone else is fixed except one person,

72
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:25,690
that person won't choose to move. But. I haven't said anything about how you

73
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:29,320
would choose among multiple Nash equilibria. And

74
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,260
that's beyond the scope of this class.

75
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:32,250
>> Okay.

76
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:35,290
>> But it is an active researcher and in fact

77
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:37,360
some of my own students have done some work in

78
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,280
thinking about. What it would mean to choose and actually

79
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,590
the answer always boils down to, let's not worry about that.

80
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:46,460
>> [LAUGH] All right. But I'm still kind of disturbed

81
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:49,040
by this, right? So it seems like it's sort of saying, is if we

82
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,380
knew the world was going to end tomorrow then we might as well be greedy

83
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:56,440
bastards. And, in fact, if we know that the world is going to end at

84
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,560
any particular time, which of course it

85
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,785
will. We might as well be greedy bastards.

86
00:04:00,785 --> 00:04:03,870
>> That's right. So, be greedy bastards.

87
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:04,910
>> Oh, no!

88
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:06,665
>> Or at least, or at least be you know, Nash bastards.

89
00:04:06,665 --> 00:04:11,525
>> [LAUGH] We'll, the Nash is kind of greedy right, it's like I'm always

90
00:04:11,525 --> 00:04:14,631
taking an action that's always best for me.

91
00:04:14,631 --> 00:04:15,430
>> Yes, you are.

92
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:15,930
>> No.

93
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:20,310
>> Every single thing we've talked about today. Has always

94
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:23,040
assumed that you're always doing what's best for you. The fact

95
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,330
that it might also be best for someone else is

96
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:27,840
neither here nor there, you're always doing what's best for you.

97
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,600
>> Right, I get, I get that, but it's, it sounds like this argument is saying

98
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:37,300
that we might as well be like that, like all the time and never really form,

99
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:39,470
like never, never self-sacrifice even a little

100
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:43,150
bit for greater advantage even to yourself.

101
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:44,830
>> Well, that's not true. This, it's just

102
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:47,274
all hidden in the utilities, once you've gone through

103
00:04:47,274 --> 00:04:48,938
all the what I'm going to do today, what

104
00:04:48,938 --> 00:04:50,810
I'm going to do tomorrow, you add it all up,

105
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:53,590
whatever the right strategy is to take. That's

106
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:56,000
the strategy that you take because it's already accounted

107
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,940
for all the self-sacrfice you might do that then

108
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:02,430
leads to later good deeds or later good outcome.

109
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:05,970
So the wonderful thing about all of this, is that this

110
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:09,610
matrix is everything you need to know. It captures the future, past

111
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:11,960
and everything else, so everything you need to know is right

112
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:15,360
here. And it's all been reduced to a bunch of pairs of

113
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,170
numbers. But you did say something kind of interesting though, Michael,

114
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:20,290
which I think is worth pointing out, which is that everything you

115
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:24,060
say requires knowing when, at least in this sort of iterated version,

116
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:27,540
requires knowing when the world is going to end. So an interesting question

117
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:29,960
to ask would be, what would happen if I knew the world

118
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:32,360
was going to end but I didn't know when. Would that change my behavior.

119
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,290
>> It, it doesn't seem like that

120
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:35,620
should make any difference because it's still

121
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:39,895
going to end. If not today then tomorrow. Or if not tomorrow then the next day.

122
00:05:39,895 --> 00:05:43,560
>> True. But I bet yeah it does make a difference.

123
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,890
>> I'm willing to go and think about that.

124
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:46,680
>> Okay, why don't you go think about it and let me know.

125
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,370
>> Alright. I'll, I'll tell you about it in the next lecture then.

126
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:52,640
>> Okay, I like that. Excellent. Okay, cool. So,

127
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,120
let's move on.

128
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,530
>> [LAUGH] Okay, fair enough.
