1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,130
In this exercise you'll set
up a shape renderer and

2
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:04,360
use it to draw a stick figure.

3
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:08,430
At a minimum you'll need a circle for
the head, and five lines for

4
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:11,670
the torso, the two arms,
and the two legs.

5
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:14,700
Remember in order to set up a shape
renderer you need to declare it,

6
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:17,020
initialize it, and dispose of it.

7
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:19,090
Then to actually use the shape renderer,

8
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:21,310
you'll need to start a batch
of the appropriate type,

9
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:25,220
whether that's filled or lined, draw
your shapes, and then end the batch.

10
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:27,260
We don't really have
step-by-step to-dos for

11
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:30,430
this one since the aim is for
you to remember the steps for

12
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:33,540
setting up a shape renderer and
be able to set one up on your own.

13
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:35,650
Of course, the solution is
still available if you run

14
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:37,230
into anything confusing.

15
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:37,770
Give it a try.
