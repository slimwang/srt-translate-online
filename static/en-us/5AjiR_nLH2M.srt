1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,524
This is why participants should be randomly assigned to treatment, meaning

2
00:00:04,536 --> 00:00:09,164
everyone has an equal chance of being assigned to either of the two treatments.

3
00:00:09,267 --> 00:00:14,052
In theory, randomization makes the two groups similar. On average, for example,

4
00:00:14,155 --> 00:00:18,635
the groups should be similar in age, the number of males and females, their

5
00:00:18,647 --> 00:00:23,245
sleep habits, et cetera. And that's why it's good to have a big sample size.

6
00:00:23,347 --> 00:00:28,040
Randomization works best with larger groups. We'll come back to the benefits of

7
00:00:28,052 --> 00:00:32,665
larger samples later in this class. Now one more thing before we end this story.

8
00:00:32,767 --> 00:00:37,174
We started this module with the question, If you're preparing for your exam

9
00:00:37,186 --> 00:00:41,261
tomorrow, should you stay up studying or should you go to sleep? Researchers

10
00:00:41,273 --> 00:00:45,596
have demonstrated using both observational and experimental studies, that sleep

11
00:00:45,608 --> 00:00:49,741
is important for memory. Getting a good night's sleep will likely pay off more

12
00:00:49,753 --> 00:00:53,980
than a couple of extra hours of studying. On the right you'll find a link to an

13
00:00:53,992 --> 00:00:57,870
interesting story, of you'd like to learn more about this topic. I wish I had

14
00:00:57,882 --> 00:00:59,205
have known that in college.
