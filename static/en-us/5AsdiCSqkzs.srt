00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:05,100
We said that spinlocks are one of the
most basic synchronization primitives.

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:08,930
And that they're also used in creating
some more complex synchronization

3
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:10,280
constructs.

4
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:14,040
For that reason it makes sense to
focus the remainder of this lesson

5
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:18,760
on understanding how exactly
spinlocks can be implemented.

6
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:21,260
And what types of opportunities
are available for

7
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:23,090
their efficient implementation.

8
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:27,500
To do this, we will follow the paper The
Performance of Spin Lock Alternatives

9
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:31,500
on Shared Memory Multiprocessors
by Tom Anderson.

10
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:35,740
The paper discusses different
implementations of spinlocks and

11
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:37,290
this is relevant also for

12
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:41,450
other synchronization constructs
that use internally spinlocks.

13
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:45,180
Also some of the techniques that
are described in this paper that concern

14
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:49,227
the use of atomic instructions
generalize to other constructs and

15
00:00:49,227 --> 00:00:49,941
other situations.
