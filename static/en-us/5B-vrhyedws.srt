00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,388
Just to recap, when we have any normal distribution, we can standardize it by

2
00:00:05,388 --> 00:00:10,965
first subtracting the mean, shifting it to 0. And then dividing by the standard

3
00:00:10,965 --> 00:00:16,385
deviation, which makes the standard deviation 1. This is called the standard

4
00:00:16,385 --> 00:00:21,923
normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 1. So here, the z score

5
00:00:21,923 --> 00:00:27,470
is going to be negative 1, and two standard deviations away, a negative 2. So

6
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:33,580
now, every value in the data set is written in terms of the standard deviations

7
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:35,155
it is from the mean.
