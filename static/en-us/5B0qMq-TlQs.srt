1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,346
Now, a relative maximum is a value of the function that is higher than all the

2
00:00:04,346 --> 00:00:08,795
other values of the function that are in the neighborhood of that point. So, a

3
00:00:08,795 --> 00:00:13,954
so-called relative maximum like a relative minimum because it's a maximum just

4
00:00:13,954 --> 00:00:18,804
in relation to the points surrounding that point. So, as we said before, B on

5
00:00:18,804 --> 00:00:23,688
this purple curve is a relative maximum, that's because all of the points to the

6
00:00:23,688 --> 00:00:28,054
left of it and all the points to the right of it, in the general area of the

7
00:00:28,054 --> 00:00:32,716
curve close to B, have values of the function that are lower than what we find

8
00:00:32,716 --> 00:00:37,080
at B itself. So, if we relate B to parts of the graph that are further away,

9
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:41,560
like points up here, we will find some areas where the function takes a higher

10
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:45,781
values than it does with B. But those aren't close by. For the points that B

11
00:00:45,781 --> 00:00:49,543
really cares about that are close to it, it's right on top.
