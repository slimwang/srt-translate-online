00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,660
SQL injection attacks are a common
security problem with code that

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:06,510
uses a database without
being careful enough.

3
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:08,160
But they're not the only one.

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,740
Here's another exciting opportunity
to mess with your forum app.

5
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:17,010
Copy the text from the instructor notes,
and put it into a forum post,

6
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:20,780
like so, and hit the Post button.

7
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:22,780
Oh, no.

8
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:27,580
Spam, and more spam, and even more spam.

9
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:30,840
Where's all this spam coming from?

10
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,830
Every time the forum page loads,

11
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:35,690
our web browser is submitting spam
messages back into the forum.

12
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,810
Remember back in lesson one when I
asked you to think about the meaning of

13
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:41,890
data in particular columns?

14
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:45,360
Well here is a case where that's
not an abstract concern at all.

15
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,550
The forum program is treating each
post as if it's just a piece of text.

16
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:51,940
But your browser on the other hand,

17
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:55,900
your browser is interpreting it with
a different meaning, as a piece of code.

18
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:58,940
This is another security
problem a web app can have,

19
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:01,330
it's called a script injection attack.

20
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:04,110
And this is why real web
forums don't allow users to

21
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:07,170
put arbitrary JavaScript
code in their comments.

22
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:08,870
Okay, so how do we fix it?
