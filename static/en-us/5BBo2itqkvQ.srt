1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:01,100
Okay.

2
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:03,480
So, here we have two frames.

3
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:07,480
On the left we have the original model
the, the model is sort of a time and,

4
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:09,500
and we're going to call that zero.

5
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,530
And on the right we have some candidate.

6
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:13,520
Something, some place in
terms of how its changed and

7
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:16,720
this can be centered at some value y,
some pixel y.

8
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,720
So on the left,
we have our initial distribution.

9
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:21,990
Okay.
So this was our

10
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:26,590
histogram that we computed, in our area,
and it's typically called q.

11
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:29,500
And q's got a set of bins, u1 through m.

12
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:33,130
And because it's going to
represent a density,

13
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:35,860
we enforce the fact that
sum of them equals one.

14
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:36,900
So how do we do that?

15
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:40,310
Well we just sum them all up and
we divide all the bins by that value.

16
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:40,880
Okay.
And

17
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:44,380
you see we have the audaciousness
to call it probability.

18
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:45,390
Okay?
Because

19
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:47,460
well were going to take these samples
and we're going to assume that it's

20
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:50,220
representative of a probability
distribution function.

21
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:55,250
So that's our distribution at
the initial of the target.

22
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:57,310
At some new location.

23
00:00:57,310 --> 00:00:58,020
Okay.

24
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:00,330
We can compute the distribution again.

25
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:07,080
So now p of u is a function of y where
y is the point that we're considering.

26
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:10,410
Remember you have to consider
p of z given the state.

27
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:13,020
So y is going to be that,
that new point.

28
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:14,880
And it's called y instead of x,

29
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,364
that's how it's done in the Mean-Shift
Literature if you read this, this is,

30
00:01:18,364 --> 00:01:19,450
this is what you would see.

31
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:22,230
And again,
were going to build a distribution

32
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:24,600
by assuming that these
things sum up to one.

33
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,890
So we have this two distributions and
what we have to do is we need

34
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:34,840
a similarity function that compares
them, that compares the original

35
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:40,130
q and the new p of y which is
the density at this proposed place.

36
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:44,570
So the question is how are we
going to compare these distributions?

37
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:49,120
Now there are a variety of functions
that you can use to compare histograms,

38
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,610
where the histograms, are,
are normalized to one, so

39
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:53,440
they represent probabilities.

40
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,570
There's the min value.

41
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:57,250
There's, there's chi-squared,
a variety of them.

42
00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:00,025
The one that was used with respect to

43
00:02:00,025 --> 00:02:04,640
Mean-Shift tracking is referred to
as the Bhattacharyya Coefficient.

44
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,750
Bhattacharyya Coefficient comes
from something related to

45
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:07,940
the Bhattacharyya distance.

46
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:11,070
It's simply a way of
comparing distributions.

47
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:13,870
What you do is,
you take your distributions here, and

48
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:18,030
you change it by taking the square
root of each of the components.

49
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:21,450
So, if q is a distribution,
q1 through qm, then

50
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:26,010
q prime is going to be the square root
of q1 through the square root of qm.

51
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:29,970
Same thing with the new proposed
distribution, p, around y.

52
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:33,420
We're going to take p prime,
where we take the square roots.

53
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,210
When we define it that way,

54
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:38,070
the Bhattacharyya relationship
is defined as follows.

55
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:39,460
Okay?

56
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:45,020
Just take the sum over the product
of those square roots.

57
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:46,090
Okay.
Well you might ask,

58
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:47,060
why would you do that.

59
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:49,360
>> Why would you do that?

60
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,490
>> Well you quickly realize that

61
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:57,220
if you take the magnitude of
those square rooted vectors.

62
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:58,160
Right?

63
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:01,420
The magnitude is the square
root of the sum of the squares.

64
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:03,820
Well, the sum of the squares is what?

65
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:07,840
Well, since the sum of the qs is one,
the sum of the square roots

66
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,280
then squared is going to be one,
so the magnitude is one.

67
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,050
So, these magnitudes here, those are
one, so that means you just have this.

68
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:19,210
So basically you're
computing the dot product,

69
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:24,240
the cosine of the angle between
the square roots of those distributions.

70
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:27,140
And that sum of the square root,
the thing in the box here,

71
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,600
that's what's referred to as
the Bhattacharyya Coefficient.

72
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,790
It's just a way of comparing
distributions, and so

73
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:33,500
that's what they did.
