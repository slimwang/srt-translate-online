1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,340
Alright I'm sold. You want to make an approval process.

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:04,600
What are we going to do? Help me out here.

3
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:07,670
>> Well before we jump to make the approval process we need

4
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:10,730
to think about what are we actually trying to create the flow for.

5
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:11,710
>> Okay.

6
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:13,980
>> So we have our stage managers.

7
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:14,770
>> Yeah.

8
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:16,040
>> And they need to approve whether or

9
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:18,229
not bands can be book at certain set times.

10
00:00:18,229 --> 00:00:18,640
>> Okay.

11
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,840
>> So we want to create an approval process on set times.

12
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,400
>> Set times, makes sense. And when a booking agent tries

13
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,920
to book something, the stage manager has to sign off.

14
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:28,492
>> Exactly.

15
00:00:28,492 --> 00:00:33,230
>> Cool. Okay. So, I guess I'll just search for approvals or something.

16
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:34,470
>> Yep. It's in the set up.

17
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:37,600
>> Okay. Okay. Workflow and approvals,

18
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,190
cool. Approval process. It's recommended that

19
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:45,270
I follow the following instructions. I'm not going to do it though. So.

20
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:46,470
>> Rules are meant to be broken.

21
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:50,060
>> Yeah. Manage approval processes for set time right?

22
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:50,820
>> Exactly.

23
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:52,300
>> Okay, create new.

24
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:53,440
>> Yep. Click that guy.

25
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,720
>> Ooh, I have a choice of wizards, a jump start

26
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:57,570
wizard, or a standard set up. Do you have a preference?

27
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:59,080
>> I use jump start, it's quicker.

28
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:05,209
>> Okay. Okay, name for the approval process? Stage Manager Sign Off?

29
00:01:05,209 --> 00:01:08,370
>> Yeah sure. Stage manager approval, whatever.

30
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:10,235
>> Approval oh yeah they're called approvals.

31
00:01:10,235 --> 00:01:10,235
>>

32
00:01:10,235 --> 00:01:10,622
[LAUGH]

33
00:01:10,622 --> 00:01:13,510
>> So approval assignment email template. What are we

34
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:14,790
doing with that? Are we even setting an email?

35
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:19,400
>> So we could if we wanted to, but we don't have to so in this case it's

36
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:22,740
okay. Okay, so we've got our specific entry criteria,

37
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:25,660
use this approval process if defined criteria are met.

38
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:27,610
>> So this is really similar to the workflow rule,

39
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:30,670
right, where we're trying to come up with some certain criteria.

40
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:31,094
>> Uh-huh.

41
00:01:31,094 --> 00:01:35,460
>> That this should only fire this process if.

42
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:35,810
>> Something

43
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:36,520
happens, it's true.

44
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:37,450
>> If there's a baseline.

45
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:37,910
>> Okay.

46
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:41,750
>> And so when would we not want it to go for approval? Like, when would

47
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:44,550
we be like, this is bad data. This

48
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:46,340
shouldn't be under approval, because it's not complete.

49
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:49,570
>> There wasn't a, a field miss, there's a field missing?

50
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:54,250
>> Exactly. And so, what's the most important field on set time that would,

51
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:56,820
has to be there, in order for it to be something we should review?
