1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:04,689
Yep, you got it,
the aptly named preview Image attribute

2
00:00:04,689 --> 00:00:08,740
is what you need to include if you
want to preview image for your widget.

3
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:12,030
Generally, during development,
you'll be iterating on your widget, and

4
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:14,750
creating a preview
image isn't as useful.

5
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:18,390
After you've finalized your widget,
you can use the Widget Preview App,

6
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:23,030
available on Android Emulators to get
a perfect preview image of your widget.

7
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:26,730
Then put the image in your
drawable nodpi folder and

8
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:29,010
reference it in your app
widget provider info xml.
