00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,628
We have negative 5x cubed times y squared, squared. So I should write this

2
00:00:04,628 --> 00:00:09,217
twice. Now that I have a product of factors, I can regroup the basis that are

3
00:00:09,217 --> 00:00:13,794
alike. So I have two negative 5, two x cubes, and two y squared's multiplied

4
00:00:13,794 --> 00:00:18,423
together. That would have been the same if I would just distributed the square

5
00:00:18,423 --> 00:00:21,902
to each of the terms. I would have had two negative 5, two x cubes, and two y

6
00:00:21,902 --> 00:00:29,097
squared. Now that I'm here, I can multiply my numbers together, and my bases

7
00:00:29,097 --> 00:00:35,417
together. Negative 5 times negative 5 is positive 25 times 2 is 50. For the base

8
00:00:35,417 --> 00:00:41,277
of x, I simply add the exponents together, 3 plus 3 makes 6 and 7 makes 13. The

9
00:00:41,277 --> 00:00:45,977
y's are a little bit easier, so I just have y to the 4th. All together I have 50

10
00:00:45,977 --> 00:00:50,144
times x to the 13th times x to the 4th. If you reasoned your way somewhat

11
00:00:50,144 --> 00:00:54,457
through that or got any of these exponents right, great job. If you got this

12
00:00:54,457 --> 00:00:58,288
right on your first try, that's even more impressive, great work.
