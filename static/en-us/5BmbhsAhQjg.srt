Hi, I'm Richard,
a course developer at Udacity.

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:05,490
After reviewing some of the feedback for
this course,

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:09,180
Cameron asked me to help him add
an additional lesson on jQuery events.

4
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:10,510
So here we are.

5
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:13,250
Events give you the power to
set up automatic responses

6
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:16,490
based on what your users do
when they're on your page.

7
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:19,660
In this short lesson, we'll be taking
a look at how browser events can help

8
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:21,870
develop interactive websites.

9
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:26,090
You'll be doing this by listening for
and reacting to events.

10
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:28,500
Now you can do this with no
libraries at all, but for

11
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,120
simplicity we'll be using
jQuery in this course.

12
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:31,840
Ready to get started?
