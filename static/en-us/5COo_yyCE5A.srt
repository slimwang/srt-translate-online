1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Let's do some simple tests.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
We want to be able to get things like 1, 2, 3, 4

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
and also 12-34.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Let's try the first one.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
1, 2, 3, 4, we win.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Oh, no problem there.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
How about this one, 12-34?

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Well, 1, 2--I can't take the hyphen here.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
But I could take this epsilon transition for free and then take the hyphen.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
That sounds good.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Now I'm in state 4, and I see a 3.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
So probably there should be some sort of digit label on this edge.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
3, 4, and then back here, and I accept.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Just to check our work, let's do something a little more complicated.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
1, 2, 3, hyphen, 3, 4.

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Free, free again,

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
hyphen, 5, 6, free again, accepted.

18
00:00:59,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Excellent.
