00:00:00,628 --> 00:00:04,550
The class projects will be based on the Raven's Progressive Matrices test of

2
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:09,140
intelligence. This test was written in the 1930s to examine general human

3
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:14,290
intelligence. It consists of 60 multiple-choice visual analogy problems.

4
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,580
The Raven's test is unique among intelligence test in that all problems in

5
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:26,090
the Raven's test are strictly visual. No words. It is the most widespread,

6
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:31,020
the most commonly used, the most reliable test of intelligence. The Raven's test

7
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:35,220
consists of two kinds of problems, two by two matrix problems and

8
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:39,510
three by three matrix problems. We'll also consider a special case of

9
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:43,259
two by one matrix problems. They're not part of the original test. But

10
00:00:43,259 --> 00:00:47,750
they will providing a baseline for starting to construct AI agents. Your project

11
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:51,500
will be to implement AI agents that can solve problems like those that appear in

12
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:55,720
the Raven's Test of Intelligence. Let's look at a few sample problems right now.
