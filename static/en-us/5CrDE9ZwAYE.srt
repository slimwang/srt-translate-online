1
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:05,400
So you already touched on this aspect also. The fact that

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:09,560
more and more we are seeing end users using mobile platforms.

3
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:09,760
>> Yeah.

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:13,240
>> And mobile platforms are entirely in the cloud.

5
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:16,940
And so as this future revolution happens in the data

6
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:20,570
center things are changing. What do you expect as changes

7
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:23,900
that are happening at the consumer end of these services?

8
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:26,410
>> To be honest, the consumer end is driving most of this.

9
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:27,281
>> Mm-hm.

10
00:00:27,281 --> 00:00:29,690
>> And the classical enterprise IT is following.

11
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:30,411
>> Mm-hm.

12
00:00:30,411 --> 00:00:34,270
>> So the, the consumer revolution in the mobile

13
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:37,550
And small devices of the like, are driving much of

14
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:42,460
this criteria. And the benefit then as accruing over time

15
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:46,190
to the usage of the systems. So, you want examples.

16
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:46,690
>> Right.

17
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:51,480
>> With more and more collaboration needs, or sharing of state.

18
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,660
You're going to put more state in the back end. To be

19
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:56,580
able to share them with multiple users. Or they need to

20
00:00:56,580 --> 00:01:01,580
do things beyond just messaging, you know, sharing, sharing data sharing

21
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:04,870
state and the like. You'll find out that data will flow

22
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:08,510
quite a bit from the devices [INAUDIBLE]. And there are physics

23
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:12,090
however, the device cannot be very big, the battery or device

24
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:14,380
cannot be very big, so the device can only do so

25
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:16,670
much. So the back end has to do it for you.

26
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:16,760
>> Right.

27
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,620
>> And finding the balance between them

28
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:20,130
will change over time as well, of course.

29
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:23,750
>> But there's also brings an interesting, concern,

30
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:26,050
that is, as you said, there's going to be

31
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:28,840
more that's happening in the back end, right?

32
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,600
Because the mobile devices may not be able to

33
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,730
do it all. And you also mentioned that,

34
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:35,850
there may be collaboration among the mobile devices. And

35
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:38,640
a lot of the things that happen in

36
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,720
mobile devices today are streaming kinds of things, and

37
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:48,040
how ready is the cloud for dealing with that kind of

38
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:52,153
traffic. And in particular you also mentioned that cloud is architect

39
00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:57,680
ed today as throughput oriented not so much latency oriented. So

40
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,688
what do you see as changes that might be coming [UNKNOWN]? [CROSSTALK]

41
00:02:00,688 --> 00:02:03,440
>> The different type of streaming order. Okay, so for the,

42
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:08,850
the bulk of inter traffic [UNKNOWN] steaming of pre recorded material.

43
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:12,355
And the way that Internet can handle it at large as you know its

44
00:02:12,355 --> 00:02:14,730
[INAUDIBLE]. So you have circle cs networks.

45
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:17,140
Content solution networks. Where the content is

46
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:20,370
told that they edge closer to the user and once you ask for a

47
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:23,180
movie and you'll be able to ask for it the second time is almost free

48
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:28,294
and by and large that's all working practically. I mean

49
00:02:28,294 --> 00:02:30,720
um,uh, depending where you are in the world, Netflix for

50
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,950
example in the US is very big and so forth.

51
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:37,940
To do more real time, it becomes more interesting, and more

52
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:39,640
conversant to be honest. And I think, I think things

53
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:42,277
will change as well. But I have to tell you,

54
00:02:42,277 --> 00:02:45,270
I am myself amazed how it works are already in

55
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:50,590
that sense. The latency aspects are, have to do with Ultimately

56
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:53,200
with physics. So there will be cases where if

57
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:57,480
your application requires a lot of chatty, lots of protocol

58
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,790
between a component and another component, you have to

59
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:02,560
think seriously about where they should land. If it's very

60
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,100
chatty and physics, as the same, we cannot change

61
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:07,650
the laws of physics, They have to be closer to

62
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:11,832
each other. So decomposing the app, whether it be, be

63
00:03:11,832 --> 00:03:15,590
to [INAUDIBLE] time live streaming of data or video, whatever,

64
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:18,530
is very important to put chatty stuff and where they

65
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:21,510
should land, which is where they can withstand the long distance.

66
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:23,500
>> Right, but that also brings up the

67
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:27,170
question of data centers as they are architecture today.

68
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:27,750
>> Yes

69
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:32,840
>> They are, as you mentioned, they're in some darkroom somewhere. But if my

70
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:36,100
mobile device is latency sensitive, shouldn't it

71
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:39,350
be closer to where the mobile device is?

72
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:41,330
>> True. And there will be multiple levels.

73
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:44,630
So you want put some competitional on device. That's, if

74
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:47,790
it, if the latency between two components is so critical,

75
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:49,610
there's no way you can cross any wire So some

76
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:52,170
will live in the device itself. Some will live on the

77
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:54,370
edge of the network before we get to the actual

78
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:59,920
DC. And in, increasingly, there are mega services on the internet.

79
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,800
Don't directly hit, you don't hit the DC directly. You

80
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:06,980
go to a net somewhere. And you do also when optimizations.

81
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:10,840
TCPIP optimizations. For example, You may land to an edge

82
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:15,760
closer to you. And there the connection between that base and

83
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,310
the actual DC yard, I get to create over common [INAUDIBLE]

84
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:20,200
connections. So tricks are definitely

85
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:23,560
important. Latency hiding tricks are important.

86
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:27,730
>> So this next question I'm going to ask

87
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:32,370
you is more related to. From the students' perspectives.

88
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:33,480
You know, the students that are taking

89
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,510
this course, this is an advanced operating

90
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:39,480
systems course, and and these students, they

91
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:42,720
may be aspiring to work in leading software

92
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,460
companies such as yours. What would be

93
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:48,330
your advice to students that are taking this

94
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:51,670
course? Specifically can you talk to the

95
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:57,228
students about, the opportunities that exists, for O.S.

96
00:04:57,228 --> 00:05:01,300
designers today in the industry space. And how

97
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:04,810
the students should prepare themselves for such opportunities.

98
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:09,130
>> Sure, I'll be honest with you, you may not design new O.S. from scratch

99
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:13,310
We have a bunch of them already. But every concept you're learning here will be

100
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:16,180
needed, more than beneficial, needed, when you

101
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:18,540
move up and down the stack. If you're

102
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:22,670
doing an application, like much of the discussion we had right now, a high scale

103
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:26,530
application, it's, it's no longer writing an application through on

104
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:29,640
a machine by itself, displaying to a screen. All the

105
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,430
issues we touch on, you have to worry about, you

106
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:33,542
have to know about them. You have to know about

107
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:36,260
caching and scale, you have to know about synchronization, data

108
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:40,890
replication, handling failures, so all these concepts you have in

109
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:44,740
a classic of OS sense, are directly applicable regardless where

110
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:48,080
you live up and down the [UNKNOWN] So I'm convinced

111
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,740
that with out a fund, a strong foundation operating

112
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:53,510
systems and a few other topics, programming languages and

113
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:56,180
the like. One cannot handle or build those big

114
00:05:56,180 --> 00:06:00,290
applications. You could do some simple work programming, do some

115
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:03,080
java script and a nice animated screen, don't get

116
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,010
me wrong, this all is important. But if you

117
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:08,390
want to do the real scalable services where the

118
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:13,710
entity's moving you have to have the foundations. More generically,

119
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:17,630
you have to also use the information you learned here and be ready, ready

120
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:19,800
to learn more. And to apply it

121
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:23,170
in different domains. So the classical papers that

122
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:27,250
you taught me way back when are still relevant. But as we discussed, you

123
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:29,180
may have to apply them differently to

124
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:32,220
morph them, evolve them, into newer [INAUDIBLE] areas.

125
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:38,990
>> So I want to make sure that the students get an idea

126
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:44,320
about specific things that you think that they should get when they're

127
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:48,890
in school. What are the things if you can name, specify, I

128
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:52,460
mean, specifically can you name a few things that you think are

129
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:55,830
important for students to get while they are still a student here.

130
00:06:55,830 --> 00:07:01,570
>> Mm-hm. College time. The time you are taking right now to learn

131
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:04,740
all this stuff is a most exciting time to be honest. Because you

132
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:10,560
can keep an open mind. And go white. So learn as why I think that's possible.

133
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,180
You want specific things in computer science, let's

134
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:18,260
be specific here. Definitely operating systems. Distribute systems

135
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:21,160
and definitely programming language as a background. I

136
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,540
think they're very important. The foundations for any

137
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:25,444
platform level type of work if you [UNKNOWN]...

138
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,790
Know the classical information, but also know how

139
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:31,950
to apply them and what you actually have in

140
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:34,590
every day and the like. What else would I want

141
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:37,870
to do? Frankly beyond CS, I would also try

142
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:39,990
to get other back ground that complement what I do.

143
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:41,140
>> Mm-hm.

144
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:42,720
>> Even the things like humanities and the like, that are

145
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,470
actually important because when you move up and you want to work

146
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:50,400
in industry and the like. Much what we do, we actually write

147
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,890
code. We design code. We make software. But we also, no longer

148
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:58,240
build things by ourselves. Now the systems you have

149
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,480
at your disposal aren't built by one person, they

150
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,130
are built by teams. So learn how to work

151
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:06,470
in teams. Learn how to deal with other people like

152
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:09,100
you who have to collaborate. And, build a software

153
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:13,030
collage. Some districts can only, we often, look, you may

154
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:16,040
only learn the basics in college. But, as you

155
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:20,230
go forward, you know, apply the large software. And also,

156
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:24,300
don't shy away from the tough assignments, you know. Push

157
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:27,170
the envelope while you can right now. Then, come back and

158
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:31,440
you can really apply them as you go forth. Lastly a

159
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:36,159
good foundation in just knowing the basics of computer science, basic

160
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:41,808
you know, algorithm, algorithm design analysis is actually very

161
00:08:41,808 --> 00:08:45,210
important. So the more advanced topics, you never did

162
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:48,900
ask you in industry what np is equal to p, and go solve this one or solve that.

163
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,510
But you will have to reason almost every day

164
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:52,780
about the basic complexity of an algorithm, or to

165
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:54,860
basically to apply a certain technique on the like.

166
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:56,840
And the foundation algorithms are really important as well.

167
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:00,570
>> So outside of school, though they are in

168
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:03,890
school, there's a chance for them to, to hone their

169
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:06,690
skills overall. What do you think of things

170
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:09,710
that they should be absorbing outside of school?

171
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:12,020
>> I would start the habit now, outside

172
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:14,230
of school, to keep track what's happening out there.

173
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:19,110
If you join [UNKNOWN] tomorrow, you will, in a

174
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:21,620
sense, have stopped learning what the [UNKNOWN] stuff is and

175
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:26,330
you start going and learning what's happening out there. And

176
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:29,450
things move very quickly out there as you know. So

177
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:33,630
start right now understanding what's happening in general. So

178
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:36,350
know the fundamentals but also know how people are applying

179
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:39,780
them. Be curious. I mean I sometimes bring up a

180
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,500
browser look at a pic and say how they done

181
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:44,730
this thing and oh it's Ajax doing dress for APIs and

182
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:48,720
so forth. So learn to be curious from right now and learn

183
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,300
to link what you do with what you see around you

184
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:55,790
as well. And that habit has to start early and don't stop

185
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:58,780
it. Keep it going. The worst thing that can happen is

186
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:01,560
for you to go to industry and to spend five years doing

187
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:04,380
the same thing and nothing but that. You have to be

188
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:06,900
able to be curious and see around you as well. And that

189
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,050
habit has to be started right now.

190
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:13,240
>> So the next question is very specific to you and your own journey.

191
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:20,290
From a student in the 80's to becoming a leader in your chosen field,

192
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,940
what are some of the skill sets you wish you had acquired when you're

193
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:30,960
still a student. If you reflect back, what are the things that you would have

194
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:35,900
done differently or learned differently as a student that might have helped you?

195
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,340
>> Honestly, I mean, I'll be quite honest

196
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:40,480
with you. I took the least amount of humanities

197
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,248
I could get, and I loaded my schedule with

198
00:10:43,248 --> 00:10:47,180
CS and E,classes and math because that was the

199
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:49,990
fun stuff, the heavy stuff. And not go any

200
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:53,440
wrong this always important too, but take a balance

201
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:58,430
view to this. The humanity is all important knowing

202
00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:01,510
what's really around you beyond just the actual chord

203
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:03,390
and the bits are very important. And the reason

204
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:05,530
is very simple really, which is a part of my

205
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:08,450
last answer. When you go out there and do

206
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:12,250
things, you'll be expected to lead. To work with others

207
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:15,360
and to tell them where to go, if you

208
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,410
will. So you can lead them or you can follow.

209
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:19,440
It's better to lead, to be honest. And to

210
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,300
lead, you need to have soft skills and an ability

211
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:26,790
to understand people. So learning about the humanities, learning about

212
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:31,000
critical thinking and writing. Had actually very important, and sometimes

213
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,440
we in Academia don't pay enough attention to these things, to be honest. We'll

214
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,720
be great to make sure you hone your skills in that space as well.

215
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,543
>> Mm-hm.

216
00:11:37,543 --> 00:11:42,250
>> I mean a critical for example, in the US, a critical English writing class

217
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:46,420
may sound, you know, too much work, and why do I need this. But it can

218
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:48,310
really hone your skills for critical thinking,

219
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:52,890
critical analysis. Of the language. So, fast forward

220
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:56,630
20 years, or in my case more than that, and you have to send an email

221
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:58,540
explaining why something is going right, is

222
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:01,350
going wrong, et cetera. Conveying the message in

223
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:04,260
two paragraphs or to some busy people, that's

224
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:06,220
actually a skill that has little to do

225
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:09,910
with writing code, to be honest. But more of, can I put my thoughts down to

226
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:14,250
paper quickly and clearly and concisely? With softer

227
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:16,480
scales or in ethical scales are important too.

228
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:22,160
>> So, this is more of an advice from me of

229
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:28,640
professors like me from your experience. In your opinion, what you, what. How

230
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:34,230
do you think we can better prepare our students? To be ready for the work place.

231
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:38,980
>> There's a couple of dimensions. One is, just

232
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:40,370
to bring the last thought, and then we'll switch a

233
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:44,610
different point. One dimension is that in Academia, you, you,

234
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:47,690
you're going through a class, you're going to give a grade

235
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:50,420
to every student and the grade is his or

236
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:53,970
her grade. So in academia we basically look at

237
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:57,470
the individual performance, did I pass or not? Don't

238
00:12:57,470 --> 00:13:00,700
get me wrong, the same happens in industry, but to

239
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,760
get through anything in industry, you have to collaborate.

240
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:06,990
So what's usually missing in, in, in, in the

241
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:09,630
more academic environment is how to build software, for

242
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:13,030
example, in a, and how to do the soft skills

243
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:15,260
for building software in a group. And those things

244
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:16,880
are hard to get, I know, in academia, but it

245
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,150
is something I wish we can get more at

246
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:23,370
the graduate, with that background, if you want. You typically

247
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:25,550
have something in you when you, when you're, you're

248
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:27,650
a good leader, but then when you go join a

249
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:29,670
company and the like, you have to go nurture

250
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:32,870
and do more of that. Otherwise, that really would happen.

251
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:39,550
Beyond that, there are some things which would be great

252
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:43,310
if you make sure that the students can push the envelope

253
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:46,490
in ways that otherwise we in industry cannot do. So make

254
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:50,500
sure they have in them the, ability to try things which

255
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,720
otherwise some of us will try it and say it doesn't

256
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,770
work. You know, I'm not jaded by that. So it's important

257
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:58,740
to instill in the students that, that, and I think you

258
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,680
do a good job of that, but it's important to remember

259
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:03,330
that, that, that to push the envelope. Because once you

260
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:07,000
hit industry and the like, you're going to find constraints. You

261
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,980
have to shift quickly. There's a deadline et cetera, and

262
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:13,410
you may forget about what's possible. Never forget what's really possible.

263
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:17,650
>> So, do you have any final thoughts that you want to share?

264
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:21,590
>> Again, thank you for the opportunity. This is great. I hope you enjoy his

265
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:23,840
class. I'm going to actually plan to take

266
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,770
it. I'm not going to take it for grades

267
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:29,090
ok but I'm going to go I want to see it. I'm looking forward to it.

268
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:32,650
I think, sir, it's a great thing you're doing. And I wish you real luck.

269
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:35,350
>> Well thank you so much, Yousef, for coming and joining us.

270
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:36,130
>> Thank you, thank you, sure.

271
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:39,390
>> And let's thank Youself for being

272
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:40,970
here and sharing his thoughts with you all.

273
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:42,030
>> Thank you.
