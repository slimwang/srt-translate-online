1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:04,070
Judging by the percentages we discussed before, mental illness is pretty

2
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:09,530
common, something that every family experiences either directly or indirectly.

3
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:13,490
Because of this, mental health literacy is something that we should strive for

4
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:16,970
as a culture, given that almost half of us will experience some type of

5
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:22,705
disorder in our life. In addition, over half of the people who experience at

6
00:00:22,705 --> 00:00:27,960
least one psychological disorder, will also experience a second disorder.

7
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:33,084
Having two or more mental disorders occurring at the same time, is termed

8
00:00:33,084 --> 00:00:40,981
comorbidity. The new DSM-5 lists 21 major categories of disorders and over 350

9
00:00:40,981 --> 00:00:47,200
distinct disorders. Now, as we mentioned at the beginning of the study, we want

10
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,860
to remind you that not all psychologists agree with the categories in the

11
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:57,645
DSM-5, or with the notion that there are 350 distinct disorders. And also it's

12
00:00:57,645 --> 00:01:01,740
important to know that what's considered a disorder in the past, sometimes

13
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:09,040
changes over time. So the DSM isn't set in stone. For example, homosexuality

14
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:15,214
was listed as a mental disorder in the DSM. Which clearly we know no longer is

15
00:01:15,214 --> 00:01:19,707
the case. Nevertheless, given the historical use of the DSM, we'll discuss some

16
00:01:19,707 --> 00:01:25,105
of these categories in this lesson. Specifically, we'll discuss some of the 21

17
00:01:25,105 --> 00:01:29,980
major categories of disorders, Including, Neurodevelopmental disorders,

18
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:34,030
Depressive disorders, Bipolar disorders, Anxiety disorders,

19
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:39,205
Obsessive-compulsive disorder, Post traumatic stress disorder, Dissociative

20
00:01:39,205 --> 00:01:44,080
disorders, Somatic symptom disorders, Personality disorders, and finally

21
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:47,860
schizophrenia.
