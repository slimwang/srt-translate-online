1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,670
So some of these lines
are pretty straight forward.

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:05,210
They start with a command prompt and

3
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:07,689
then there's a command
that I typed after it.

4
00:00:07,689 --> 00:00:12,520
So those, all the ones that start
with a command prompt must be input.

5
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:18,200
This one right after the ls command
sure looks like output and it is.

6
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:22,420
Here though, I tried to get the shell
to wish you a Good St. Moose's Day.

7
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:25,670
But I forgot that the shell has a
special meaning for this single quote or

8
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:27,350
apostrophe character.

9
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:31,790
Like you saw earlier in the lesson,
the quote means that the argument and

10
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:34,190
therefore the command line that it's on

11
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:37,820
continue at least to the next
single quote, which is down here.

12
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:43,050
And that means this and this are both
also input lines, and these are output.

13
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:47,910
By the way, if you actually want to
see an apostrophe in the output.

14
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:48,640
You can do that.

15
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,533
The way you do that is to put
a backslash before the apostrophe.

16
00:00:52,533 --> 00:00:56,747
You'd also need to put a backslash
before the exclamation mark as well.
