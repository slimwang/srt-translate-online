00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:06,377
Now, what's the probability, for example, of randomly selecting a subject that

2
00:00:06,377 --> 00:00:12,750
is greater than five standard deviations above the mean? Would the probability

3
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:18,746
be approximately 0.01? And notice that these are in proportions 0.3, 0.8, or

4
00:00:18,746 --> 00:00:19,249
0.99.
