If you got this answer, excellent work. Here I've gone ahead and drawn the like

2
00:00:04,459 --> 00:00:08,816
terms in shapes. The p to the 4ths have a green square, and the p squareds have

3
00:00:08,816 --> 00:00:13,209
circles in a lighter color. I also drew triple lines under the constants. I'm

4
00:00:13,209 --> 00:00:17,494
showing you this as a method of finding the like terms. Use whatever you feel

5
00:00:17,494 --> 00:00:22,345
comfortable doing. These are just tools to help you out. I've rearranged the

6
00:00:22,345 --> 00:00:27,264
like terms in this second line. Notice I paid careful attention to keep the sign

7
00:00:27,264 --> 00:00:32,095
with its term. If it's positive the sign is positive. And if it's negative, the

8
00:00:32,095 --> 00:00:36,945
sign in front of the term still stays negative. Finally, adding our like terms

9
00:00:36,945 --> 00:00:38,845
together, we get this result.
