1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:03,469
Now that you have all this installed
your instance is ready to be used as

2
00:00:03,469 --> 00:00:05,390
a node in the hoodoo cluster.

3
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:06,480
You can easily save it and

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,300
launch multiple copies by
creating an amazon machine image.

5
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:11,820
Usually just called image.

6
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,610
When you use this image to launch
an instance it will already have

7
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:16,360
all the software installed.

8
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:18,610
From the dashboard go
to the instances list.

9
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,720
Select the instance, then actions,
image, create image.

10
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:28,080
Give it a name something like
a dupe node then save it.

11
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,800
Click AMI in the sidebar.

12
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,840
After a few minutes you should
see the image raster here.

13
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,410
If you come back to start up another
cluster you can launch this image and

14
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:38,279
you'll have nodes with Java
hoodoo already installed.

15
00:00:38,279 --> 00:00:39,249
