00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,200
So we talked a lot about domain and range in this lesson so far, but I want to

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:08,750
give you a slightly different perspective on how to visualize them, and how to

3
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:13,300
think about values of the domain through the relation of a function mapping to

4
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:17,796
values in the range. So lets say we have some function f and for three to our

5
00:00:17,796 --> 00:00:22,269
values a, b and c, constants not exactly sure what they are, we get outputs of

6
00:00:22,269 --> 00:00:27,694
one, four, and five. We know that if we graph this, we would pair the

7
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:33,175
coordinates a and 1, b and 4, and c and 5. And what the function is really doing

8
00:00:33,175 --> 00:00:37,205
is taking this input value, playing with it somehow, and spitting out this

9
00:00:37,205 --> 00:00:41,792
output. So you could visualize this by writing out values of the domain over

10
00:00:41,792 --> 00:00:46,544
here, and then showing that via the function, they get paired with these values

11
00:00:46,544 --> 00:00:51,230
in the range. Let's say actually that for this particular function f, a, b and c

12
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:56,265
are the only values in the domain. So if the entire domain of this function is

13
00:00:56,265 --> 00:01:01,346
just the set a, b, c, what values are in the range? Please separate any values

14
00:01:01,346 --> 00:01:03,263
that are in the range by commas.
