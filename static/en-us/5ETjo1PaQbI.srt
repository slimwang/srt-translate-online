1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,090
So the next thing I want to do is I want to show some

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:06,120
text reading recording in progress.

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:08,980
And I want this text to show up right here,

4
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:11,220
right underneath the microphone button.

5
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:14,330
To do this, I will go back to the standard editor.

6
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:19,370
There I see my storyboard and then I will slide out the utility area.

7
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:23,382
Let me center my storyboard.

8
00:00:23,382 --> 00:00:24,840
There.

9
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:28,420
Now in here, I'm looking for something called a label.

10
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:32,430
Let me actually go back to the list view to see what it does.

11
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:33,240
There it is.

12
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:37,370
It says, A label is a variable sized amount of static text,

13
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:39,240
which is exactly what we need.

14
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm going to drag this label and place it right underneath my microphone button.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:44,910
There.

16
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:50,610
Let me change its text to recording and then reposition it.

17
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,550
There.

18
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:58,120
Now, while the label is selected, I will go to the Attributes Inspector, and

19
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,670
then begin to change a whole bunch of things about this label.

20
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:02,170
For instance, I can change its font.

21
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,530
I can pick a custom font.

22
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:07,360
This is the font I like.

23
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:13,850
I can reduce the font size, can make the label central lined.

24
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,246
I can also change its color.

25
00:01:24,303 --> 00:01:26,163
And I will also go to the Editor and

26
00:01:26,163 --> 00:01:29,230
make sure that I select the Size to Fit Content option.

27
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:34,770
Let me reposition this one more time so it's right underneath the button.

28
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:36,670
There.

29
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:40,150
All right, I'm going to go ahead and run this and see how it looks.

30
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:44,110
All right, we can see our label right here,

31
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:47,420
although there seem to be a couple of things that are odd with it.

32
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:49,820
One is that it is not properly aligned.

33
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:52,750
It's not lined up right underneath the microphone button.

34
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:55,430
Now, this happened with this microphone button also, so

35
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:58,300
we kind of know a way to fix this.

36
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:01,250
And the other thing that's weird is that this label or

37
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:03,570
text is showing up by default.

38
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:05,440
The correct behavior would be for

39
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:09,080
this label to show up after we have pressed the microphone button.

40
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,940
How would you fix these issues?

41
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:14,520
Here are the two things you would want to fix with this label one more time.

42
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,980
My recommendation is that you search for

43
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:20,130
documentation and then post your responses on the discussion forum.

44
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:22,520
Once you're done, select one of these two options.
