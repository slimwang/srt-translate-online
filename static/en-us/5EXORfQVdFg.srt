00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:03,814
All that we are, who we are, what we think and what we feel is due to our brain

2
00:00:03,814 --> 00:00:08,176
chemistry. We're like walking chemical factories producing the chemicals that

3
00:00:08,176 --> 00:00:13,144
we need to function daily. However, sometimes these chemicals can change and

4
00:00:13,144 --> 00:00:16,798
this change can affect our mood, our ability to learn and remember, and even

5
00:00:16,798 --> 00:00:22,144
our behavior. For example, our brains produce and use dopamine which is a

6
00:00:22,144 --> 00:00:25,952
neurotransmitter responsible for a reward behavior such as having sex or eating

7
00:00:25,952 --> 00:00:31,406
a good meal. Now, some drugs can increase the amount of a neurotransmitter

8
00:00:31,406 --> 00:00:35,724
that's available. For example, methamphetamines increase the amount of dopamine

9
00:00:35,724 --> 00:00:39,499
that's available. This can result in a person feeling really great when they're

10
00:00:39,499 --> 00:00:43,548
under the influence. The feeling of euphoria. However, there are negative

11
00:00:43,548 --> 00:00:48,812
effects associated with excessive dopamine levels. For example, stimuli-induced

12
00:00:48,812 --> 00:00:52,570
psychosis. In this part of the lesson, we're going to talk about three main

13
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:57,339
classes of drugs. Stimulants, depressants and hallucinogens. I'm going to send

14
00:00:57,339 --> 00:01:00,755
you over to Susan to get started on our discussion of stimulants.
