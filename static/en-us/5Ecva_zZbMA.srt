00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,625
The least common multiple of A and 4a squared is 4a squared. To make the

2
00:00:04,625 --> 00:00:09,839
denominator in the second fraction equal that, we need to multiply both the top

3
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:14,920
and the bottom fraction by 4a. Remember, this is the same as multiplying by 1,

4
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:20,027
so it's totally kosher to do within an equation. Written as a single fraction

5
00:00:20,027 --> 00:00:23,289
then, this is B squared minus 4ac over 4a squared.
