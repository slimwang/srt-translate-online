1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,190
All right.
So you just created an intent

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:04,310
in the main activity of the Miwok app,
but

3
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:06,750
the code that we used to
create an intent in the Miwok

4
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:10,850
app looks different from the way we
create intent in the Just Java app.

5
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:14,074
So in the last course we
started to learn about intents.

6
00:00:14,074 --> 00:00:16,699
But we didn't fully discuss
all the types of intents.

7
00:00:16,699 --> 00:00:20,580
So there are actually two types of
intents, implicit and explicit intents.

8
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:23,820
Use an implicit intent when you
don't know which component or

9
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,980
even which app will handle your intent.

10
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:28,180
For example, in a social media app,

11
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:30,600
you can send an intent to
allow a user to take a photo.

12
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,980
It doesn't matter which camera
app receives the intent,

13
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:34,790
as long as the app can take a photo.

14
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:38,980
On the other hand, you should create
an explicit intent when you know exactly

15
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:42,030
which app component or
activity should handle the intent.

16
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:44,920
For example,
in the Miwok app from the main screen

17
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:48,490
when you click on a category,
we want to send an explicit intent

18
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:51,650
to the numbers activity within
our app to open that screen.

19
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:54,810
It doesn't make sense to let
any other activity handle this.

20
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:57,210
So now let's review each
case in more detail.

21
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:00,030
You can use an implicit
intent in the Just Java app

22
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:02,470
to open email app to send
off an order summary.

23
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:05,180
It didn't matter which email
app received the intent,

24
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:08,350
as long as it was an email app that
could take our message subject and

25
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:10,300
body and send it off as an email.

26
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:15,260
Remember that by specifying an intent
filter in their Android manifest file,

27
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:19,360
apps like this email app, announce which
intents they can receive and handle.

28
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,730
Another example of an implicit intent

29
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:23,810
is when you want to open
up a website in your app.

30
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:26,900
You can send an intent to
a browser app to show the website.

31
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:29,310
It doesn't matter which
browser up handles the intent.

32
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:31,650
They are all capable
of showing a website.

33
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:35,080
So this type of flexibility that we get
with intents is great when you aren't

34
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:37,260
sure what apps the user
has on their device.

35
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:39,310
Remember back to our
metaphor of throwing a ball

36
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:40,750
which represented our intent.

37
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:42,860
It didn't matter who we
were throwing it at,

38
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:46,850
as long as someone was there to catch it
and this represented an implicit intent.

39
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:50,840
Sometimes we want to be 100%
sure that when we send an intent

40
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,870
a particularly component
will receive it.

41
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:56,820
For example, within the Miwok app,
clicking on a category sends it explicit

42
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:01,560
intent that opens up a new activity
displaying vocab words in that category.

43
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,370
So, another example of this
is the Google Play Music app.

44
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:07,840
In the top level activity,
you see an overview of your music and

45
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,729
clicking on an album launches
the track container activity,

46
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:13,800
which contains a list of
tracks by a specific artist.

47
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,420
So this activity is within
the same music app.

48
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:21,350
In cases like these, we are using
an explicit intent, explicitly stating

49
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:24,980
exactly what activities should open when
intent is given to the Android system.

50
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:26,970
So back to the metaphor
of throwing a ball.

51
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:30,220
For explicit intents, it's like
we're shouting the name of a person

52
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:33,860
we know is on the other side and
no is open to catching the ball.

53
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:37,710
It's important to know that you should
almost never use explicit intents

54
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:41,320
to open a third party app because we
can't guarantee that the particular

55
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:45,460
third party app we intend to call is
actually installed on the device.

56
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:49,240
So, for this reason, explicit intents
are usually used within the same

57
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:53,170
application because the developer
knows what activities are available.

58
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:55,440
All right, so now we know
there's two types of intents and

59
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,450
let's review what's inside the ball
which represents our intent.

60
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:02,600
Implicit intents generally
need an action and a data URI.

61
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:06,330
We could also add in category,
components and extra information to help

62
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:09,500
the Android System determine which
app would best handle this request.

63
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,410
Implicit intents already know
where they need to go, so

64
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:14,470
it provides very specific information.

65
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:16,720
We usually just need to
pass the context and

66
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,610
component which is usually
the class we want to navigate to.

67
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:23,430
However, there are situations where
we may want to set the data URI so

68
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:26,490
that the other activity can
receive certain information.

69
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:29,370
Let's look at the code for
these two types of intents.

70
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:31,729
So this is an example of
an implicit intent and

71
00:03:31,729 --> 00:03:33,536
an example of an explicit intent.

72
00:03:33,536 --> 00:03:35,555
What similarities and
differences do you see?

73
00:03:35,555 --> 00:03:39,957
For similarities, in both cases,
we create object instances of the intent

74
00:03:39,957 --> 00:03:44,358
class and then we eventually pass the
intent as an input to the start activity

75
00:03:44,358 --> 00:03:49,470
method and the two big differences are,
notice the different constructor inputs.

76
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:53,667
Implicit intent required an action
string such as action_view or

77
00:03:53,667 --> 00:03:57,380
action_send to announce what
generic action the app is needing.

78
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:00,900
Explicit intents can directly name
the class component they need to open.

79
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:01,690
Secondly, for

80
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:05,400
implicit intents we have this resolve
activity if block which catches

81
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,940
cases where there aren't any apps in
the device to handle the intent request.

82
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:10,954
So to recap, for the implicit intent,

83
00:04:10,954 --> 00:04:15,043
we need to create an object instance of
the intent class and in the constructor,

84
00:04:15,043 --> 00:04:18,353
we pass in an action string and
in this case it's action sent to.

85
00:04:18,353 --> 00:04:21,612
The implicit intent also has
this result activity if block.

86
00:04:21,612 --> 00:04:24,248
On the other hand, to build and
fire off that explicit intent,

87
00:04:24,248 --> 00:04:27,133
we make a new instance of the intent
class, passing in the context and

88
00:04:27,133 --> 00:04:28,760
the activity we want to open.

89
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:32,800
Then we call startActivity, passing
in the intent instance we just built.

90
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,960
So as a disclaimer, I want to note that
this particular implicit intent example

91
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,800
uses intent extras, while this
explicit intent example doesn't.

92
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,160
But remember that both types of intents
are capable of handling intent extras.

93
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,910
So now let's practice
what you just learned.

94
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:50,500
In the following scenarios,
determine whether we use an implicit or

95
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,850
an explicit intent.

96
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:55,970
For each case, should we create
an explicit or implicit intent?

97
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:58,840
In case number one, popular group
texting apps allow users to

98
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:02,040
open video links they
receive in chat messages.

99
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:05,740
Should opening a video player use
an implicit or explicit intent?

100
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:09,802
In case number two, in a food ordering
app a user selects the dishes that she

101
00:05:09,802 --> 00:05:12,360
wants to order and
clicks the submit order button.

102
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:16,010
The app then moves from the order
activity to the order summary activity.

103
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:19,154
Should moving to the order summary
activity use an implicit or

104
00:05:19,154 --> 00:05:20,126
explicit intent?

105
00:05:20,126 --> 00:05:21,437
And in case number three,

106
00:05:21,437 --> 00:05:25,262
ride sharing apps allow users to contact
their drivers via text messaging.

107
00:05:25,262 --> 00:05:29,002
Should accessing a text messaging
app on the phone use an implicit or

108
00:05:29,002 --> 00:05:30,060
explicit intent?
