1
00:00:00,006 --> 00:00:04,760
So if someone in-between your user and
your server wants to stop them from

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:08,180
using your site, there are a lot
of ways they could mess with you.

3
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:10,113
So if the user can ping your IP address,

4
00:00:10,113 --> 00:00:14,400
that means the blockage is not just
dropping all of their traffic to you.

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,170
So that can be a useful
thing to investigate.

6
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:20,550
Can a user access a different
domain on the same server?

7
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:24,440
Well, if they can't that suggests their
traffic isn't getting filtered by IP

8
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:27,870
address because normally two
different domains on the same server

9
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:30,790
would be on the same interface and
same IP address.

10
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:33,200
They might be getting DNS hijacked, but

11
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,790
this can definitely be
a good thing to investigate.

12
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:38,490
Can you send the email
from your Gmail account?

13
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:41,480
Well, when you send an email
with a service such as Gmail,

14
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:45,310
it's going to travel a very different
path from the traffic between a user and

15
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:46,510
your web server.

16
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:49,630
So this option is not
going to tell you very much.

17
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:52,080
Can they look up your server's
name using host or dig?

18
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:56,080
In other words, can they look up
your server's host name in DNS and

19
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:58,100
get back the IP address?

20
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:02,830
This can definitely distinguish certain
kinds of problems with the DNS, so

21
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:03,930
we should definitely investigate that.

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,420
And are all of the users with
the problem in the same country?

23
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:10,450
Well, that might indicate that
there is some kind of official

24
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:12,170
filtering being done.

25
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:14,330
So that's definitely a thing
to investigate as well
