00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,250
In this lesson, we'll talk about the web

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:06,710
and how web caches can improve web performance.

3
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:09,680
We will study, in particular, the hyper-text transfer

4
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:13,130
protocol, or HTTP, which is an application layer

5
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:17,510
protocol to transfer web content. It's the protocol

6
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:20,250
that your web browser uses to request web

7
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:22,620
pages, and it's also the protocol that the

8
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:25,970
responses, or the web pages. Or the objects

9
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:30,610
that are returned as part of a webpage are returned to your browser. Your web

10
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:35,550
browser makes requests for webpages, and the pages and the objects in the page

11
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:40,680
come back as responses. HTTP is typically layered on

12
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:46,180
top of a byte stream protocol, which is almost always TCP. The client

13
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:51,070
sends a request to a server, asking for web content and the

14
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:55,860
server responds with the content often encoded in text. The

15
00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:01,210
server maintains no information about past client requests. Thus

16
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:03,750
we say the server is stateless. Let's take a

17
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:09,020
quick look into the format of HTTP requests, and responses.
