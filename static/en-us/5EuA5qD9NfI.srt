1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:05,620
We showed a moment ago how to
go from prices to port-val,

2
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:09,020
which is the daily total
value of the portfolio.

3
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:13,950
Now that we have port-val, we can
compute a number of important statistics

4
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:17,310
on the portfolio, and
thus assess the portfolio and

5
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:20,100
the investment style of whoever
is managing that portfolio.

6
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:25,840
An important first calculation
is to compute daily returns.

7
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,220
We've talked about how to do that
before, so I won't go over it here.

8
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:34,920
But an important observation is
whenever you compute daily returns,

9
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,980
the first value is
always going to be zero.

10
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:41,860
And that's because on the first day,
of course, there's no change.

11
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:45,390
So we want to exclude

12
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:49,540
that value from any calculations
we do across all daily returns.

13
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:53,690
It's easy to accomplish this
with a simple python statement,

14
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:57,230
which is just to replace
daily returns with

15
00:00:57,230 --> 00:01:02,000
daily returns where we just
include the second row forward.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,180
And boom, we're rid of that first zero.

17
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:09,860
Now that we have this information,
we can compute four key statistics that

18
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:13,540
everybody wants to know about regarding
the performance of a portfolio.

19
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:17,980
They are cumulative return,
average daily return,

20
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:22,370
standard deviation of daily return and
sharp ratio.

21
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:26,080
Cumulative return is just a measure of
how much the value of the portfolio has

22
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,990
gone up from the beginning to the end.

23
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:33,560
So to calculate that, we take the last
val, which is port-val of -1.

24
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:39,400
Which is this one divided by
the beginning and subtract 1.

25
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:43,580
Average daily return is just
the average of these numbers, so

26
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:45,610
we just take the mean.

27
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:47,050
Very simple.

28
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:51,300
And standard deviation of daily return,
again simple.

29
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:55,010
Just use the standard deviation
function right there.

30
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:58,190
Now sharpe ratio is a little bit
more complex than these other ones.

31
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:02,230
So we're going to spend a little bit
more time diving into sharpe ratio.
