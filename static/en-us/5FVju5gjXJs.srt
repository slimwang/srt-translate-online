00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,680
The cardiovascular system is comprised of our heart and all of the blood

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:08,587
vessels in our body. Now, unfortunately, the cardiovascular system is

3
00:00:08,587 --> 00:00:13,976
especially susceptible to the effects of sustained arousal. Under the

4
00:00:13,976 --> 00:00:18,130
conditions of sustained arousal, our heart rate and blood pressure elevate and

5
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:23,898
remain elevated over a period of time. This can damage arteries. And increase

6
00:00:23,898 --> 00:00:28,880
the likelihood of fatty buildup. This in turn can result in heart disease.

7
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,378
Again, this demonstrates just how important it is to reduce stress in our daily

8
00:00:32,378 --> 00:00:36,728
lives. Because of its negative consequences on the immune system, as well as

9
00:00:36,728 --> 00:00:40,360
the poteential damage to our cardiovascular health.
