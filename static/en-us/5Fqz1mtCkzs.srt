00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,815
Notice that we weren't given the actual time for Katrina to travel upstream or

2
00:00:03,815 --> 00:00:08,596
the actual time for her to travel downstream. We just have expressions for each

3
00:00:08,596 --> 00:00:12,943
of these. But we do know something about the sum or the total amount of time

4
00:00:12,943 --> 00:00:17,950
she spends on the river. So I want you to think about what equation you can

5
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:22,750
write in order to solve for x. When you think you've got it enter it here.
