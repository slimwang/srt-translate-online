00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,550
Previously, we discussed how to
generate notifications on the phone,

2
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:04,640
like this here.

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:06,590
And how they're automatically
synchronized over to

4
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:08,400
the wearable device.

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,400
However, you might run into
a situation where you want to generate

6
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:15,070
a notification on a wearable,
but not on the phone.

7
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:17,850
This is not possible with the code
that we went through earlier.

8
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:19,020
The solution to this,

9
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:23,000
is to create a notification on
the wearable device itself.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,680
If you create it on the wearable
from within the wearable APK,

11
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:28,680
it will only appear on the wearable.

12
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:32,433
It is never synchronized
over to the phone.

13
00:00:32,433 --> 00:00:36,162
A notification generated on a wearable
uses exactly the same code as done on

14
00:00:36,162 --> 00:00:37,260
the phone.

15
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,730
You can use all the same code
that you did previously.

16
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:42,440
I just wanted to point this all out now,
since you did not know

17
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:46,000
about wearable apps when we
previously discussed notifications.

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,130
There are two great samples that you
should refer to in the sample browser.

19
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:53,400
Synchronized notifications is the first
and notifications is the other.

20
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,050
In synchronized notifications,
let's load that one up.

21
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,140
Input sample and
synchronize notifications.

22
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:05,230
It's in the wearable project in
notification updateservice.java.

23
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:08,840
The method we're looking for
is BuildWearableOnlyNotification.

24
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:11,880
In this method you can see the code
used to make a notification

25
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,880
is exactly the same as
what you've seen before.
