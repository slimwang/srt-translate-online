00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,670
Okay, let's continue our story on the history of

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:06,740
server side computing. At this time we enter the race

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:10,530
for scalability. Because once the computer rack was created,

4
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:12,610
we could start to stack servers on top of each

5
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:15,150
other to save space. And this was of course

6
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:19,960
great. But now, another problem surfaced. Because even though these

7
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:22,500
servers were great from a stacking perspective, it was

8
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,290
still the case that one application could only run on

9
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:28,489
one server. And this became a big problem,

10
00:00:28,489 --> 00:00:31,921
because as the internet grew, these applications got

11
00:00:31,921 --> 00:00:34,326
more and more popular. And more and more

12
00:00:34,326 --> 00:00:39,230
popular. And more and more popular! And since

13
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:40,790
there is a limit to the performance of

14
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:44,250
one server, this architecture was not sustainable and

15
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:47,320
had to be abandoned. The one application, one

16
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:51,170
server strategy was a dead end street and

17
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:53,260
a radically new solution was required
