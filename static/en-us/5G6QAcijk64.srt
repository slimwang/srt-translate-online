Great job.

2
00:00:01,550 --> 00:00:04,250
We covered a lot of
ground in this session.

3
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:08,280
Loops are an extremely important
part of Ruby, and in my opinion,

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:10,760
it's where programming really
starts to get exciting.

5
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:15,550
If you're still feeling shaky on all
the different loops we've covered,

6
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:19,480
feel free to repeat, repeat,
repeat this session.
