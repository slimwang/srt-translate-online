00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,695
So, init is the most important of the Magic Methods. And nearly, every class

2
00:00:03,695 --> 00:00:08,154
that you define will have init there. I want to introduce one other magic method

3
00:00:08,154 --> 00:00:12,893
now. There are many, many others. We're only going to cover one more today,

4
00:00:12,893 --> 00:00:17,190
which is the str magic method. And what str should do is return the string

5
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:22,410
representation of this instance. So, here's why str is so useful. Every Python

6
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:26,261
object can be printed. Say, we can a number and we get three, we can print a

7
00:00:26,261 --> 00:00:29,561
list, we get something that looks at the list. When we print one of our

8
00:00:29,561 --> 00:00:32,598
restaurant objects, well, it tells us there's a restaurant object, but it

9
00:00:32,598 --> 00:00:37,170
doesn't tell us anything useful about it. What's happening when we print things,

10
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:42,588
the Python internal definition of print is using str to turn an object into a

11
00:00:42,588 --> 00:00:47,913
string, that's str operator like this. Str can turn any object into a string,

12
00:00:47,913 --> 00:00:52,928
and you'll notice that the results here are of type string, or type str. When we

13
00:00:52,928 --> 00:00:56,170
do str on one of our restaurant objects, well, we get back to this string.

14
00:00:56,170 --> 00:01:02,234
That's because we haven't defined a magic__str method. If we do that, we'll get

15
00:01:02,234 --> 00:01:04,203
something more useful. So, let's do that.
