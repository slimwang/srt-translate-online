The bitcoin protocol relied on using proofs of work to provide scarcity in producing new blocks.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
For this question you are asked to order a list of tasks by how much expected work they require.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Assume that H is a strong cryptographic hash function that produces 128 output bits

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
from any length input.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Comuting H(x) takes 1 unit of time.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
E indicates RSA encryption. K sub U is a known public key.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
But the corresponding private key is not known.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Computing E(x) takes takes 1000 units of time.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
There are no memory limits, but the task has no access to precomputed values.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Using those assumptions, order these by how much work they prove

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
from the least expected work to the most expected work.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
For example, enter cebad if you think c requires the least amount of work

13
00:00:48,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and d the most amount of expected work.
