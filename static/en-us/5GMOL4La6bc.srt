00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,410
I don't know about you, but I would
argue that the best answer is work.

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:07,830
The definition of energy says that
you need to pay some energy cost for

3
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:09,520
every operation.

4
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:13,180
Well, the whole point of work
is to count all operations.

5
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:15,800
So, if you're interested some
measure of asymptotic energy,

6
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,810
then work is the right analogy.

7
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:20,860
By the way, this idea implies
something kind of neat.

8
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:25,110
It says that at an algorithmic level,
if what you care about is energy, and

9
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:28,670
supposing that the energy per
operation is bounded by some constant,

10
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:32,159
then finding work optimal
algorithms is super important.
