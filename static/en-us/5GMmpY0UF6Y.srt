1
00:00:00,173 --> 00:00:02,111
Of course, this was a very simple answer.

2
00:00:02,111 --> 00:00:06,144
The red would all, just be the red itself, and

3
00:00:06,144 --> 00:00:09,150
the blue would be the blue itself.

4
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:16,697
But the green should just be the average of the two greens here.

5
00:00:16,697 --> 00:00:19,960
So of course, that would be 175.

6
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:23,470
So, of course as I said before, these could actually also be a different bayer

7
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:27,480
pattern where there could be two blues, and this would be a green and a red.

8
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:31,300
And again, depending on the knowledge of this kind of a lattice structure,

9
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:34,310
we would determine what would be the values of R, G and B, at this point.
