1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,520
Now I could do the same thing for the
num_courses_visited field that I did for

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:04,700
the other two fields.

3
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:07,300
That is,
group the records by account key.

4
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:10,740
Then sum up the num_courses_visited
field for each account key.

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:13,510
However, if I did this, the results
would be a little bit strange.

6
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:18,660
For example, suppose this student
visited three courses their first day,

7
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:22,130
zero courses their second day,
and one course their third day.

8
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:24,850
Then the total for
this student would be four.

9
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:28,030
But that's not equal to the number of
days the student visited the classroom

10
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:29,820
at all, which is two.

11
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,750
And it's not equal to the number of
unique courses the student visited,

12
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:34,650
which is either three or

13
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:37,930
four, depending this was the same
course as one of these three.

14
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:40,730
Instead, I would prefer to
analyze the total number of days

15
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:42,820
each student visited
the classroom at all.

16
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:45,950
Regardless of how many courses
they visited that day.

17
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:48,310
There are a couple of ways
I could accomplish this.

18
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:51,860
First, I could change the code in
the sum_grouped_items function or

19
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:55,900
create a new similar function that
instead of adding each number up,

20
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:59,360
adds up the total number of records
where the number is greater than zero.

21
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:02,641
Alternatively, I could create a new
field in the data called has_visited,

22
00:01:02,641 --> 00:01:03,660
that is either 1 or 0.

23
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:07,733
It's 1 if the student visits
the classroom at all on that day, and

24
00:01:07,733 --> 00:01:09,240
0 otherwise.

25
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:12,320
If I do this, I could call the same
sum_grouped_items function that I've

26
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,140
already written to add up these numbers.

27
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:17,130
And what I would get is the total
number of days that the student visited

28
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:18,430
the classroom.

29
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:22,310
The second way is the way I would prefer
to use, but either one should work.

30
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:25,410
Using whichever these two methods
you prefer, calculate the mean,

31
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:30,160
standard deviation, minimum and maximum
for this number, the number of days

32
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:33,230
student visit any manner of degree
course during their first week.

33
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:34,820
Then enter your results in these boxes.
