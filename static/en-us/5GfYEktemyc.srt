Alright, let's make this a little bit more challenging. I'm going to show you

2
00:00:04,603 --> 00:00:09,003
some shaded images. And then I want you to write the missing parts of the

3
00:00:09,015 --> 00:00:13,787
fraction. So for example, I know this image has 3/4, or 3 out of 4 pieces

4
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:17,508
shaded. This other image has one, two, three, four, five, six out of 8 pieces

5
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:22,028
shaded. I know that these two fractions are actually equal. I want to think

6
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:26,429
about moving this piece here over into this empty region here, and then my

7
00:00:26,441 --> 00:00:30,921
figures would match. And really what I did is I doubled the number of shaded

8
00:00:30,933 --> 00:00:35,554
pieces I have. I split up each piece into two parts. Also, I doubled every piece

9
00:00:35,692 --> 00:00:41,230
As I have, because in total I have eight new pieces here so I multiply the total

10
00:00:41,242 --> 00:00:43,495
number of pieces 4 by 2 to get 8
