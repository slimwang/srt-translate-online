00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:00,780
In this lesson,

2
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:04,800
we will review the memory management
mechanisms used in operating systems.

3
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:08,500
We will describe how operating
systems manage physical memory, and

4
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:12,470
also how they provide processes with
the illusion of virtual memory.

5
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:15,710
Let me remind you that
the intent of this course is for

6
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:19,770
us to review some of the basic
mechanisms in operating systems.

7
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:22,660
And also to serve as a refresher for
those of you who may have

8
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:26,100
forgotten some of this content
from your undergraduate classes.

9
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:30,670
My goal is for us to review some of the
key concepts, and to make it easier for

10
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:34,140
you to use additional references
like the books that I mentioned or

11
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:36,850
some online content,
in case you need to fill in any blanks
