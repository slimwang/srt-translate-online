00:00:00,005 --> 00:00:05,350
So, how do we forget? One reason we forget things is because of interference.

2
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:09,158
Interference is a disruption of memory because of new information that competes

3
00:00:09,158 --> 00:00:13,625
with information we are trying to recall. Now, there are two types of

4
00:00:13,625 --> 00:00:18,420
interference. One is called retroactive interference. With retroactive

5
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:22,767
interference new experiences or information cause people to forget what they've

6
00:00:22,767 --> 00:00:28,024
previously learned or experienced. The second type of interference is proactive

7
00:00:28,024 --> 00:00:32,637
interference. Proactive interference occurs when previously learned information

8
00:00:32,637 --> 00:00:37,162
interferes with the learning of new information. Let's look at an example of an

9
00:00:37,162 --> 00:00:42,886
retroactive interference. First is a learning task. Study psychology. Next, is

10
00:00:42,886 --> 00:00:47,588
a learning task, study sociology. For retroactive interference, we would have

11
00:00:47,588 --> 00:00:52,610
memory loss for the first task, studying psychology. An example of proactive

12
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:58,260
interference would be, first, studying psychology, then learning sociology.

13
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:01,977
With this, we would have memory loss for studying sociology because it came

14
00:01:01,977 --> 00:01:03,170
second.
