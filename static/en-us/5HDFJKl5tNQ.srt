00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:04,620
So lets see if we understood
the relationship between page size and

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:06,000
frames in memory.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,660
Lets say we have system whos physical
memory's only two gigabytes.

4
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:13,080
The virtual memory same page
process is four gigabytes,

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,920
the page size in this
system is four kilobytes.

6
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:20,300
The question for you is how many page
frames do we have in this system.

7
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:23,590
And how many entries does
each page table have?

8
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:26,420
An entry is what keeps the mapping for

9
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:29,070
a single page to where it
is in physical memory.
