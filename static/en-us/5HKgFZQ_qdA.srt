00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:04,320
Let's do an example. I got this idea from Dan Meyer, a really great math

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:08,370
teacher. The link to his blog is below, with more ideas around the upcoming

3
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:13,170
example. Let's say you want to go on vacation, but you have a budget of $500.

4
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:18,560
Where are some places you could go? How much will it cost to go to Reykjavic,

5
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:23,578
where they have awesome volcanic beaches? Or maybe Dublin, Ireland? Or Kumasi,

6
00:00:23,578 --> 00:00:28,820
Ghana. You'll go anywhere. You just want to have an adventure. You decide to

7
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:32,600
analyze some flights and plotted the number of miles they traveled and the

8
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:36,720
costs of that plane ticket. Here's a scatter plot showing the nine flights you

9
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:41,590
looked up. Here's the line of best fit. This shows the expected value of the

10
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:47,220
dependent variable, y, for any value of the independent variable. Let's focus

11
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:53,290
on this point, for example. For this x value, which looks like it's about 1,500

12
00:00:53,290 --> 00:01:00,130
miles, we see that the flight costs almost $800. Let's say this is about 750

13
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:05,760
dollars. This is the observed value. But based on our line of best fit, we

14
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:11,960
would expect that a flight that travels 1500 miles would cost more like 450

15
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:18,770
dollars. These expected values for any x value are symbolized by y hatt.

16
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:24,350
Whereas the observed values are just are regular y values. You can see that we

17
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:29,730
have an observed and expected value for all of these data values. Take this

18
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:33,925
one, for example. We travel about 5,010 miles, let's say. And the actual or

19
00:01:33,925 --> 00:01:42,920
observed price was about $1500. But according to our line of best fit, we would

20
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:48,790
have expected this to cost about $1200. The prices for both these flights were

21
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:53,710
more than we would have expected based on all of our data. The difference

22
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:58,240
between our observed and expected value is called the residual. There's a

23
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:04,110
residual for every point in the data set. It might be 0, or it might be huge.

24
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:08,370
The most important thing is that we're able to find this line of best fit and

25
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:14,090
then use it to visualize the data and the relationship between x and y, and

26
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:15,120
make predictions.
