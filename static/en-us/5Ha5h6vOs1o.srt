Hey Georgia,
what kind of phone do you have?

2
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:04,059
>> I have an iPhone.

3
00:00:04,059 --> 00:00:05,210
Why do you ask?

4
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:08,800
>> Well I'm trying to decide if i should
make Project Compass an iOS app or

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:09,370
an Android app.

6
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:11,250
And, I don't know how to choose.

7
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:15,670
>> Well depending on your users,
you may eventually need both.

8
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:19,570
However, we can evaluate the different
pop forms to see what your next step is.

9
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:20,799
>> Sounds like a good idea.

10
00:00:20,799 --> 00:00:24,322
There are many things to consider
when deciding between Android and

11
00:00:24,322 --> 00:00:29,050
iOS development such as user base,
revenue models or development speed.

12
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:31,750
For example, if you want to release
your mobile app immediately,

13
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:34,360
you may want to start
with an Android app.

14
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:37,260
Google's app review process
has automated elements, so

15
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:40,420
you could see your app on the Google
Play Store sooner than you may see

16
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:42,240
your iOS app published to the app store.

17
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:45,840
But Android is on
a broader range of devices.

18
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,710
So it may be harder to program for

19
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:50,520
it because your app may function
differently depending on the device.

20
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:53,130
iOS apps are only program for

21
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:56,610
iPhones so there are less hardware
differences to account for.

22
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:58,230
That's kind of a lot to think about.

23
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:01,170
There are a lot of factors to evaluate.

24
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:04,640
But there are also a ton of resources
to help you make this decision.

25
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,640
Okay, thanks Georgia.
