1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,490
Let me show this to you again.

2
00:00:01,490 --> 00:00:03,400
This is exactly the same problem.

3
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:07,380
And this time, as I will traverse
the diagonal, I will find something,

4
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:10,240
jump off diagonal, come back to
the diagonal, jump off diagonal,

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,060
come back to the diagonal.

6
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:16,530
So, imagine this to be my diagonal, and
I'm jumping off, and creating loops.

7
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:19,980
There's one, of course,
I can do jumps forwards and backwards.

8
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:23,420
And now, you basically see
very simply that we can take

9
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:27,150
a video volume like this, and
traverse it in many different ways.

10
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:29,800
In essence, what we've done
is extended the time axis.

11
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:33,840
You're not bound to just the axis
of this we moved around a lot.

12
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,470
So, use exactly what I'm
going to show you here.

13
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:41,440
This is my diagonal, and in this way
we're going to traverse this axis, and

14
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,620
whenever off, you know, we find
something off diagonal we'll jump out of

15
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:46,100
this way, and keep on looping this way.

16
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:51,030
So, anytime I get these arcs
basically show possible pathways.

17
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:54,262
For example, here you notice these
jumps, and whenever the arc lights up

18
00:00:54,262 --> 00:00:57,513
basically, it's going off diagonal,
and coming back to the diagonal.

19
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:05,883
So, now we've basically done
what we've set out to do,

20
00:01:05,883 --> 00:01:08,210
we created infinitely
long video texture.
