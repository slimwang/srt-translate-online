00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,600
Now, here you can see the very simple
UI that we're putting into this app.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,200
You should edit your
layout.xml file to match this.

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,970
Note that you should add an onClick
attribute to the button, and you should

4
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:15,310
call it addGeofencesButtonHandler
as I show here.

5
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:16,550
Also for good practice,

6
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:20,020
don't hard code the string with
the caption of the button.

7
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,810
The caption here
are the words Add Geofences.

8
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:25,270
Instead, use the strings.xml file and

9
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:27,910
put a reference to that
in your UI declaration.

10
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:29,970
When you're done,
check this box to continue.
