1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
[Thrun] Let's practice this again with another 2-state Markov chain.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
States are A and B.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
A has a 50% chance of transitioning to B,

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and B always transitions into A.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
There is no loop from B to itself.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Let's assume again at a time, 0, we know with certainty to be in state A.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 99:59:59,999
I would like to know the probability of A at time 1, at time 2, and at time 3.
