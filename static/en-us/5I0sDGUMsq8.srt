00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:01,640
Welcome to this practice session.

2
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:03,960
In this session we're going to
apply what we've learned so

3
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:07,880
far by modifying a battleship
style game called Pirate Fleet.

4
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:11,540
By the end of this session we'll create
code that will make custom pirate ships,

5
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:14,280
launch cannonballs, and
ultimately make a playable game.
