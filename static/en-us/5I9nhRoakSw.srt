1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:04,320
I didn't say in the previous image what the range of

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:06,960
our pictures would tend to be, okay?

3
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:11,461
Remember I told you an image might go from, you know, 0 to 1.

4
00:00:11,461 --> 00:00:15,010
And that would be from the darkest black to the brightest white.

5
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:18,600
Well, if I did that and I had a sigma of two.

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,329
You would get black and white all over the place.

7
00:00:20,329 --> 00:00:24,380
And yet, when I go back here, sigma of two is just a small variation.

8
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:26,660
Whereas sigma of 64 was a big variation.

9
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:27,300
Why?

10
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:33,750
In this image, we have this notion of maybe minus 127 was black and

11
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:36,460
plus 128 was white.

12
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:42,070
When we talk about the amount of noise in an image in terms of the intensity.

13
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:46,380
It has to be with respect to sort of what's the overall range.

14
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:50,090
So another reason to use doubles in your images.

15
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:53,980
And to think of them as going from 0 to 1, then we can talk about a sigma of,

16
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:55,080
you know, 0.1.

17
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:58,370
Well, that's a tenth of sort of going from black to white.

18
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:01,470
If you want to use something arbitrary like 0 to 255.

19
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:03,110
You can do that.

20
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:07,570
First of all, use 0.0 to 255.0, so use a floating-point number.

21
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:11,970
And then you're going to have to say, okay, I guess a sigma of 0.1 in one case

22
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:15,870
would be a sigma of, like, 25 in another case.

23
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:17,540
Right, because I've stretched the whole thing out.

24
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:20,380
So you have to worry about the magnitude of sigma with respect to

25
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:21,520
the overall range of your image.

26
00:01:23,058 --> 00:01:29,454
This will c, catch you number, numerous times when you go to display an image.

27
00:01:29,454 --> 00:01:32,620
All right, because now you have to tell the machine, okay I've got this image.

28
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:34,620
How do you want it displayed?

29
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:37,630
Matlab has a large number of ways of displaying images.

30
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:40,210
If you have the imshow function which I think

31
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:42,790
actually comes from the Image Processing Toolbox.

32
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:45,913
You can show it this way where you'd tell it low and high.

33
00:01:45,913 --> 00:01:49,385
And it will display, anything with the value low or

34
00:01:49,385 --> 00:01:53,522
lower as black, anything higher than high as white, okay?

35
00:01:53,522 --> 00:01:58,342
You can also do imshow and just give it this empty array.

36
00:01:58,342 --> 00:02:01,055
And it will scale the image for you automatically.

37
00:02:01,055 --> 00:02:03,221
That is, it'll find the minimum value in the image and

38
00:02:03,221 --> 00:02:05,120
say, okay, that's going to be black.

39
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:05,920
It'll find the maximum.

40
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,350
It'll say, that'll be white, and it'll scale you.

41
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:12,620
There's another function called imagesc, for image scale.

42
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:14,280
It's a much older function.

43
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:18,450
It's not in Image Processing Toolbox, which will also display it.

44
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:23,220
Don't get caught between this question of how I display an image versus how I

45
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:24,180
use an image.

46
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:27,490
Just I just finished teaching part of this course here at Georgia Tech.

47
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:30,120
I had some people doing, computing some gradients.

48
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,360
They computed some gradients, which involves substructions and derivatives and

49
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,390
all that stuff.

50
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:38,130
And then one guy, he normalized his picture to go from 0 to 255,

51
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:40,600
before he computed with it.

52
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:45,460
You would only normalize it in order to display it,

53
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:46,860
not in order to compute with it.
