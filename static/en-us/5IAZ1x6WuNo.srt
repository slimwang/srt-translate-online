1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:03,527
Creativity is not simply original thinking, after all both of these paragraphs

2
00:00:03,527 --> 00:00:07,700
are equally original. They're both unusual and both give voice to sentences

3
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:11,156
that are probably never been uttered or written before these writers penned

4
00:00:11,156 --> 00:00:16,040
them. So, for something to be deemed creative however, it must not only be

5
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:21,332
original, but it also must be useful and adaptive and solve a problem. James

6
00:00:21,332 --> 00:00:24,992
Joyce's paragraph does that, because it's part of solving the problem of

7
00:00:24,992 --> 00:00:30,950
telling a story. The second paragraph is not creative, because it's not useful.

8
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:36,560
It doesn't solve a problem. By useful, we clearly do not mean pragmatic. James

9
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:39,962
Joyce's novel was useful in the sense that he was the first novelist to write

10
00:00:39,962 --> 00:00:45,293
from the perspective of inside a person's unconcious mind. It has been so

11
00:00:45,293 --> 00:00:48,632
esteemed and deemed creative by experts and readers of English literature

12
00:00:48,632 --> 00:00:53,700
because it presented a powerful study of unconscious human thought and emotion.

13
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:57,543
It can be useful in a literary, artistic, or aesthetic sense, in that people

14
00:00:57,543 --> 00:01:03,090
are inspired by it and make use of it in their own creations. The second quote,

15
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:07,646
is equally as original but does not solve an important problem. In any useful

16
00:01:07,646 --> 00:01:12,038
or adaptive way. By itself, these phrases may be interesting but together,

17
00:01:12,038 --> 00:01:17,062
they're not terribly coherent. Or were not made with the intent of shedding

18
00:01:17,062 --> 00:01:22,228
light on the inner workings of a human mind as was "Ulysses". So. Creative

19
00:01:22,228 --> 00:01:27,800
thought and behavior requires two things. Originality or novelty of the thought

20
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:31,765
and behavior, and that thought and behavior has to be useful and adaptive

21
00:01:31,765 --> 00:01:37,219
solution to some kind of problem. So new forms of art and literature,

22
00:01:37,219 --> 00:01:43,226
architecture, science technology, and business changed their fields. The field

23
00:01:43,226 --> 00:01:47,459
is different after the insight or innovation. Creativity changes things for the

24
00:01:47,459 --> 00:01:51,532
better. Of course the usefulness, our originality may not be immediately seen

25
00:01:51,532 --> 00:01:56,503
or appreciated. Truly creative thought, behavior may be well ahead of it's

26
00:01:56,503 --> 00:02:01,680
time. So the evaluation of creativity is not limited to the here and now.
