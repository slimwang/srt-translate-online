00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,880
Let's do a quick exercise to check our
understanding of these operations on

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:05,340
languages.

3
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:09,090
We'll let sigma consist of
the symbols zero and one.

4
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:12,360
And we'll let gamma consist
of the symbols a and b.

5
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:16,690
For each statement, indicate whether
the given statement is true or false.
