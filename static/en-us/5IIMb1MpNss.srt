Here's a picture of the teapot with the lid off. You can see the inside of the

2
00:00:04,146 --> 00:00:08,119
teapot. What's odd here is that the outside and inside surfaces have the same

3
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:11,804
lighting. This is because the same normals are used to calculate both the inside

4
00:00:11,804 --> 00:00:16,398
and outside surfaces. That is, all the normals point outwards. Regardless of

5
00:00:16,398 --> 00:00:20,522
whether we're looking at the inside or outside. This is certainly not how the

6
00:00:20,522 --> 00:00:24,236
real world works. I call this the paper lantern effect, where the surface is

7
00:00:24,236 --> 00:00:27,778
sort of like a paper lantern, looking the same on both sides. However, if you

8
00:00:27,778 --> 00:00:31,284
think about it, the shading here is really not like anything in the real world.

9
00:00:31,285 --> 00:00:35,680
For example, if we put a light inside this lantern all of the surfaces would be

10
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,489
dark. This is because they're normals all point away from the light. Say we want

11
00:00:39,489 --> 00:00:43,620
to fix this problem and have the surface be double-sided? Which of the following

12
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:48,122
fixes will work? First if the normal is facing away from the light, don't render

13
00:00:48,122 --> 00:00:52,645
diffuse and specular, render the model twice. Once with backface culling on.

14
00:00:52,645 --> 00:00:57,106
Once with frontface culling on and flipping each shade normal direction. Make

15
00:00:57,106 --> 00:01:01,591
and also render a second set of triangles in the same locations, but with their

16
00:01:01,591 --> 00:01:05,890
normals reversed. Do not cull. Put a second light opposite the first light,

17
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:07,773
pointing in the opposite direction.
