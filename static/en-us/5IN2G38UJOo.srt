1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:04,382
We find the lowest common denominator by factoring each of these denominators

2
00:00:04,382 --> 00:00:09,400
first. The first denominator will have factors of x plus 2 times x minus 6,

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:14,674
since factors of 12 that sum to negative 4 are positive 2 and negative 6. The

4
00:00:14,674 --> 00:00:20,284
factors for x squared minus 36 would be x minus 6 and x plus 6. This is just the

5
00:00:20,284 --> 00:00:24,680
difference of two perfect squares. We can see that both of the denominators

6
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:29,464
share a common factor of x minus 6. So this is the factor they share, and we

7
00:00:29,464 --> 00:00:33,598
list it in the middle. The other factor of this denominator is x plus 2, and the

8
00:00:33,598 --> 00:00:38,110
other factor of this denominator is x plus 6. Finally, we just multiply all

9
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:42,473
these factors together to get our lowest common denominator, right here.
