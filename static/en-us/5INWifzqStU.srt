00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So now that you know what a spanning tree is, I would like to introduce to you

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
the concept of a minimum spanning tree.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
So a minimum spanning tree is still a spanning tree on a graph,

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and in order to find a minimum spanning tree,

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
you actually need to have a special kind of graph,

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
and that is one that looks just like the input for shortest tour.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
And what I mean by that is that all of the edges

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
have a certain number assigned to them.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
So in the case of shortest tour, those were distances,

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
but it can be other values as well; that doesn't really matter.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
The important thing is that each edge must have a certain value attached to it

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
such as in this one here.

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Now what is a minimum spanning tree?

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,500
Now, first of all, let's take any spanning tree for this graph here.

15
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,500
So let's say we take this spanning tree.

16
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:47,000
And what you can do if you have a graph like this where you have numbers

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
attached to the edges is, for each spanning tree, you can sum up those numbers.

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:03,000
So here we have 2+4+3+2+3+6, and the sum of that is 20.

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
And so what you say is that this spanning tree here has a weight of 20.

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Now if you choose another spanning tree--for example, this one here--

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:22,000
that spanning tree will have a weight of 3+4+3+2+3+6, which is a total weight of 21.

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
And now you can almost guess what a minimum spanning tree will be.

23
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
A minimum spanning tree is the spanning tree for the graph

24
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
for which this total weight--the sum of all of the edge numbers--

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
is the smallest possible one.

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,500
A graph can have more than one minimum spanning tree,

27
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:42,000
but every minimum spanning tree has to have the property that

28
00:01:42,000 --> 99:59:59,999
the sum of the edges is as low as possible.
