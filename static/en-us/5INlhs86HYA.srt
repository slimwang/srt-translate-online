1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:03,030
This lesson is all about code design.

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:05,970
When presented with the exact
same problem, two different

3
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:09,740
programmers will most likely come up
with two very different solutions.

4
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:12,590
Both work, but
how do you know which one is best?

5
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:13,990
Or is one better?

6
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:15,870
Is it just a matter of opinion?

7
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:17,020
What makes good code?

8
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:21,980
So how can we take all the tools you've
learned about, things like methods,

9
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:25,720
classes and inheritance, and
combine them in the best possible way?

10
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:29,890
Learning the syntax to define
a class is only the beginning.

11
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:33,560
In this lesson, we'll discuss
when you should define a class.

12
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:36,660
You'll learn about different strategies
for structuring applications,

13
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:39,330
with the goal of making our
code as flexible as possible
