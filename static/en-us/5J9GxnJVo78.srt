00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,360
Throughout all of our analyses of the pseudo-Facebook user data

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:06,300
set, we've come to learn a lot about our users.

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:08,790
From their birthdays, to their friend counts, to their friendships

4
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:12,220
initiated, we've really come to understand their behaviors and how they

5
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:15,580
use the Facebook platform. But, now I think it's time

6
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:19,420
for something completely different. In the next couple of segments,

7
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:21,920
we'll look at another data set, and then we'll return

8
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,510
to this Facebook data set to draw some comparisons Here's Dean

9
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:29,890
to introduce this new data set, and why we might look at it in the first place.

10
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:34,470
>> Because of online purchases, credit cards, and loyalty cards, lots of

11
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:37,120
retail purchase data is associated with

12
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,750
individuals or households, such that there

13
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:45,260
is a history of purchase data over time. Analysts in industry often mine

14
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:50,540
this panel scanner data, and economists and other behavioral scientists use

15
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:53,020
it to test and develop theories about

16
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:56,084
consumer behavior. We are going to work with a

17
00:00:56,084 --> 00:00:59,653
data set describing household purchases, of five

18
00:00:59,653 --> 00:01:03,409
flavors of Dannon yogurt in the eight-ounce size.

19
00:01:03,409 --> 00:01:06,217
Their price is recorded with each purchase

20
00:01:06,217 --> 00:01:09,016
occasion. This yogurt data set has a quite

21
00:01:09,016 --> 00:01:12,875
different structure than our pseudo-Facebook data set.

22
00:01:12,875 --> 00:01:15,683
The synthetic Facebook data has one row per

23
00:01:15,683 --> 00:01:20,909
individual with that row giving their characteristics and counts of behaviors

24
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:25,908
over a single period of time. On the other hand, the yogurt data has many

25
00:01:25,908 --> 00:01:31,064
rows per household, one for each purchase occasion. This kind of microdata is

26
00:01:31,064 --> 00:01:33,521
often useful for answering different types of

27
00:01:33,521 --> 00:01:35,720
questions than we've looked at so far.
