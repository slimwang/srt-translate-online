1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,740
You've seen the OnCreate already.

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:05,398
This is where we created
the GoogleApiClient and

3
00:00:05,398 --> 00:00:09,220
the textView object for
the text field in our UI.

4
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:10,270
As you might recall,

5
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:16,030
we also need to connect our
GoogleApiClient in the OnStart method.

6
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:20,210
And we also need to disconnect
it in the OnStop method.

7
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:24,640
Take a moment to write the code to
do this now in these methods, and

8
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:25,780
check the box when you're done.
