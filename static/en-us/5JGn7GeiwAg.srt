00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:03,710
So, we just learned about what was
probably the most important piece of

2
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:08,450
math for this class,
in statistics, called Bayes Rule.

3
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:14,480
It's invented by Reverend Thomas Bayes,
who was a British mathematician,

4
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:18,540
and a Presbyterian minister
the eighteenth century.

5
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:21,544
Bayes Rule is usually stated as follows.

6
00:00:21,544 --> 00:00:29,000
P of A given B, where B is the evidence
and is variable we care about,

7
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:35,740
is P of B given A times
P of A over P of B.

8
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:39,340
This expression is is
called the likelihood.

9
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:41,560
This is called the prior.

10
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:45,230
In this is called
the marginal likelihood.

11
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:49,940
The expression over here
is called the posterior.

12
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:55,170
The interesting thing is the way
the probabilities are reverted.

13
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:56,900
Say we have evidence B.

14
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:01,540
We know about B but
we really care about the variable A.

15
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:03,230
So, example B is a test result.

16
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:05,860
We don't care about
the test result as much we

17
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:07,721
care about the effect of
whether we have cancer or not.

18
00:01:07,721 --> 00:01:15,085
This diagnostic reasoning which
is from evidence to its causes,

19
00:01:15,085 --> 00:01:22,034
is turned upside down by Bayes Rule
into a causal reasoning.

20
00:01:22,034 --> 00:01:27,160
Which is given, hypothetically,
we knew the cause,

21
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:30,600
what would be the probability of
the evidence which just observed?

22
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:37,450
But to correct for this inversion,
we have to multiply by the prior

23
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:41,750
of the cause to be the case in the first
place, in this case having cancer or

24
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:46,270
not, and divide it by
the probability of the evidence.

25
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:47,400
P of B.

26
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:52,250
Which often is expanded using
the theorem of total probability as follows:

27
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:59,670
The probability of B is the sum of all
probabilities of B conditional of A,

28
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:05,020
lower caps a, times the probability
of A equals lower caps a.

29
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:07,095
This is total probability.

30
00:02:07,095 --> 00:02:07,595
