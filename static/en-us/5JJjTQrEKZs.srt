1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Remember what we wanted to prove was that a^Ï†(n) is congruent to 1 mod n.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Now you should understand what the totient function means here.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
First we're going to look at a different theorem, which we've already used, that's very similar.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:22,000
This is Fermat's Little Theorem, which is a^(n - 1) is congruent to 1 mod n

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
as long as n is prime and a is not divisible by n.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
We used this in the previous lecture when we talked about finding large primes.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
This was the basis of the primality test.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
We didn't prove it, though, and it's actually fairly straightforward to prove.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
So let's see if we can prove that Fermat was correct.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
The question is what is the value of this set where we're taking a mod n,

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
2a mod n, 3a mod n, 4a mod n, all the way up to (n - 1)a mod n.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 99:59:59,999
You have four choices.
