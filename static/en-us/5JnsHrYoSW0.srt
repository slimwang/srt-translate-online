1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:05,120
Let's look at this, and now with
a specific set of examples and images.

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,429
Here of course I have given you two
images, this comes from a very famous

3
00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:11,420
data set that has been collected
by computer vision researchers for

4
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:16,450
years now to do real hardcore
analysis of stereo algorithms.

5
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:19,160
I'm basically showing you two images,
left and right.

6
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:22,130
Left image and the right image
basically are, you know, shown here and

7
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:25,240
now using this,
this depth could be computed.

8
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:26,980
I haven't told you how
to compute depth yet but

9
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:30,460
we'll get there in a bit,
specifically for images like this.

10
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:33,350
But you know how to do it if I
could find the same points and

11
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:34,810
do those two images, right?

12
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:36,730
To compute the disparity that is.

13
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:38,180
Here you see a couple
of interesting things.

14
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:41,260
You see, of course, a few dark
points here, this is where for

15
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:43,380
example no information was available.

16
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:47,965
Remember when I showed you
the images of the child earlier,

17
00:00:47,965 --> 00:00:50,615
you just saw a lot of black image and
black points in those images.

18
00:00:50,615 --> 00:00:53,745
Again, those were, again, but
there's no information available

19
00:00:53,745 --> 00:00:57,615
partly because two images cannot just
actually see those points clearly.

20
00:00:57,615 --> 00:01:01,345
Partly, the reason it can't see these
kinds of things is that each and

21
00:01:01,345 --> 00:01:04,959
every pixel has to be
visible from both cameras.

22
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:08,290
This image basically is also
referred to as a disparity image or

23
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:09,340
disparity values.

24
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:11,910
And here basically we're showing
gray values form zero to 64.

25
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:17,080
Zero, of course, no information or
no disparity, 64 most.

26
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:20,160
And, of course, if you look at
it in this context it means that

27
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:22,900
basically anything that's
closer is you know, and

28
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:25,740
farther is lower values,
closer values are higher.
