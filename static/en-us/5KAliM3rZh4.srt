00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,630
So far, we've figured out how to do one transformation to f of x equals x

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:08,909
cubed. We've shifted it to the right by one unit. However, we know that this

3
00:00:08,909 --> 00:00:13,634
wasn't the function we were actually looking to end up with. We wanted f of x

4
00:00:13,634 --> 00:00:19,292
equals negative x -1 cubed. So, what does this negative sign out front do? This

5
00:00:19,292 --> 00:00:24,143
negative sign is going to cause our function to be reflected in some way. But

6
00:00:24,143 --> 00:00:29,889
which axis will it be reflected in? Please write either x or y in this box.
