1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,367
To start solving this problem we're going to let d equal the number of dimes and

2
00:00:04,367 --> 00:00:08,646
q equal the number of quarters. The question indicates the variables that we

3
00:00:08,646 --> 00:00:12,798
need to use. In this case we need to know how many of each coin we have. So we

4
00:00:12,798 --> 00:00:17,213
need two variables, d and q. We need to set up two equations. One will involve

5
00:00:17,213 --> 00:00:21,883
the number of coins And the other would involve the value of the coins. We know

6
00:00:21,883 --> 00:00:26,671
the number of dimes plus the number of quarters has to equal a total number of

7
00:00:26,671 --> 00:00:31,661
coins. A register only contains dimes and quarters and it has a total number of

8
00:00:31,661 --> 00:00:36,504
21 coins. So if we add the number of dimes d to the number of quarters q, we get

9
00:00:36,504 --> 00:00:41,255
21. Here the variables are taking the place of the numbers. We don't know the

10
00:00:41,255 --> 00:00:45,781
number of dimes so we use d, and we don't know the number of quarters so we use

11
00:00:45,781 --> 00:00:50,353
q. We know the total value of the coins is $2.70. A dime is worth $0.10. So to

12
00:00:50,353 --> 00:00:54,675
get the value of dimes we multiply $0.10 by the number of dimes we have. A

13
00:00:54,675 --> 00:00:58,978
quarter on the other hand is worth $0.25 cents. So to get the value of the

14
00:00:58,978 --> 00:01:03,540
quarters. We multiply 25 cents times our number of quarters, q. And if we add

15
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:08,099
these two values together we should get $2.70. I've rewritten the two equations

16
00:01:08,099 --> 00:01:12,387
down here and now we can use either substitution or elimination to solve this

17
00:01:12,387 --> 00:01:16,566
problem. I'm going to use substitution since I can easily solve for one of the

18
00:01:16,566 --> 00:01:21,180
variables in this first equation. If we subtract q from both sides of this

19
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:25,945
equation, we'll get d is equal to 21 minus q. Now that d is solved for we can

20
00:01:25,945 --> 00:01:31,028
perform substitution and plug in 21 minus q, and for d in our second equation.

21
00:01:31,028 --> 00:01:35,861
Next I distribute 1 tenth to 21 and negative q. I combine like terms. Nest I

22
00:01:35,861 --> 00:01:40,752
subtract 2 and 1 tenth from both sides. And finally I divide both sides by

23
00:01:40,752 --> 00:01:45,202
fifteen hundredths. I get Q is equal to 4, which stood for the number of

24
00:01:45,202 --> 00:01:49,882
quarters. So we have four quarters. But I still need to find the number of

25
00:01:49,882 --> 00:01:54,451
times. My first equation I plug in 4 for Q to find the number of dimes, D.

26
00:01:54,451 --> 00:01:59,278
Solving for D, I get D is equal to 17. So we have 4 quarters in a register and

27
00:01:59,278 --> 00:02:03,983
17 dimes. Let's go back to our original problem and make sure that this makes

28
00:02:03,983 --> 00:02:08,888
sense. We said we had 17 dimes and 4 quarters. Well, the total number of coins

29
00:02:08,888 --> 00:02:13,714
should be 21 and, yes, those two add up to 21. So we know this first equation is

30
00:02:13,714 --> 00:02:20,126
true. 1 dime is worth 10 cents, so 17 dimes would be worth $1.70. 1 quarter is

31
00:02:20,126 --> 00:02:26,583
worth 25 cents, so 4 quarters would be worth $1. And with simple addition we

32
00:02:26,583 --> 00:02:33,144
know that $1.70 and $1 add up to $2.70. So the second equation is true as well.
