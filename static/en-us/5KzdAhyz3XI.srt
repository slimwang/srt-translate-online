1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
And finally this example based on 4-grams--

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Now we're seeing an even longer structure.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Sometimes we have this generate something that makes sense like

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
"betwixt their two estates,"

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
and this is not something that appears in Shakespeare,

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
but it was just generated and it made sense.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Sometimes we get things that are actually quotes like "even to the frozen ridges of the alps."

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
The model chose to duplicate something that is actually in Shakespeare.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Certainly there were lots of traces it could have made.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
"Alps" appears four or five times.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
"Even" appears many, many times.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
"Frozen" appears multiple times.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
But it just happened to duplicate something that was a quotation from the original.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
And then there's lots of examples of sentences and phrases that make a lot of sense--

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
"I know my duty," and "give me some little breath," and so on.

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
So it looks like even though all we know is a sequence of 4 woeds,

17
00:00:56,000 --> 99:59:59,999
We're still capturing quite a bit of what it means to have coherent sentences but not everything.
