00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:05,370
We have seen that an out of order processor will track when one instruction uses

2
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:09,640
a register produced by another. But, load and store instructions can

3
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:13,790
access the same memory location without using the same register for

4
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:17,860
it. So let's see how to do them correctly in an out of order processor.
