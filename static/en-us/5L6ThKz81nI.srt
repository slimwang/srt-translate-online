00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:04,296
When we use the quadratic formula, we want to be sure to use parenthesis. We

2
00:00:04,296 --> 00:00:08,990
want to use parenthesis around the values of b, a, and c. For this equation,

3
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:12,770
the value of a is 3, the value of b is negative 4, and the value of c is

4
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:17,887
negative 5. So these are the placeholders for the numbers a, b, and c. You

5
00:00:17,887 --> 00:00:21,604
should always do this when you start to solve a quadratic equation using the

6
00:00:21,604 --> 00:00:26,534
quadratic formula. This will prevent us from making any sign mistakes with

7
00:00:26,534 --> 00:00:31,656
negative b and the minus 4ac. So we plug in the value of b here and here, the

8
00:00:31,656 --> 00:00:37,506
value of a here and here, and the value of c here. Now that we've plugged in,

9
00:00:37,506 --> 00:00:40,966
it's time to simplify. You try simplifying this expression, and when you think

10
00:00:40,966 --> 00:00:44,920
you have your final answer, enter it here. You can either write your answer as

11
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,870
two fractions with plus or minus in between them or you can enter in your

12
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:51,998
answer as one giant fraction. The plus or minus symbol will be in the

13
00:00:51,998 --> 00:00:52,946
numerator.
