Suppose I give you two algorithms.

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:05,450
Algorithm 1 does work
proportional to n and

3
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:08,990
number of transfer proportional
to transfers divided by l.

4
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:10,990
Algorithm 2 is a little different.

5
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:16,460
It has n log n work and
n divided by l log z transfers.

6
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:18,640
My question is, which is better?

7
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,770
You have several options,
you can choose one, both, or none.

8
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:25,260
Checking both means you
think they're equally good.

9
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:27,200
Checking none means you can't tell.

10
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:30,290
Whatever your choice I want
you to explain your thinking,

11
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:31,710
here's a handy box for doing so.
