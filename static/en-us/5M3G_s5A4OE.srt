Some good examples of answers include,
Sensor Listeners, Location Updates,

2
00:00:04,502 --> 00:00:08,230
Dynamic Broadcast Receivers
or Games Physics Engines.

00:00:09,101 --> 00:00:11,799
Any task that your application 
needs to keep happening,

4
00:00:11,799 --> 00:00:13,785
even when your activity is paused,

5
00:00:13,785 --> 00:00:16,250
shouldn't really happen 
within an activity at all.

6
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:20,422
We'll have a look at some solutions 
to that problem in Lesson 6.

7
00:00:20,557 --> 00:00:24,001
Keep in mind that when you're activity
is paused, it's still visible.

8
00:00:24,001 --> 00:00:27,973
It's just obscured by something else,
usually a dialog box.

9
00:00:27,973 --> 00:00:29,788
But it's not stopped.

10
00:00:29,788 --> 00:00:33,280
So, don't stop drawing your UI 
when you receive onPause.
