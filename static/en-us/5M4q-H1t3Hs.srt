00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
[Norvig] So I've talked about the possibility axioms and the successor state axioms.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
That's most of what's in situation calculus,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
and that's used to describe an entire domain like the airport cargo domain.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
And now we describe a particular problem within that domain by describing the initial state.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Typically we call that S0, the initial situation.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
And in S0 we can make various types of assertions

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
of different types of predicates.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:43,000
So we could say that plane P1 is at airport JFK in S0, so just a simple predicate.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:52,000
And we could also make larger sentences, so we could say

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:07,000
for all C, if C is cargo, then that C is at JFK in situation S0.

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
So we have much more flexibility in situation calculus to say almost anything we want.

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Anything that's a valid sentence in first order logic can be asserted about the initial state.

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
The goal state is similar.

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
We could have a goal of saying there exists some goal state S

15
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:41,000
such that for all C, if C is cargo, then we want that cargo to be at SFO in state S.

16
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
So this initial state and this goal says move all the cargo--

17
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I don't care how much there is--from JFK to SFO.

18
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
The great thing about situation calculus is that once we've described this

19
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
in the ordinary language of first order logic,

20
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
we don't need any special programs to manipulate it and come up with the solution

21
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
because we already have theorem provers for first order logic

22
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
and we can just state this as a problem,

23
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
apply the normal theorem prover that we already had for other uses,

24
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:19,000
and it can come up with an answer of a path that satisfies this goal,

25
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
a situation which corresponds to a path which satisfies this

26
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
given the initial state and given the descriptions of the actions.

27
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
So the advantage of situation calculus is that we have the full power of first order logic.

28
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
We can represent anything we want.

29
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Much more flexibility than in problem solving or classical planning.

30
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
So all together now, we've seen several ways of dealing with planning.

31
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
We started in deterministic, fully observable environments

32
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
and we moved into stochastic and partially observable environments.

33
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:55,000
We were able to distinguish between plans that can or cannot solve a problem,

34
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
but we had 1 weakness in all these different approaches.

35
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
It is that we weren't able to distinguish between probable and improbable solutions.

36
00:03:03,000 --> 99:59:59,999
And that will be the subject of the next unit.
