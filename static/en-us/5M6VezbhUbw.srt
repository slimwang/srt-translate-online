00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:03,990
Do you remember back in our lesson on motivation and emotion when we discussed

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:07,772
Maslow's hierarchy of needs, and we talked the top level of the hierarchy,

3
00:00:07,772 --> 00:00:13,290
which was self-actualization? Well, our next type of psychotherapy was

4
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:16,890
developed by Carl Rogers, and its purpose is to help a client reach their

5
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:22,016
greatest potential. So, this top layer of the hierarchy. This is called

6
00:00:22,016 --> 00:00:25,668
client-centered therapy. This is a form of humanistic therapy where the

7
00:00:25,668 --> 00:00:29,633
therapist shows unconditional positive regard for the patient, meaning the

8
00:00:29,633 --> 00:00:33,720
therapist genuinely accepts the individual and empathizes with the client, no

9
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:40,695
matter what the person has done. The basic idea behind Rogers' humanistic

10
00:00:40,695 --> 00:00:44,477
therapy is that the mismatch between who people think they are and who they

11
00:00:44,477 --> 00:00:47,832
think they should be, or would like to be, is the source of their low

12
00:00:47,832 --> 00:00:54,610
self-esteem and problems. In other words, there's a mismatch between the real

13
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:59,730
and the ideal self. The job of the therapist, therefore, is to be so accepting

14
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:05,450
of the person that their real self and ideal self becomes one and the same.

15
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:09,182
That is, they like who they really are and they accept who they really are. The

16
00:01:09,182 --> 00:01:12,584
end result of a successful treatment would be that the individual develop a

17
00:01:12,584 --> 00:01:16,040
strong sense of self worth, and that he or she has the confidence to strive for

18
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:18,750
self-fulfillment.
