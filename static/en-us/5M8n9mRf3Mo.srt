00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,500
Now that the module has been created, we
can use it to bootstrap the application.

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:07,810
To bootstrap our app,
we need the attribute ng-app and

3
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:13,800
set it equal to the name of the module,
which is udsc MealsApp.

4
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:16,405
Using Yeomen to scaffold our
project has helped us out again,

5
00:00:16,405 --> 00:00:20,230
because it automatically added
the code to bootstrap the app for us.

6
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:22,680
The code right here is
called the directive.

7
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:26,510
This is a mini preview on directives,
but they're awesome and very powerful.

8
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:30,550
When Angular loads, it scans your
HTML for this specific directive.

9
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:33,680
You can only use ng-app once and
it tells Angular two things.

10
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,270
First, this element
contains your application.

11
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:40,830
You can put this anywhere, but if we put
it on a div somewhere down in the page

12
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:43,050
then Angular will only be
loaded inside that div.

13
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:47,679
Second, it tells Angular to load
the Udsc MealsApp module and

14
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:49,683
all the components that it contains.

15
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:52,958
There are some other things to
be aware of when using ng-app.

16
00:00:52,958 --> 00:00:54,750
Look in the instructor notes for
details.
