Earlier on, we looked at solving equations which looked something like this.

2
00:00:04,881 --> 00:00:09,834
Here, we have 3x plus 4 equals 19. Let's consider something slightly different

3
00:00:09,846 --> 00:00:14,519
however. What if instead, we have the equation y equals 3x plus 4, let's say

4
00:00:14,531 --> 00:00:19,066
that we want know the value of x when y is equal to 19. Well, we know on one

5
00:00:19,078 --> 00:00:24,550
hand that we can just use substitution to replace y here with 19 and end up with

6
00:00:24,562 --> 00:00:30,095
the equation that we saw before. Then, we could isolate x and have an answer for

7
00:00:30,107 --> 00:00:35,665
it. We can also however use a graph to figure out the x-coordinate when y equals

8
00:00:35,677 --> 00:00:40,995
19. Please use this graph to find that x value. Also, please take note of the

9
00:00:41,007 --> 00:00:44,443
scale of the x-axis versus the, the y-axis.

10
00:00:44,446 --> 00:00:51,400
On the y-axis, every grid line up counts as 2, whereas, on the x-axis, it's only

11
00:00:51,412 --> 00:00:51,531
1.
