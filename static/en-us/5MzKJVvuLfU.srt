In this exercise you'll add a body to the robot this body is created by the

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,350
create robot body function you'll see it in the code. This body can rotate and

3
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:11,193
has the upper arm attached to its top your job is to add this body to the robots

00:00:11,193 --> 00:00:14,430
design. When your done your robot arm should look like this you might want to

5
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:17,530
turn off the display of the other two arm parts while you're testing out the

6
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:21,440
body itself. Simply comment out the line of code that adds the arm to the scene.

7
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:25,316
If you really want to get fancy, you can add a y axis control for the body

8
00:00:25,316 --> 00:00:28,919
itself. It's pretty easy to do this, just three lines of code. Take a look in

00:00:28,919 --> 00:00:31,933
the user interface set up gui method and in the render method.
