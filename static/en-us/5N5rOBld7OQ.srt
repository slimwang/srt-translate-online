1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,195
I've given myself a whole bunch of room, so
that I can write out all the steps that

2
00:00:04,207 --> 00:00:07,945
I'm going to need to simply this
expression up here. So as we talked about

3
00:00:07,945 --> 00:00:11,478
before, in other problems where we're
multiplying polynomials, to deal with

4
00:00:11,478 --> 00:00:16,865
these 2, I'm going to start the 1st
term of the 1st polynomial and make sure

5
00:00:16,877 --> 00:00:21,358
that I multiply it by every single term in
the 2nd polynomial. So I'm going to

6
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:25,907
write out all of those terms to start out.
So I have 3 terms here, reflecting the

7
00:00:25,907 --> 00:00:30,653
fact that I multiplied this term by each
of the 3 terms in this expression. Now

8
00:00:30,653 --> 00:00:35,839
that the -4x^2 is taken care of, I'll move
on to the x, since that's the next term in

9
00:00:35,851 --> 00:00:40,491
this 1st polynomial. Once again, I
should add on 3 more terms to what I'm

10
00:00:40,503 --> 00:00:45,372
building up here, 1 for each of these
terms, since I'm multiplying this by all

11
00:00:45,372 --> 00:00:49,265
of them. So now I have 6 terms total,
which I can double check by counting them

12
00:00:49,265 --> 00:00:52,425
all out. And this is actually a really
good way to check that you're on the right

13
00:00:52,437 --> 00:00:56,522
track, in terms of the spot in the problem
you're at. If I've already multiplied out

14
00:00:56,534 --> 00:01:00,679
the terms that I need for the first 2
terms of the 4 that I'm going to need

15
00:01:00,691 --> 00:01:04,143
to multiply. And there are 3 terms
that I'm multiplying each of them by,

16
00:01:04,143 --> 00:01:08,211
that'd make sense that I would have 2
times 3, or 6 terms total. Now let's

17
00:01:08,211 --> 00:01:12,458
continue, by multiplying all of these by
2y. And finally, we get to the last

18
00:01:12,458 --> 00:01:17,998
term in our 1st polynomial, the -6,
and now we have a super long expression.

19
00:01:18,382 --> 00:01:22,223
This looks pretty miserable right now, but
hopefully, as we continue to simplify

20
00:01:22,223 --> 00:01:25,655
within the terms, then combine like terms,
things will get to look a little bit

21
00:01:25,655 --> 00:01:30,543
nicer. Really though, in terms of new
material that this problem covered, our job is

22
00:01:30,543 --> 00:01:34,427
done. All that's left is for us to
simplify. Although, of course, this is a

23
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:38,031
particularly complicated simplification
process, because there are so many terms.

24
00:01:38,031 --> 00:01:43,498
We just have to be super careful. We end
up with this lovely, very long final

25
00:01:43,498 --> 00:02:00,459
answer of
-12x^2y^2+20x^3+3xy^2+6y^3-17x^2-10xy-18y^2+33x+6y-18.

26
00:02:00,459 --> 00:02:06,201
Wow. That was really difficult, and if you 
got this perfectly right, I am so proud

27
00:02:06,201 --> 00:02:10,573
of you. I actually made a couple of
mistakes myself when I was redoing the

28
00:02:10,573 --> 00:02:14,320
problem on the tablet here. You can see
actually, when I was doing my work, that I

29
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:17,983
had to put little check marks above all
the terms in this step before I got to the

30
00:02:17,995 --> 00:02:22,515
final answer. The reason that I did that,
is that I wanted to make sure that as I

31
00:02:22,527 --> 00:02:26,973
rewrote each term down here, and combined
it with it's like terms, that I prevented

32
00:02:26,973 --> 00:02:32,285
myself from dealing with it again. So, I
put a little check mark above a term, when

33
00:02:32,297 --> 00:02:36,565
I wrote it down here, that also let me
check that I actually had dealt with every

34
00:02:36,577 --> 00:02:39,661
single term that I needed to deal with. I
think at this point, if you got this

35
00:02:39,661 --> 00:02:43,583
problem right, you have mastered
multiplication of polynomials.

36
00:02:43,674 --> 00:02:45,515
Congratulations. That's pretty huge.
