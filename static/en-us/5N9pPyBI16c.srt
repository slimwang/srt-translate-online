00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,083
You might be wondering why this might be useful. Never fear.

2
00:00:04,083 --> 00:00:05,691
We'll have 2 good examples in this unit

3
00:00:05,691 --> 00:00:08,358
and cover the first one here and the second a little later.

4
00:00:08,358 --> 00:00:12,896
So let's consider the problem of sparse matrix/dense vector multiplication,

5
00:00:12,896 --> 00:00:17,713
which we abbreviate SpMv, sparse matrix vector.

6
00:00:17,713 --> 00:00:21,931
Many interesting matrices have lots of zeroes, so we call those matrices sparse.

7
00:00:21,931 --> 00:00:26,411
And we want to find a data structure to represent them that squeezes out the zeroes

8
00:00:26,411 --> 00:00:31,202
as well as to find a more efficient way to multiply them by vectors.

9
00:00:31,202 --> 00:00:35,950
After all, if there's lots of zeroes, we'll do lots of multiplications that have no effect.

10
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:40,520
So sparse matrices are incredibly common in computational problems in many domains.

11
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:45,040
For instance, PageRank is the world's largest matrix computation.

12
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:50,400
PageRank is based on a giant sparse matrix that represents every web page in the world.

13
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,466
How big is this matrix?

14
00:00:52,466 --> 00:00:57,067
Well if there is n web pages in the world, this matrix is n by n

15
00:00:57,067 --> 00:01:05,117
and each entry at row R in column C is non-zero only if web page R Links to web page C.

16
00:01:05,117 --> 00:01:07,937
So the PageRank computation on this sparse matrix

17
00:01:07,937 --> 00:01:11,344
is how Google computes the importance of web pages.

18
00:01:11,344 --> 00:01:15,587
Let's briefly refresh how we multiply a matrix by a vector.

19
00:01:15,587 --> 00:01:19,230
Students who already know this are welcome to skip to the next segment.

20
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:26,096
So we're going to multiply this 3x3 matrix here by this 3x1 matrix here. So how do we do this?

21
00:01:26,096 --> 00:01:29,005
For each output in the output vector,

22
00:01:29,005 --> 00:01:36,077
we multiply the row of the input matrix by the column of the input vector.

23
00:01:36,077 --> 00:01:38,609
So we do this in a pairwise way--

24
00:01:38,609 --> 00:01:42,668
a times x + b times y + c times z,

25
00:01:42,668 --> 00:01:46,752
and that will create the entry here ax + by + cz.

26
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:52,482
For each additional row in the output matrix we simply do another one of these dot products.

27
00:01:52,482 --> 00:01:59,136
So for instance, to compute this value here we dot product this vector with, again,

28
00:01:59,136 --> 00:02:05,102
our input vector to get g times x + h times y + i times z.

29
00:02:05,102 --> 00:02:07,571
So let's do a matrix times a vector as a quiz.

30
00:02:07,571 --> 00:02:11,383
We're going to have this sample 3 x3 matrix times this sample 3x3 vector.

31
00:02:11,383 --> 00:02:15,388
And I'd like you to write the vector answer in these 3 blanks here.
