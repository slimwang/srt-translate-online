Today we will talk about Case-Based Reasoning. In Case-based reasoning,

2
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:09,610
the cognitive agent addresses new problems by tweaking solutions to

3
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:14,120
similar previously encountered problems. Case-based reasoning builds on

4
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:18,920
the previous lesson on learning recording cases. In learning recording cases,

5
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:23,510
the new problem is identical to the previous problem. In case-based reasoning,

6
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:28,220
the new problem is similar to a previously encountered problem. Case-based

7
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:32,600
reasoning typically has several phases, case retrieval, case adaptation,

8
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:38,572
case evaluation, and case storage. We'll also discuss certain advanced processes

9
00:00:38,572 --> 00:00:42,610
of case-based reasoning which will include new methods for case retrieval.
