[Evans] This helps a little bit but doesn't avoid many of the problems with passwords.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
One big problem with passwords is that they're reused.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
There are lots of ways to reuse passwords.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Some of this is using the same password across many sites.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
That's not what I'm talking about here.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I'm talking about the point that every time Alice logs in

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
she enters the same exact password.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
The password is the same until she does something to change it.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
So she's typing the same password many times.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
This means if there is something logging what she types,

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
it will learn her password if she types it in an Internet cafe

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
or somewhere where it's visible to someone looking over her shoulder--

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
a shoulder surfer.

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
It's also the case that her device that she enters her password in

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
would start to have smudges where she types her password.

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
This is a particular problem for short PINs on smartphones

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
that are entered so many times that finger smudges start to give an idea

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
of what the password might be.

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
All of these problems stem from using the same password every time she logs in.

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
So we're going to talk about one way to avoid that, which is to use a hash chain.

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Hash chains have lots of interesting applications.

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
In this case, we're going to use a hash chain to make it so we still have the nice property

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
that we had with the password file where the server stores no secrets.

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
It doesn't matter if all the data on the server is compromised.

25
00:01:19,000 --> 99:59:59,999
That still wouldn't give someone the ability to log in as Alice.
