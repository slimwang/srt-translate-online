1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,730
So three of these would reduce latency. The first one is correct.

2
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:06,990
That would reduce latency because every time you go through a hop,

3
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:10,860
well there's some time delay there. That you need the time for

4
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:13,994
the troops at the hop to see the message that came in and

5
00:00:13,994 --> 00:00:17,300
then to start their fire to send the same message on to

6
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:20,070
the next hop. So if you have fewer hops its going to take

7
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:23,065
less time for the message to get across. You could reduce the

8
00:00:23,065 --> 00:00:26,130
time it takes to go through each hop. So, if you can make

9
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:29,460
the soldiers at each node work faster, it would take

10
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:31,790
less time from the time that they see the message to

11
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:34,390
the time that they send it on, which is the time

12
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:36,490
when the next person will see it. So, the total time

13
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:39,690
to get across the network would also be reduced. The

14
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:44,500
third choice does not reduce latency. So adding colors would allow

15
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:48,010
you to send more messages, but it doesn't reduce the time

16
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:51,390
it takes for a message to get across. And we'll see

17
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:54,040
next that what adding colors would do would actually increase

18
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,380
the bandwidth of the network. But it doesn't improve the

19
00:00:56,380 --> 00:01:00,510
latency at all. And finally, because Zeus can do things

20
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:05,150
that most people can't, other than possibly physicists in Switzerland.

21
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:07,400
If you could increase the speed of light, well that

22
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,590
would make the network faster. Not a very realistic option

23
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:12,940
and it wouldn't make it much faster because of the

24
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:16,630
transit time even with the regular speed of light, the time

25
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:19,120
it takes for the light to travel between

26
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:22,660
the points is infinitesimally small compared to the time

27
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:25,390
for all the other things like starting fires. But

28
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:27,480
all three of these would in theory reduce the

29
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:32,040
latency. The adding colors would not reduce the latency,

30
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,190
but it would increase the amount of information that

31
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:36,110
Zeus could send between those points in the same

32
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:38,650
amount of time. And that's what we call bandwidth.
