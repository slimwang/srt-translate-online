1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Let's first have a look at the output.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,000
You see that with rates of 20,000 and 50,000 tons per year, we do not seem to be over fishing.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
However, with rates of 100,000 and 200,000 tons per year,

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
we clearly are over fishing, fish go extinct.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
The line of code that actually implements the forward Euler method

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
is produced straightforward.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
The harder part is to stop harvesting and this solution is as follows--

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:38,000
we check whether or not the amount of fish for the next step is equal to zero or negative.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
If so, we set a flag that tells us whether I should be using zero

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
for the amount of fishing in all upcoming steps.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Note that you cannot simply check whether the amount of fish for the next step

12
00:00:50,000 --> 99:59:59,999
is exactly equal to zero--that's probably not going to happen.
