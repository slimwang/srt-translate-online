1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,914
This last one is the best choice. We still want to cap the number of people that

2
00:00:04,914 --> 00:00:09,776
Grant can hire at 15, still including 15. But we also want to make sure that he

3
00:00:09,776 --> 00:00:14,502
doesn't hire a negative number of people. So we put the end of our range at 0,

4
00:00:14,502 --> 00:00:18,710
but including 0, because technically, he wouldn't have to hire anyone.
