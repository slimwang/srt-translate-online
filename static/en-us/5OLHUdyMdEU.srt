1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,500
So, there's a lot of trends
in the Silicon Valley.

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:06,703
Should I, as an entrepreneur,
look for an idea around the trend?

3
00:00:09,882 --> 00:00:12,220
>> Again, I think it depends.

4
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:18,890
There's a lot of people who can be very,
kind of like, trans centric.

5
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:22,110
Social mobile local is hard,
so let's all go chase that.

6
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:23,610
Or, everybody wants to,

7
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:27,440
I don't know how many companies have
heard about shared economy, you know?

8
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:31,100
Back in 2000s,
there was this wave about pets.

9
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:36,820
So, I think that there's a lot of this,
I hate to use the word herd mentality,

10
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:38,710
everybody wants to go do the same thing.

11
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:44,370
But, having said that, I think it's
valuable to look at current disruptions,

12
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:47,800
current dislocations,
like for example, mobile.

13
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,530
Having a camera on the mobile phone, or

14
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:53,030
having your location
on the mobile phone.

15
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:57,200
It's created businesses around
like Uber or Instagram.

16
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:01,350
These are really mobile first companies.

17
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:05,440
And this wasn't possible,
six, seven, eight years ago.

18
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:12,860
So, I think studying, hey there is this
big movement from landlines to mobile.

19
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:16,566
I think, people can consciously think
about down screen impacts of those

20
00:01:16,566 --> 00:01:19,820
things, and
businesses then can then be created.

21
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:21,850
Music is another great example.

22
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:25,222
Music has been massively disrupted,
around how you produce it,

23
00:01:25,222 --> 00:01:27,748
how do you distribute it,
and all of that.

24
00:01:27,748 --> 00:01:35,140
Companies like Spotify, or even device
makers, iPods and phones, and so on.

25
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:38,910
So, I think there's a lot of benefit
in thinking about disruptions,

26
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:42,420
and what does that mean three years
from now, six years from now.

27
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:44,630
A cloud is a great example.

28
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:45,762
All right.

29
00:01:45,762 --> 00:01:49,310
AWSI are doing cloud, and now there
are numerous companies that got

30
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:53,330
created around that trend,
security, payments, and so on.

31
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:55,780
So, I think it's valuable, but

32
00:01:55,780 --> 00:02:01,360
having said that, I don't want to just
recommend that as the only approach.

33
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:05,370
We can see companies that are created
in retail, in agriculture,

34
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:08,410
in insurance, in data, and so on.

35
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:13,250
So, just old-fashioned industries
that people are not looking at.

36
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:17,850
But, there's a lot of opportunity,
because incumbents populate those,

37
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:20,550
and it's not the sexy thing to do.

38
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:22,240
But you can definitely
create businesses there.

39
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,480
>> So, as an entrepreneur,

40
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:27,190
how should I think about competition,
and how should it impact my product?

41
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:32,480
>> I think it's very important
to be aware of the competition.

42
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,890
But, I think it also depends
on the state of the company.

43
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:39,740
I've seen entrepreneurs
that get very distracted

44
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:45,020
by trying to follow and
copy every move off their competition.

45
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:48,080
I think it's not very healthy.

46
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,820
Especially, if you're trying
to go after a new market,

47
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:51,030
if you're creating a new category.

48
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,620
You let somebody else define
your moves and your product.

49
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:58,070
And that's not healthy.

50
00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:01,810
But, I think as you start maturing,
and as you start optimizing

51
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:06,840
it's useful to think about even
small differences in the product

52
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:11,610
can create massive differences
in the mindset of consumers.

53
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:17,030
So, I think if I were to simplify,
if you're just getting going,

54
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:21,880
if you're in a new category,
don't let the competition define you.

55
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,240
But if you're mature,

56
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,840
I think you need to pay more
attention to the competition.
