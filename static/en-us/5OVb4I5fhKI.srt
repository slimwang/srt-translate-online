00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,230
Now let's discuss
the Secure Hash Algorithm or SHA.

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:08,240
The Secure Hash Algorithm
was developed by NIST.

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,661
The original algorithm is SHA-1.

4
00:00:10,661 --> 00:00:15,290
SHA-1 produces a hash value of 160 bits.

5
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:21,230
Later, NIST revised the SHA standard and
specify the SHA-2 algorithms.

6
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:26,500
This algorithms have key lengths of 256,
384 and 512 bits,

7
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:30,970
and their operations
are similar to SHA-1.

8
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:33,930
This table compares the SHA parameters.

9
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:39,185
The message digest size refers to
the length of the hash value, so for

10
00:00:39,185 --> 00:00:47,140
SHA-1 it is 160 bits, and for
SHA-512 the hash length is 512 bits.

11
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:50,840
Message size is a size
limit on the input.

12
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:55,290
You can consider these size limits
are not having an effect in practice,

13
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:58,630
because most if not all
messages will be smaller.

14
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:05,700
For example, even with SHA-1,
the message size is limited to 2 to 64.

15
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,390
This means that you
can hash a message so

16
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:13,490
big that it occupies the entire
address space of a 64 bit computer.

17
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:16,125
You can also think about
it in another way.

18
00:01:16,125 --> 00:01:19,320
2 to the 43 bits is already a terabyte.

19
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,380
As we can see,

20
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:25,730
the algorithms from left to right
produce hash values with more bits.

21
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:29,750
Hence, they are more secure as
we move from left to right.

22
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:34,730
For example, with SHA-1
because the hash value has 160

23
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:39,894
bits then the search space for the
attacker to find a collision is 2 to 80.

24
00:01:39,894 --> 00:01:44,030
Whereas for
SHA-512 the search space is 2 to 256.

25
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:48,967
In this lecture we will provide
a description of SHA-512,

26
00:01:48,967 --> 00:01:52,550
the other versions are quite similar.

27
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:55,460
For SHA-512 it takes as an input

28
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:59,200
a message that's smaller
than 2 to the 128.

29
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,530
Again, this is not a limit that
will have any impact in practice.

30
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:06,880
The output is a hash value
that is in 512 bits.

31
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:12,247
The input is processed block by
block and each block has 1024 bits.
