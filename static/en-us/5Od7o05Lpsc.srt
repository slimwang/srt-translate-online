1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,750
The way that you build a portfolio, or

2
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:06,900
buy stocks that you hold in your
portfolio, is by issuing orders.

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:10,140
Usually you send those orders
to a stock broker, and

4
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:11,980
they take care of executing them for
you.

5
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:16,550
We're going to dive now into
the details of what happens

6
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:20,460
when you create an order, and
how it gets to the market and back.

7
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:24,810
And how things can go wrong, and
how they can potentially go right.

8
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:29,950
The first stop there is to think
about what is actually in an order.

9
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:33,820
What are the components of an order
that can go to a stock exchange?

10
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:39,970
Here is all the information that
must go into a well-formed order.

11
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:44,380
First of all,
I need to know are you looking to buy or

12
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:45,910
sell shares of a stock?

13
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,120
Next is the symbol.

14
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:54,900
This is an identifier for the stock or
perhaps ETF that you want to buy or

15
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:58,810
sell, for instance IBM or SPLV.

16
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:04,970
Next you need to tell your broker how
many shares you want to buy or sell.

17
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:06,860
Stocks and ETFs and

18
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:12,770
other assets are sold in units of
shares, not by amount of money.

19
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:17,570
So you don't tell your broker I
want $100,000 worth of Apple,

20
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:22,750
you tell your broker I want
a thousand shares of Apple.

21
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:25,680
Next, you need to tell your broker
whether this is a limit order or

22
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,910
a market order.

23
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:32,030
Let's start with market first,
market means you're willing to accept

24
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:37,280
a good price but essentially whatever
price the market is currently bearing.

25
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,310
And I'll show you in a moment
how that's determined.

26
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,900
A limit price means you don't want to
do any worse than a certain price.

27
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:49,630
For instance,
suppose you're selling some stock.

28
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:54,720
You might specify I don't want it to
be sold below a particular price.

29
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,790
Or if you're buying stock,

30
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:59,840
you might say, I don't want to pay
more than a certain amount to get it.

31
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,000
If you're issuing a limit order,

32
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,510
then you have to say what
the corresponding price is.

33
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:06,950
If it's a market order,

34
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:10,210
you're not able to specify that price
because essentially when you issue

35
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:14,250
the market order you're saying I'll
take whatever price comes back.

36
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:16,780
Let's take a look at
a couple example orders.

37
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:17,560
Here's one.

38
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:22,850
Buy IBM, 100 shares, limit, 99.95.

39
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:29,025
So this means I want to buy 100
shares of IBM at no more than $99.95.

40
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:35,430
Another example, sell Google,
150 shares, market.

41
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:37,890
Notice there's no price
with this because

42
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:40,260
we're going to take whatever
the market price is.

43
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:43,870
So let's look at what happens when
these orders reach the exchange.
