1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Now let's turn the tables a bit and attack the problem from the other direction.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
This time, I'd like you to use the interpreter, and you're going to create

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
your own regular expression.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Assign to the variable regexp, a common abbreviation for regular expression,

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
a regular expression that matches either the exact string ab--2 letters in ab--

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,000
or 1 or more digits. To help clarify this specification, I have 3 positive instances--

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
you should match ab, 1, and 123--

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:38,063
and 3 negative instances--don't match a alone, don't match abc, and don't match abc 123.
