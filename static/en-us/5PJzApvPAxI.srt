00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:04,460
Okay, so here's the shell of the code that we saw before, where we're

2
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:08,790
grabbing the click location on the document, which is just the whole website.

3
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:12,900
And we're going to be running some steps, using this weird function syntax,

4
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,190
that we'll actually be learning a little bit more about soon.

5
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:19,430
Every time the page is clicked, we create two new variables, x and y.

6
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:21,720
Both of them use this location object,

7
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:25,910
this location event object from the click, and we grab its pageX and its pageY,

8
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:30,340
which are simply the pixel values of the x and y location of the clicks.

9
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:34,720
Once we have the x and y locations, we simply pass them into logClicks and

10
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:39,750
we should see, when we click, there it is again, x and y locations.
