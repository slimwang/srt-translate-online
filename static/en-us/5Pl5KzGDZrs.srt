00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,760
Let's go over the answers
to these quiz questions.

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:06,689
Each of these lines of code
creates a string variable and

3
00:00:06,689 --> 00:00:11,150
I wanted to know what is the value
that goes inside the string variable.

4
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:14,020
That means we need to evaluate this
expression which includes string

5
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:15,340
concatenation.

6
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:21,080
Part a says, String orderNumber
= "Order number:" + 23.

7
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:26,583
The value that gets stored in
this variable is Order number;23.

8
00:00:26,583 --> 00:00:30,129
Notice that there's no space
after the semicolon because

9
00:00:30,129 --> 00:00:32,817
the end quote is right
after the semicolon.

10
00:00:32,817 --> 00:00:35,975
Since this is a string literal
concatenated with a integer literal,

11
00:00:35,975 --> 00:00:38,870
then the whole thing
just turns into a string.

12
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:42,324
For part b, the right-hand side
of the equal sign evaluates

13
00:00:42,324 --> 00:00:45,140
to the string You were served by Jack.

14
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:48,060
There's a space here
because there's a space

15
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:50,060
right before we have the end quote.

16
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:55,740
For part c, this string evaluates to
You are2cups away from a free drink.

17
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:59,280
The number 2 is an integer literal
value here because it's not in quotes.

18
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,760
It's just a plain number 2.

19
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:03,370
Since we have an integer
concatenated with a string,

20
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:07,450
it just becomes a string, and all
these parts are combined together, so

21
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:08,900
we pretend to squish them together.

22
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:12,420
And that's why there's
no spaces right here,

23
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:16,765
because there's no space after the are
and there's no space before the cups, so

24
00:01:16,765 --> 00:01:19,670
are2cups is all combined with no spaces.
