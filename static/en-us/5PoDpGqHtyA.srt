Hey Asser.

2
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:04,360
>> Why are you wearing this weird coat?

3
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:08,970
>> Well funny you ask, I'm actually
traveling to Seattle to visit some

4
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:13,630
relatives and unlike here they
have this weird thing called rain.

5
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:16,620
Now I was actually able to use
Sunshine's location preference

6
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:19,100
to see that inclement
weather long in advance.

7
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:22,557
>> Right and I finally got my
temperature to show in Celsius degrees.

8
00:00:22,557 --> 00:00:22,987
>> Cool,

9
00:00:22,987 --> 00:00:27,379
now these are just some examples
of preferences you can implement.

10
00:00:27,379 --> 00:00:29,079
The skills you learned in this lesson,

11
00:00:29,079 --> 00:00:32,149
you can now quickly make preference
screens for your own apps.

12
00:00:32,149 --> 00:00:34,059
>> You also learned about
shared preferences,

13
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:37,240
which is your first taste of
data persistence on Android.

14
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:40,289
Hopefully it tasted good because we
will be learning a lot more about data

15
00:00:40,289 --> 00:00:42,149
persistence in the next lessons.

16
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:46,734
>> But for now take a break, stretch,
and maybe even enjoy the sunshine.

17
00:00:46,734 --> 00:00:48,143
