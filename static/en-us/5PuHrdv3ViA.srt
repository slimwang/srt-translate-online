1
00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:02,890
Okay, let's look at these guys.

2
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:03,400
Now remember,

3
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:06,830
these aren't instructions that are meant
to be followed together, they're

4
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:10,349
different ways that you can substantiate
the declare currentlyPlaying.

5
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:12,105
So, let's look at each
of them separately.

6
00:00:12,105 --> 00:00:16,265
Okay, the first one,
everything is almost perfect but

7
00:00:16,265 --> 00:00:21,540
there's one tiny thing missing and it's
the quote that matches this one here.

8
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:23,590
Much like our curly braces,
parentheses, and

9
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:27,440
XML tags, you always need to put
quotes at the ends of the string.

10
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:28,530
Okay, let's look at this next one.

11
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:33,220
As we discussed in the last problem,
capitalization matters.

12
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:34,550
And there's something wrong here.

13
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:36,600
String is always
a capitalized data type.

14
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,270
Now we'll discuss this a little
bit in the next lesson, but

15
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:41,900
String is not a primary
data type like int.

16
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:43,610
It's actually something called a object.

17
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:45,790
Again we'll talk about it more later,
but

18
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:47,810
with String you always
need it to be capitalized.

19
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:49,735
And once you capitalize String,
this would work fine.

20
00:00:49,735 --> 00:00:54,280
And here, this one is almost fine,
there's just one tiny problem.

21
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,800
Can you see it?

22
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,110
All right.
Hopefully you caught it.

23
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:59,400
There should be a semicolon
at the end here.

24
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:02,969
As always, you should remember to finish
your Java statements with semicolons and

25
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:05,060
close all of your strings with quotes.

26
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:06,925
You don't want something bad to happen.
