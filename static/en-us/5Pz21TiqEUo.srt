1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:04,538
The year never changed, but year is how we're controlling the loop. So we

2
00:00:04,538 --> 00:00:10,490
needed to remember to increment year by 1. Inside the body of the loop. Now if

3
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:14,360
I run this again, the output is much more manageable. It's pretty easy to make

4
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:18,500
this kind of mistake. Where you forget to update the loop counter variable.

5
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:21,214
We're going to show you a way to write a loop that is good for cases like this

6
00:00:21,214 --> 00:00:25,280
one, when you know exactly how many times you want to repeat something.
