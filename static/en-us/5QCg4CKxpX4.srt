1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,250
The next step is to add a second

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:03,899
Horizontal Stack View, so that it can

3
00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:05,400
hold buttons for playing the recorded

4
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,099
audio with high and low pitches.

5
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:10,468
With the Main.storyboard file open,

6
00:00:10,468 --> 00:00:14,519
select the Play Sounds View Controller.

7
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:16,199
Let's search for “stack view” in the object library.

8
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:23,670
Drag a Horizontal Stack View

9
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:25,439
from the object library into the

10
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:27,778
Document Outline. Make sure that it's

11
00:00:27,778 --> 00:00:29,550
embedded inside of the Vertical Stack View

12
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:31,559
our outermost stack view in the

13
00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:34,049
Document Outline and under the first

14
00:00:34,049 --> 00:00:43,130
Horizontal Stack View. Perfect.

15
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:44,600
Your Document Outline should look

16
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:47,840
similar to what you see here.

17
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,789
One more thing. With this new Horizontal Stack

18
00:00:49,789 --> 00:00:51,740
View selected, change its Distribution

19
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:54,140
setting and the attributes inspector to

20
00:00:54,140 --> 00:01:01,039
Fill Equally. There we go. Now let's add

21
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:04,129
some more buttons. Back in the object

22
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:07,069
library, start typing “button”.

23
00:01:07,069 --> 00:01:08,900
Drag a button to the new Horizontal Stack View.

24
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:14,810
In the attributes inspector, remove the

25
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:19,579
buttons title text. So we'll delete that

26
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:21,049
and press Enter.

27
00:01:21,049 --> 00:01:24,379
There we go. And change its image to HighPitch,

28
00:01:24,379 --> 00:01:30,950
which is the chipmunk image.

29
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:32,299
It's all the same steps for the Low Pitch button.

30
00:01:32,299 --> 00:01:39,799
Drag our new button below

31
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:43,759
the High Pitch button, remove its title

32
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:47,149
text and this time we'll change the

33
00:01:47,149 --> 00:01:48,978
image to LowPitch which is an image of

34
00:01:48,978 --> 00:01:53,149
Darth Vader. I’m also going to rename the

35
00:01:53,149 --> 00:01:54,769
buttons to High Pitch button and

36
00:01:54,769 --> 00:01:57,439
Low Pitch button. Once you're done, your

37
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:58,969
Document Outline should look similar to

38
00:01:58,969 --> 00:02:00,289
this.

39
00:02:00,289 --> 00:02:02,000
I should mention that the hierarchy and

40
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,420
order seen here is important. If I were

41
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:07,519
to rearrange the fast and slow button,

42
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:09,770
we'd see them change their position in

43
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:14,780
the stack view. With the Fast Button

44
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:16,879
positioned above the Slow Button and the

45
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:18,318
stack view laying things out

46
00:02:18,318 --> 00:02:20,689
horizontally, now we see moving left to

47
00:02:20,689 --> 00:02:23,300
right first the Fast Button and then the

48
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:26,360
Slow Button. So for horizontal stack views,

49
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,129
the order moves from left to right.

50
00:02:28,129 --> 00:02:31,580
For Vertical Stack Views, the order moves

51
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:34,669
from top to bottom. So if I rearranged

52
00:02:34,669 --> 00:02:37,159
these stack views, we could change the row’s

53
00:02:37,159 --> 00:02:40,159
positioning. Right now the first row is the

54
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:43,459
Fast and Slow button. If I move the stack

55
00:02:43,459 --> 00:02:46,729
view below, this now becomes the second

56
00:02:46,729 --> 00:02:48,650
row and our first row now has the High

57
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:50,598
Pitch and Low Pitch buttons.

58
00:02:50,598 --> 00:02:54,780
Let's return things back to what we had.

59
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:58,889
There we go. Now you have four buttons in

60
00:02:58,889 --> 00:03:00,719
this view perfectly aligned, and we have

61
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:02,459
not had to add a single AutoLayout

62
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:08,959
Constraint. That's pretty awesome.
