1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:03,680
So, in fact, it's actually quite easy to illicit false memories in the

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:09,128
laboratory. This is often done with word list. So, people are presented a list

3
00:00:09,128 --> 00:00:13,400
of words that they have to recall later on. And often, they remember words that

4
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:17,496
were not on the original list, but were associated similar to words that were

5
00:00:17,496 --> 00:00:22,672
on the list. So in fact they've created a false memory, a memory of a word that

6
00:00:22,672 --> 00:00:27,660
wasn't there. So then the question is, why is this important, who should care?

7
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:32,086
So one reason it's so important to demonstrate the ease of creating false

8
00:00:32,086 --> 00:00:35,838
memories in the laboratory is that it has real world ramifications, especially

9
00:00:35,838 --> 00:00:43,886
in court cases. Occasionally false memories lead to false accusations. In one

10
00:00:43,886 --> 00:00:48,164
case, a woman who was raped accused a psychologist by the name of Donald

11
00:00:48,164 --> 00:00:54,062
Thompson of the rape. As it turns out she'd been watching t.v. Right before her

12
00:00:54,062 --> 00:00:58,210
attack and on TV she was watching Donald Thompson, who in fact was talking

13
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:03,939
about, of all things false memories. Now in her mind the association between

14
00:01:03,939 --> 00:01:09,810
the attack and Donald Thompson's face was made. So she made this accusation.

15
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:12,742
Now as it turns out Donald Thompson, of course, had a great alibi. He could

16
00:01:12,742 --> 00:01:16,046
prove beyond a shadow of the doubt that he was on TV at the time and was not

17
00:01:16,046 --> 00:01:22,119
there in committing a crime. Unfortuneately, not everyone who is falsely

18
00:01:22,119 --> 00:01:27,157
accused has such a alibi. Occassionally, false memories lead to false

19
00:01:27,157 --> 00:01:29,510
accusations and convictions.
