1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Now, the answer--that's a 60% and here is why.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
At the threshold of Herd Immunity, the expression in the red parenthesis has to be 0.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
If we vaccinate even more persons, the number of susceptible persons shrinks further,

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
and this expression becomes negative, and now we can solve for the number of susceptible persons.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
And we get 1/5 days divided by this coefficient--the days answer

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:34,000
and we get the number of 40 million persons--that's 40% of the population of 100 million.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
If the number of infectious persons is negligible at that point of time,

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
the remaining 60% have to be in the R compartment of the model.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
They have to be immune.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
If more than 60% of the population are in the R compartment, this expression is negative

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
and we can never have an epidemic outbreak.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So 60% is the threshold of Herd Immunity.
