1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Let's go through the answers together.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
We're looking for a space in "Ada Lovelace", and there is a space right here.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
This "a" is at position 0, "d" is at position 1, "a" is at position 2.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
So this space is at position 3.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Now we're looking for an "n" in "Alan Turing", and there are two.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
The first one is at position 3, but here we're asked to start from position 4,

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
so the one we'll get is this last "n" at position 9.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Ada Lovelace is widely regarded as the first computer programmer.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
In fact, she wrote the first computer program for computing some mathematics

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
before computers themselves even really existed.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
They were just plans or blueprints.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Similarly, Alan Turing is often regarded as one of the leaders or founders of computer science.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,246
The Nobel Prize in computer science is called the Turing Award.
