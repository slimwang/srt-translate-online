1
00:00:00,406 --> 00:00:04,310
HTML 5 edit types for phone numbers, email addresses,

2
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:07,720
URLs, numbers and dates, among others. For each one of

3
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:10,010
these fields, I can go into the depth fields and

4
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:13,250
change it. For example, email, right now, gives me the

5
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:15,990
standard keyboard. But, if I go in and change

6
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:19,760
its type to email, you may notice one subtle difference.

7
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,320
And I now get an @ symbol on my keyboard

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,330
by default. Some of the biggest changes were for dates,

9
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:33,050
where I now get an actual calendar and colors, where not only do I

10
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:39,500
get a nice color selection box, but I can actually edit the color. And finally,

11
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:42,030
there's a simple number input type. You'll

12
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:44,510
notice this is somewhat like the number input

13
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:46,799
for telephone numbers, except there's no alpha

14
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:49,110
numeric's and there's no hash and star sign.
