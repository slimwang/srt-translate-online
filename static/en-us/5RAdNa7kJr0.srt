1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:03,450
But you can do more than just
display files in the terminal.

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:05,760
You can also edit files in the terminal.

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:08,950
This is really handy if you're
logged into a remote system and

4
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:11,730
you want to change a configuration
file or something.

5
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:15,220
Instead of pulling the file back to your
desktop and editing it with Sublime or

6
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:17,220
another graphically based text editor,

7
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,780
you can use an editor that
runs right in the terminal.

8
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:22,964
There are a heck of a lot of terminal
based text editors out there.

9
00:00:22,964 --> 00:00:29,580
Like vim and emacs and
joe, and many others.

10
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:34,120
But one of the easiest ones is built
into ubuntu, and it's called nano.

11
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:38,040
You can run nano on any text file you
happen to have on your Linux box.

12
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:41,050
It takes the file to edit as
a command line parameter.

13
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:42,620
And here we are in nano.

14
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:46,580
You can move around with the arrow
keys and edit just like this.

15
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,510
Down at the bottom of
the terminal screen,

16
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:52,370
nano shows you a bunch of
commands that you can use.

17
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:56,358
The little carrot or
hat character means the control key.

18
00:00:56,358 --> 00:01:01,802
For instance, ^J means Justify or
rewrap the text to fit on the screen.

19
00:01:01,802 --> 00:01:06,310
And ^O means WriteOut which
is to say save the file.

20
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:09,360
If the file doesn't already have
a name it'll ask you for one.

21
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,840
Now open up nano on a file yourself.

22
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,690
Looking at the help that's right there,

23
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:15,642
what key stroke would
you used to exit nano?

24
00:01:15,642 --> 00:01:19,965
Control-G, Alt-R, Control-Alt-Delete,

25
00:01:19,965 --> 00:01:23,929
Control-X, Alt-X, or Escape :wq Enter?
