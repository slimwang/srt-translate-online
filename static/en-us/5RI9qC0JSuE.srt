1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:02,680
Now this pseudocode that you're looking at, is very similar

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:05,580
to the pseudocode for verifying your credit card number. The

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:09,230
pseudocode for verifying your credit card starts by setting n

4
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:12,610
and sum, and it also sets a count. Then for each

5
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:16,720
digit, again starting from the right, it increments the count,

6
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,830
and then uses the count to determine what to do with

7
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:22,150
the digit. If the count is odd, then the digit

8
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:25,530
gets added to the sum. Otherwise, if the count is even,

9
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:27,520
then it matters how big the digit is. If the

10
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:30,400
digit is less than five, then we add two times the

11
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,500
digit to the sum. Otherwise, if the count is even and

12
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,220
the digit is five or greater, then we add two times

13
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:41,910
the digit to the sum, and subtract nine. And then,

14
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:44,410
if the last digit of the sum is zero, the card

15
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:47,860
number is valid. How would you write Java code for this?

16
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:50,600
There's a lot going on here, so first let's do one

17
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:54,910
part of it. How would you change the code for summing all of the digits, so that

18
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:59,600
it only sums every other digit, starting with the rightmost? I'd like you to

19
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:05,400
complete the sum certain digits method, which given a number like,

20
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:10,809
12,345 would return 5 plus 3 plus 1. And for a number

21
00:01:10,809 --> 00:01:16,230
like 6,789, would return 9 plus 7. I'll give

22
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:19,330
you the code for summing all the digits to start with. And there will be

23
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:21,050
some hint links above the submit button, to

24
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:22,480
hint videos in case you'd like a boost.
