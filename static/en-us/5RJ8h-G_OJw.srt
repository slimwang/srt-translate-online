00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:05,720
Thinking about the 2 x 2 matrix on the last slide, a real question for you is--

2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:08,630
how does your product get to the customer?

3
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:12,820
I think the real questions start with what type of product do I have.

4
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:18,280
Do I have a product made out of bits that is--is it virtual or is my product a physical product.

5
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:21,270
Now, I think that's a simple choice you need to make right now.

6
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:24,050
Is your product physical or is it bits.

7
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:28,690
The next thing you need to ask is what's going to be my distribution channel.

8
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:34,170
Is it going to be direct--that is am I going to either offer it on a website AOL

9
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:38,850
or have direct sales people that work for me, or is it to be indirect.

10
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:44,790
That is, am I going to put it on a third party website like an Amazon or a web aggregator,

11
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:47,910
or physically, am I going to use system integrators or VARs

12
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:50,750
or some other indirect channel like a retail store.

13
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:55,820
Just select what you think will work for your product, and so later on in the lecture,

14
00:00:55,820 --> 00:01:00,790
we'll analyze the potential choices for you to pick for your product.
