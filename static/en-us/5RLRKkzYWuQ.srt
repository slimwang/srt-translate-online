00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Let me back up a step further,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
and let's look at supervised learning more generally.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Our example so far was one of classification.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
The characteristic of classifcation is

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
that the target labels or the target class is discrete.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
In our case it was actually binary.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
In many problems, we try to predict a continuous quantity.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
For example, in the interval 0 to 1 or perhaps a real number.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Those machine learning problems are called regression problems.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Regression problems are fundamentally different from classification problems.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
For example, our Bayes network doesn't afford us an answer

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
to a problem where the target value could be at 0,1.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
A regression problem, for example, would be one to

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
predict the weather tomorrow.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Temperature is a continuous value. Our Bayes Network would not be able

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
to predict the temperature, it only can predict discrete classes.

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
A regression algorithm is able to give us a continuous prediction

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
about the temperature tomorrow.

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
So let's look at the regression next.

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
So here's my first quiz for you on regression.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:18,000
This scatter plot shows for Berkeley California for a period of time

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
the data for each house that was sold.

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Each dot is a sold house.

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
It graphs the size of the house in square feet

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
to the sales price in thousands of dollars.

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
As you can see, roughly speaking,

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
as the size of the house goes up,

28
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
so does the sales price.

29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I wonder, for a house of about 2500 square feet,

30
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
what is the approximate sales price you would assume

31
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
based just on the scatter plot data?

32
00:01:52,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Is it 400k, 600k, 800k, or 1000k?
