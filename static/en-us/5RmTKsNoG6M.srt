1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,504
We've seen what search can do for
problem solving.

2
00:00:02,504 --> 00:00:06,887
It can find the lowest cost path
to a goal and it can do that in

3
00:00:06,887 --> 00:00:11,277
a way in which we never generate
more paths than we have to.

4
00:00:11,276 --> 00:00:14,246
We can find the optimal number
of paths to generate and

5
00:00:14,246 --> 00:00:17,481
we can do that with a heuristic
function that we generate on

6
00:00:17,481 --> 00:00:20,770
our own by relaxing the existing
problem definition.

7
00:00:20,769 --> 00:00:23,539
But let's be clear on
what search can't do.

8
00:00:23,539 --> 00:00:28,579
All the solutions that we have found
consist of a fixed sequence of actions.

9
00:00:28,579 --> 00:00:32,408
In other words,
the agent here in Arad thinks,

10
00:00:32,408 --> 00:00:35,149
comes up with a plan
that it wants to execute.

11
00:00:35,149 --> 00:00:37,890
And then essentially closes his eyes and

12
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:42,630
starts driving, never considering along
the way if something has gone wrong.

13
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:45,870
And that works fine for
this type of problem, but

14
00:00:45,869 --> 00:00:48,714
it only works when we satisfy
the following conditions.

15
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:53,480
Problem-solving technology works when
the following set of conditions is true.

16
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:57,390
First, the domain must
be fully observable.

17
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:01,079
In other words, we must be able to see
what initial state we start out with.

18
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:04,480
Second, the domain must be known.

19
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:08,500
That is, we have to know the set
of available actions to us.

20
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:10,799
And third, the domain must be discrete.

21
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,349
There must be a finite number
of actions to choose from.

22
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:17,289
Fourth, the domain
must be deterministic.

23
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:20,440
We have to know the result
of taking an action.

24
00:01:20,439 --> 00:01:22,769
And finally, domain must be static.

25
00:01:22,769 --> 00:01:26,390
There must be nothing else in
the world that can change the world

26
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:28,000
except our own actions.

27
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,700
If all these conditions are true,
then we can search for

28
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:33,890
a plan which solves the problem and
is guaranteed to work.

29
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:37,799
In later units, we will see what to do
if any of these conditions fail to hold.
