00:00:00,135 --> 00:00:05,018
Okay, so in this quiz I'm asking you to identify which type of the 4 types

2
00:00:05,018 --> 00:00:10,355
of parallelism we've looked at is represented by which of these algorithms that I've written down here.

3
00:00:10,355 --> 00:00:14,184
So, matrix multiplication, which is multiplying 2 matrices together,

4
00:00:14,184 --> 00:00:20,020
finding faces in a photograph album where I might have hundreds of photographs and I'm trying to find faces in all of them,

5
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:24,003
binary search, finding a number in a list of numbers,

6
00:00:24,003 --> 00:00:27,197
and calling a parallel library from inside of a kernel.
