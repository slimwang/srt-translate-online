1
00:00:00,729 --> 00:00:02,949
Start off your letter by
writing the introduction,

2
00:00:02,948 --> 00:00:06,439
which should include your purpose and
professional mission.

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:09,140
Your cover letter should include
the name of the organization and

4
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:12,030
the title of the position you
are applying to in the first paragraph,

5
00:00:12,029 --> 00:00:14,269
usually the first
sentence of the letter.

6
00:00:14,269 --> 00:00:17,120
This is a small detail
that goes a long way.

7
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:19,839
It helps the hiring manager's sort
through the amount of applications they

8
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:20,839
receive.

9
00:00:20,839 --> 00:00:23,344
And helps the reader automatically
connect you in the job.

10
00:00:23,344 --> 00:00:26,591
If you know someone in the company,
don't be afraid to ask them to refer

11
00:00:26,591 --> 00:00:30,279
you, you can mention their name
in the first paragraph too.

12
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:33,990
You should focus less on why
the company should want you and

13
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:36,469
focus more on why you want the company.

14
00:00:36,469 --> 00:00:40,879
This is vital on helping you stand
out among other job candidates.

15
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:43,240
If most applicants to
the job are qualified for

16
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:46,289
it, it means they all probably
have a similar set of skills.

17
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:49,810
Your statement of interest is
personal and unique to you.

18
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:54,520
The best employees are the ones who
are excited about the company, so

19
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:57,240
communicate that excitement and
be specific.

20
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:00,969
Here are a couple examples of how
to write your professional purpose.

21
00:01:00,969 --> 00:01:03,210
If you're interested in
applying to Udacity.

22
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:08,159
A strong statement could be I am a self
taught web-developer eager to use my

23
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,359
five years of experience to
support the next major revolution

24
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:12,280
in online education.

25
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:17,569
Or if you are interested in applying
to a job within an accounting company,

26
00:01:17,569 --> 00:01:18,818
this phrase could be more appropriate.

27
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:23,380
I am a passionate data analyst
fascinated by the opportunities created

28
00:01:23,379 --> 00:01:25,259
by the abundance of available data and

29
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:28,270
the computing power in
the modern accounting industry.

30
00:01:28,269 --> 00:01:30,549
All jobs in companies are different, so

31
00:01:30,549 --> 00:01:32,509
you need to take a different
approach to all of them.
