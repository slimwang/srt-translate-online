00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,232
Here's one last simplification that I want to show you. Again, there's multiple

2
00:00:04,232 --> 00:00:08,192
ways to do that type of problem. So, I'm going to show you two, and you choose

3
00:00:08,192 --> 00:00:12,238
what you prefer. In the first way, I'm going to start outside the parenthesis

4
00:00:12,238 --> 00:00:16,315
and take care of this negative exponent. I do the reciprocal of the entire

5
00:00:16,315 --> 00:00:20,650
inside parenthesis to get 1 over 3a to the 4th, b to the negative 3 squared.

6
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:26,797
Next, I square each factor in the parenthesis. 1 squared is 1. 3 squared is 9. A

7
00:00:26,797 --> 00:00:31,617
to the 4th squared is a to the 8th. And b to the negative 3 squared is b to the

8
00:00:31,617 --> 00:00:36,179
negative 6. Finally, we move b to the negative 6 to the numerator for our final

9
00:00:36,179 --> 00:00:40,629
result. The second way of doing this problem is starting inside the parentheses.

10
00:00:40,629 --> 00:00:44,777
We can move any negative exponents to the denominator. So I have 3a to the 4th

11
00:00:44,777 --> 00:00:49,241
divided by b cubed, and then all of this is raised to the negative 2. We have a

12
00:00:49,241 --> 00:00:53,499
fraction that's a base raised to a negative exponent. So we take the reciprocal

13
00:00:53,499 --> 00:00:58,036
of this entire fraction and change the exponent to be positive. Finally, b cubed

14
00:00:58,036 --> 00:01:02,273
squared is b to the 6, 3 squared is 9, and a to the 4 squared is a to the 8th.

15
00:01:02,273 --> 00:01:06,480
Here's our anwer. Both of these results are the same. So we know our work is

16
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:10,755
correct. In the first case, i started with a negative exponent here. Then I

17
00:01:10,755 --> 00:01:15,385
handled the negative exponent on the inside. For the second case, I handled this

18
00:01:15,385 --> 00:01:19,740
negative exponent on the inside first, then I did the negative exponent on the

19
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:23,772
outside. You'll have to move terms around either way you do it, just get

20
00:01:23,772 --> 00:01:25,293
comfortable with one way.
