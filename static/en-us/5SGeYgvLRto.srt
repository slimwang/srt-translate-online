00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,811
>> The least common multiple of 2 and 3 is 6. So we know that that's still going

2
00:00:04,811 --> 00:00:09,775
to need to be the denominator of our combined fraction. To change the fraction x

3
00:00:09,775 --> 00:00:14,695
over 2 to have a denominator of 6 instead, we need to multiply it by 1 in the

4
00:00:14,695 --> 00:00:19,455
form of 3 over 3, since 2 times 3 is 6. For x over 3, we need to multiply it by

5
00:00:19,455 --> 00:00:23,884
2 over 2. If this step was tricky for you at all, please go back and review

6
00:00:23,884 --> 00:00:28,646
fractions again. It's never too late to do some extra practice. Carrying out

7
00:00:28,646 --> 00:00:33,488
this multiplication gives us this. And then we just need to combine like terms.

8
00:00:33,488 --> 00:00:35,525
We end up with 5 x over 6 equals 4.
