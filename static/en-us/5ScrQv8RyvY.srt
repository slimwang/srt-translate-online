1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,272
Let's go through this exercise one more time,

2
00:00:02,272 --> 00:00:08,544
this time using the Fermi GPUs that are installed in the Amazon clusters that Udacity is running on.

3
00:00:08,544 --> 00:00:12,598
I'll put the device query information in the supplementary material,

4
00:00:12,598 --> 00:00:15,485
and you should look through that and answer the questions again.
