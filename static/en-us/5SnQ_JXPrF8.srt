00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:04,320
In this video, I've built
a sample app that has geofences

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:06,770
around the studios that I'm filming in.

3
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:10,000
As you build out your app, you'll likely
want to use a different geofence.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,850
As we've explained earlier, a geofence
uses latitude and longitude and

5
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:19,080
an easy way to find the lat long for
any location is to use Google Maps.

6
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,680
You can either look at the URL when
you are in a particular location, and

7
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:26,520
pull the latitude and longitude from
them, or if you prefer, you can drop

8
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:31,280
a pin and then you can see the latitude
and longitude in the pop-up.

9
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,370
Note that it also depends
on your zoom level.

10
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:36,610
So, here I zoomed into the the top
secret military base at Area 51 and

11
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:40,620
you can see it can actually get
the latitude and longitude for

12
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:42,080
the baseball field there.

13
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,510
That must be where
the aliens play baseball.

14
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:47,470
Or if they're more the tennis type,
I can drop the pin here and

15
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:50,660
then get the latitude and
longitude for the tennis courts.

16
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:52,750
Yes, believe it or not,
there's a baseball field and

17
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:54,100
tennis courts in area 51.

18
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:58,080
Now if you prefer to go to
a slightly less secret place,

19
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:02,120
you can zoom in on anywhere you like,
for example the Google campus.

20
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,660
And here I'll find the latitude and

21
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:08,390
longitude of my favorite coffee shop,
which is right here in this building.

22
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:10,420
There's the latitude and longitude.

23
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:11,300
So it's up to you.

24
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:15,110
You can find locations wherever you like
on Google Maps, and like I said you can

25
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:19,770
either look at the URL, as you can see
here, to get the latitude and longitude,

26
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:22,930
or you can drop the pen and the latitude
and longitude will be presented to you.
