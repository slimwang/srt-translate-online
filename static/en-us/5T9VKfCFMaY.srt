As you may have noticed from the graph, this graph is symmetric about the

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:09,238
y-axis, and is therefore an even function. As a review, if the function was

3
00:00:09,238 --> 00:00:15,300
symmetric about the origin, it would be an odd function. An example of an odd

4
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:20,712
function would be f of x equals x cubed. Here is what the graph looks like.
