00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:02,170
Now imagine that this yellow sheet of

2
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:05,640
paper is the Python Standard Library. Imagine that

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:12,070
this is what we got when we downloaded Python. Inside Python is a file named

4
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:17,150
webbrowser. And inside webbrowser is a function

5
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:20,470
called open. Now this is the function that

6
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:23,088
allowed us to play the YouTube video.

7
00:00:23,088 --> 00:00:25,780
Much like webbrowser, there is another file or

8
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:28,920
module inside the Python Standard Library. It's

9
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,300
called time, and time has several functions

10
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:37,980
defined inside of it. Two of them are, ctime which gives you the current time,

11
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:42,490
and sleep, which suspends program animation for

12
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:45,610
a little bit. Now here's a thought, how

13
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:49,060
does function sleep actually suspends or pauses

14
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:51,750
program flow for a given number of seconds?

15
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:53,360
We don't really know how it does that behind

16
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,180
the scenes. In much the same way, how does

17
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:58,832
function open, opens up a webbrowser to play a

18
00:00:58,832 --> 00:01:02,080
YouTube video for us? We don't quite know how it

19
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:06,040
does that behind the scenes also. That detail is

20
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:09,540
hidden from us, and this hiding of detail in programming

21
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:13,020
is called abstraction. Now this idea of abstraction is

22
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:17,020
a really powerful one in programming, because it allows us

23
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:19,790
to focus on the program that we actually want to write which

24
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:22,980
is the take a break program, and it empowers us to use

25
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:25,260
these functions simply by reading their

26
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:27,840
documentation. So lets read some documentation

27
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,300
now and see if these functions actually exist in the Python Standard Library.
