Blurring is an image processing effect. So most of the work is done by the

2
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:07,560
fragment shader. The vertex shader is the only one that can move vertex

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:11,670
positions. So is the one that can change an object's shape. Evaluating an

4
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:15,770
illumination model can be done on the vertex or pixel level. So both shaders

5
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:19,610
can do this work. Gouraud interpolation itself is done in the rasterization

6
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:22,350
stage. So neither shader does anything along these lines.
