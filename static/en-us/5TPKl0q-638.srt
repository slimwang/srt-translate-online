1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:05,388
We have a total degrees of freedom and likewise we have a total variation. This

2
00:00:05,388 --> 00:00:10,430
is also the sum of the sum of squares for between and within group variability.

3
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:14,910
This is the total sum of squares that we mentioned earlier. Each value, minus

4
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:20,354
the grand mean squared and then sum them up. Basically what ANOVA does is

5
00:00:20,354 --> 00:00:24,644
partition the total variation into between group variation and within group

6
00:00:24,644 --> 00:00:29,855
variation. Difference is in the dependent variable or treatment are due to both

7
00:00:29,855 --> 00:00:35,614
between group differences and individual differences within each group. This

8
00:00:35,614 --> 00:00:39,518
means that only some of the variation can be explained by knowing which group

9
00:00:39,518 --> 00:00:43,830
is subject is in and the rest is unexplained variants.
