1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,804
In all the cases before, we've been adding like radicals together. And in a

2
00:00:03,804 --> 00:00:06,684
couple of the cases, we couldn't even combine the radicals, because the

3
00:00:06,684 --> 00:00:11,320
radicands were different. Sometimes radicals will appear to be different, but

4
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:15,306
they're actually alike. We can simplify these radicals to determine whether or

5
00:00:15,306 --> 00:00:19,380
not we can add or subtract them together. For example, we can split up the

6
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:23,846
square root of 20 into 4 times 5. Then, we can split this radical up into two

7
00:00:23,846 --> 00:00:28,877
separate radicals, using our product rule. We do the same thing for 80 and for

8
00:00:28,877 --> 00:00:32,452
500. Notice that when I split up 80, I split it up into the largest perfect

9
00:00:32,452 --> 00:00:37,449
square. And the same is true for 500. 100 is the largest perfect square that

10
00:00:37,449 --> 00:00:41,978
goes into 500. This allows me to simplify the radicals more quickly. Now that

11
00:00:41,978 --> 00:00:45,878
we have some perfect squares, we can simplify them. The square root of 4 equals

12
00:00:45,878 --> 00:00:51,750
2, the square of 16 equals 4, and the square root of 100 equals 10. We multiply

13
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:56,772
the remaining factors in front of our radical to get 16 root 5, 12 root 5, and

14
00:00:56,772 --> 00:01:02,148
negative 20 root 5. Notice how we were able to simplify each of these radicals

15
00:01:02,148 --> 00:01:06,276
to radicals that all have a square root of 5. Because these radicals are

16
00:01:06,276 --> 00:01:10,530
identical, we can add and subtract them. We'll have 16 plus 12 minus 20, which

17
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:15,691
equals 8 times the square root of 5. This is why we learn how to simplify

18
00:01:15,691 --> 00:01:19,585
radicals first, because even though these radicals don't appear to be like, we

19
00:01:19,585 --> 00:01:23,223
can simplify them and then combine them.
