1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
And, yes, the answer is 0.108.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Technically, what this really means is the probability of a positive test result--

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
that's the area in the circle that I just marked.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 99:59:59,999
By virtue of what we learned last, it's just the sum of two things over here, which gives us 0.108.
