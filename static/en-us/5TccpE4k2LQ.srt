00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,070
Now let's do a quiz on the benefits

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:05,835
of branch prediction. Let's say we have the classical

3
00:00:05,835 --> 00:00:09,290
5-stage pipeline. The fetch, decode, execute, memory and

4
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:13,287
write. The branch is fully resolved in the execute,

5
00:00:13,287 --> 00:00:16,239
the third stage. Fully resolved means that we

6
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:18,930
finally know the correct PC from which we should

7
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:22,300
fetch the next instruction. In this processor, we

8
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:25,720
fetch nothing until we are sure what to fetch,

9
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:31,590
and we execute many many iterations of this loop. We add minus one to R1,

10
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:37,880
we add R2 to itself, and then we branch if R1 is not equal zero back to

11
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:43,470
the loop. The question for you what is the speed up over this achieve if we

12
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:46,420
had perfect predictor? Meaning for after every instruction

13
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:49,090
fetched we know which one should be fetched next.
