1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:04,502
People with post traumatic stress disorder or PTSD experience many intrusive

2
00:00:04,502 --> 00:00:10,241
symptoms that last at least one month. These include things such as recurring

3
00:00:10,241 --> 00:00:15,521
intrusive thoughts, feelings or memories of the traumatic event. This can

4
00:00:15,521 --> 00:00:19,996
happen while awake or while dreaming. A person may experience flashbacks, which

5
00:00:19,996 --> 00:00:24,484
are vivid reactions that a person feels when they're experiencing the traumatic

6
00:00:24,484 --> 00:00:30,558
event over and over again. People with PTSD are easily startled, with hair

7
00:00:30,558 --> 00:00:37,337
trigger tempers. They may also be reckless or self-destructive. PTSD can occur

8
00:00:37,337 --> 00:00:43,410
in both children and adults. And as we discussed in lesson six, many veterans

9
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:49,515
experience PTSD. In fact, some research shows that approximately 24% of war

10
00:00:49,515 --> 00:00:55,225
veterans will experience PTSD. These veterans are also at greater risk of

11
00:00:55,225 --> 00:01:01,273
developing major depression, drug abuse and suicide after returning home. The

12
00:01:01,273 --> 00:01:05,604
death and despair of war induced PTSD is seen in a suicide note from an Iraq

13
00:01:05,604 --> 00:01:12,230
war veteran. In 2007, Daniel Somers was diagnosed with a traumatic brain

14
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:16,853
injury, post-traumatic stress disorder, Gulf War Syndrome, fibromyalgia, and a

15
00:01:16,853 --> 00:01:22,206
host of other medical problems. He sought treatment through therapy,

16
00:01:22,206 --> 00:01:27,592
medication, music and film production. But eventually took his own life June

17
00:01:27,592 --> 00:01:32,348
10th, 2013. He left behind a powerful suicide note. Here's part of what it

18
00:01:32,348 --> 00:01:37,934
said. All day, every day a screaming agony in every nerve ending in my body. It

19
00:01:37,934 --> 00:01:41,886
is nothing short of torture. My mind is a wasteland filled with visions of

20
00:01:41,886 --> 00:01:46,955
incredible horror, unceasing depression and crippling anxiety. Thankfully there

21
00:01:46,955 --> 00:01:50,489
are treatments available for PTSD which we're going to talk about in our next

22
00:01:50,489 --> 00:01:51,809
lesson.
