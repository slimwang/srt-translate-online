1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:04,600
First, each fragment must not share
a common fragment identification number.

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:07,810
This is false because each
fragment of the same IP packet

3
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:10,380
must share the same
identification number.

4
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:13,280
Second, each fragment must
say what it's place or

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,680
offset it is in the original
unfragmented packet.

6
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,630
This is true because
otherwise we cannot correctly

7
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:23,210
reassemble the fragments
into the original IP packet.

8
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:26,520
Third, each fragment must tell
the length of the data carried

9
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:27,520
in the fragment.

10
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:28,500
This is true.

11
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:34,130
Again, this has the correct assembly of
the fragments into the original packet.

12
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:37,510
Fourth, the fragment does not need
to know whether more fragments

13
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:38,830
follow this one.

14
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:40,030
This is false.

15
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:44,080
Because each fragment must know whether
there are more fragments to follow.

16
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:48,870
Again, this information is necessary for
correct reassembly of the fragments.
