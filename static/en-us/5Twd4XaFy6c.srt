00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,370
First I need to add this
code to the main.html file.

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:05,980
Here's the main file, so
I'll add the code right here.

3
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:08,270
Now whatever I type shows
up in the name tag.

4
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:10,270
How quick and easy it was that?

5
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:11,360
Typing in my name and

6
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:15,320
checking these check boxes
dynamically updates the name tag.

7
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:17,535
You're seeing several Angular
concepts at work here,

8
00:00:17,535 --> 00:00:21,120
two-way data binding,
directives, scopes.

9
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:24,150
All of these come together to form
a dynamic and interactive app.

10
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:25,743
Let's look at how these
concepts fit together.
