1
00:00:00,173 --> 00:00:02,622
So, after we have done
feature detection,

2
00:00:02,622 --> 00:00:06,208
let's talk about matching images
that have similar features.

3
00:00:06,208 --> 00:00:09,225
Again, something we have done before
when we talked about panoramas.

4
00:00:09,225 --> 00:00:12,585
Remember, most of the pipeline of
this is similar to what we did for

5
00:00:12,585 --> 00:00:16,665
panoramas, except in this time around,
we're not interested in putting those

6
00:00:16,665 --> 00:00:19,435
images together in creating
a seamless larger image.

7
00:00:19,435 --> 00:00:22,547
We just want to be able to model,
which images have similar content, so

8
00:00:22,547 --> 00:00:24,668
we can say that they're
related to each other.

9
00:00:24,668 --> 00:00:26,847
So for example,
I look at these features.

10
00:00:26,847 --> 00:00:28,597
I basically say, okay, this image and

11
00:00:28,597 --> 00:00:30,781
this two images have
something in feature.

12
00:00:30,781 --> 00:00:33,843
We basically create a connection
between them and we do this for

13
00:00:33,843 --> 00:00:36,055
each image with
relationship to each other.

14
00:00:36,055 --> 00:00:39,174
And basically, create a graph structure,
which basically says,

15
00:00:39,174 --> 00:00:42,138
this image is common with this,
this image is common with this.

16
00:00:42,138 --> 00:00:45,652
So, in essence, what we do is take
one image, find the features and

17
00:00:45,652 --> 00:00:49,303
match it with another image and
do this across for the whole database.

18
00:00:49,303 --> 00:00:53,989
Yes, it takes computational time, but
this is something valuable for us to do.

19
00:00:53,989 --> 00:00:57,840
And again, one of the contributions
of the original Photosynth paper was

20
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,703
a piece of software, the Bundler,

21
00:00:59,703 --> 00:01:03,258
which is available from their site
that does it quite efficiently.

22
00:01:03,258 --> 00:01:07,500
Now you may remember one of the ways of
doing this kind of matching that we have

23
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,898
talked about before and that was using
RANSAC random sampling and consensus.

24
00:01:11,898 --> 00:01:15,575
Again, allows us to match different
types of images together based on

25
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:17,145
features that are within it.

26
00:01:17,145 --> 00:01:21,118
And uses that to find images that are
well, similar and closer to each other.

27
00:01:21,118 --> 00:01:23,566
This is what we use for
doing again, matching and

28
00:01:23,566 --> 00:01:26,562
then using that to generate
a pattern same technique.

29
00:01:26,562 --> 00:01:29,813
But in this instance, what we're
really interested in is finding out,

30
00:01:29,813 --> 00:01:32,818
which images are related to each
other in a parallelized fashion.

31
00:01:32,818 --> 00:01:33,561
And again,

32
00:01:33,561 --> 00:01:37,731
something we know we can do quite
well if we have all of these tools.

33
00:01:37,731 --> 00:01:40,954
This is a similar process to what,
of course, we talked about when

34
00:01:40,954 --> 00:01:44,526
we talked about using recognizing
panoramas, which basically said is,

35
00:01:44,526 --> 00:01:47,135
if I took a bunch of pictures,
that were not in order.

36
00:01:47,135 --> 00:01:50,752
If I threw them into a process,
can they figure out which pictures will

37
00:01:50,752 --> 00:01:53,955
actually use, be used to create
a panorama and which won't.

38
00:01:53,955 --> 00:01:55,310
Same process applied here.
