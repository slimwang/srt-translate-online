1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,820
So here is a representation of the restaurant script. Here is the name of

2
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:07,750
the script, restaurant, and the six elements that we talked about earlier.

3
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:11,430
Track, props, roles, entry, result and scenes. So

4
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:16,180
this particular track refers to formal dining. Here are the props, tables, menu,

5
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:20,590
check, money, food and place. And for food and place we can use symbols. These

6
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:23,640
symbols can be used as variables. So where I may different kinds of foods and

7
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,370
different kinds of places in a restaurant. Here are the rules, so

8
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:32,710
S is a customer, W is a waiter, C is a cook, M is a cashier, O is an owner and

9
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:37,350
so on. The entry conditions are S is hungry, S as the member is a customer,

10
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:41,640
S has money and those conditions are that S has less money. S is not hungry.

11
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,530
S is pleased. But O has more money. And scenes, well,

12
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:49,520
let's discuss them in the next slide. Here is a representation of scene one.

13
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,640
We'll call it the entering scene. This particular scene consists of

14
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:58,640
several events. So in the first frame, the customer S, S stands for

15
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,800
the customer. Moves himself or herself. So S is moving himself or

16
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:07,970
herself to some restaurant, some place P. And the second frame,

17
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:12,814
the agent S, the customer Sees some table. So this frame,

18
00:01:12,814 --> 00:01:17,840
the customer S decides to, take an action. The particular action is, where this

19
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:23,320
agent S this customer S moves. Customer S himself or herself to the table.

20
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:27,210
So this is a walking action going on. Let us continue another set just a little

21
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:32,169
bit longer. So now S is moving his own body into a sitting position. Here,

22
00:01:32,169 --> 00:01:34,996
the waiter sees the customer, and now the waiter moves himself to the customer.

23
00:01:34,996 --> 00:01:41,490
And now the waiter moves the menu, to the customer. And

24
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:45,760
this completes a representation of the first scene of entering in a restaurant.

25
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:49,280
One can imagine many more scenes. The next scene might be a way to customer

26
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,100
orders food. The third thing might be the way the waiter brings food, and so

27
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:56,520
on and so forth. And then the last thing is the customer pays the bill and

28
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:00,840
then walks out. This is a stereotypical notion of a script.

29
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,950
Your notion of a script, might be slightly different depending on what kinds of

30
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:06,780
restaurants that you go to. In different cultures, the script for

31
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:09,889
going to a restaurant might be quite different. The point here is that

32
00:02:09,889 --> 00:02:14,440
the script is capturing in a knowledge representation, what is known about

33
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:17,620
the stereotypical situation of going to a restaurant of a particular kind.
