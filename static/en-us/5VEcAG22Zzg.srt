00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:04,830
And this, this leaves us with our final collaboration diagram which has all

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:06,220
the messages going on.

3
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:11,030
Now it's busy the diagram, the diagram has a lot in it, but

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:19,830
it captures at least for this exercise what we expect of the system.

5
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:21,720
In terms of the classes that are involved and

6
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:25,720
the messages passing force path, passing back and forth amongst them.
