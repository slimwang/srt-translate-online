1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
And the answer is C.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
The derivative of a quadratic function is a linear function.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Which would look about like this.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
And as we go outside, our gradient becomes larger and larger.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 99:59:59,999
This over here is much steeper than this curve over here.
