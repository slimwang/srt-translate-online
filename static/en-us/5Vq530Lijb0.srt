00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:02,500
Okay, let's talk about Tabular Data. You're

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:06,530
probably familiar with spreadsheet applications like Microsoft Office's

3
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:10,480
Excel, or Calc from Apache OpenOffice, or

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:13,090
even Google Spreadsheets. So with any one of

5
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:16,059
these applications. We can create tabular data

6
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:18,170
in the form of spreadsheet. So I'm a

7
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:21,060
big Beatles' fan, indulge me as we begin

8
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:25,070
a little data wrangling with some discography data.

9
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:27,460
After all, I'm sure even space cowboys

10
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:30,380
will be listening to Beatles' someday. Okay,

11
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:32,800
so as data scientist were usually concern

12
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,910
with what items a dataset contains and what

13
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:39,860
fields. Those items have. As I'm sure

14
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:44,430
you're aware, with tabular data, each row represents

15
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:51,324
a data item. And, an individual item can have one or more fields. The columns

16
00:00:51,324 --> 00:00:57,610
each represent a different field. And in most tabular data, the very first row

17
00:00:57,610 --> 00:01:00,010
will actually label those fields in some

18
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:04,440
way. Finally, we have an individual cell

19
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:10,700
that contains a value for a particular field. In this case the label for

20
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:16,340
this particular album is capital records in Canada. Okay so just to look at that

21
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:24,390
again in a more abstract sense. Each row is an item in our data set. Each column

22
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:30,080
makes up the fields for the data items. And finally, individual values for a

23
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:34,060
field are stored in cells. In the videos

24
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:36,560
that follow, we'll quickly get our hands study

25
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,520
working with tabular data in the CSV and

26
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,690
Excel data formats in the Python programming language.
