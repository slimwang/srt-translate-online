1
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:06,590
So in the build your portfolio,
the first thing that you're looking for

2
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:12,769
is the design of the page itself and so
we want the DOM tree to correctly present

3
00:00:12,769 --> 00:00:18,720
the page content elements there.
We want to see use of symmetric tags

4
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,760
wherever appropriate and
that there is a grid and

5
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:27,390
basic layout used in your markup.

6
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:31,600
So I guess I would start with
the first part of this which says

7
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:35,860
the DOM tree correctly presented and
provided. Ops! 

8
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:38,840
Sorry. Provided...

9
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:41,900
the DOM tree correctly present the page content.

10
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:45,300
So what is DOM tree, Poornima?

11
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:49,670
>> So it's essentially,
a document object model is nothing but

12
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:57,760
an in-memory representation of
your HTML page provided to you.

13
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,340
So what it is.

14
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:01,120
It's like a tree structure and

15
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:05,480
it arranges all these HTML
elements hierarchically.

16
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,735
So that's what it's doing and.

17
00:01:07,735 --> 00:01:14,485
I could actually show you guys
how you can represent a dom tree.

18
00:01:14,485 --> 00:01:15,765
So if you see.

19
00:01:15,765 --> 00:01:18,315
I have a very basic HTML document.

20
00:01:18,315 --> 00:01:20,985
A HTML document that has a head.

21
00:01:20,985 --> 00:01:24,435
And the head has a title
followed by the body.

22
00:01:24,435 --> 00:01:25,835
Which has nothing essentially.

23
00:01:25,835 --> 00:01:26,575
For now.

24
00:01:26,575 --> 00:01:29,265
And then I close the HTML tag.

25
00:01:29,265 --> 00:01:34,560
So how do I represent this
code in the form of a tree?

26
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,610
So what you do is you have the root
followed by the parents, and

27
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:41,490
the siblings, and its child.

28
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:48,750
So the HTML is the root element in
the DOM tree followed by two siblings.

29
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:53,620
So two children sorry,
which is the head and the body.

30
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:56,230
So these are essentially siblings,
the head and

31
00:01:56,230 --> 00:02:01,050
the body are siblings they
are the child off the HTML element.

32
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:06,435
And then followed by the head has
another child which is the title and

33
00:02:06,435 --> 00:02:12,305
then the title has a string that is the lead
>> The title of the page.

34
00:02:12,305 --> 00:02:12,995
>> Yeah the title of the page.

35
00:02:12,995 --> 00:02:16,955
And then the body just has 
a string called tag

36
00:02:16,955 --> 00:02:19,195
which is the body.

37
00:02:19,195 --> 00:02:22,565
So as you can see this is
how the DOM tree is formed.

38
00:02:22,565 --> 00:02:23,065
So.

39
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:27,180
However if you represent your page.

40
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:30,890
If you code in your HTML document and
then draw,

41
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:32,770
Make a DOM tree out of it.

42
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:34,990
It should, both of them
should make sense so.

43
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:36,520
>> Yes.
>> You should be able to map

44
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,680
the DOM tree to a

45
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,445
>> HTML document.

46
00:02:38,445 --> 00:02:39,580
>> Mm-hm.
And then map

47
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:42,120
the html document to the DOM tree.

48
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:46,420
So we need that to be appropriate
that's what we mean by the first part.

49
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:50,683
Moving onto the next part

50
00:02:50,683 --> 00:02:56,100
It says base element used use
semantic tags where appropriate and

51
00:02:56,100 --> 00:03:01,870
this also gets covered little bit
in your... In the associated class.

52
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:02,760
>> That's right.

53
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,970
>> But.

54
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:06,160
>> Definitely look up semantic tags.

55
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,410
What are semantic tags?

56
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:09,910
What are non-semantic tags?

57
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:15,398
And have a equal, healthy mix of both.

58
00:03:15,398 --> 00:03:18,420
Definitely they're wherever
required if you feel like you

59
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:20,960
need to make use of semantic tags.

60
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,988
Go ahead and do it.

61
00:03:21,988 --> 00:03:26,050
Non-semantic tags are just-
>> It's fast.

62
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:29,920
>> Yeah.
So somethings, so your div is just

63
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:35,380
creating an invisible box around
the content that you put inside your div.

64
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:39,330
So that goes as a non-semantic element.

65
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:43,460
Whereas your header
footer your articles.

66
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:45,580
All of them are similar caption.

67
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:46,180
>> Yeah.

68
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:48,650
>> Because they exactly
represent what element you

69
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:52,870
are going to be putting into your file.

70
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:54,528
>> So those are semantic tags.

71
00:03:54,528 --> 00:03:55,375
>> [CROSSTALK] So.

72
00:03:55,375 --> 00:03:58,340
P tag may just tell
you it's a paragraph.

73
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:01,160
But say you're adding
a caption to your figure.

74
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:06,220
You would want to have a
figcaption tag which is semantic.

75
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:07,275
It's adding meaning.

76
00:04:07,275 --> 00:04:09,236
>> [CROSSTALK] yeah.
>> To what you are

77
00:04:09,236 --> 00:04:10,580
>> To what you are written and

78
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:12,260
It's easier for human to read.

79
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:12,940
>> Exactly.

80
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:18,110
>> And it's only for where appropriate
It's not where we ask you to completely

81
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:24,830
code your page with semantic tags we
do need an equal that makes very like,

82
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:28,910
It's something that something that
is appropriate for your HTML page.

83
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:29,410
So yeah.

84
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,510
And the design uses a grid
based lay out principles and

85
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:37,390
this again can be a grid
that you build on.

86
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:39,700
You don't necessarily
have to use Bootstrap.

87
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:42,480
Although using Bootstrap is going
to make your life so much easier.

88
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,320
>> Very convenient.

89
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:48,030
And you'll learn more about
framework as you go through the but

90
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:51,398
very just most of the times
just the early phase here.

91
00:04:51,398 --> 00:04:53,060
>> That's true.

92
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:55,690
But if you do want to get practice
it just loading up your own,

93
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:56,820
go ahead and do that.

94
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,880
We also check for responsiveness.

95
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,910
With the build a portfolio website and
very responsive, we just.

96
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:14,040
What responsiveness stands for
is being able to view your page

97
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:18,620
in a usable manner On
different types of devices.

98
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:19,940
The ones we check for

99
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:22,940
is a small screen device in
the form of the Google Nexus 5.

100
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:26,740
A tablet, we check it on an iPad.

101
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:29,150
And a general laptop.

102
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:33,286
so there and
again you want to add tags in

103
00:05:33,286 --> 00:05:39,370
appropriate width at which you want
to change the layout of your pages.

104
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:46,250
In, in your project, but
a very easy way to visualize

105
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:51,380
what things would look like is by using
developer tools on your Google Chrome.

106
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:53,696
And the way to access, and

107
00:05:53,696 --> 00:05:58,658
we're going to share my screen,
I guess, [CROSSTALK].

108
00:05:58,658 --> 00:06:01,198
>> So
I have my rubric opened right now, and

109
00:06:01,198 --> 00:06:04,920
let's check out Udacitys responsiveness.

110
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,240
So you want to go to that hamburger bar.

111
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:10,240
Yeah.
And then what I do is I go to more tools

112
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,930
and click on developer tools.

113
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:16,740
It's taking a while but it's there.

114
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:20,925
So if you Instead, instead of using the
mouse, you want to use your keyboard.

115
00:06:20,925 --> 00:06:22,770
>> Mm-hm
>> On a Mac you would go with

116
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:24,315
command shift and I together.

117
00:06:24,315 --> 00:06:26,500
>> Mm-hm
>> And on Windows, or,

118
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,420
I believe,-
>> Control.

119
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:31,285
>> Even on Linux you would go with
control shift and i together.

120
00:06:31,285 --> 00:06:31,990
>> Mm-hm, yeah.

121
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:32,490
And then.

122
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:35,300
As you can see,
you can see a lot of tabs opening up.

123
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:39,450
Oops, that shows a lot of code and
console logs.

124
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:40,310
But let's see.

125
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:41,960
Okay, so.

126
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:45,880
Do you see this little, mobile device.

127
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,110
I'm going to click that.

128
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:51,520
So what it does is it
automatically changed.

129
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,240
You know, and
your screen size have to move the.

130
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:58,400
Yeah.
And As you can see the device tab shows

131
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,770
you all of the devices that
you can check your page with.

132
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:04,270
So I'm going to check
the Google nexus five.

133
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:07,270
And then what I'm going to do is,
it's showing me an error that says,

134
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:10,760
you may have to reload your page for

135
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:13,890
proper user agents, so
I am going to reload this page.

136
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:18,570
Oops, okay.

137
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:23,410
>> And that's the way you're
going to see it on a mobile?

138
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:24,040
>> Yeah.
>> And then.

139
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:30,540
I'm going to shift to an Apple
iPad device and see how it is.

140
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:33,320
I like this view better [LAUGH]
>> [LAUGH]

141
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,390
>> So yeah, I'm going to reload it

142
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:34,970
again.

143
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:38,670
Just to see how it's
rendering on an iPad.

144
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:41,400
And yeah this is how it
looks on an iPad so and.

145
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:47,080
It's as easy as this to actually
use the Google developer tools

146
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:51,340
to actually view your responsiveness
of your website and I think.

147
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:54,250
All the developers all
the course developers,

148
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:59,130
all of the coaches believe that start
designing for smaller devices first.

149
00:07:59,130 --> 00:07:59,800
Yes.
>> And

150
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:03,670
then go up, to tablets and desktops.

151
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:08,750
So, always think about smaller devices,
when you are with the coding and

152
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:09,570
your web page.

153
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:12,420
>> There are more things we check for

154
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:15,890
in the first of which is
separation of concerns.

155
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:20,290
And by that we mean we want to check
whether you have completely separated

156
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:24,860
your style, which is CSS,
from the structure, or the HTML.

157
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:29,680
And we want to do this, honestly,
to just avoid confusion.

158
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:34,230
You want to have that separation
between style and structure.

159
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,080
And moving forward you learned that.

160
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,025
It's an industry standard.

161
00:08:39,025 --> 00:08:40,360
>> Mm-hm
>> You do that?

162
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,058
So.
>> That's right.

163
00:08:42,058 --> 00:08:44,140
>> You want to add
anything to that, Poornima?

164
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:45,245
>> No.
It's perfect.

165
00:08:45,245 --> 00:08:47,700
>> [LAUGH]
>> Yeah It's good enough.

166
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:48,980
And it's very straight forward.

167
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:51,010
And the rubric.

168
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:55,830
So your structure is your HTML and
your style is your CSS.

169
00:08:55,830 --> 00:09:00,425
So yeah just make sure they are in
different files, and they don't get mixed.

170
00:09:00,425 --> 00:09:01,030
>> Hm-mm.

171
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:04,410
>> Mixed.
I know that there are a lot of ways to

172
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:07,260
actually put in CSS
inside your HTML just

173
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:09,420
by adding your style tags-
>> Style, mm-hm.

174
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:14,270
>> Or your script tags for your
Java Script inside your head element.

175
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:20,390
And that's not usually a best practice
because you are reading CSS format

176
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:25,920
code at the beginning and then you
shift to HTML.

177
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,040
All of a sudden.

178
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:27,905
And it's just like,

179
00:09:27,905 --> 00:09:34,080
to see it's not very pleasant it's
not a very properly organized.

180
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:38,500
And that's all we want you to
separate it into different files and

181
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:43,300
remember to have like a hierarchy in
your directories that you create.

182
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:47,270
So have a CSS directory
where all your CSS files go.

183
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:50,700
Right now for this project
you might have only one CSS.

184
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:55,750
And one HTML file and no JavaScript
files, but it all is always,

185
00:09:55,750 --> 00:10:00,140
always cleaner to see code
which is properly structured.

186
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:03,190
So you have CSS folders
and CSS files go in there

187
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:07,130
JS folders, JS files go in there. Images

188
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:12,040
Folder where your images go in and
then in your root directory you have

189
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:16,350
only your index.html or
whatever you name it as.

190
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:25,150
>> I guess the biggest chunk of both
this project is the good quality.

191
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:32,200
And what we check is whether the code
passes HTML and CSS validators,

192
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:38,410
and is formatted in a way as
stated by the CSS style guide.

193
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:45,350
And basically the style guide was
developed based on industry standards.

194
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:48,110
So we want you to get
started with good habits.

195
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,250
>> Most of the rules on that style
guide are pretty straight forward.

196
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:56,120
There are some things which
are very important and

197
00:10:56,120 --> 00:11:00,000
which you might not understand
while getting started.

198
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,400
It's very difficult to detect those.

199
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:07,250
So I guess we would get started
with telling them how to

200
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:12,080
detect these sort of
mistakes in their code.

201
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:15,400
And these are formatting
mistakes nothing logical, right?

202
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:19,040
Your code might work fine, might render
great on the web page because it's

203
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,440
very smart, web pages are very smart.

204
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,720
They can [CROSSTALK] The main character.

205
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,040
>> [CROSSTALK] Typo, yeah.

206
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:28,116
>> They can render with mistakes,
like even if you don't close tags or

207
00:11:28,116 --> 00:11:30,990
some sometimes they would render right.

208
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:37,080
But there is a lot of things that
are missing in your formatting style in,

209
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,880
that might be uncaught sometimes and
that's.

210
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,580
I can understand that that.

211
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:43,470
Totally happens to all of us and.

212
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:44,380
>> Yeah.

213
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:48,030
>> It's these rules help us understand,
you know,

214
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:50,190
where we can do better in writing code.
