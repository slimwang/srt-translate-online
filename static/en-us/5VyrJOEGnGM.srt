1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,740
So now that we have seen that GShare can

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:06,490
do some qualitative branches that PShare cannot do, but on

3
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:09,940
the hand PShare can do things with shorter history that

4
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:13,620
require GShare to have more of a history. The question

5
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:15,550
is if we need to choose one, which one

6
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:19,278
should we choose in our processor? Many earlier processors would

7
00:00:19,278 --> 00:00:23,018
choose either GShare or PShare, but very quickly people figured

8
00:00:23,018 --> 00:00:26,000
out. That you really want to have both of them.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,670
You want to have a GShare so that you

10
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:31,436
can do correlated branches. And you want to do

11
00:00:31,436 --> 00:00:34,316
PShare because it does better figuring out those self

12
00:00:34,316 --> 00:00:37,290
similar branches, even if it has a shorter history.
