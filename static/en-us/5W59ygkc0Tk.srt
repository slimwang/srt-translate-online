00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:04,250
I guess it gave a very, when it says
it's still not very popular, of course,

2
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:07,670
a lot of people not
interested in buying it.

3
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:09,900
There are a variety of reasons actually.

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:15,050
People who are selling cyber
insurance have too may exclusions.

5
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:17,350
It's not really worth the cost.

6
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:18,270
You pay for it and

7
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:22,060
when you need it they say this this
is excluded and things like that.

8
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:25,970
So people are interested in insurance
when they think it's a good value for

9
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:28,310
them, which means there are not
too many exclusions and

10
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:32,360
the cost is low, and those things don't
hold when it comes to cyber insurance.

11
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:35,910
So not very popular not a lot of
people are actually asking for

12
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:37,780
it and buying it actually.

13
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:41,200
So that's what this link has
more information about it.

14
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,440
You should read it.
