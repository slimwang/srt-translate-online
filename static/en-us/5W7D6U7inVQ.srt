00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Excellent work! You've just completed your first tough question

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
on filling out the charts for parsing.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Because parsing is everywhere in the computing world--

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
from HTML to E-mail,

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
to languages like JavaScript or Python

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
or C and C++--

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
this notion of memoizing--

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
writing down intermediate results so that we can refer to them--

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
is critical to performance; and because parsing happens all the time,

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
this performance really matters.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Now these are some of the first questions

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
to really stretch our ability to do abstract reasoning,

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
so don't worry if it's taken you a few more trials on these exercises

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
than it may have in the past.

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
On the other hand, we should definitely be excited

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
about the goal that we're working towards.

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Very soon, we're going to have a complete parser

18
00:00:42,000 --> 99:59:59,999
for HTML and JavaScript.
