1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,700
Now, as you might have guessed,
the data isn't really pristine.

2
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:09,070
So, here's what people think
financial data is like.

3
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:13,400
They imagine that it's perfectly
recorded minute by minute.

4
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:17,088
The prices that are recorded
are exactly right.

5
00:00:17,088 --> 00:00:20,617
The volume data is exactly right.

6
00:00:20,617 --> 00:00:23,540
But that's not the case.

7
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:26,240
But that's not the only mistake
[LAUGH] people make about

8
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,320
what they think the data's like.

9
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,580
People assume there's
no gaps in the data,

10
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:33,290
that we have every
single minute recorded.

11
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:37,090
That data for stocks started
since the beginning of time, and

12
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:39,340
they continue to the very last minute.

13
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:45,078
The reality is that our data is
an amalgamation created from many,

14
00:00:45,078 --> 00:00:46,175
many sources.

15
00:00:46,175 --> 00:00:49,093
For instance, for any particular stock,

16
00:00:49,093 --> 00:00:54,037
it may be traded on the New York Stock
Exchange, at NASDAQ, at Bats, and

17
00:00:54,037 --> 00:00:57,037
over any particular
minute during the day,

18
00:00:57,037 --> 00:01:02,414
it may trade at one price at New York
Stock Exchange, another price at NASDAQ.

19
00:01:02,414 --> 00:01:05,114
The reality is that there's
no single price for

20
00:01:05,114 --> 00:01:07,120
any stock at any particular time.

21
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,500
In fact, it's hard to say who's right.

22
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:12,870
So, the reality of the data that
we get is that it's a combination

23
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:14,750
from all these different sources.

24
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:19,020
And different data providers will
provide, actually, different numbers.

25
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:23,680
And finally, one part of reality
that's especially troublesome

26
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,940
is not all stocks trade everyday.

27
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:30,680
Sometimes stocks come into existence and
suddenly, there's values for them and

28
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,740
before that there was no data.

29
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:36,050
Sometimes stocks go out of existence and
suddenly,

30
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:38,975
they quit existing and
there's no data for them going forward.

31
00:01:38,975 --> 00:01:42,030
There's another kind of failure mode or

32
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:46,570
missing data mode where
a particular stock will be trading,

33
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:49,050
data will be missing, suddenly,
it starts trading again.

34
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:53,100
And these are the sorts of problems
we're going to take a look at and

35
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:55,180
find a way to solve in this lesson.
