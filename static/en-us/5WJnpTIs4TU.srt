00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Our next question was about external APIâs

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
and relying on them and the dangers and pit falls of that.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
For example, for Hipmunk, you parse Amtrak's website

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and what if they redesign that, how screwed are you?

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Sure. Well, itâs true.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
If Amtrak changes their website, our parsing of Amtrak also

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
breaks and thatâs basically how it goes.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Itâs not really a big deal, thatâs just kind the way it goes.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
The harder decision you have to make there is how you want to

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
actually parse the website for websites that don't have an API

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
or websites whose API is so bad, youâd rather just script the HTML.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
You can do it by hand. I showed you some regular expression examples in the lecture.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Those work if the website isn't changing very often.

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Basically whatever works--parsing HTML is really tough because HTML is often invalid

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
and malformed and all those sort of issues, so basically play whatever works and--

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Yeah. >>And-- >>Just do what you can.

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Yeah. Things break and then you fix on them and thatâs how it goes. >>Okay. Great.
