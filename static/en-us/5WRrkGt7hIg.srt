1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,180
Next in our scenario, the modem wraps the packet in

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:06,090
the appropriate link layer frame and passes it on to the

3
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:09,220
wide area network. The packet will then make several hops across

4
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:12,330
the Internet. In each phase, the IP packet will be wrapped

5
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:15,740
in a link layer and sent on. A routing table

6
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:18,530
will be consulted to figure out where the packet should go

7
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:21,250
to next, and then the packet will be wrapped up again

8
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:25,090
in the appropriate link layer protocol before being sent along again.

9
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:28,720
Eventually the data will reach the Udacity site. Udacity will

10
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,070
say, of course I'm happy to establish a TCP connection.

11
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:34,280
So, it will send an acknowledgement. And my question to

12
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:38,000
you is, what is the destination port for this acknowledgment packet.
