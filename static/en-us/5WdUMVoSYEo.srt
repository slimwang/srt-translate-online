>> It holds true. It's invariant okay so yeah, we're going to say that

2
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:17,062
there's an invariant over the book class, that we, we now want to express, okay?

3
00:00:17,062 --> 00:00:23,050
Now one. one, one thing to realize is,

4
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:28,910
just like when, in drawing the diagram, there's never only one correct answer.

5
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:34,260
And so we could if we wished have for the the check-out operation,

6
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:39,630
we could have postcondition there which says that that, that this is true.

7
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:44,760
And do it that way but it ma, makes more sense in

8
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:48,750
situations where something is always true, so you have an invariant for it
