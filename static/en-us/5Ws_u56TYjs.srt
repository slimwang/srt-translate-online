1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,450
So here's how we're going to build our descriptor.

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:04,920
We're going to build a feature vector.

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:08,050
So there's going to be some vector of some length.

4
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:13,010
Okay, and it's going to be based essentially upon properties of

5
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:16,270
the histograms of gradients, all right.

6
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:19,190
So what I'm showing you here is, this is a, a nice picture nomolist,

7
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:23,280
this is pretending that we've got a little grid of 8 by 8 pixels.

8
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:27,490
I'm only showing 8 by 8 because to show you more, would be, too hard.

9
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:28,130
Okay?

10
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:29,080
And, what we're going to do

11
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:32,659
is we're going to take this histogram of gradients, all right?

12
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:35,400
And we're also going to weight it by a Gaussian.

13
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,832
So sort of this circle that's drawn out here and

14
00:00:37,832 --> 00:00:39,750
then The idea is that we're going to, if,

15
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:43,590
if our center point if located in the middle, we're going to take the gradients

16
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:47,770
in the middle to be weighted more than the gradients toward the outside.

17
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:52,110
So, what we're going to do is we're going to build these little histograms.

18
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:55,460
What we do is we take, say 4 pixels by 4 pixels.

19
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:56,170
Can I count to four?

20
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:57,080
Yes I can.

21
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:02,710
Okay, and we take a little histogram of those orientations and

22
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:04,000
that's done right over here.

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,780
So this thing has sort of eight different dimensions.

24
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:10,720
And then this four pixels here would be.

25
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:11,380
There.

26
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:14,200
Now, I'm only showing this as a two-by-two, right?

27
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,140
One, two.

28
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:16,940
Well, actually, for real sift,

29
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:20,410
they do a four-by-four, two-by-two just shows better.

30
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:24,940
So just to think about that, we have a four-by-four away.

31
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:26,190
That's 4 times 4, that's 16.

32
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:29,380
Each histogram has eight bins.

33
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:31,760
So that's 16 times 8 that's 128.

34
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:34,980
That's 128 numbers, okay?

35
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:39,830
Those 128 numbers, that's the feature vector that we're going to use to

36
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:43,270
describe this this single key point.

37
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:45,720
This is the descriptor that we're going to use.

38
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:49,390
Because you take these 4 by 4.

39
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:50,700
And now I'm going to try to draw them out and

40
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,680
it won't look quite so good, but you'll see what I'm talking about.

41
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,880
Okay, so I have 16 different little histograms.

42
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,620
Because I stacked them up into a feature vector.

43
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:03,330
I don't add them together, I stack them into a feature vector.

44
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:05,950
There is a certain amount of spatial sensitivity, right?

45
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:10,150
The top left hand, let's suppose the top left hand histogram is the first part

46
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:11,510
of the feature vector.

47
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:12,040
Right?

48
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,330
All the way down to the second, the third,

49
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:15,910
the fourth, finally the, the last part on the bottom.

50
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:20,100
So there's a certain amount of sensitivity to the spatial layout, right?

51
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:24,020
So if you've got some orientation of gradient in the top left-hand corner and

52
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:28,220
different on the bottom right-hand corner, you get that spatial layout.

53
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:32,570
But it's not a very strong sensitivity to the spatial layout.

54
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:36,180
Which is good because and that maintains a bunch of our viewpoint invariance.

55
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:39,890
And remember, we have unrotated this thing,

56
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:44,180
with respect to the dominant orientation locally, okay.

57
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:48,420
So our, all of our histograms that are being put down

58
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:51,900
are placed with respect to this normalized orientation and scale.
