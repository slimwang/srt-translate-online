00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,402
Let's get a little more familiar with the Grand mean, and what that really

2
00:00:03,402 --> 00:00:08,548
means. Let's say we have two or more samples, and we find the mean of each

3
00:00:08,548 --> 00:00:14,105
sample. Will the mean of sample means in the case of four samples, the sum of

4
00:00:14,105 --> 00:00:21,131
the sample means divided by 4, be the same as the mean of all values? In each

00:00:21,131 --> 00:00:25,100
sample. Always, sometimes, or never.
