context of Grant's story and about what we've learned about slope in general,

00:00:09,197 --> 00:00:13,875
what does slope mean overall for equations and graphs? Is it the factor by which

4
00:00:13,887 --> 00:00:17,990
y will, will scale as x changes? Is it the ratio of the change in x to the

5
00:00:18,002 --> 00:00:22,645
change in y? Is it the steepness of a line? Or is it the direction a line points

00:00:22,657 --> 00:00:25,232
