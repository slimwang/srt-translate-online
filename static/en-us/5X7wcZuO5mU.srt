1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:02,360
OK so we had a request line that looks something like

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:06,606
this. It is followed by a number of headers. Headers have

3
00:00:06,606 --> 00:00:11,930
this format, Name: space value. Let's add some headers. When you

4
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:14,750
make a request, all of this is sent at once, the request

5
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:17,544
line followed by a number of headers. These aren't the only

6
00:00:17,544 --> 00:00:19,798
headers that are sent but these are some of the more popular

7
00:00:19,798 --> 00:00:22,290
ones. The first one is called Host, and this is from

8
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:25,720
the URL. This is the host part of the URL. It's required

9
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:30,760
in HTTP/1.1. It's not strictly required in 1.0. But why

10
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:34,080
is this useful? We're already connecting to the machine. So

11
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:37,270
why do we need to say what the host is again? It would be like if you came up to

12
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:39,700
me and said, Steve, what is your name? Obviously, you

13
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:42,580
already know my name. So why are you asking? Well,

14
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:46,680
it's because web servers may have multiple names. One, one

15
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:51,150
machine, one web server, can host the website for many websites.

16
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:55,140
For example, with udacity.com, which is hosted on

17
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:57,600
Google's app engine, each of those machines host many

18
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,890
websites. So, we need to say which website we're

19
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:04,360
requesting a document for. The next header, this one

20
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:08,320
is called User-Agent. This describes basically what, who

21
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,270
is making the request. This is generally your browser.

22
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:13,532
Your browser put its name in there and there's

23
00:01:13,532 --> 00:01:16,920
also some, some version info and things like that.

24
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,360
And this is really helpful for the servers so

25
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,140
they know what type of machine is making a request.
