1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,255
So step one is to change
the accepted request class.

2
00:00:03,255 --> 00:00:07,713
Instead of void message with no fields,
we want to take ProfileMiniForm.

3
00:00:07,713 --> 00:00:12,078
Step two is to pass the request
up to the doProfile function.

4
00:00:12,078 --> 00:00:18,092
Now let's save this and run it and
check it out in the APIs Explorer.

5
00:00:18,092 --> 00:00:20,321
Here's the conference API.

6
00:00:20,321 --> 00:00:23,688
If we say save profile,
put a display name in.

7
00:00:23,688 --> 00:00:27,240
Let's say, maybe my name and
a teeShirtSize.

8
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,839
Let's say men's medium,
because that's the size that I wear.

9
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:34,536
Hit Execute and we see the request
going in with these fields and

10
00:00:34,536 --> 00:00:38,525
this time, the response comes back
with the fields returned to us.

11
00:00:38,525 --> 00:00:39,450
It works.
