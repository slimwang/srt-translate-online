00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So let's start out again with an example here. And by example, of course,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I mean a quiz. Actually I mean a triple quiz, because I have 3 questions for you.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
The first one is the size of a minimum vertex cover for this graph here.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:20,000
The second one is the size of the greedy solution. And then finally the size of

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
the solution that would have been produced if we had used the Take 2 algorithm.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So please give me your 3 answers here.
