1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:06,110
Lets revisit specificity and sensitivity, and see how it is calculated.

2
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:12,155
In the language of hypothesis testing we can have the classification problem

3
00:00:12,155 --> 00:00:18,470
expressed as a hypothesis I or class 1, and a hypothesis II as class 2.

4
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:22,270
Often one of the hypothesis is called the null hypothesis and

5
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:24,620
the other the alternate hypothesis.

6
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:30,148
In our example, we can say hypothesis I as the person is B,

7
00:00:30,148 --> 00:00:34,600
and hypothesis II as the person is F.

8
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,830
This is the case of a binary classifier.

9
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:42,980
Now recall, we had two kinds of errors defined.

10
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:46,680
The type 1 error and the type 2 error.

11
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:51,550
The type 2 error is the one minus the the specificity.

12
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:57,630
The model inherently classifies between the two classes or hypothesis.

13
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:00,760
By making a cut or a threshold.

14
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:03,890
In this case, let's put the threshold as 1.5.

15
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:06,710
With this cut, we can

16
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:12,900
calculate the area under the probability distribution of both the hypothesis.

17
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:18,540
If the Type 1 error for given cut or test disket.

18
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:24,930
For a given hypothesis, is less than a pre-determined value called significance,

19
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:28,220
which is expressed as a probability of the classifier,

20
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:30,700
we fail to reject that class.

21
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:36,110
We also claim that as failing to reject the null hypothesis.

22
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:39,670
We also define the power of the test as 1

23
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:43,650
minus the sensitivity of the type 2 error.

24
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:46,480
Now notice the sensitivity and

25
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:52,420
the specificity is dependent on the threshold or the cut determined here.

26
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:57,330
If we move this around, the values for sensitivity and specificity.

27
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:58,320
With change.

28
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,360
You can guess now, that we can draw a curve that

29
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:07,840
plots the specificity versus sensitivity for different values of this cut.

30
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:13,030
Such a curve is called a receiver operator characteristic curve.

31
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:18,800
In the following video, we will look at an ROC curve for our classifiers.
