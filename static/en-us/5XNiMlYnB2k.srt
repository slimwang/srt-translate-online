1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,750
The weak version prohibits us from
profiting from technical analysis,

2
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:06,570
because the weak version says that,

3
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:09,990
you can't predict future
prices from past prices.

4
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:12,410
But the weak version didn't say
anything about fundamental or

5
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:13,665
insider information.

6
00:00:13,665 --> 00:00:20,920
Semi-strong prohibits technical
analysis, also fundamental.

7
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:24,880
But it's silent on insider.

8
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,460
And finally the strong
versions says that,

9
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:30,100
you can't profit from any
of those three types.
