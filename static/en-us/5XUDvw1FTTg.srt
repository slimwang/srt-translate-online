Sleep is really important for learning. This is especially true for infants.

2
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:07,352
There's a particular stage of sleep called rapid eye movement sleep that helps

3
00:00:07,352 --> 00:00:11,009
learning the most. This is when your eyes actually move back and forth really,

4
00:00:11,009 --> 00:00:14,565
really quickly. But Greg, why don't you tell em a little bit about that?

5
00:00:14,565 --> 00:00:18,308
>> Sure Lauren. You know, as it turns out, when babies sleep, they spend about 75%

6
00:00:18,308 --> 00:00:22,822
of their time in rapid eye movement sleep. Adults on the other hand are only

7
00:00:22,822 --> 00:00:26,604
spending about 25% of their time in rapid eye movement sleep. Turns out this is

8
00:00:26,604 --> 00:00:31,200
not a coincidence. Because rapid eye movement sleep and brain growth are

9
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:35,514
related. Neuroscientists tell us that rapid eye movement sleep in fact

10
00:00:35,514 --> 00:00:41,190
consolidates or makes stronger the neural growth involved in learning. So,

11
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:44,490
babies' brains, because they're growing more, are spending more time in rapid

12
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:46,090
eye movement sleep.
