1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,570
The idea is that if you have a signal,

2
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:07,190
the signal has as its building blocks these sinusoids.

3
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:10,960
And if you add enough of them, you could get whatever component you want.

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,780
So here we're adding up different,

5
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:16,030
this is, this was our target, these are the elements that we're adding.

6
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:17,470
We're going to show this more in a minute.

7
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:19,890
And this is the function that we're building up.

8
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:21,860
So before we look at that more carefully,

9
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:26,240
how many degrees of freedom are there in this signal, right here, okay?

10
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,640
There are three degrees of freedom.

11
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:28,620
What are they?

12
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:32,009
Well a here is just going to be the amplitude, that's going to be a scale,

13
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:32,600
all right?

14
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,910
And then there are these two numbers, omega and phi.

15
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:40,420
And omega is what's referred to as the frequency, and phi is the phase.

16
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:43,120
So which of these is most important?

17
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:47,400
Which of these encodes the, the notion of a coarse signal versus a fine signal?

18
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:50,350
Well it's going to be this one, the frequency.

19
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:51,700
All right? So as you change that frequency,

20
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:54,960
as that number gets bigger, essentially the thing wiggles more quickly.
