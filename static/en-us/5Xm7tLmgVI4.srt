00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,404
Now that you have an idea about the difference between what and, and or denote

2
00:00:03,404 --> 00:00:06,974
with inequalities. I'd like you to match each of these number lines on the left

3
00:00:06,974 --> 00:00:10,667
with the compound inequality that it represents. These are definitely a little

4
00:00:10,667 --> 00:00:14,247
bit tricky. And I know that or is kind of a new concept for us. But just give it

5
00:00:14,247 --> 00:00:17,727
a try. Start with the ones that you're sure about. And then move onto the ones

6
00:00:17,727 --> 00:00:19,596
that you're not totally positive about.
