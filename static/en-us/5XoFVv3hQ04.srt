1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The answer is 8.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,000
The easy way to see that is to observe that 15 is 3 * 5.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
That's a composite number that can be broken down into two primes.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Then if we look at the numbers from 1 to 14--

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
these are all the positive integers less than n--

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
we want to figure out how many of these are relatively prime.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
The multiples of 3 are not. You can cross all those out.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
true for the multiples of 5 as well.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The multiples of 5 are not.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
That leaves us with eight numbers.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
This works in general. If we know that n is the product of two primes.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Then we could compute φ(n).

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It's the number of integers less than n,

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
which is also pq - 1. That would be all the integers.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Then we subtract out all the multiples of p that are less than n.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Since n is pq, there are q - 1 of those.

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Then we want to subtract all the multiples of q less than n,

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
which is again pq, so there are p - 1 of those.

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
If we do the algebra, we get pq - (p + q) +1,

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
which we could also write as (p -1)(q - 1).

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Since p and q are prime--and this property depended on q being prime.

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Otherwise, some of these multiples might have collided.

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Since they are prime, we know they didn't.

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
That means that we know that φ(n) is equal φ(p)φ(q).

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
This is going to turn out very useful for RSA.

26
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
The reason for that is if we know the factors of n,

27
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
we have an easy way to compute the value of φ(n).

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
But if we don't know the values of p and q,

29
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
it appears to be hard to compute the value of φ(pq).

30
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
That's the crux of what the security of RSA relies on,

31
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
and we'll talk more about that later.

32
00:01:57,000 --> 99:59:59,999
For now we're still focused on correctness.
