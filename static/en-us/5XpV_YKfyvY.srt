Now that we've looked at factoring perfect square trinomials, let's look at the

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:09,060
difference of squares. If ever I have the difference of 2 squares, I can factor

3
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:13,782
it as a plus b, times a minus b. This factoring pattern is really helpful, and

4
00:00:13,782 --> 00:00:17,763
we'll see it throughout the course. So let's focus on this difference of squares

5
00:00:17,763 --> 00:00:23,767
and see if you can factor a couple examples. Try factoring 49x squared times 4.

00:00:23,768 --> 00:00:26,263
What do you think are the two factors we need?
