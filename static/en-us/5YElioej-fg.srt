1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:02,390
By the way, this also happens in time.

2
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:07,130
Have you ever watched a video where an airplane propeller is starting to go?

3
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:10,868
And then all of a sudden st, you start to kind of see it's spinning backwards,

4
00:00:10,868 --> 00:00:13,450
and then you see it spinning forwards.

5
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:16,670
Okay, airplane propellers don't spin backwards.

6
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:17,980
They only go forwards.

7
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:19,130
So what's going on there?

8
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:23,260
Oh, and by the way, I hope you know that if you were actually standing out on

9
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:26,800
the tarmac, watching the airplane, you wouldn't see this phenomenon.

10
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:30,890
The reason you're seeing this phenomena is that this was recorded on

11
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:31,760
either video or

12
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:36,450
film that was taking a picture every so often, and that's what's displayed here.

13
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:41,960
Imagine we have this wheel that's turning this amount each time.

14
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,590
So if you track the dot,

15
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:49,530
you can see that the thing is turning almost 90 degrees at every rotation.

16
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:52,070
But, if that dot wasn't there,

17
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:57,110
you would actually see this thing going backwards just a little bit.

18
00:00:57,110 --> 00:01:01,750
Because of the fact that you couldn't tell which one of those cross patterns was

19
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:05,540
which, and so you would see it rotating backwards, okay?

20
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:08,080
And that's aliasing in the temporal domain.

21
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,260
We'll, we'll talk about that in a minute in the spatial domain.

22
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:13,730
And essentially, the thing is moving too fast for how often you're

23
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:17,270
sampling a time for you to actually be able to tell what's going on.

24
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:22,350
The high frequency and the low frequency can't be distinguished.

25
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:24,750
To show you a simple example in an artificial image,

26
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:26,280
we'll see some natural ones later.

27
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,230
Here we have a rendering, and

28
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:31,720
as this checkerboard gets further away from you in the distance, right?

29
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:35,070
It's supposed to start getting thinner and thinner and closer and closer.

30
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:39,880
And you'll notice, that somewhere right around here, it starts to break up.

31
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,650
It's not looking like a checkerboard look.

32
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:43,870
In fact, look at this nonsense, right?

33
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:46,310
It's like low frequency all over again.

34
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:47,090
What's going on?

35
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:49,910
Well, we can look at that in MATLAB, all right?

36
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:51,730
Suppose we have this input signal.

37
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:54,460
Okay, this is like that chirp that I was showing you before.

38
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:57,890
Well, we can plot this as an image in MATLAB, and

39
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:00,250
that would look like this, okay?

40
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:02,760
So here I'm just doing the x from zero to five by 0.05, and

41
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:08,460
I'm, I did this image of sine of 2 to the x times x, all right?

42
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:10,180
And, what you're seeing is, so

43
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:13,990
it starts off a slow frequency, and then it's getting higher and

44
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:17,190
higher and, eventually, you start to see stuff that looks like that.

45
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:19,130
So what's going on there?

46
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:20,460
Well, that's aliasing.

47
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:21,980
There are not enough pixels in the,

48
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:25,620
in the plot for you to be able to see what's going on.

49
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:30,340
And that's illustrated down here, where we have a small number of samples,

50
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:34,950
a not dense enough sampling, in order to recover those frequencies.
