00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:03,596
What you just saw, was almost a recreation of the Solomon Asch study, a really

2
00:00:03,596 --> 00:00:07,822
famous social psychology study on conformity. What they did was they showed

3
00:00:07,822 --> 00:00:10,990
their participants a standard line, and then had them compare it to three other

4
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:16,270
lines, kind of like the one I showed you. They had them do this about 18 times.

5
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:19,042
Now, this was a relatively easy task, when the independent variable wasn't

6
00:00:19,042 --> 00:00:24,730
manipulated. People messed up less than 1% of the time. However, when the

7
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:30,480
independent variable was manipulated, people messed up about 37% of the time.

8
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,010
So, what was the independent variable. Well, it was the people that were in the

9
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:38,271
room saying the response is allowed. Out of all of the people in the room there

10
00:00:38,271 --> 00:00:42,330
was only one real participant. The rest of the people were confederates.

11
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:45,398
Meaning they worked for the research team, but they appeared to be real

12
00:00:45,398 --> 00:00:50,133
participants. After a while of answering these questions, the researchers had

13
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:55,290
the confederates, incorrectly answer the question, on purpose. Because they

14
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:58,140
wanted to see if hearing these five or six people answer the question

15
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:03,064
incorrectly, would actually sway the participants' response. And well, as it

16
00:01:03,064 --> 00:01:06,370
turns out, it did. Let's go to Susan for some more details.
