00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:04,059
Dragging the map around updates
the URL to a new location.

2
00:00:04,059 --> 00:00:08,520
This maintains application state and
lets you get back to this specific view.

00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:11,920
Google Maps uses a standard template
to display the current location's

00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:12,470
information.

00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:16,970
Changing the location just updates
the sections of the template.

6
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:19,650
Events fire when you drag the map
around, click somewhere, and

00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:21,200
with a whole bunch of
other interactions.
