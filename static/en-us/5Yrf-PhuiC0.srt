1
00:00:00,241 --> 00:00:02,037
And we would do just like before, we take the

2
00:00:02,037 --> 00:00:05,270
value from above, plus the two left ones. So one,

3
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:07,982
two plus one is three, three plus two plus one is

4
00:00:07,982 --> 00:00:14,092
six, two, three and two with seven, six, three

5
00:00:14,092 --> 00:00:16,000
and one.
