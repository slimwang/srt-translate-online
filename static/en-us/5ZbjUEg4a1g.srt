00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:02,630
In this video, I'll show you how to install R

2
00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:06,025
and R Studio. To get started you want to go to

3
00:00:06,025 --> 00:00:10,460
cran.rstudio.com. And then you'll click on the link to download

4
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:14,560
R for Windows. If you never installed the R programming language

5
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:17,030
before, then click on this first link. Since it's your

6
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:20,380
first time downloading it. Now depending on your version of Windows,

7
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:22,920
you might need to see the frequently asked questions. I'm

8
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,460
set for my computer, so I'm going to go ahead and download

9
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:28,610
R for Windows. I get a warning message and

10
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:31,120
I want to keep the file. Now this might take

11
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:34,090
some time to download, so just be patient. Then

12
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:38,200
you want to open the file, and then run the program.

13
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,970
A set up wizard should appear and now you

14
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:42,260
just want to walk through all the steps. I'll set

15
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:45,790
my language, and then I'll just continue installing by

16
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:51,530
hitting next. I'm just going to accept the defaults here and

17
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:54,860
then install it to R. I'll leave these as is,

18
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:58,010
so that way a desktop icon will be created. And

19
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:01,890
it's going along. Great. Now I'm finished with my setup.

20
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:04,420
So that was just part one of the installation process.

21
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:07,210
That just gave us the programming language R. Now we

22
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:10,990
need to go and install RStudio. RStudio is a graphical

23
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:14,630
user interface for programming in R. It's basically a point

24
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:17,120
and click system that lets us work with data really easily.

25
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:21,460
So first let's just go to download now to get RStudio.

26
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:24,170
We're going to get RStudio for our desktop. So just click this first

27
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:27,220
button. Now there's going to be a lot of links here, and you

28
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:29,700
really just want this first link. It's going to be the version of

29
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:34,150
RStudio that's recommended for your computer, and for your operating system.

30
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:37,740
Notice how this one's for Windows XP, Vista, Windows 7, or Windows

31
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:41,240
8, so I'll click on that, and then I'll keep the file.

32
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,580
And you can see it downloading in the bottom left corner, here.

33
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:45,890
It looks like it's ready, so I'm going to

34
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:49,540
open this up. I'll then install RStudio into this path.

35
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:56,730
And create a Start Menu folder as well. Great. I'm done. And this is

36
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:59,180
what RStudio looks like. Now yours might

37
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:01,300
look slightly different than mine and that might

38
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:04,610
be because the file's open. So if I go to File > New File

39
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:09,639
> RScript this opens a basic RScript which allows me to start programming in R.
