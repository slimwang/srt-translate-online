1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,490
Now, in addition to recording
feedback on what to improve, we've

2
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:07,689
been recording feedback on what parts
of our app really resonate with users.

3
00:00:07,689 --> 00:00:11,060
This feedback is really vital to share
in a presentation on your prototype.

4
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:13,740
It will be one of your greatest assets.

5
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:16,300
Nothing shows that your concept
resonates with users quite like

6
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:20,290
hearing or seeing one of them be
excited when using your prototype.

7
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:22,760
Because of this,
it can be a good idea to get video or

8
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:25,550
audio recordings of your
user testing sessions.

9
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:27,650
The one rule is to always,

10
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:31,410
always, always get permission
from your subjects first.

11
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:35,030
We've said it before, and
its really vital that you do this.

12
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:38,110
Ask before you record and
ask every user.

13
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:40,940
What you need is a media release
form that covers research use and

14
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:42,038
presentation use.

15
00:00:42,038 --> 00:00:43,450
This is a thing you should look for

16
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:46,710
online and then customize and
run by a lawyer before you use it.

17
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:50,500
Over the course of a few
iterations of user testing,

18
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:54,830
you should be able to find some users
who absolutely adore your design.

19
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:58,320
If not, you may need to iterate more
before you're ready to demo your app.
