1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,010
So the idea here, if something
goes wrong, then this is useful.

2
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:06,121
This one says, maybe nothing
goes wrong when there is a TCB,

3
00:00:06,121 --> 00:00:08,989
when we're talking about
the trusted computing base.

4
00:00:08,989 --> 00:00:13,604
The second option says, yes,
it is relevant because TCB only

5
00:00:13,604 --> 00:00:17,789
provides high assurance and
not a 100% guarantee.

6
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:20,541
If you think about these two options,

7
00:00:20,541 --> 00:00:25,962
we said TCB is also a system that is
fairly complex for a variety of reasons.

8
00:00:25,962 --> 00:00:30,632
We're going to do our best and use the
design principals and do other thing for

9
00:00:30,632 --> 00:00:33,462
analysis and so on,
but it's trustworthy.

10
00:00:33,462 --> 00:00:35,436
It's not 100% secure.

11
00:00:35,436 --> 00:00:38,454
So basically,
it gives us this high assurance, but

12
00:00:38,454 --> 00:00:40,381
something could still go wrong.

13
00:00:40,381 --> 00:00:43,284
It helps to have this design principle.

14
00:00:43,284 --> 00:00:45,036
So if something can go wrong,

15
00:00:45,036 --> 00:00:49,112
even if it's a small likelihood,
having this proves it's useful.

16
00:00:49,112 --> 00:00:53,743
So I think, the idea here is that you
can't assume just because we have

17
00:00:53,743 --> 00:00:58,390
the word trusted computed base in TCB,
that it is guaranteed secure.
