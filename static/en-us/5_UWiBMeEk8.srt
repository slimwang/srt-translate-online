1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
A sensible estimate would be E times the ratio of the first to the difference.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Let's look at why that is the case.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
We know that for the forward Euler's method, the global truncation error that this kind of error

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
depends on the step size in almost the linear fashion.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
This error that I am looking for here is the GTE for h1.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
We see that E, the error between the two numerical solutions, appears here.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:38,000
So now there's two similar triangles. The first one is here and the second one is here.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Let's look at the following ratio error/h1. This has to equal E/h2-h1,

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:58,000
and hence, the error is equal to E*h1 times up divided by the difference.

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm writing an equal sign here but of course that's just a rough estimate.

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
This dependance is not strictly linear and we're assuming

12
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
that these three points are almost on a line.

13
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
This may not be perfect in practice.
