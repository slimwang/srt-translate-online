00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,580
Our eyes naturally follow patterns when we look at things.

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:04,900
We usually start in the top left,

3
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:09,560
and then we'll look from left to right, and then top to bottom.

4
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:13,010
Traditional print media takes advantage of the patterns our eyes follow, and so

5
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:14,220
do websites.

6
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:15,510
For instance, with our website here,

7
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:18,210
we have the title at the top because we want the title to

8
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:21,160
be the first thing that people see when they click on our website.

9
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:24,970
After they get past the title, they'll move down and at the left we have images.

10
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:26,680
These images are here to capture attention,

11
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:28,230
because people will look at the images first.

12
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:30,650
Then they'll see the headline.

13
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:33,800
And then once they read the headline, they'll go down to the text below it.

14
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:37,080
This type of design follows what we call a grid based layout, and

15
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:40,700
in fact many if not all websites, follow a grid based layout.

16
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:42,290
Here we are on the Udacity course's page.

17
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:45,410
It's pretty easy to pick out the grid on this page.

18
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:46,660
We can see that there's a main column on

19
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:49,890
the left that's broken into smaller grids, and then on the right,

20
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:53,310
we have this large column that's broken into smaller grids.

21
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:57,040
In fact, we can keep breaking it down into smaller and smaller grids.

22
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:00,110
Other websites like the New York Times do the same thing.

23
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:03,070
It's pretty easy to see how the New York Times is broken into grids.

24
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:06,020
And we can keep going breaking it into smaller and smaller pieces of the grid.

25
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:09,190
Next time you're on a website, try to break it apart into grids.

26
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:10,550
You'll be surprised how easy it is.
