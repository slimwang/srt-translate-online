1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,380
So for this quiz we're going to actually
derive a third Bellman equation

2
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:06,550
in addition to the V equation
that we talked about and

3
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:08,150
the Q equation which
we just talked about.

4
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:12,010
We're going to derive an equation,
we'll call it C, because we want to

5
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:14,360
make sure the front of the alphabet
gets a little bit of love.

6
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:20,380
So, just as Q here stands for this part
of the equation, starting from the R,

7
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:24,430
and V captures this part of
the equation starting from the max.

8
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:27,320
We want to express an equation
that starts essentially from where

9
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:28,210
the gamma is.

10
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:31,630
And so I've written four choices
that you can select among.

11
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:32,409
>> Okay, I think I got it.

12
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:35,040
So we're just doing the same thing we
did when you did that little clever

13
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,570
trick to derive Q.

14
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:40,700
We're going to do the same thing
by moving one step down this lot.

15
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:41,370
>> Exactly, yes.

16
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:41,940
>> Okay.

17
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:46,950
>> So we have b of s, and q of sa,
and we c of, I don't know, something.

18
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:47,990
>> So wait, wait here.

19
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:50,680
I don't think I can answer this question
until I get something resolved.

20
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,940
So the v stands for value.

21
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:55,900
The Q stands for quality so
the C stands for.

22
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:56,780
>> Quantity!

23
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:57,570
No, that's not right.

24
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:58,960
It stands for continuation.

25
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,520
The idea was introduced in a paper
by Tom Dietrich where he showed

26
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:07,100
that sometimes if the reward function
is really complicated it can help to to

27
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:10,280
derive, or re express the Bellman
equation in this form where the reward

28
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:13,590
gets left off and we only observe
the reward later in the flow.

29
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:16,132
So it has a little bit of usage, but
at the moment it's just to try and

30
00:01:16,132 --> 00:01:18,808
get you to play around a little bit
with this idea of capturing different

31
00:01:18,808 --> 00:01:20,050
quantities as it goes by.

32
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:23,330
>> Okay, I think that's a hint,
and I think I'm ready.

33
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:23,830
>> Go.
