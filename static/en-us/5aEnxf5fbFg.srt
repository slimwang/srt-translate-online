1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,420
All right, so now that we
have a notion of contraction.

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:07,510
We should apply a contraction to our
favorite friend the Bellman operator.

3
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:08,870
>> I do not use contractions.

4
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:12,260
>> Oh, I see what you did there.

5
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:14,410
>> Thank you.
>> My spouse is an obstetrician, and so

6
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:16,210
sometimes she worries about
contractions as well.

7
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:18,680
>> I think we could probably do this for
an hour.

8
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:19,890
>> Let's say we contract it.

9
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:22,630
Nicely done.

10
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:23,850
So good.

11
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:26,610
So right, we want to apply this
notion of a contraction mapping

12
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:27,520
to the Bellman operator.

13
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:32,520
In other words, we want to show
that if we have a Q function Q and

14
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,360
we apply the Bellman operator to it.

15
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,310
Then, well in particular,
if we have 2 Q functions, Q1 and

16
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:42,290
Q2, the distance between them.

17
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:45,540
After applying the Bellman
operator is less than or

18
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:48,380
equal to gamma times
the distance before we apply it.

19
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:51,090
So by applying it we move these
two Q functions closer together.

20
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:53,600
Sure.
>> All right, so

21
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,830
the first thing we're going to do is
unpack the definition of the max norm.

22
00:00:57,830 --> 00:00:59,870
And so in this case,
in the case of Q functions.

23
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:04,510
What that really means is we're going to
maximize, over all state-action pairs.

24
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:08,178
The Q value of each of those
state-action pairs' difference and

25
00:01:08,178 --> 00:01:09,190
absolute value.

26
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:13,280
And that leaves us in a good position
to be able to unpack the definition of

27
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,380
the Bellman operator itself over these
two different Q functions Q1 and Q2.

28
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:23,180
So all I did here is substitute
it in for the Bellman operator.

29
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:25,382
The definition of the Bellman
operator as it's written up here.

30
00:01:25,382 --> 00:01:26,222
>> Mm-hm.

31
00:01:26,222 --> 00:01:30,646
>> Alright, since we're computing
the difference between Q values for

32
00:01:30,646 --> 00:01:32,320
the same state action pair.

33
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,490
They're going to have the same reward
and then they're only going to differ

34
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:40,765
really in the value of
the resulting state.

35
00:01:40,765 --> 00:01:42,820
>> Mm-hm.

36
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:44,960
>> So
we can cancel out these two rewards.

37
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,500
We can actually factor together
these gammas and summations,

38
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,400
which are the same in both cases.

39
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:53,180
And we get down to the maximum
difference over all the state

40
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:53,850
action pairs.

41
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:56,980
Or the absolute difference
between the discounted

42
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:58,710
expected value of the next state.

43
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:02,440
And the value of
the next state being for

44
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:06,844
Q1 the max over all actions of
the values of state s prime

45
00:02:06,844 --> 00:02:10,680
at Q1 and for Q2
>> The maximum over reactions

46
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:13,560
of the values at state s prime for Q2.

47
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,160
>> Oh, because you can.

48
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,960
>> So
why can't we just keep factoring it?

49
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,140
Yeah.

50
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:19,590
>> because they're different a primes.

51
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:20,150
>> Right.

52
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:25,650
>> So do you see why I didn't
go one more step here and

53
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:27,280
actually combine these
two maxes together.

54
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,000
Even though we combined
these two sums together?

55
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:31,370
>> Yeah, because,

56
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:36,040
even though you wrote a prime both
times, they're two different a primes.

57
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,400
>> Right, right.
So this is the action that maximizes

58
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,210
the q value for Q1.

59
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:42,120
And this is the action that
maximizes the q value for Q2, and

60
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,810
they may have different max actions.

61
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:46,920
>> Right, even though they
both end up in this prime.

62
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,850
>> They start in s prime.

63
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:49,640
That's right.

64
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,690
>> Well, they start in s and
they end up in s prime.

65
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:53,660
>> And then we're choosing
the action in s prime.

66
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:54,280
>> That's right.

67
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,320
Okay, yeah, that makes sense.
