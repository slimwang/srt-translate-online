1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:04,350
These are the correct answers, great work if you found those two. For the first

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:07,500
one, we want to start by multiplying our numbers together, and our variables

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:12,358
together. We'll have 20 times 2, which equals 40, x to the 5th times x squared

4
00:00:12,358 --> 00:00:18,760
which x to the 7th. The y squared times y to the 4th, which y to the 6th. Since

5
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:23,525
under a cube root, we want to find factors that appear three times. We can

6
00:00:23,525 --> 00:00:28,582
split up 40 into 8 times 5 since the cubed root of 8 equals 2. We have to leave

7
00:00:28,582 --> 00:00:32,828
the 5 inside of our cube root since this factor doesn't appear 3 times. It's

8
00:00:32,828 --> 00:00:36,234
not a perfect cube. Finally we deal with our variables by using power divided

9
00:00:36,234 --> 00:00:41,730
by root. 7 divided by 3 is 2 remainder 1, so we'll have x squared on the

10
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:47,389
outside and x to the 1 on the inside. The cubed root of y to the 6th, is just 6

11
00:00:47,389 --> 00:00:52,485
divided by 3, so y squared comes out. This gives us our final result, I hope

12
00:00:52,485 --> 00:00:56,390
you found it. For the second one, we want to start by distributing 3 root 2 to

13
00:00:56,390 --> 00:01:02,390
each of these radical terms. Pull out 3 root 2 times root 18, and 3 root 2

14
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:08,506
times negative 2 root 6. For the first term we'll multiply these two radicals

15
00:01:08,506 --> 00:01:13,484
together to get 3 root 36. For our second term, we'll multiply 3 times negative

16
00:01:13,484 --> 00:01:19,820
2, which equals negative 6, and root 2 times 6, which equals root 12. The

17
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:22,322
square root of 36 equals 6, and then we can break down the square root of 12

18
00:01:22,322 --> 00:01:27,349
into the square root of 4 times 3. We simplify further, by multiplying 3 times

19
00:01:27,349 --> 00:01:32,210
6, which is 18, and then we take the square root of 4, which is 2. We multiply

20
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:37,370
these two numbers together to give us our final answer, 18 minus 12 root 3.

21
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:39,703
Nice work if you found that one as well.
