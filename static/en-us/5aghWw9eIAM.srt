00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,010
So here's the solution to this quiz in case you had any problems.

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,190
The first thing you have to do is import the sklearn regression module.

3
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:11,110
Of course it isn't quite this simple because it's called sklearn.linearmodel,

4
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:13,850
but you can figure this out from the documentation pretty easily.

5
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:16,480
There's a familiar linear regression function, and

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,550
I have my regression which I named reg.

7
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:23,190
Reg gets, linear regression, and

8
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:26,030
then I don't have to worry about parameters in this particular case, and

9
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:29,400
then the next thing to do is just to fit it the same as we did a classifier.

10
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:33,640
We do this of course on our training data, and of course now we have this

11
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:38,190
regression its been, trained on our training data and we're just returning it.
