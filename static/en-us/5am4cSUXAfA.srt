1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,546
So on our first scenario of our
Video Everywhere app we needed to store

2
00:00:03,546 --> 00:00:04,830
the video segments.

3
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:08,189
Now, video segments are large media
files and they should probably be saved

4
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:11,670
using something like internal or
external storage in files.

5
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:14,260
So given that the videos
are specific to the app and

6
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:16,540
we don't want other apps
to be able to delete or

7
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:20,710
modify these videos,
using files would be our best choice.

8
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:24,000
So for our second app, the user
will likely quickly open up the app

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,980
to get a conversion when they need it.

10
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:29,140
So the user will need their
preferences for units stored.

11
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:32,220
Now because of this, using shared
preferences should be more than enough

12
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:33,540
just to store our unit preferences.

13
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,040
So our third case, the song app
was similar to our video app

14
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,780
in that songs are stored
on a user's device.

15
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:42,970
And their large media files.

16
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:46,090
So you might want to use
these songs on any app.

17
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:49,240
And in fact, remember the description
says that the songs should be useable

18
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,440
on any app.

19
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:54,070
So storing in files will make
perfect sense in this case.

20
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:55,980
So lastly we have our Pets app.

21
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:59,050
So it's likely that
the shelter organizes its data

22
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:01,440
in something like a giant
spreadsheet already.

23
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,030
So this method of data storage is
directly analogous to how the SQLite

24
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:08,180
database organizes its data.

25
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:11,230
So each row can have a pet.

26
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:14,820
And we'll store the most important
attributes of the pet in the columns.

27
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:17,910
So for that, our pets app,
we'll use our SQLite database.
