[Norvig] Now, suppose we arrange our program like this.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
So we set up the houses and we have a list of all 120 possible orderings

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and then we iterate each of the 5 properties in each of the 5 property groups

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
through all those orderings.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
And so now, 5 levels nested deep into our code we've got an assignment

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
of all 25 properties.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Each of them is assigned to one of the houses,

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and now we can check the constraints, like the Englishman lives in the red house

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and the Spaniard owns the dog and so on. Those can all go here.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
If we find something that checks out, we can just report we've got an answer.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Now, I want you to go back to the back of your envelope

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
and tell me if we wrote the program this way and filled in this code with all the constraints

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
and then ran it, about how long do you think it would take to find a solution?

14
00:00:45,000 --> 99:59:59,999
About a second, a minute, an hour, or a day? Click on the best answer.
