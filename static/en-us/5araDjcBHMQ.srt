1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,300
But much more interesting
than a Markov model for

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:06,370
what we're going to do is what's
referred to as a hidden Markov model.

3
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:07,230
So here's the basic idea.

4
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:12,458
Suppose you actually can't
observe the state, kay?

5
00:00:12,458 --> 00:00:16,160
So there's some state doing its thing,
but you can't observe it.

6
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,790
But what you can observe, or
what are referred to as observables, or

7
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:21,500
the evidence.

8
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:25,350
So let's suppose for
the same weather example, okay?

9
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:28,800
Let's suppose the things that
we can observe are essentially

10
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,840
what women of the day happen
to be wearing or carrying.

11
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:36,840
So maybe I see this very sheik bathing
suit on a person, or I see just a nice

12
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:42,160
coat that can be worn any time
that it was sunny, or an umbrella.

13
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,380
So these are the evidence
of what the state is.

14
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:47,990
So before I can go further,

15
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:51,520
I have to tell you one more thing
about our Markovian system, and

16
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,630
that's what's referred to as
the emission probabilities.

17
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:57,260
Emission, if you think of it
as symbols being spit out, and

18
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:59,940
the emission probabilities
are written like this.

19
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:01,400
B, sub j of k.

20
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,270
And what that means is,

21
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:09,560
the probability that you'll see symbol
k, that you'll see a bathing suit,

22
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:13,970
given that at some time you're
in some particular state, okay?

23
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:17,240
So what's the probability you'll see
a bathing suit, given that it's sunny?

24
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,830
What's the probability
you'd see a bathing suit,

25
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:20,870
given that it's snowy, all right?

26
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:22,740
Those are called
the emission probabilities.

27
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:27,880
And what that means, our entire system
when it's running, looks like this.

28
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:28,920
In this new system,

29
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:33,950
where we can't observe the states, we
don't ask questions about the likelihood

30
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:38,430
of having seen a particular sequence of
states, because we can't see the states.

31
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:40,740
Instead, we're going to ask
about the likelihood, or

32
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:45,340
the probability of seeing a particular
sequence of observations.

33
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:46,280
So that's shown here.

34
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:50,100
So you could say, given this
sequence of observation, coat,

35
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:53,060
coat, umbrella, umbrella,
bathing suit, umbrella,

36
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:57,555
umbrella, what's the probability of that
series of that sequence of observations?

37
00:01:57,555 --> 00:02:01,245
Well, we could evaluate that if
you give us everything, right?

38
00:02:01,245 --> 00:02:05,625
So here, I've just written it out
as P of O is the sequence of all

39
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:10,715
the observations, and I know the way to,
to compute that and we'll get more

40
00:02:10,715 --> 00:02:16,400
of the details later is, I can say well,
if you told me the sequence of states,

41
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,370
then I can tell you the probability
of given observation.

42
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:23,410
And if I multiply that by
the probability of that sequence,

43
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:24,840
I can get the whole thing.

44
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:30,200
So one simple example is, well,
one possible sequence of states,

45
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,970
just one, is that it's all sun.

46
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:38,520
All right, and that can be determined
from the yellow stuff here, all right?

47
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:42,940
All right, so it's the probability that
I start with sun, 0.7, right there.

48
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:46,850
And then I follow that with a whole
bunch of sun, 0.8, point, right?

49
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:48,710
All e, sunny days.

50
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:53,760
So, this is the probability of
all sunny days, and this would

51
00:02:53,760 --> 00:03:00,060
be the probability of seeing this
sequence, if every day was sunny, right?

52
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:05,260
So, the coat,
it's a 0.3 probability t, there's 4,

53
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:10,650
umbrellas, and there's only a 10% chance
of seeing an umbrella when it's sunny.

54
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:12,930
Notice by the way,
I wrote 0.1 to the 4 here.

55
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:14,295
The order doesn't matter, right?

56
00:03:14,295 --> 00:03:16,830
because I'm assuming that
if you tell me the state,

57
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:19,710
that I could tell you the probability
of being, of, of having an umbrella.

58
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:22,150
It doesn't matter what the day before or
the day after was.

59
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:23,890
You tell me that it's,
that it's raining,

60
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:26,760
I can tell you the probability
that they're carrying an umbrella.

61
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:31,080
But this was only for
one particular sequence of all sun.

62
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:35,070
You have to worry about all
possible sequences of weather,

63
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:39,590
over those seven days to talk about the
probability of getting this one series.

64
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:42,610
So to make that a little clearer and
a little easier, let's just do the math.
