1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:05,400
Here is a bad sequence of updates for
this particular example.

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:09,240
So I rewrote the value function for all
the different states, all seven states.

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,070
They're all remember dot products of
the weights with the feature vectors.

4
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:16,264
So V(1) can be written as W0 + 2W1.

5
00:00:16,264 --> 00:00:19,540
V(2) can be written as W0 + 2W2.

6
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:20,560
And so on.

7
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:26,900
State seven is the weird one,
right, that has 7W0 + W7 and

8
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:29,350
we have to change the w values so

9
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:32,720
that we actually are representing
the value function correctly.

10
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,510
So let's consider the case we start off.

11
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:38,030
We're going to get this process
going with the weights positive and

12
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:42,270
the value of state seven
much bigger than the others.

13
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:44,270
And we're going to update
things round robin.

14
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:46,830
We're going to say
after a transition from

15
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:49,490
state one to state seven using
the only action that we've got and

16
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:51,890
getting no reward,
because there's no reward.

17
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:55,191
We update when we go from state two to
state seven, state three to state seven,

18
00:00:55,191 --> 00:00:57,741
state four to state seven,
state five state to state seven,

19
00:00:57,741 --> 00:01:00,360
state six to state seven,
and seven back to itself.

20
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:03,050
So these are all the possible
transitions in this MVP.

21
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:06,020
So we'll just update all
of them one at a time.

22
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:08,790
And then do it again, repeat.

23
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:12,840
And just for concreteness, let's say
that the discount factor's point nine,

24
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,660
and the learning rate is point one.

25
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:15,959
And let's see what happens.

26
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:16,459
>> Okay.
