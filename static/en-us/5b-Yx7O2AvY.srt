00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
This unit is about simplifying.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Why is simplifying important?

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Think about a plane catching fire as it leaves the runway.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
When you think about how could that possibly have occurred,

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
you want to figure out what the cost of failure is.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
In order to explain how the failure came to be,

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
you want to come up with the minimum of factors that explain how.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
So, here is our plane with passengers, luggage on board,

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
entertainment system, air condition, and whatnot.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Now suppose you had a means to turn back time and repeat history at will.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Or suppose all of this were running in a simulation.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
You could try again and again to see whether the failure occurs or not.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Then you could try to simplify things.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
You could, for instance, remove the passengers and see

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
whether the failure still occurs. Oh, it still occurs.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Remove the flight attendant and see whether the failure still occurs.

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Well, the plane still catches fire.

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Remove the seats. The plane still catches fire.

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Remove the air conditioning system and repeat the whole thing.

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
And remove the entertainment system, remove the luggage,

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
and you see that none of this actually is important.

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Whatever you remove, the plane still catches fire.

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
You can go and remove the airport, and even with all the airport removed,

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
everything happens as before.

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
But as soon as you remove this little metal strap that's lying on the runway,

26
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
then all of a sudden your plane takes off just as normal.

27
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
But if that strap is there, then your plane is on fire.

28
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
What we're going to explore today is how to simplify failures--

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
that is, finding what is relevant for the failure and what is not--

30
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
and how to do this automatically--

31
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
that is, automatically finding out the cause of the failure.
