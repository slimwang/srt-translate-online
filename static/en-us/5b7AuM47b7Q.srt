1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The correct answer is it will stay as it is.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
One way of seeing this is the following--the central compartment loses

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
temperature to the left and gains temperature from the right if you will.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
The amount of gain and loses proportional to the difference in temperature,

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
but to the left and to the right, the difference in temperature is the same,

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
so we lose as much as we gain.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
The temperature of the central compartment has to stay constant.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Of course, the same is true for the compartment to the left.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
We'll just look at one further compartment down the road

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
and see that this compartment to the left gains as much as its going to lose.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Another way of seeing this behavior is to look at the heat equation.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
The partial derivative of the temperature with respect to time

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
equals thermal diffusivity times the second derivative of temperature.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Now, with respect to x, this is a line of constant slope, which means we have to form the derivative

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
of this derivative with respect to x, but when the first derivative is constant,

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:10,000
the derivative of this derivative is zero--this line has a slope of zero, so the right hand side

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
of the heat equation equals zero, which leads us to the statement that there is no change in time.

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,000
In reality, of course, we can never have this type of linear gradient going on and on.

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
The temperature must not shrink below 0 K, but of course in practice, there's some upper limit as well.

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
So eventually, we will see some changes to that curve

21
00:01:30,000 --> 99:59:59,999
because energy accumulates downstairs and is depleted upstairs.
