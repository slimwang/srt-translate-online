00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:04,080
To illustrate the difference between case-based reasoning and learning by

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:09,836
recording cases, or instance-based learning, let's revisit our micro-world

3
00:00:09,836 --> 00:00:14,760
of blocks. Once again, you can see all of these blocks in this micro-world. So

4
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:19,170
you can see the colors, you can see the shapes, and you could even touch them,

5
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:23,720
so you have some idea about their approximate sizes. Now let us suppose I give

6
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:29,330
you a new block. Note that this new block, the size, is very different from

7
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:32,600
the size of any of the other blocks. What color do you think this block will be?
