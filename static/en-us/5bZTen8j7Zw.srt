00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:03,680
Congratulations, you've finished the first lesson of the course.

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:06,630
In this lesson, you learned why saving old versions of your files might

3
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:09,360
be useful, and you learned some systems that can help you do this

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,640
called version control systems.

5
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:14,000
You also learned a particular system called Git, and

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,620
got practice using it to review the history of existing projects.

7
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:20,500
In the next lesson, you'll create your first Git repository and

8
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:21,180
create that history.

9
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:22,500
See you then.
