1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:01,290
Thanks, Colt.

2
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:03,090
Let's take a look at our first tool.

3
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:06,180
Hierarchy Viewer is a tool that'll help
you visualize your entire UI structure

4
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:09,580
at a glance, and also provide you with
a better way to understand the relative

5
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:13,070
rendering performance of distinct views,
within that structure.

6
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:15,630
Here's what it looks like, so
let's go ahead and set it up.

7
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:18,570
You're actually going to need some
actual code to try this on, so

8
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:21,910
we're going to use Sunshine from
the Android fundamentals class.

9
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:23,600
You can find the details
on how to pick up this code

10
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,070
from the instructor notes down below.

11
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:27,830
When you're done,
click Continue to move on.

12
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:32,650
Oh, and one more note, if your phone is
rooted and running Android Jellybean or

13
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:34,810
newer, you're good to go, otherwise,

14
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:37,220
you're going to need to set up an
environment variable on your computer,

15
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:40,300
so that Hierarchy Viewer is able
to communicate with your device.

16
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:42,882
You can also find the details for
that, in the instructions as well.

17
00:00:42,882 --> 00:00:45,770
All right, so let's go ahead and
start up Hierarchy Viewer,

18
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:48,700
the first thing you want to do
is hop into Android Studio.

19
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:50,030
Then, in order to get
the Hierarchy Viewer,

20
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:52,600
we're going to want to start
the Android Device Monitor.

21
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,290
Now, you can do that through a menu,
you can come up to the top here,

22
00:00:55,290 --> 00:01:00,240
click Tools, go to Android, and
then select Android Device Monitor.

23
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,980
Or you can click this little
handy green little icon,

24
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:04,050
that also does the same thing.

25
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:06,680
So I'm going to go ahead and click that
to start the Android Device Monitor.

26
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:12,260
So here we are in the blank default
layout of Android Device Monitor,

27
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:15,780
now to get to Hierarchy Viewer, you're
going to want to open up a perspective.

28
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:18,510
So I'm going to do that,
by clicking this menu here, and

29
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:23,150
then clicking on Hierarchy view,
and then click OK to launch it.

30
00:01:24,192 --> 00:01:26,410
All right, so here's the default
layout for Hierarchy Viewer.

31
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:28,750
If your screen looks
different than this,

32
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:31,670
you can go to the default view
by clicking the Window menu, and

33
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:35,040
click on Reset Perspective,
that'll reset things for you.

34
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,700
All right, so
let's talk about the different panes

35
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:41,000
that are available to you in the UI
layout for hierarchy viewer.

36
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,660
On the left here you're
going to find the windows tab,

37
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:46,770
you should see your phone and
a list of running applications in it.

38
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:48,900
Make sure you can see sunshine
amongst the list, and

39
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,350
then go ahead and
double-click to load it up.

40
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:56,010
Now as you can see, hierarchy viewer
shows you,your entire view structure for

41
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:57,260
the activity you selected,

42
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:59,980
in this case this was the main
activity of our sunshine app.

43
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:03,390
Now, if you hover over here this
is called the tree overview, and

44
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:06,540
it gives you a bird's eye view
of your entire UI structure.

45
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:11,500
Now you'll also see this view port,
which allows you to move around and

46
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:14,570
change what shows in
the detailed view on the left.

47
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:15,550
This is the detailed view.

48
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:18,950
As you can see when I
move the view port,

49
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:21,680
the details also change
in the detailed view.

50
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,080
This is a great way to zoom in
on portions of your hierarchy.

51
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:28,280
Now if you hopped over to the tree view,
there's this other zoom

52
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:32,070
control that allows you to zoom in and
out on your structure as well, like so.

53
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:36,930
I can also drag the layout to
move the position, zoom in and

54
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:38,250
out to get a little bit more context.

55
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:41,995
Now when you click on a view,
you can see all of its properties,

56
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:44,665
in the view properties tab, that
opens up here on the left hand side.

57
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:47,625
I'm going to go ahead and expand it, and

58
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:50,855
it's got these collapsible menus that
show you various details about the view.

59
00:02:52,055 --> 00:02:54,425
For example, I can look at events and

60
00:02:54,425 --> 00:02:56,795
other details related to
drawing on the screen.

61
00:02:56,795 --> 00:03:00,820
Things like alpha, things like pivot,
things like rotation.

62
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:03,580
Now, double-click on a view to get a
preview of what's drawn to the screen of

63
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:06,120
this particular view,
that you've selected.

64
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,150
Now, let's move over
here to the lower right.

65
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:09,050
This is the Layout view.

66
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:11,540
Now, when you click on
a view on the hierarchy,

67
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:14,050
the Layout view highlights
the same view in that Layout view.

68
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:18,950
In other words, you can look at
this Layout view as a wireframe off

69
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:20,120
your device's screen markup.

70
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:23,270
So you can select items
in the detail view and

71
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:25,920
see where they will be laid
out on your device's screen.

72
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,990
You could also go the reverse
direction and click items here, and

73
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:32,800
see items light up in the tree
view on the top above it.

74
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,340
So for example,
if I click on this box right here,

75
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:39,680
this corresponds to this view over here,
and if I move the view pager, and

76
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,750
zoom in a little bit, I can drill
down into details about this view.

77
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:47,760
Now unfortunately you can't go directly
from hierarchy viewer to your source

78
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:52,040
code, because it's actually connected to
your running app, not the source itself.

79
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:56,210
But each node shows the type and the ID,
so that you can reference it later or

80
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:58,050
find it later in your source code.

81
00:03:58,050 --> 00:03:59,620
All right, so
I want to step back for a second and

82
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:02,410
I want to make sure that you know that
hierarchy viewer is really useful in two

83
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:03,850
key ways.

84
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:06,580
The first, it's going to help you
understand your structure of your user

85
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,075
interface from Android's perspective.

86
00:04:08,075 --> 00:04:12,850
And two, it can help you figure out,
where you might have superfluous views,

87
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:15,650
or opportunities to flatten your
view hierarchy to save memory,

88
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:18,230
and improve rendering performance.

89
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:21,670
But now some real performance insights
come from our per node profiling feature

90
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:23,265
and hierarchy viewer.

91
00:04:23,265 --> 00:04:27,385
The tool models, the overall rendering
process of the entire user interface,

92
00:04:27,385 --> 00:04:28,675
and provides rendering data for

93
00:04:28,675 --> 00:04:32,265
a particular node relative to the other
nodes in that particular tree.

94
00:04:33,465 --> 00:04:35,725
All right, so lets go back over
here to our detailed tree view.

95
00:04:35,725 --> 00:04:39,425
Now click on a root node of a sub-tree
that you actually want to profile.

96
00:04:39,425 --> 00:04:40,585
Just for test purposes right now.

97
00:04:40,585 --> 00:04:43,055
I'm going to go ahead and
click on this action bar container.

98
00:04:44,135 --> 00:04:47,220
Now in order to invoke the profiling
feature of hierarchy viewer,

99
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:50,870
you're going to want to click on
this Venn diagram icon, right here.

100
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:52,900
So, I'm going to go ahead and
do that right now.

101
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,590
Now, let's drill down a little
bit more specifically.

102
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:58,550
Now, as you may notice,
each view gets three distinct dots, and

103
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:01,310
they can be of different colors,
green yellow or red,

104
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:03,850
and we'll talk about what
that means in a little bit.

105
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:06,510
But, there's also a meaning
to the order of the dots.

106
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:10,330
Now the left most dot represents the
measure phase of the rendering pipeline,

107
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:12,200
the middle one, the layout phase, and

108
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,670
the right most one, the draw
phase of the rendering pipeline.

109
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:18,050
All right, so
lets talk about the colors now.

110
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:21,530
Now the colors of the dots indicates
the relative performance of this node,

111
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:24,070
in respect to all other profiled nodes.

112
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:27,150
So what do we mean by
relative performance?

113
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:29,740
Now let's take a look at this one.

114
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:32,650
Greens means that for
this phase of the pipeline,

115
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:35,490
this view renders faster than at
least half of the other views.

116
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:39,610
Now, if you see yellow,
it means it's in the bottom 50%.

117
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:41,010
Now, if you see red,

118
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:43,230
that means it's one of the slowest
nodes in your view hierarchy.

119
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:45,990
All right, so
here's a little bit of insight.

120
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:49,270
A red node is a potential problem in any
situation where you would not expect

121
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:50,960
slow performance.

122
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,860
For example, in a leaf node or

123
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:56,520
a view with only a few children,
that should be a red flag.

124
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:00,020
Now also remember, when dealing with
a large hierarchy something does need to

125
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:04,830
be the slowest node, so the question is,
is it the node that you expect it to be?

126
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:08,510
Also keep in mind that just because it's
performing relatively slow, it might not

127
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:12,960
be performing absolutely slow, that's
where the actual numbers are helpful.

128
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,850
All right, so now that you're
familiar with hierarchy viewer,

129
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:17,350
let's go ahead and try it on some
sample code for this lesson.
