1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:04,910
So, luckily, this is already factored as much as it can be. We need to solve

2
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:10,738
the equations, x squared plus 1 equals zero. And x plus 2 equals zero. The

3
00:00:10,738 --> 00:00:17,165
first one gives us i and negative i. And the second one tells us that the only

4
00:00:17,165 --> 00:00:22,952
real zero, or root, in this case, is negative 2. Remember, though, there are

5
00:00:22,952 --> 00:00:28,806
three solutions to this problem. I, negative i, and negative 2.
