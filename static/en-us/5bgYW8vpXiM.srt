1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,700
Queries are specified in a health
quality measure format or

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:06,540
HQMF for short.

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:11,330
This is an XML standard for documenting
the content and structure of a quality

4
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:17,000
measure using an XML document
formatted based on the HL7 REM.

5
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:20,329
It consists of three levels of detail.

6
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:25,220
Metadata, such as who wrote it,
the dates over which it is valid,

7
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:30,520
who validated it, and other details
about how the measure works or is used.

8
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:35,340
Human narrative, including measured
description, data criteria,

9
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:39,310
the measure population,
and measure observations.

10
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:42,780
Finally, computer instructions
As to how to count and

11
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:45,700
compute the results of the measure.

12
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:51,220
This is a small part of the XML
in a HQMF query specification.

13
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:55,100
In this case,
it provides instructions to the computer

14
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:58,370
to only include patients who
have had their weight measured.

15
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:03,180
This might define the numerator of
a weight screening quality metric.

16
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:06,980
That as you recall from lesson two,
is a requirement in meaningful use.
