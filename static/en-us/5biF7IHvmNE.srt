Today was an embarrassing day. At 8 a.m., my boss sent

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,490
out an email to everyone in the company, asking for volunteers

3
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:10,530
to help him proofread some marketing documents. Since I had some

4
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:13,630
time available, I replied by saying, I can take a shot

5
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:15,690
at it. Or at least, that is what I wanted to

6
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:19,520
say. I misspelled one key word in that sentence. And instead,

7
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,220
wrote something really embarrassing. Why do the i and o keys

8
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:25,730
have to be so close to each other on my keyboard?

9
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:28,320
I was so embarrassed. I wish my spell checker caught

10
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,090
curse words to alert clumsy writers like myself. Let's write

11
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:35,140
a program that detects curse words in a text. But

12
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:38,360
before we do that, let me ask you, have you ever

13
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:41,460
been in a situation like this? Have you ever sent

14
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:44,800
or received a message that you felt was embarrassing? If so,

15
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,450
we would love to hear about it. You can share
