1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,900
Next, I want to use this definition
of an optimization problem

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:05,880
to define an approximation algorithm.

3
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:10,520
An algorithm is a factor
delta approximation algorithm

4
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:14,640
if on any instance I it
produces a solution S.

5
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:19,570
Such that the objective value
of the solution S on instance I,

6
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:23,650
is that most delta times the optimum for
the instance I.

7
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,990
Note that it's okay for delta to
be a function of the instant size.

8
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:31,570
Also, when we're working
with maximization problems

9
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:35,610
instead of minimization ones,
this inequality gets reversed.

10
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:38,440
Our previous results for
the min vertex cover problem then

11
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:41,230
can be stated in terms of
this definition by saying

12
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:45,920
that min vertex cover has a polynomial
time factor 2 approximation algorithm.

13
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:48,400
Or approximation scheme
