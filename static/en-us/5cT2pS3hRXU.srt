1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,250
Feeling up for a challenge?

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:05,170
In the instructor notes you'll
find a link to this site.

3
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:08,590
Pop open the timeline,
hit the big red button to record.

4
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:11,080
And then click the Click Me button.

5
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:14,692
Find the big Recalculate Style block in
the timeline, and then notice how it's

6
00:00:14,692 --> 00:00:18,470
self time is going to be way too
long to hit 60 frames per second.

7
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:21,100
There are three things
you can do in this case.

8
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:23,640
You can either reduce the number
of affected elements,

9
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,080
you can reduce the selector complexity,
or you can do both.

10
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:30,210
Reducing the number of affected
elements means modifying fewer

11
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:31,500
nodes in the render tree.

12
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:35,640
Reducing selector complexity means that
you are going to using fewer tags and

13
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,090
class names to select your elements.

14
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:42,060
But hey, why not try to do both,
because that is a double whammy.

15
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:45,780
For this quiz, I want you to make
recalculate styles much more efficient.

16
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:48,910
If all goes well, you should be
able to get a five to ten x drop.

17
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:51,710
But before you start, I'm going to
give you a little bit of a hint.

18
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:55,625
This sample uses a class on the body
to change the style of all the boxes.

19
00:00:55,625 --> 00:00:58,705
And this means that it has to check
the style of each and every box.

20
00:00:58,705 --> 00:01:03,083
You can see that happening here with
this nth-child selector on class box.

21
00:01:03,083 --> 00:01:06,087
An alternative would be to use
querySelectorAll to grab all of

22
00:01:06,087 --> 00:01:07,196
the boxes on the page.

23
00:01:08,197 --> 00:01:10,947
Once you have them,
toggle the style of every other

24
00:01:10,947 --> 00:01:13,867
box by iterating through
this list using JavaScript.

25
00:01:13,867 --> 00:01:17,717
Once you're seeing a five to ten x drop,
check this box to let us know you're

26
00:01:17,717 --> 00:01:19,497
recalculating styles
much more efficiently.
