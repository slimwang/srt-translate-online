00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,526
We heard a lot of information in the last
video, so here is just a summary of all of

2
00:00:04,538 --> 00:00:08,733
that on one screen. We can think about
Grant's sales story so far as having two

3
00:00:08,745 --> 00:00:13,281
situations. The situation after the first
day, which I'm going to call the before

4
00:00:13,293 --> 00:00:17,682
picture and the situation after the second
day of selling, which is the present

5
00:00:17,694 --> 00:00:22,646
situation we're concerned with. The last
equation that we came up with, a = 36w +

6
00:00:22,658 --> 00:00:27,426
22n had to do with just the sales from the
first day. So, I changed the name of the

7
00:00:27,438 --> 00:00:32,561
total money earned to a old to show that
this is the money earned after the first

8
00:00:32,561 --> 00:00:36,643
day of selling. This equation still works
if we're only interested in calculating

9
00:00:36,655 --> 00:00:41,012
the money that Grant earned from his
friends after just that one day, but now,

10
00:00:41,112 --> 00:00:45,843
we want to find, is what I'm going to call
a new. The money he's going to get from

11
00:00:45,855 --> 00:00:50,537
those people and from these new people who
also want to buy. What we're going to do

12
00:00:50,537 --> 00:00:54,793
in this quiz is come up with an equation
for a new, which should combine the

13
00:00:54,793 --> 00:00:59,463
information from a old with this new data
about people who are also going to buy the

14
00:00:59,463 --> 00:01:04,626
wipers and nozzles. So, which of these
equations down at the bottom is the

15
00:01:04,626 --> 00:01:09,467
correct equation for a new? The total
amount of money that Grent will have after

16
00:01:09,467 --> 00:01:14,802
these people on the first day buy his
wipers and nozzles, and these people from

17
00:01:14,814 --> 00:01:19,726
the second day buy his wipers and nozzles.
This is a lot of information to take in, so

18
00:01:19,726 --> 00:01:24,744
I'm going to lable this quiz a challenge
quiz. Actually many of the quizzes that

19
00:01:24,756 --> 00:01:27,708
you've had have been challenging, but I
think that this one is especially

20
00:01:27,708 --> 00:01:31,968
difficult. Think really carefully about
how many terms you think this new equation

21
00:01:31,968 --> 00:01:36,516
should have. Should it have two terms or
should it have four terms? Also, there may be

22
00:01:36,516 --> 00:01:40,235
more than one correct answer. Even if you
don't get it right the first time, just

23
00:01:40,235 --> 00:01:41,421
give it another shot.
