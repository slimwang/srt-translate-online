00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:03,290
Well what's happening, is that the attendance,

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:07,870
is on a scale vastly different than the scale of the web page's pixels.

3
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:11,250
Remember, attendance was on the order of millions and

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:14,780
while we properly scaled the center x and center y,

5
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:19,000
to correspond to the correct x and y pixel of the latitude and

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,950
longitude of the game, we never created a scale for our attendance values.
