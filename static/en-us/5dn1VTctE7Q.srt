00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:01,650
In the last work session,

2
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:06,136
we were able to replace the words noun
and verb in a single hard coded string.

3
00:00:06,136 --> 00:00:08,370
But the Mad Libs Generator
we want to build,

4
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:12,270
we want to feed in any string we want
into it and the way we want to do this

5
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:16,170
is by using the new concept you've
just learned about, functions.

6
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:18,090
Now we don't know enough
about functions just yet

7
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:20,500
to build a full blown
Mad Libs Generator but

8
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:24,050
in this work session, we'll go over
the distinction between two statements.

9
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:27,880
Print and return, which can cause a lot
of frustration to new programmers but

10
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:29,900
are also inherent to functions.

11
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:30,410
Let's dive in.
