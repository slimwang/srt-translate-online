00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,719
So, welcome to our third, and final, supervised classification algorithm.

2
00:00:03,719 --> 00:00:04,280
>> On?

3
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:05,210
>> Decision trees.

4
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:07,380
>> Decision trees are one of the oldest and

5
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:09,490
most used elements in machinery in general.

6
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:13,050
They go back for decades, and they're extremely robust.

7
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:15,610
>> They have really interesting looking decision boundaries too,

8
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:17,920
that you'll see as soon we start coding things up.

9
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,520
>> And, they're very intuitive, so you can look at the result and understand it.

10
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,130
It's a great algorithm and we're really excited to get started.
