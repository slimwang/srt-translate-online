1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,573
The solution to this problem is x equals 9 7th. Well, let's see how we got 9

2
00:00:04,133 --> 00:00:08,450
7th. Whenever I see an equation with fractions in it, the first thing that I

3
00:00:08,462 --> 00:00:12,499
want to do is get rid of the fractions. Because I don't want to have to add,

4
00:00:12,597 --> 00:00:17,058
subtract, multiply and divide fractions all the way through solving the problem.

5
00:00:17,156 --> 00:00:21,595
To clear the fractions out of an equation, I look at all the denominators, which

6
00:00:21,607 --> 00:00:26,942
I have 6, 2 and 3. And I have to find the least common denominator, because I

7
00:00:26,954 --> 00:00:32,377
want to multiply the entire equation through by the least common denominator.

8
00:00:32,493 --> 00:00:37,696
The least common denominator of 3, 2 and 6 is 6. So, I'm going to multiply the

9
00:00:37,708 --> 00:00:43,177
entire equation through by 6. I have to multiply 6 by each term that is in the

10
00:00:43,189 --> 00:00:48,403
equation. I'm going to write the steps out here. But once you get comfortable,

11
00:00:48,415 --> 00:00:53,548
you can feel free to skip this step. So, I have 6 times 1 3rd, and 1 3rd is

12
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:58,491
being multiplied by 2 x minus 1. On the right side of the equation, I have 6

13
00:00:58,503 --> 00:01:04,343
times negative 1 half x plus 6 times 7 6th. When I multiply 6 times 1 3rd, I get

14
00:01:04,355 --> 00:01:09,947
6 times 1 3rd is 6 over 3, which gives me 2. And that's going to be multiplied

15
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:15,444
by 2 x minus 1. On the right side of the equation I have 6 times negative 1 half

16
00:01:15,456 --> 00:01:20,854
x. 6 over 2 is 3, so I have negative 3 x. When I multiply 6 times 7 6th, the 6th

17
00:01:20,866 --> 00:01:26,383
cancel out and I'm left with a 7. Once I clear the fractions from the equation,

18
00:01:26,499 --> 00:01:31,598
I need to distribute wherever needed. Here, I have 2 times 2 x minus 1, so I

19
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:36,809
need 2 times 2 x, and I need 2 times negative 1. 2 times 2 x is 4 x, and 2 times

20
00:01:36,821 --> 00:01:42,050
negative 1 is negative 2. And I just write down the other side of my equation.

21
00:01:42,146 --> 00:01:46,294
Once I've cleared the grouping symbols and distributed where needed, I would

22
00:01:46,306 --> 00:01:50,588
combine like terms on each side of the equation. However, here, there's only one

23
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:54,612
x term and one constant term on the left side, and one x term and one constant

24
00:01:54,624 --> 00:01:58,804
term on the right side. The next step is to move all my constants to one side of

25
00:01:58,816 --> 00:02:04,655
the equation. We learned that whatever you do to one side of the equation, you

26
00:02:04,667 --> 00:02:10,400
have to do it to the other side of the equation. So, if I add 3 x on this side,

27
00:02:10,526 --> 00:02:16,040
I have to add 3 x on this side. When I add 3 x to both sides, I have 4 x plus 3

28
00:02:16,052 --> 00:02:21,829
x gives me 7 x minus 2 equals negative 3 x plus 3 x is 0. So, I just have 7. Now

29
00:02:21,841 --> 00:02:26,130
that I have the variable on one side of the equation, I need to move the

30
00:02:26,142 --> 00:02:30,728
constant to the other side of the equation. When I add 2 to both sides of the

31
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:35,197
equation, I get 7 x on the left side. Negative 2 plus 2 is zero. And I get 7

32
00:02:35,209 --> 00:02:40,033
plus 2 which equals 9 on the right side. So, I have 7 x equals 9. The last step

33
00:02:40,045 --> 00:02:44,763
is to divide both sides of the equation through by the coefficient of the

34
00:02:44,775 --> 00:02:49,751
variable. The coefficient of the variable is 7, so I divide both sides by 7. 7

35
00:02:49,849 --> 00:02:54,765
over 7 is 1, so I have x equals 9 7th. Solving an equation with fractions in it

36
00:02:54,777 --> 00:02:59,837
is a little bit more difficult. But if we simply multiply through by the least

37
00:02:59,849 --> 00:03:05,655
common denominator, all the fractions dissappear and you're left with a simpler

38
00:03:05,667 --> 00:03:06,892
problem to solve.
