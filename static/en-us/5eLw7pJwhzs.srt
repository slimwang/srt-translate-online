00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,960
As far as the three other system qualities in

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:08,630
an object oriented architectural style, performance has problems because of

3
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:12,210
the many small objects linked to multiple context switches.

4
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:13,990
And delegation, okay,

5
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:19,100
whereby one object may refer to others to provide its functionality,

6
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:23,290
this can increase indirection, which can reduce responsiveness of the system.

7
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:26,450
With respect to reliability, decentralized control in

8
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:29,950
object oriented system reduces opportunity for oversight.

9
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:33,820
But encapsulation can reduce vulnerability to undin, unintended interactions.

10
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:40,410
For safety, the correspondence between the real-world entities which the system

11
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:44,860
is is modeling, and the objects that the programmer has

12
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:48,110
developed can improve the intentionality of the system and

13
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:51,450
accountability, thereby enhancing the safety of the system.
