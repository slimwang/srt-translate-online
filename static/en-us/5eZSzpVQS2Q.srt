1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
And the answer is 60 and it turns out the uncertainties

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
from both of these experiments just add up.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
The second one is very non-trivial. I'm not going to prove it to you.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
There's a proof in my book that takes marginal pages, but it is interesting to see

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
when you add Gaussian variables, the means add up and the variance add up.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 99:59:59,999
The important to this standard deviation is don't add up.
