In the previous lesson we mentioned the term asymptote. And in this past quiz

2
00:00:04,839 --> 00:00:08,899
you saw that the graph of f of x equals 1 over 3x never actually reaches x

3
00:00:08,899 --> 00:00:15,122
equals 0. The y axis. Now if we look at this line on the graph since its

4
00:00:15,122 --> 00:00:20,546
already drawn for us. We can see that it splits the graph. So that the curve

5
00:00:20,546 --> 00:00:25,071
falls down toward negative infinity on one side. And comes back down from

6
00:00:25,071 --> 00:00:30,120
positive infinity on the other side. As I mentioned before, this line, x equals

7
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:35,098
0, is called a vertical asymptote, for this graph. Here's a graph of the other

8
00:00:35,098 --> 00:00:41,213
function we were looking at before. F of x equals 4 over X minus 1. Based on

9
00:00:41,213 --> 00:00:45,962
this graph, what do you think the vertical asymptote for this function is? Make

10
00:00:45,962 --> 00:00:50,047
sure that what you write is the equation for a vertical line. Since that's what

11
00:00:50,047 --> 00:00:51,480
a vertical asymptote is.
