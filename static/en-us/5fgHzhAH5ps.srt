1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:01,589
The URI or

2
00:00:01,589 --> 00:00:06,070
uniform resource identifier is the path
to find resources provided by your API.

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:11,160
This means that our URI should
always refer to resources and

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:14,210
not to actions being
performed on those resources.

5
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:18,776
And it is recommended to use
the plural form for each resource name.

6
00:00:18,776 --> 00:00:21,527
HTTP provides us with eight verbs,
or methods,

7
00:00:21,527 --> 00:00:24,650
we can use to indicate
the desired method of action.

8
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:26,600
We want a server to take
on an API endpoint.

9
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:30,680
There's no rule forcing you
to use all of these verbs.

10
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:33,430
But it's a good practice
to use them responsibly.

11
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:36,150
Head and get requests can be
called by search engines and

12
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:38,240
web crawlers exploring the Internet.

13
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:40,992
Make sure these requests only
provide information, but

14
00:00:40,992 --> 00:00:43,868
never modify your database,
or the state of your backend.

15
00:00:43,868 --> 00:00:47,813
HTTP also has status codes to indicate
the different types of responses

16
00:00:47,813 --> 00:00:49,860
a server can send back to the client.

17
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:54,410
A good API should take advantage of
these status codes for successful and

18
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:56,170
erroneous HTTP responses.

19
00:00:57,370 --> 00:01:00,820
Error messages you send to your
users should be concise, clear, and

20
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:01,329
informative.

21
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:07,650
Proper URI paths, HTTP verbs, and error
messages are all important components

22
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:10,980
for making your APIs understandable,
and easily implementable.
