00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
[Thrun] I would now like to ask you to perform linear regression on these data points

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
and calculate for me W0 and W1.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
As defined in this class, we might have to go back

4
00:00:12,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and look over the exact formula from the lecture that I taught on linear regression.
