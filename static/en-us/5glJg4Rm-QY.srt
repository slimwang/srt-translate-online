1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,287
We know that we need to multiply both sides by x. But, what does it mean to

2
00:00:04,287 --> 00:00:08,243
multiply this entire side of the equation by x? Well, it means that

3
00:00:08,243 --> 00:00:12,503
multiplication by x needs to distribute to both terms on this side of the

4
00:00:12,503 --> 00:00:17,163
equation, since we're multiplying the entire side by x. 7 times x is, of course,

5
00:00:17,163 --> 00:00:22,952
just 7x. Then we can distribute and simplify the left-hand side, x times 3 over

6
00:00:22,952 --> 00:00:28,301
x just gives us 3. And x times negative 1 over 5x gives us negative 1 over 5.

7
00:00:28,301 --> 00:00:33,553
And in the end, we get 14 over 5 equals 7x, which of course looks like what we

8
00:00:33,553 --> 00:00:34,470
had before.
