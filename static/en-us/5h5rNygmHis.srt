1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Now let's take a step back for a second, and I'm going to talk about

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
probabilistic letter models.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Here we have a sequence of letters,

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and it looks like this sequence is rather infrequent in English.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
But what can we do with letter models that we can't do

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
or that we can do in opposition to word models?

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
The answer is letter models are very good in cases

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
where we're going to be dealing with unique words that maybe we haven't seen before,

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
but they still give you properties of the language.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
One very interesting task is language identification. Let's see how that would work.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Let's take some example phrases--"hello, world," "guten tag, welt," "salam dunya,"

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
and let's suppose you have the task of classifying these

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
into the language from which they were sampled from,

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
and we'll make this into a quiz, and we'll give you some choices--

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
English, German, French, Spanish, and Azerbaijani--

16
00:00:59,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and tell me for each of these want your best guess is at the most likely language classification.
