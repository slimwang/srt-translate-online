00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,929
After we solve this equation for y, we'll have y equals negative 2x plus 4. Now

2
00:00:04,929 --> 00:00:09,512
we're ready for substitution. Using substitution, I want you to find the

3
00:00:09,512 --> 00:00:14,387
solution or the point of intersection for this system of equations, these two

4
00:00:14,387 --> 00:00:17,900
lines. Enter your numbers here, and here. And good luck.
