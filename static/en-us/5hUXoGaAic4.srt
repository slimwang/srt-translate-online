1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,170
Now, handling audio focus in
our app is going to be a pretty

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:04,750
significant code change.

3
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:08,010
So before you go off on your own,
let's walk through the major decisions

4
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:10,570
you'll need to make when
using the Audio Manager API.

5
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:15,480
So remember, API just refers to the
classes and methods that are offered by

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:19,120
the Android framework that
you as a developer can use.

7
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:23,070
Now let's start by requesting
audio focus from the AudioManager.

8
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:25,830
In order to begin playing
the audio on the app.

9
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:30,840
In the last quiz, we found that we need
to call the requestAudioFocus method and

10
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:36,049
it requires three inputs,
onAudioFocusChangeListener object,

11
00:00:36,049 --> 00:00:38,410
a streamType and a durationHint.

12
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:42,443
So these last two inputs here,
the streamType and

13
00:00:42,443 --> 00:00:44,303
the durationHint are integers.

14
00:00:44,303 --> 00:00:48,300
Now when we call this method
requestAudioFocus what should we pass in

15
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:51,550
as a stream type which will
be our second parameter and

16
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:54,560
this refers to the type of
audio they we're playing?

17
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,540
So is this a song or ring tone?

18
00:00:57,610 --> 00:01:01,130
And for the second question,
which we pass in as the durationHint?

19
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:02,550
So the third parameter.

20
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:05,780
And this refers to how long
we need audio focus for.

21
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:09,350
So do we need it for a short period
time or a long period of time?

22
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:13,050
So as a hint, both of these answer
choices should be integers, and

23
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:16,990
more specifically they should be integer
constants that have already been defined

24
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:19,280
in the AudioManager class.

25
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,110
So in the reference documentation for
the AudioManager class, if we scroll

26
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:27,100
down to this public constant section and
then go down a little bit further.

27
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:29,030
So these are all the possible
stream types that you can

28
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:31,280
pass into a requestAudioFocus method.

29
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,686
And you can refer to them
as audiomanager.stream or

30
00:01:34,686 --> 00:01:38,650
audiomanager.stream.DTMF and so on and

31
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:42,730
so on and the descriptions for
each stream type is on the right column.

32
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:48,400
So let's click into the stream along
constant to get some more details.

33
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,680
Now remember a constant is a fixed
value the never changes, and

34
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,090
by convention we name the variable
in all capital letters.

35
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:57,620
So it's often used to
communicate a certain state.

36
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:00,830
So this case are stream alone
has a value of four and

37
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:02,490
that will never change.

38
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:05,420
So when we pass in this constant
value to the AudioManager,

39
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:07,690
it knows that we mean this
particular stream type.

40
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:10,610
All right so this takes care of it for
our stream types.

41
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:12,100
What about our durationHint?

42
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:15,110
Let's navigate over here to
requestAudioFocus method and

43
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:17,295
notice here the different
valid options for

44
00:02:17,295 --> 00:02:20,140
durationHint are listed in
the method description.

45
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,764
So we have different ones such
as audioFocus_Gain_Transient,

46
00:02:22,764 --> 00:02:25,030
audioFocus_Gain_Transient_May_Duck and

47
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:28,370
then a couple other ones and
each of these have explanations

48
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:31,590
to help you choose which one is
the appropriate one to pick.

49
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:32,970
So feel free to search online for

50
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:35,850
tutorials if you need help
answering these two questions.

51
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:38,750
And I'd like you to fill out your
answers here and then continue on.
