Let us do an exercise on analogical transfer together. Back to our example of

2
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:08,830
this sort of system in the atomic structure. Given this representation of

3
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:12,150
the solar system and this representation of the atomic structure,

4
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:16,309
what would be transferred from the solar system into the atomic structure model?
