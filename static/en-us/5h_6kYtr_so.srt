The distance between the two points is the square root of 74. Great problem

2
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:08,470
solving if you found it. We'll start by drawing a rough sketch on the points on

3
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:12,995
the coordinate plane. If we want to find this distance between the two points,

4
00:00:12,995 --> 00:00:18,115
we set up a right triangle in two dimensional space. The horizontal distance

5
00:00:18,115 --> 00:00:23,651
goes from x equals negative 2 to x equals positive 3. So, we know that this

6
00:00:23,651 --> 00:00:27,872
distance is a horizontal distance between the values of negative 2 and positive

7
00:00:27,872 --> 00:00:32,785
3. Which is the total distance of 5 units. For this vertical distance we

8
00:00:32,785 --> 00:00:36,782
want to find the difference between the y values or the change in them. We

9
00:00:36,782 --> 00:00:42,322
start at y equals negative 3, and we climb all the way up to y equals 4. This

10
00:00:42,322 --> 00:00:48,414
distance, so we know that this distance is 7 units. Keep in mind that the

11
00:00:48,414 --> 00:00:51,742
distance on this vertical axis, or between the y coordinates, is the same out

12
00:00:51,742 --> 00:00:57,194
here. This is a vertical distance that's the same as this one. So, we'll have

13
00:00:57,194 --> 00:01:00,914
the change in x squared, which is 5 squared, plus the change in y squared,

14
00:01:00,914 --> 00:01:06,631
which is 7 squared equals d squared, our hypotenuse. Squaring these numbers,

15
00:01:06,631 --> 00:01:11,336
and finding this sum, will get 74 equals d squared. Now, we just take the

16
00:01:11,336 --> 00:01:15,452
square root of both sides, keeping only the positive root. So, one d is equal

17
00:01:15,452 --> 00:01:20,218
to the square root of 74. Now, if we try to simplify the square root of 74, we

18
00:01:20,218 --> 00:01:26,568
notice that its factors are 2 and 37. These are not perfect squares, so we just

19
00:01:26,568 --> 00:01:30,223
leave our answer as the square root of 74.
