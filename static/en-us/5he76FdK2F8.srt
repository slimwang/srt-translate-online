1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:04,490
First, a reflection attack is
a form of man-in-the-middle attack.

2
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:09,040
This is true, because in reflection
attack, Trudy is the man in the middle.

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,010
In particular,
in order to impersonate Alice,

4
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:17,880
Trudy intercepts the message Bob sends
to Alice, and repay it back to Bob.

5
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:22,580
Second, to defeat a reflection attack,
we can use an odd number

6
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:27,400
as a challenge from the initiator and
even number from the responder.

7
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:28,320
This is true.

8
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,300
By doing so, Trudy cannot repay the
challenge that she received from Bob,

9
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:39,090
which is an even number, back to Bob,
because Bob is expecting an odd number.

10
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:44,930
Third, we can use signing with public
keys to achieve mutual authentication.

11
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:45,790
This is true.

12
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:49,170
We have discussed a mutual
authentication protocol

13
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:51,290
using encryption with public keys, but

14
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:55,440
you can easily modify the protocol
using signing with public keys.
