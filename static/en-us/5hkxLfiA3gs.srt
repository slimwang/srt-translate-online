00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,977
This number line is the correct answer. We know that m is supposed to be smaller

2
00:00:03,977 --> 00:00:07,814
than n or equal to n. So we need to have a bracket that includes n to square 1.

3
00:00:07,814 --> 00:00:11,621
And also select all of the values to the left of n on the number line. Another

4
00:00:11,621 --> 00:00:15,391
thing to note is that the quantity we're thinking about, which is m in our case,

5
00:00:15,391 --> 00:00:19,353
is conveniently written to the lower right-hand hand corner of the number line.

6
00:00:19,353 --> 00:00:23,139
You'll continue to see this on different number lines in the future with

7
00:00:23,139 --> 00:00:26,710
different variable names, depending on what we're searching for.
