00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,790
Just to reiterate the last quiz, and

2
00:00:01,790 --> 00:00:06,750
now actually looking at more general terms, let's look at these two questions.

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:10,400
In this question, I want you to think about any image which is convolved with

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,450
a box filter will have an averaged output, or

5
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:18,140
averaged output with flipped images, both vertically and horizontally.

6
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:20,980
The same case of a Gaussian filter.

7
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:22,115
What would be the output?

8
00:00:22,115 --> 00:00:24,060
Would it be flipped or will it be just blurred?
