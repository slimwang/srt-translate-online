I want to talk briefly about histograms as a special case of a bar chart.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The key difference is whereas the bar charts we discussed so far

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
were defined over 2D data, the histograms look at 1D data.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
That is, there is only one dimension of data that is being plotted.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Let me start with an example.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Here is a fictitious data set about annual income.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Suppose at some company I asked software engineers how much annual income they make.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Again, this data set is contrived.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Of the nine people I asked, here is the survey of different annual salaries.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
In the histogram case, I make a bar chart that concerns itself with only one thing,

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
which is called "frequency," which is short for "count,"

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
that will group these salaries into three different buckets--

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:58,000
from $120,000 on, $130,000 on, and $140,000 on.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
What the bar chart plots is the frequency at which people asked fall into the different categories.

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Specifically, I am asking you what is the count for the salaries that fall into

16
00:01:10,000 --> 99:59:59,999
the $120,000 to $130,000 bucket. Please answer it here.
