00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:02,700
In the following quiz,
you'll write code for

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:08,350
a function called word_in_pos, which
stands for word in parts of speech.

3
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:14,590
The function takes in a string word, and
the list, parts_of_speech, as inputs.

4
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:20,180
If there is a word in parts_of_speech
that is a substring of word,

5
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:23,380
then you'll be asked to return
that word, else return none.

6
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:28,880
So if my word is equal to "NOUN", and my
parts_of_speech is a list that contains

7
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,725
the strings ["VERB", "NOUN",, and
"PLACE"], and pass both both of these

8
00:00:32,725 --> 00:00:36,075
into my word_in_pos function, Iâ€™ll
be returned with the string, "NOUN".

9
00:00:38,095 --> 00:00:43,020
However, if I were to pass in the same
list, but this time word would be

10
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:47,736


11
00:00:47,736 --> 00:00:49,425
I would be returned with "PLACE".

12
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:53,915
We'll use this function in our final Mad
Libs generator by passing the current

13
00:00:53,915 --> 00:00:56,510
iteration of Mad Lib Into this function

14
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:59,490
with the parts of speech
list that we're using.

15
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:01,260
If we receive none,

16
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:04,400
we know that the word we pass
in isn't in parts of speech, so

17
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:09,010
we can just add the iteration, or word
we're looking at, to our list replaced.

18
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:09,866
If it is, however,

19
00:01:09,866 --> 00:01:13,360
we'll be returned with the part
of speech we want to replace.

20
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,310
So we'll replace the part of
speech with the user input so

21
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:18,350
we can keep the punctuation.

22
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:21,230
And then we'll add it
to our replaced list.

23
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:22,210
All right, good luck.
