1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,440
So if metacognition reasons over deliberation, could we also have

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:07,800
an additional layer, where meta-metacognition reasons over metacognition? And

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:11,367
to take that even further, could we have a meta-meta-metacognition reasons over

4
00:00:11,367 --> 00:00:14,920
meta-metacognition all the way up, infinitely up in a hierarchy?

5
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,200
Is this a good way to think about the levels of metacognition?
