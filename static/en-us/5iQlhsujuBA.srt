1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:05,540
This is a really high value, meaning that the relationship between miles and

2
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:13,010
ticket price is very strong. R squared is about 0.83 which means that 83% of

3
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:17,620
the differences in cost is due to the differences in miles traveled. Now we

4
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:22,530
want to find the equation for our line of best fit. Remember that the generic

5
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:29,690
form is y equals bx plus a or a plus bx, doesn't matter. Where b is our slope

6
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:34,900
and a is our y intercept. You learned before that the slope is equal to

7
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:40,780
Pearson's R times the ratio of the standard deviations. We already found R. Our

8
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:46,300
next step is to find the standard deviation for the y values. And the standard

9
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:51,180
deviation for the X values. Remember that since these are the sample standard

10
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:55,640
deviations, we have to use the corrected standard deviation, dividing by n

11
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:56,897
minus 1.
