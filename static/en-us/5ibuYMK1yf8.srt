1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,450
So, to mitigate the shortcomings of a scatter plot, we can

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:05,950
plot the same data as a line chart, and connect the

3
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:09,750
dots with lines, as we see in this image. Putting lines

4
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:13,240
here really emphasizes trends. So, as we can see, there was

5
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:16,810
a pretty bad series of Red Sox teams in the 90s.

6
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:18,860
And that the Red Sox teams have been doing pretty well

7
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:22,090
in the 2000s. It's a little bit harder to see this

8
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:25,860
when we just have the points without the lines. That being said,

9
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:27,850
having lines that connect each point really puts

10
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:30,550
a focus on year to year variability. We

11
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:32,980
can see, for example that from 1964 to

12
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:36,940
1965, there's a huge drop. But it's a little

13
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:38,840
bit harder to have a good sense of

14
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:41,970
the more global trends. Are the teams getting better

15
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:44,560
or worse on average? For this reason, we

16
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:47,100
might introduce a lowest curve instead of these lines.
