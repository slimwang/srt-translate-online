00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,340
In this lesson we talked about
inter-process communication, or IPC.

2
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:08,960
We described several IPC mechanisms that
are common in operating systems today.

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,820
We spent a little bit more time on use
of shared memory as an IPC mechanism.

4
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:18,190
And we contrasted this also with use
of message-based IPC mechanisms.

5
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:22,345
Based on this lesson you should have
enough information on how to start using

6
00:00:22,345 --> 00:00:24,845
inter-process communication
mechanisms in your projects.
