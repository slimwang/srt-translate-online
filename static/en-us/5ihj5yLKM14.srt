00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:02,790
When you buy a component from somebody else,

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:04,790
you're giving up your competitive advantage.

3
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:07,830
You didn't build it yourself, so you can't put into it the bells and

4
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:10,575
whistles that might give you that advantage.

5
00:00:10,575 --> 00:00:14,570
On the other hand, the vendor can concentrate all their energy on that

6
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:18,110
particular component and come up with a super-specialized version.

7
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:20,710
So that's an, an advantage of buying.

8
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:23,380
Your development costs may also go down.

9
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:26,720
That is, the vendor can apply economies of scale,

10
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:31,390
thereby reducing the price you have to pay for that, that component.

11
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:34,630
However, dealing with a vendor is a third party relationship, and

12
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:38,100
the channels of communication that you have with the vendor may not be as

13
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:41,010
effective as the ones you would have if you did in-house development.
