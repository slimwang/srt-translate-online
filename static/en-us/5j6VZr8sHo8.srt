1
00:00:00,079 --> 00:00:01,237
And this example is now easy.

2
00:00:01,237 --> 00:00:04,230
You can see that all the four over here fit with the green one.

3
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:09,800
In fact, the separating line will be somewhere here and, in fact,

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:13,480
after the next iteration of optimize, with the assignment of those point, four

5
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:16,059
points of this cluster center and those three points of this cluster center.

6
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:18,730
You can see that this cluster center will move

7
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:21,750
straight into the center of those four points.

8
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:24,950
And this cluster center will move to the center of those three points.

9
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:26,470
Have we truly achieved our result?

10
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:29,580
We now have assumed it's two clusters.

11
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:32,030
But our algorithm of iteratively assigning and

12
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:36,570
optimizing has moved the cluster center straight into what we

13
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:41,890
would argue is actually the correct centroid for those two clusters over here.

14
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:43,990
That is called the k-Means algorithm.
