1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The answer is 17.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The first time we call rec_naive a is 17.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
We make one addition and call rec_naive again

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
with 16 as its argument.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
We make another addition and call rec_naive with 15 as the argument.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
This process continues, doing one addition and another call 14 more times

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
until a = 0, and so we will have made 17 additions.
