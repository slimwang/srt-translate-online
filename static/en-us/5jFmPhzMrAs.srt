1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:04,360
The characters property itself
has a property called Count,

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:06,839
which allows us to count the number
of characters in a string.

3
00:00:08,089 --> 00:00:11,910
For our string constant, called the
Truth, the count of characters is 24.

4
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:16,009
Also, through the characters
property of a string,

5
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:19,980
we gain access to functions
only available to collections.

6
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:20,640
For example,

7
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,269
to reverse the characters in a string,
you can use the function Reversed.

8
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,910
Let's use a loop again to print out
the characters in reverse order.

9
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:33,130
So if we reverse the characters and
our original string spins,

10
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:37,634
we have snoops, s-n-o-o-p-s.
