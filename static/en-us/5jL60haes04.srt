1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:04,770
All right. So I created a new class called RecordedAudio with two fields,

2
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:07,070
filePathUrl and title.

3
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:11,160
The next thing I will do is go back to RecordSoundsViewController and

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:15,530
then scroll to this audioRecorderDidFinishRecording function.

5
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:19,700
The first thing I have to do here is I have to save the recorded audio, and

6
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:22,870
I will do that with the most recent class I have created.

7
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:25,460
So what I will do is scroll up to the very top and

8
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:29,860
then create a new object for this class which is RecordedAudio.

9
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:32,759
There. And then I'll scroll back to my function, and

10
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:35,090
in here I will initialize the new object.

11
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:35,890
There.

12
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:38,280
Now I can set the attributes of this object.

13
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:41,290
One of them is filePathURL.

14
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:45,250
The value for this can be obtained using the recorder parameter.

15
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:49,060
This is the reference to the audio file that was actually recorded on the phone.

16
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:51,909
So I can say something like recorder.url.

17
00:00:51,909 --> 00:00:55,362
Then I will set the title of this object recordedAudio.

18
00:00:58,402 --> 00:01:01,680
I can get this value from the recorder parameter also.

19
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,720
I can say recorder.url.lastPathComponent, this gives

20
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,950
us the name of the recorded file.

21
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:11,500
All right, with that, step one is done.

22
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,510
Step two is to perform a segue to the next scene.

23
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:19,020
I can accomplish that by calling the performSegueWithIdentifier function.

24
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:23,000
You should not that we inherit this method from UIViewController.

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,640
Now, Xcode is asking me for an identifier of the segue, and

26
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:33,280
I recall that the idea of my segue was stopRecording there.

27
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:38,040
Just as a quick recap, however, let me go back to my storyboard and then select

28
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:43,060
this segue and slide the utility tray out to see that the identifier for

29
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:45,980
this segue was in fact stopRecording.

30
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,750
Okay, let me go back to my code.

31
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:50,320
Now, for this second parameter,

32
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,400
sender, we will pass in the new object, recordedAudio.

33
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,274
Let me do that.

34
00:01:57,004 --> 00:02:00,560
This is the object that actually initiates the segue.

35
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,040
All right, so it seems like step two is also done.

36
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:07,200
By the way, at this point I want to highlight that the name of our function is

37
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,430
called audioRecorderDidFinishRecording successfully.

38
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:14,440
And the way we can figure out if the recording was in fact

39
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:18,660
accomplished successfully is by using this boolean flag.

40
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:20,702
So I will add an if statement here.

41
00:02:20,702 --> 00:02:23,501
And enclose all of this code within that if statement.

42
00:02:26,072 --> 00:02:29,854
If for some reason the audio recording does not finish successfully,

43
00:02:29,854 --> 00:02:32,481
then what I can do is print out an error message and

44
00:02:32,481 --> 00:02:35,310
update the correct settings on my buttons.

45
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:35,860
All right.

46
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:37,715
Let's run our project.

47
00:02:37,715 --> 00:02:39,660
Okay, let me record something.

48
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,125
Is this going to work?

49
00:02:41,125 --> 00:02:43,070
Okay, so

50
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:47,300
it seems that the segue is happening, and this time it's happening through code.

51
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,180
And now let me play the sound.

52
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:53,450
>> My mom always said life was like a box of chocolates.

53
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:56,950
>> Hm, the app is still playing the movie quote.

54
00:02:56,950 --> 00:03:00,820
Why do you think our app is still playing the quote and not the recorded voice?

55
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,040
Enter your thoughts in this box.
