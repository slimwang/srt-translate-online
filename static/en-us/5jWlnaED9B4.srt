1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:02,350
Alright we're back. So let's, let's, let's think

2
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:04,400
this through, so the teacher gets to suggests to

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,623
the student any, any question. The teacher knows

4
00:00:06,623 --> 00:00:08,773
the answer, and the teacher would like the learner

5
00:00:08,773 --> 00:00:10,606
to get the answer as quickly as possible.

6
00:00:10,606 --> 00:00:13,639
Not requiring the full 20 questions if, if possible.

7
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:15,655
So what do you think, what do you think

8
00:00:15,655 --> 00:00:17,850
the teacher could do as a good strategy here?

9
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:18,980
>> For 20 questions?

10
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:19,737
>> Yeah.

11
00:00:19,737 --> 00:00:21,411
>> So, if, if we think of the set of

12
00:00:21,411 --> 00:00:25,160
possible people as being these sort of hypotheses. And you know

13
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:31,112
which of the hypothesis is correct and which is wrong, then presuming the

14
00:00:31,112 --> 00:00:37,256
teacher can keep all this in her head, I guess the right thing to do would be to

15
00:00:37,256 --> 00:00:42,728
always pick an X, such that it gets rid of as many of the hypotheses is

16
00:00:42,728 --> 00:00:44,423
possible. But what, what, do I mean by

17
00:00:44,423 --> 00:00:47,155
that? I mean, it gives the most information.

18
00:00:47,155 --> 00:00:50,242
>> Well, but there's a, there's a very strong kind of information that you

19
00:00:50,242 --> 00:00:54,100
could get in this particular case. So, so, so let's imagine that this set

20
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:57,550
of questions is, is this sort of, you can ask any question in the universe.

21
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:00,673
>> So, I give you some question, I oof.

22
00:01:00,673 --> 00:01:02,650
>> Let's, let's try this because remember

23
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:03,850
we did this before, you thought of a

24
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:06,970
person, and you had me ask questions. So I want you to think of a person.

25
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:07,560
>> Okay.

26
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,330
>> Alright, and I want you to tell me what question I should

27
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:13,170
ask, that's going to figure out who the person is as quickly as possible.

28
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:15,440
>> Okay. Is this person as

29
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:18,220
good in his field as his namesake is in his field?

30
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:20,140
>> Is it Michael Jordan?

31
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:20,583
>> Yes.

32
00:01:20,583 --> 00:01:24,410
>> Is it the Michael Jordan who's a professor at Berkley?

33
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:24,653
>> Yes.

34
00:01:24,653 --> 00:01:25,880
>> Okay.

35
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:28,207
>> You could have asked if I say, is it Michael I Jordan?

36
00:01:28,207 --> 00:01:31,366
>> Yeah, I don't think I knew the initials of the two Michael Jordans.

37
00:01:31,366 --> 00:01:33,745
>> Yeah. Michael Jordan, for, for people who

38
00:01:33,745 --> 00:01:35,309
don't know is a professor at Berkley and

39
00:01:35,309 --> 00:01:37,062
one of the giants in machine learning. And

40
00:01:37,062 --> 00:01:40,141
he is literally the Michael Jordan of machinery.

41
00:01:40,141 --> 00:01:40,506
>> [LAUGH]

42
00:01:40,506 --> 00:01:45,210
Alright, but, but, but you could've done this in one question, right?

43
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:48,000
If you had to ask me, if the first question was, is the

44
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,369
person, and then the actual person. You knew that the answer to

45
00:01:51,369 --> 00:01:54,350
that would be yes. And so I would've gotten it in one step.

46
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:56,360
>> Hmm, that's true.

47
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,987
>> So, given a, you know a, a sufficiently,

48
00:01:58,987 --> 00:02:02,087
helpful teacher. You can, you can do this in one.

49
00:02:02,087 --> 00:02:03,143
>> Well, that make sense, right? So

50
00:02:03,143 --> 00:02:05,717
basically, if my questions include, is this

51
00:02:05,717 --> 00:02:09,907
the correct hypothesis, then you should always just ask that question.

52
00:02:09,907 --> 00:02:10,610
>> Right.

53
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:13,533
>> But that seems, that seems like cheating.

54
00:02:13,533 --> 00:02:18,004
>> [LAUGH] Yeah, I would, I. You're right and all I was really trying to do

55
00:02:18,004 --> 00:02:19,804
is show that, it's a very different problem,

56
00:02:19,804 --> 00:02:21,289
when the, the question has to come from

57
00:02:21,289 --> 00:02:23,540
the learner's side. That kind of question from

58
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:26,160
the learner's side would be pure folly. Because

59
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,330
it would, it, it, the learner would not

60
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:30,698
know what person to pick. If the person started,

61
00:02:30,698 --> 00:02:32,854
if the learner started to ask questions like, is the

62
00:02:32,854 --> 00:02:35,880
person Michael I Jordan? The answer's very likely to be no.

63
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:38,720
In which case that's not very helpful. Now, a really helpful

64
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,220
teacher could potentially change the

65
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:42,530
target. But that's, that's definitely cheating.

66
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:44,150
>> Mmm. OK, fair enough.
