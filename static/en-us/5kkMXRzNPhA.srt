00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,724
>> So increasing 1 foot in each direction increased the total area from 150 to

2
00:00:04,724 --> 00:00:09,383
176 feet squared or, in other words, made the area go up by 26 feet. So what

3
00:00:09,383 --> 00:00:14,454
will happen then if we increase the dimensions by yet another foot? Do you think

4
00:00:14,454 --> 00:00:19,372
the area will increase by another 26 feet squared exactly? Do you think it'll

5
00:00:19,372 --> 00:00:24,496
increase by more than, than this? Or do you think it will increase by less than

6
00:00:24,496 --> 00:00:24,915
this?
