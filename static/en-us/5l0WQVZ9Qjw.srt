00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:04,150
Well it seems like each stage has a bunch of set times, so

2
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:09,260
I want the relationship to go like that. And each band can sign up

3
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:12,570
for multiple set times, so I want the fork on that end as well.

4
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:15,780
So I guess the forky end goes on set time for both of em?

5
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:16,980
>> Yep. That's right.

6
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:19,240
>> Cool. So this is our junction object.

7
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:20,780
>> Looks good. Let's build it.
