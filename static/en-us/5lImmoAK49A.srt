1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Now we're down to a network with a single node, T, L,

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
with this joint probability table, and the only operation we have left to do

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
is to sum out to give us a node with just L in it.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:26,000
So, the question is to compute P(L) for both values of L,

5
00:00:26,000 --> 99:59:59,999
+l and -l.
