1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,823
The last choice is correct. We need both the positive and the negative square

2
00:00:03,823 --> 00:00:07,639
roots. This time, we don't have any real life situations ruling out negative

3
00:00:07,639 --> 00:00:11,356
numbers, and it makes sense mathematically that if we end up with a negative

4
00:00:11,356 --> 00:00:15,368
number inside the parentheses on the left-hand side, since we're squaring it, it

5
00:00:15,368 --> 00:00:16,907
will equal a positive number.
