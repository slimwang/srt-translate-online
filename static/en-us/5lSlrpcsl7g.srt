1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Finding things like the max of a list or the min or the second largest or the second to last smallest,

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
they are all examples of what are called order statistics.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Statistics summaries of the values in a list that depend on the order that they are sorted.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,000
This notion is generalizing min and max, so the min can be expressed as order statistic 1.

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The second smallest element in the list is order statistic 2.

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The median is order statistic like n/2 floor.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
The second largest is order statistic n-1, and the max is order statistic n.

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
To give you a chance to play with this idea a little bit of order statistics,

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'd like you to write some Python code to find the second most popular name.

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I'm going to give you the list of the most popular names

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:02,000
given to babies in the US born in 1995, it's a yob, for year of birth, 1995.txt

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
and if you take a look at the file, you should be able to download this and take a look at the format.

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:14,000
It's pretty simple, the name and the sex and essentially a measure of how popular the name is,

14
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
and what you want to find is the second most popular female name given in the US in 1995.

15
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Once your program is completed, it should be able to output the name,

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
and I want you to just check off the name that your program returns.
