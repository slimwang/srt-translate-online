1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,220
Replace the resource XML for the list item

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:05,630
forecast to split up the single text field

3
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:08,640
into multiple fields with the IDs below, while

4
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:11,793
keeping the same approximate design. Note that you

5
00:00:11,793 --> 00:00:13,324
won't just be able to drag additional fields

6
00:00:13,324 --> 00:00:15,664
onto the existing list_item_forecast layout, since it contains

7
00:00:15,664 --> 00:00:18,380
only a text view, which means there is no view group to add additional views to.

8
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,280
I recommend deleting list_item_forecast and creating a new

9
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,410
file if you want to use the visual editor.
