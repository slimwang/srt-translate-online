1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,680
Let's take a look at this method signature.

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:05,990
We can see that ajax takes in URL and settings.

3
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:08,490
And, settings come within these square brackets.

4
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:11,540
In general, square brackets within documentation means that

5
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:13,060
something is optional.

6
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:17,240
So, if we look at settings, we see that, in fact, all settings are optional.

7
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:23,110
So, in all reality all you really need is a URL for an AJAX request.

8
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:27,150
AJAX has another signature where your just passing in settings, and

9
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:28,940
settings are optional.

10
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:33,580
This leads to an interesting situation, let's talk about this for a second.

11
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:35,970
The correct answer to this questions going to be URL, but

12
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:40,010
we can see that with this function signature we don't even need settings,

13
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:41,630
settings are in fact optional.

14
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:42,470
And, there is no url.

15
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:48,690
so, you actually can call an ajax request without passing in anything to it.

16
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:50,780
But, that would be kind of pointless,

17
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:54,470
because while it would succeed, it wouldn't go anywhere.

18
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:57,900
So, you're not really doing much of a request.

19
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:03,440
In terms of real world requests, most post requests will probably have a url and

20
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,550
some data with them.

21
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:07,400
Because in a post request, you're usually sending off data.

22
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:11,570
And, GET request, in the real world, generally have a url along with some type

23
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:16,890
of call back function and some optional data passed along with the GET request.

24
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:20,400
But, the only thing that's really necessary to send off a functional AJAX

25
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,770
request is a url string
