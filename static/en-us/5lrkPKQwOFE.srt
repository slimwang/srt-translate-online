1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,849
Now let's see how
the definition of a problem

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:05,679
maps on to the route founding domain.

3
00:00:05,679 --> 00:00:10,489
First, the initial state we're given,
let's say, we start off in Arad.

4
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:13,630
And the goal test, let's say,

5
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:18,969
that the state of being in Bucharest is
the only state that counts as a goal.

6
00:00:18,969 --> 00:00:20,759
And all other states are not goals.

7
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:25,250
Now the set of all the states
here is known as the state space.

8
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:29,280
And we navigate the state
space by applying actions.

9
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:33,399
Actions are specific to each city,
so when we're in Arad,

10
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:38,759
there are three possible actions to
follow this road, this one, or this one.

11
00:00:38,759 --> 00:00:43,369
And as we follow then,
we build paths or sequences of actions.

12
00:00:43,369 --> 00:00:46,939
So, just being an Arad
is the path of length 0.

13
00:00:46,939 --> 00:00:50,419
And now,
we can start exploring into space and

14
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:54,730
add in this path or length 1,

15
00:00:54,729 --> 00:00:59,729
this path of length 1,
and this path of length 1.

16
00:00:59,729 --> 00:01:06,979
We can add in another path here of
length 2, another path here of length 2.

17
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:11,853
Here's another path of length 2,
here's a path of

18
00:01:11,852 --> 00:01:17,429
length 3,
another path of length 2 and so on.

19
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:24,170
Now, at every point we want to separate
the state out into three parts.

20
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:28,070
First, the ends of the paths,
the farthest path that been,

21
00:01:28,069 --> 00:01:31,179
have been explored we call the frontier.

22
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:33,770
And so the frontier, in this case,

23
00:01:33,769 --> 00:01:39,280
consists of these states that are the
farthest out we've been explored.

24
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,099
And then,
to the left of that in this diagram,

25
00:01:43,099 --> 00:01:46,030
we have the Explored part of the state.

26
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:49,159
And then, off to the right,
we have the Unexplored.

27
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:52,050
So let's write down
those three components.

28
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,629
We have the Frontier,
we have the Unexplored region, and

29
00:01:58,629 --> 00:02:00,310
we have the Explored region.

30
00:02:01,569 --> 00:02:03,099
One more thing,

31
00:02:03,099 --> 00:02:08,439
in this diagram we've labelled the Step
Cost of each action along the route.

32
00:02:08,439 --> 00:02:12,064
So, the Step Cost of
going between Neamt and

33
00:02:12,064 --> 00:02:18,139
Lasi would be 87 corresponding
to a distance of 87 kilometers.

34
00:02:18,139 --> 00:02:22,179
And then the Path Cost,
is just the sum of the Step Cost.

35
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:28,453
So the cost of the path of going from
Arad to Oradea would be 71 + 75.

36
00:02:28,453 --> 00:02:30,429
