00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:02,640
Now, if you chose that you have to reload a

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:05,220
lot, you must not be used to developing on the web,

3
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:08,060
you always have to hit reload a lot. But if

4
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:11,320
you chose the second option, you missed a subtlety of what

5
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:14,190
I said, you can't just touch the manifest file, you

6
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:17,940
actually have to change the bits in the manifest file, with

7
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:22,610
every resource update. The challenge becomes, that every time you update

8
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:25,790
any of the files in your system, you have to update

9
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:30,410
the manifest file as well. So ,even if you're just tweaking a bit of CSS,

10
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:33,970
you have to change the manifest file as well in order for it to reload.
