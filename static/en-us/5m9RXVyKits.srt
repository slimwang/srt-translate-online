1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:04,240
That ends this section specifically
on Particle Filtering.

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:06,490
You've now seen the algorithm
in some details.

3
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:10,120
State and dynamics and censor models.

4
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:14,110
And the really good thing
about particle filters is that

5
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:17,320
you can make them as
complicated as you want.

6
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:19,500
But you can start off simple and
get something running.

7
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:24,270
You then have to worry about how, how
many dimensions are in your state space,

8
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:27,240
because if you get too many, then you
might have to have too many particles.

9
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,050
You have to worry about re-initializing.

10
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:31,970
We talked about that before,
of scattering some particles around

11
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:36,030
in order to you know,
in case something has happened quickly

12
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:39,370
that you didn't anticipate there
would be some particles there.

13
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:42,220
But the good news is it,
it's really quite accessible,

14
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:43,140
there's a lot of papers to read.

15
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:45,650
You can actually start with
that condensation paper.

16
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:47,610
It, it really lays it out.

17
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:52,060
In fact, there's a conference version of
it, that came out even earlier that I

18
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:55,180
think is even clearer
because it has less detail.

19
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:59,240
So so I hope most of you will get,
will get to understand that.

20
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,990
And certainly the OMS students,

21
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:02,950
you will, as you will be
doing it on the problem set.
