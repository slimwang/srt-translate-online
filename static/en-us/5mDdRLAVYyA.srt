00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,450
Now I want to do a little series of quizzes that relate,

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:05,960
essentially, the transformations to points.

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:07,720
So here's quiz number one.

4
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:11,160
Suppose I told you the transformation from image A to image B

5
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,430
is a pure translation.

6
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:16,120
How many pairs of corresponding points would you

7
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:18,270
need to know to compute the transformation?

8
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:21,510
So I say pairs of points, meaning pairs of corresponding points, meaning,

9
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:23,590
I've got a point in A, and a point in B,

10
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:25,820
and that's a single pair of corresponding points.

11
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:29,080
So the question is, how many pairs would I need in order to do tran,

12
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:35,899
figure out the translation, a, 3, b, 1, c, 2, d, 4.
