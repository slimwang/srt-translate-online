1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:04,660
Well it turns out all of these are negative 1. For the first fraction we can

2
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:08,928
think about simplifying the common factor of 6. Leaving us with negative 1

3
00:00:08,928 --> 00:00:12,970
divided by 1 or just negative 1. We can use the same reasoning for the rest of

4
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:16,796
the examples. They will all equal negative 1 since we'll have one factor that's

5
00:00:16,796 --> 00:00:21,080
positive in the numerator. And one factor that's negative in the denominator. It

6
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:25,730
doesn't matter where the negative sign falls, we just need one of them to be

7
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:29,008
negative in order for our answer to be negative one.
