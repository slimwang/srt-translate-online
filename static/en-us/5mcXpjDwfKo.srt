00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:03,890
Great job completing Descriptive Statistics. I really hope you've enjoyed

2
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:07,380
this experience. Having taken this course, you should now know how

3
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:11,080
to summarize data by measuring its center and its variance.

4
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:13,438
You should be familiar with how to use Google Spreadsheets to

5
00:00:13,438 --> 00:00:16,430
handle data sets as well as how to visualize data.

6
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:20,350
And finally, you should have introductory knowledge of probability and how

7
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:23,110
it can be applied to normalized data. In the final

8
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:26,088
project, you will conduct an experiment using a deck of cards.

9
00:00:26,088 --> 00:00:28,360
You will sample and describe your own

10
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:32,000
data using visualizations and descriptive statistics. Now

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,030
once you completed the final project, you'll

12
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:36,810
be ready to move on to Inferential Statistics,

13
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:40,130
where you will learn how to make predictions using data. There's a link to

14
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:41,960
this course in the instructor's notes box.

15
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,260
We really look forward to seeing you there.
