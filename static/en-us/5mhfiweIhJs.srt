00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,121
From an engineering perspective,

2
00:00:02,121 --> 00:00:04,678
chronic disease presents
a data logistics problem.

3
00:00:04,678 --> 00:00:08,378
Here's a more dramatic network
depiction of the complex,

4
00:00:08,378 --> 00:00:12,596
highly specialist-driven care of
the chronic disease patients in

5
00:00:12,596 --> 00:00:15,779
the typical primary care
physician's practice.

6
00:00:15,779 --> 00:00:20,891
As you already know, the average
multi-chronic disease patient,

7
00:00:20,891 --> 00:00:25,830
20% of Medicare patients that drive
half of the cost is seen each

8
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:30,871
year by 14 providers who are mostly
specialists, as shown here.

9
00:00:30,871 --> 00:00:35,632
In aggregate, all of
the multi-chronic disease patients in

10
00:00:35,632 --> 00:00:39,853
a typical PCP's practice
are seen by 86 providers.

11
00:00:39,853 --> 00:00:42,418
Again, mostly specialists.

12
00:00:42,418 --> 00:00:46,794
Keep in mind that each of these
specialists mostly focuses only on

13
00:00:46,794 --> 00:00:51,649
the particular organ or body system
they have special knowledge of, and

14
00:00:51,649 --> 00:00:53,174
are trained to treat.

15
00:00:53,174 --> 00:00:59,900
In total, the average PCP is involved
with over 200 other providers.
