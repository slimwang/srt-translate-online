00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:05,350
Let's do another one you have a sample of size 30. What are the T-critical

2
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:10,830
values for a two-tailed test with alpha equals .05. So remember with a

3
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:16,484
two-tailed test we have two critical regions, one in each tail. And since the T

4
00:00:16,484 --> 00:00:20,571
distribution is symmetrical our t critical value should be positive and

5
00:00:20,571 --> 00:00:22,523
negative what?
