00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,660
So far we have seen how OCL is used to specify invariants and

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:07,920
operations. There is another part of our analysis model that OCL can help with.

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:11,975
That's derive data. There were two places in the [UNKNOWN] model for

4
00:00:11,975 --> 00:00:17,180
the library, where derive data, was used. The Patron's age and the amount of

5
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:21,320
the overdue fine. Remember that derive data are, they're attributes,

6
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:25,280
like any other attributes but, they're going to be computed along the way,

7
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:32,439
rather than something that is a, is a set piece of data. Okay?

8
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:36,410
And the, the situation here had to do, for example, with the, Patron's age,

9
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:41,640
which is changing on a day to day basis. So, at any moment when we need the age,

10
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:46,550
we compute the value. Okay, so we need to say what value is being computed. And

11
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:50,710
the same, the same holds true for the amount of fine which changes on a day to

12
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:56,430
day basis, and depending upon how long your book is overdue. So let's,

13
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:58,690
let's do a little exercise here.

14
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:04,480
See if you can come up with a constraint in OCL or a Patron's age.

15
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:08,550
And as a hint here, there's a keyword in, in OCL called derive, and

16
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:12,000
you use that instead of pre or post interim variant. See if you can express it.
