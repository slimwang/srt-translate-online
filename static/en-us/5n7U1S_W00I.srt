Because the number e is so common in nature, such as with population growth and

2
00:00:04,035 --> 00:00:10,340
decay for example. Log base e, as I mentioned earlier, gets a special notation.

00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:15,520
Instead of writing log base e of x, we would write this. This is called the

4
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:21,480
natural log of x. Thinking about this definition of natural log or ln, what is

00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,489
its inverse?
