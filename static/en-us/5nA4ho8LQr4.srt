1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:04,734
So, in terms of a graphical interpretation, we could just add the two y values

2
00:00:04,734 --> 00:00:11,864
here together to find f plus g of 2. We would just add 8 and 3 to get 11. So,

3
00:00:11,864 --> 00:00:17,445
what do you think would be f plus g of 0? You can either evaluate these

4
00:00:17,445 --> 00:00:22,281
functions for 0, or you can use the graph. When you think you have the answer,

5
00:00:22,281 --> 00:00:23,310
enter it here.
