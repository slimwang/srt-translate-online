00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Now we've got a grammar, and we've got a parser. Let's see what it's good for.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Here's an example of parsing URLs.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Here's an official specification from the W3--the World Wide Web Consortium.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
There's a definition on their page. It's not quite in the right format that we use.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
But it was very easy to take their format and translate it into our format.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I just sort of went down their rules one-by-one.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Some of them you copy verbatim. Some of them I had to fix up a little bit.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
You can see here is the whole specification of the grammar.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
It's 40 lines or so. It's fairly involved and verbose.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
But it handles URLs.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
It was straightforward to go from the specification that they had on their website

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
to one that could be parsed by the simple parser we built.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Now, I have to say that as I was doing this, I didn't get it all right the first time.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I made a couple of types that made my grammar not work,

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
and I found this function very useful. I wrote this function to verify a grammar.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
What it does is it finds all the tokens that are on the left-hand side and on the right-hand side,

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
and then it shows them to me.

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
It shows me the nonterminals, the things that are on the left-hand side.

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
It shows me the terminals that are the right-hand side but not on the left-hand side.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Those should be the regular expressions. It shows me some suspects. What's a suspect?

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
That's a something that looks like it's the name and should appear on the left-hand side,

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
so it's alphanumeric characters, but doesn't.

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
If they've done that, it's probably because I spelled it wrong in one place

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
and tried to have the same word used twice and spelled it wrong in one place.

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Then there are the orphans.

26
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Those are the things that appear on the left-hand side but don't appear on the right-hand side.

27
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
They're useless. They're defined, but they aren't called anywhere.

28
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
As I was writing this grammar, I would call this function and say, oops, there's an error.

29
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I fixed it and called the function and say, oops, there's another error. Then I got it right.
