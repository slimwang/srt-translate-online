00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:04,710
Alright, so if I want to do some class changing, I can right click and inspect

2
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:09,654
element. And then let's see, I can open up this container. And,

3
00:00:09,654 --> 00:00:15,378
[INAUDIBLE] some heading above game.

4
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:23,069
Yeah there it is. So I'm going to turn restart button into game intro.

5
00:00:23,069 --> 00:00:28,108
[SOUND] And it moved over to the left so what's, what's going on there?

6
00:00:28,108 --> 00:00:31,210
>> Yeah so the class that was there previously was

7
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:34,550
telling the CSS what rules to use. So we change

8
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:36,580
it to a different class. So now, it's using those

9
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:41,070
rules instead of the rules that Gabrielle [UNKNOWN] originally wanted.

10
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:41,850
>> Okay, cool.
