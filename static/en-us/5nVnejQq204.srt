1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
In this unit, we looked at growth and harvesting to study fundamental concepts

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
in differential equations and simulations.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
In particular, how to find optimal values for parameters and how to find

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
which data are most critical for our simulation.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
The most fundamental concept of all, however, may be that of an equilibrium.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 99:59:59,999
This is going to play a vital role in the next unit, may be design an anti-lock breaking system.
