In the second lesson of this course,

2
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:06,100
you're going to explore the APIs of
some popular online applications.

3
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:10,370
I will point you to some documentation,
introduce you to a few tools for

API exploration and testing, and then
you will write code to utilize these

5
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:17,030
APIs inside of your own
Python applications.

6
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:17,840
So let's get started.
