[Narrator] A popular toy cipher is a monoalphabetic substitution cipher

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
where each letter in the alphabet is mapped to some substitution letter.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
This could be the same letter, could be any other letter in the alphabet,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and decryption is done by the reverse mapping.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
We provided python code to make this more specific,

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
what a monoalphabetic substitution cipher does.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
One way to prove that a monoalphabetic substitution cipher is imperfect

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
is to use Shannon's key space theorem, which says that

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
the number of keys in a perfect cipher must exceed the number of messages or be equal to it.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Assuming a 26-letter alphabet, what length message do we need to show

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
that the key space for the monoalphbetic cipher is too small to be a perfect cipher?

12
00:00:40,000 --> 99:59:59,999
For your answer give a number, which is the minimum length message needed for this proof.
