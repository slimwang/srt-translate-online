Folks, you're looking at the Babbage engine.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
It does what Charles Babbage envisioned it would do--

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
produce mathematical tables without any human intervention

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
all the way over to the print shop.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
It produces a stereotype try, which then goes to a printer to print a book

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
of logarithmic tables for example.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
This was envisioned by Charles Babbage 1849 but never built in Charles Babbage's lifetime.
