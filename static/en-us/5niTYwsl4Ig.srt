00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,964
As we stated earlier, VMware ESX and

2
00:00:02,964 --> 00:00:08,039
the Citrix XenServer are both
hypervisor- based solutions.

3
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:09,880
So is Microsoft's Hyper-V.

4
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:12,380
All of the other products are hosted.

5
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:17,199
However, it's important to note that
at KVM, the host OS switches to a,

6
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:21,260
a mode, a module in order to
assume a hypervisor-like role.

7
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:24,242
So, the rest of the operating
system really plays

8
00:00:24,242 --> 00:00:28,220
a secondary supporting role like,
like a privileged partition.
