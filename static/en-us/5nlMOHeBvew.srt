1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:05,079
So one classic study on display rules, we had students in Japan and in the U.S

2
00:00:05,079 --> 00:00:11,070
being shown medical procedure films. And these were really disgusting films.

3
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:14,986
Arms being amputated, burn graphs and so on. Now, as it turns out they saw the

4
00:00:14,986 --> 00:00:20,842
films in one of two different conditions though. Either alone or in the

5
00:00:20,842 --> 00:00:25,096
presence of an authority figure. Now, in the US, it didn't matter whether the

6
00:00:25,096 --> 00:00:28,360
students saw the film alone or in the presence of an authority figure, the

7
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:34,378
students showed real signs of disgust in either condition. But in Japan, it was

8
00:00:34,378 --> 00:00:39,480
only when they saw the film alone did the students show the disgust face.

9
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:43,140
Because in Japan there's a rule, a cultural norm that prohibits disgust

10
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:48,617
expressions in the presence of an authority figure. So instead of that they

11
00:00:48,617 --> 00:00:53,111
mask that disgust with a smile. Interestingly these smiles were not genuine

12
00:00:53,111 --> 00:00:58,400
smiles because they didn't involve the eyes. So this is a good example of how

13
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:04,012
culture influences and dictates when it's okay to express which emotion. So

14
00:01:04,012 --> 00:01:08,420
what about gender and emotion? Of course, the stereotype is that women are more

15
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:13,550
emotional than men. question is, is there any evidence for this stereotype?

16
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:17,984
Well, yes and no. So as it turns out, men and women express emotion very

17
00:01:17,984 --> 00:01:24,889
similarly, although women do in fact smile a little bit more. But women do seem

18
00:01:24,889 --> 00:01:29,021
to have an advantage in two areas. First, when talking about emotion, they're

19
00:01:29,021 --> 00:01:33,912
more precise than that. Men seem to be a little bit more vague. And secondly,

20
00:01:33,912 --> 00:01:37,816
women are better at reading emotion on people's faces and hearing it in their

21
00:01:37,816 --> 00:01:39,250
voices.
