00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,230
Let's see if you can connect time,
energy, and

2
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:07,050
power as a function of the algorithm
a little bit more directly.

3
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:10,960
Here's the main high level
difference between time and energy.

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:15,390
You can reduce time by hiding it or
overlapping it using, for example,

5
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:16,730
parallelism.

6
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:18,360
Energy is different.

7
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:22,320
With respect to energy,
every operation has some energy cost and

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,890
you have to pay for
that cost for every operation.

9
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:29,140
Now let's go back to our
simplest model of parallelism.

10
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:32,500
That was the work-span or
multi-threaded DAG model.

11
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:33,080
In that model,

12
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:36,600
you had a bunch of abstract algorithmic
costs that you thought about.

13
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,090
Do you remember them?

14
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:41,160
One was work, another was span.

15
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,220
There was also the ratio
of work to span,

16
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:45,030
or the average available parallelism.

17
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:49,310
There was also the execution
time given P processors.

18
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:51,500
For time, we had both lower bounds and

19
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:54,290
upper bounds, the upper bound
coming from Brent's theorem.

20
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:56,820
And there was also Speedup.

21
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:59,340
Note, that this definition of
Speedup is a little bit relaxed

22
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:01,483
in the sense that it's (Self-) Speedup.

23
00:01:01,483 --> 00:01:06,320
For (Self-) Speedup, I don't use the
best sequential time in the numerator.

24
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,460
Instead, I use the time of
the parallel algorithm when

25
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:11,680
run on a single processor.

26
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,233
But remember, if your algorithm is
work optimal, then self speed-up and

27
00:01:15,233 --> 00:01:18,460
conventional speed-up relative
to the best sequential case

28
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:21,260
are basically the same, asymptotically.

29
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:23,250
Okay, my question is this.

30
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:24,905
Of these five five measures,

31
00:01:24,905 --> 00:01:28,775
which one is the best metric
to use to quantify energy?

32
00:01:28,775 --> 00:01:30,945
Now, think about these
informal definitions and

33
00:01:30,945 --> 00:01:33,685
your options carefully
before you answer.

34
00:01:33,685 --> 00:01:35,305
And I want you to
choose just one option.
