00:00:01,359 --> 00:00:05,390
The answer is, the right movement is stochastic, so

2
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:07,100
it may fail, so that means we may stay in

3
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:08,680
the left and we may move to the right.

4
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:13,160
And the world is dynamic, which means, dirt may appear

5
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:16,520
in either the left or the right location. And

6
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:18,390
we didn't know for sure if there was dirt or

7
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:22,760
not in the right, so that means any of the

8
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:26,450
eight possible states belong to the belief state for the

9
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:32,850
update, for the or rather for the prediction of moving right. That means any of

10
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:38,190
the eight states belong to the belief state for the prediction of moving right.
