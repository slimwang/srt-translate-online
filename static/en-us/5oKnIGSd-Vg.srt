You've seen how to use breakpoints in single stepping, to run your program in

2
00:00:03,466 --> 00:00:07,410
slow motion. And of course what you really want to be able to do is look at

3
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:11,862
variables. I'm going to rerun the program until I hit this breakpoint, here I

4
00:00:11,862 --> 00:00:15,168
am, and over here in this window, you can see the settings of the local

5
00:00:15,168 --> 00:00:21,373
variables. You can see that count is 0, end is 3, and this Boolean inside vowel

6
00:00:21,373 --> 00:00:26,785
group is false. Up here you can see the settings of the instance variables, of

7
00:00:26,785 --> 00:00:32,512
the class whose method we're currently in. Go ahead at home and do exactly what

8
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:38,336
I just did. Run the program until this breakpoint. Then click continue one more

9
00:00:38,336 --> 00:00:42,112
time until this breakpoint is reached for the second time, and tell me what is

10
00:00:42,112 --> 00:00:45,400
the value of end when you reach it.
