00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,220
Since our concern in this course is with operating systems, I'm going to

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:06,130
leave you to explore most of the physical layer on your own,

3
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:08,970
and focus on the part that has implications for the operating system

4
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:11,280
at the edge of the network, and end users like you and

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,380
me. The most important piece of hardware for us, then, is the

6
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:18,850
network interface card, or NIC. This typically is a direct memory access,

7
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:22,540
or DMA device. Meaning that once connected to the memory bus, it

8
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:25,490
has the ability to read and write from memory, on its own,

9
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:28,930
independent of the CPU. Typically, the CPU specifies through the

10
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:32,490
bus, the range of memory it wants to be sent, whether

11
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:34,510
it's a read of write, and then sets the go

12
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:38,000
bit, to let the NIC begin. The NIC then tries to

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,810
copy the data, as requested. Because the NIC controller puts

14
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:44,780
all of the copy instructions on the bus, the CPU doesn't

15
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:47,660
have to. He can go about his business, to the extent

16
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:51,080
that he finds the information he needs in the CPU cache,

17
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,695
there won't be any contention on the memory

18
00:00:52,695 --> 00:00:55,490
bus. Only when the NIC finishes either sending

19
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:57,440
or receiving a packet, need he bother the

20
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,130
CPU with an interrupt. The NIC controller is

21
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:02,720
also responsible for putting hardware specific headers and

22
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,410
footers on the data. For physical ethernet, this

23
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:08,890
would include an inter-frame gap of silence, and

24
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:11,250
a special preamble, to indicate the startup of frame.
