00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Welcome back!

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,000
This is unit 4 of programming languages, and if we turn the clock back to last time,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
we were posed the following question.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Given a string S, like a webpage or some embedded JavaScript or any program,

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
and a formal grammar describing our desired language,

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
a former grammar for HTML or JavaScript,

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
we want to know if that string S is in the language of G?

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
To do this, we use 2 key techniques--lexical analysis, which broke the string down

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
into a stream of tokens, and syntactic analysis or parsing,

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
which takes a string of tokens and checks to see if they adhere to,

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
if they conform to a context-free grammar.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
While we're on the subject of time and grammars--grammars that may possibly

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
be ambiguous, let me introduce you to a phrase that you may not have run into yet.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
The phrase is, "Time flies like an arrow. Fruit flies like a banana."

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The ambiguity trick here is that time is a noun, flies is a verb--time flies--

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
and "like an arrow" is the modification.

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
So here I've got time flying.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
You can tell because it's got labels, and those labels are always to be trusted.

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:21,000
So you might think, based on parallel structure, that fruit is a noun and verb is flies.

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
So here I've got a picture of an apple with wings,

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
and their flying in the manner of a banana.

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
But in fact, fruit flies is the noun.

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
They are little insects that go after fruit, and this time, like is the verb.

24
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Fruit flies go after the banana. They enjoy the banana.

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
This is the sort of ambiguity that we can run into in a natural language like English.

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
We're going to have to deal with that same sort of issue in programming languages,

27
00:01:43,000 --> 99:59:59,999
like in JavaScript or Python.
