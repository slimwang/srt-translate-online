00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:05,110
In modern browsers, there is a cool
feature that you could use; autofill.

2
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:07,780
Users appreciate when
a website save them

3
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:13,138
time by automatically filling common
fields like name, email, and more.

4
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:17,710
Plus autofill helps to reduce
potential input errors

5
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:20,290
like what Cam experienced before.

6
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:24,055
Browsers use many heuristics to
determine which field they could

7
00:00:24,055 --> 00:00:29,320
auto-populate based on a previously
specified data by the user.

8
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:34,250
You, the developer, can give hints
to the browser by providing both

9
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:39,060
the name attribute and the auto complete
attribute on each input element.

10
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:44,180
For example, to give the browser a hint
that it should auto complete the form

11
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:47,770
with a user's name,
email, and phone number.

12
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:50,870
You should use these
auto complete attributes.

13
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:54,810
Let's have a look on the name or
should I say the first name,

14
00:00:54,810 --> 00:01:00,080
the input element has an AutoComplete
attribute equal fname.

15
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:04,410
On the email input,
we have the autocomplete equal email.

16
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:06,880
And on the phone input element,

17
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,730
I'll have the tell AutoComplete
like you could see here.

18
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:12,250
Let's see it in action.

19
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:16,650
When I start typing the address, you
could see that the browser is already

20
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:20,100
remember what was typed here before.

21
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:22,150
And now with a click on the enter,

22
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:25,980
I'm filling the shipping
address with just a few clicks.

23
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:27,400
Awesome.

24
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,690
In the instructor notes,

25
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:32,530
you could find a massive list
of auto-complete attributes.

26
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:37,180
Take a look and see how you could
automate life for your users.

27
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:40,030
And put a big smile on their faces.

28
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:43,227
Now it's your turn to add
some AutoComplete attributes.
