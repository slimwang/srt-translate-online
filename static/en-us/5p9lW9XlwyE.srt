1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Now let's do a final quiz here using again distance from triviality

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
so that you have a chance to understand this concept a bit better.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Let's consider 3-SAT this time.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
You already know that 3-SAT is NP-complete,

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and you 2-SAT is contained in P,

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
so 2-SAT is polynomial time solvable.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
So let's consider 2 Boolean formulas here.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
This is the first one here, x1 or not x2 or not x3

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and x1 or not x5 or x6

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and x2 or x5 or x7

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
and x3 or not x6 or not x7.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Now it's not really difficult to see if either of these 2 formulas

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
has a satisfying assignment or not,

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
and that's not really the point.

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
What I would like you to think about is the following:

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Considering x1, x2, and x3,

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
which of these Boolean formulas is closer to triviality,

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
and by triviality I mean

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
which one of these is closer to a 2-SAT formula.

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
So look at x1, x2, and x3

21
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
and consider what would happen if you were to assign them true or false values.

22
00:01:06,000 --> 99:59:59,999
And then you just check the appropriate box.
