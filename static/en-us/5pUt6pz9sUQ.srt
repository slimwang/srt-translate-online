00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,029
Assuming a horizontal axis,

2
00:00:03,029 --> 00:00:08,429
spacing refers to the horizontal
space between the arranged views.

3
00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:10,689
There's one catch with
the spacing property.

4
00:00:10,689 --> 00:00:15,009
It takes precedence over the views
intrinsic count and size.

5
00:00:15,009 --> 00:00:19,545
So if there is not enough space
available Auto Layout would rather

6
00:00:19,545 --> 00:00:22,731
shrink the view that shrink the spacing.

7
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:25,668
One last thing,
the spacing can be negative and

8
00:00:25,667 --> 00:00:27,879
that would make the views overlap.
