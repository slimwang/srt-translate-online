00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:05,600
If you guessed that the regression line goes through the means, the mean of x

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:11,020
and the mean of y, you're correct. The line of best fit will always go through

3
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:15,750
the means of the two variables that we're interested in. Since the mean of x is

4
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:20,650
the best estimate for the x values, and the mean of y is the best estimate for

5
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:24,650
the y values, the best fit line must go through this point.
