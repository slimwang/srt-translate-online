00:00:00,522 --> 00:00:02,610
So we've gone through
a fair amount of code.

2
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:06,220
Let's go ahead, and put it all together
in our database_setup.py file.

3
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:08,800
Let me start with this
configuration code that goes at

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,610
the beginning of our file,
and put it where it belongs.

5
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:15,060
I can also take this code at the end,
and put it at the end of the file.

6
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:18,360
Next, let's put our two class
definitions, right where they belong.

7
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,456
Next, we need to add
our table information.

8
00:00:20,456 --> 00:00:24,180
And finally, our mappers.

9
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:25,530
Putting all this code together,

10
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:28,710
should give us a Python file
that looks something like this.

11
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:32,530
So, if we navigate to the directory,
where our database_setup.py file live,

12
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:36,785
and run it using the Python command,
we should get something like this.

13
00:00:36,785 --> 00:00:37,725
Looking in the same folder,

14
00:00:37,725 --> 00:00:41,625
where we have our code,
we see a newrestaurantmenu.db file.

15
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:43,365
This is our empty database.

16
00:00:43,365 --> 00:00:45,015
Now that we have an empty database,

17
00:00:45,015 --> 00:00:47,015
let's figure out how to populate
it with some information.
