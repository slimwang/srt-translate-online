1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,830
You just learned a lot of new things
about bootstrap in order to complete

2
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:05,070
this project.

3
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:09,600
But how would somebody who already knows
bootstrap approach our same problem?

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,330
Let's ask Jacques and find out.

5
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:14,140
To continue our series
of throwing random

6
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:18,120
things at him to get his attention,
let throw this ginormous penguin.

7
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:27,040
So we're going to actually take
this design and go through

8
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:31,590
it with Bootstrap, and turn it into at
least a first pass with HTML and CSS.

9
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:39,050
Okay, so here's an image that
we've been given by a designer.

10
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:43,190
And I'm just going to go through the
process that I go through when I take

11
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:45,964
something like this and
turn it into a web page.

12
00:00:45,964 --> 00:00:47,171
I'm going to be using Bootstrap.

13
00:00:47,171 --> 00:00:51,279
And I have a lot of working knowledge
of Bootstrap so when I use classes from

14
00:00:51,279 --> 00:00:55,402
Bootstrap, don't worry if you don't
know them off the top of your head.

15
00:00:55,402 --> 00:00:57,650
I use them almost everyday, so
they are right there for me.

16
00:00:57,650 --> 00:01:00,690
But you can go look at
the documentation for Bootstrap.

17
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:03,570
It is very complete and
they have all kinds of demos and

18
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:05,720
things like that you
can really dive into.

19
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,590
So if there's something
you want to do and

20
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:10,680
you want to see if Bootstrap does it,
go check out those documents.

21
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:15,570
All right, so basically everything on
the web is in boxes at the moment.

22
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:19,000
So we start with the biggest box,
that's our browser.

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,170
The whole page here and
we'll work down from there.

24
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:24,112
If I'm looking at a design like this,

25
00:01:24,112 --> 00:01:27,450
I'm going to start picking
out those boxes and so

26
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:32,650
the first one would be this topic
area here with the logo and the name.

27
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:35,680
There's an HR, a horizontal rule,
that cuts through everything here.

28
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,150
We have this center area
with the main image.

29
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:43,430
And then we've got a box down
here that has the featured work.

30
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:46,370
And then sort of, the contents of that.

31
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:48,330
And so that'll be my first cut.

32
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:53,580
And when I'm looking at that,
I'm also seeing for instance

33
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:59,370
in this featured work area, there
are three boxes, three sets of content.

34
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:00,330
They're all identical and

35
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:05,260
I'll probably just be splitting that
whole role up into these three columns.

36
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:08,850
Same with the top here where we
a box that the logo's in and

37
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:11,162
a box that the name is in.

38
00:02:11,162 --> 00:02:14,260
So I go through it and I look at first.

39
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:19,470
It's really helpful to work through
the image in your head first and

40
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:21,110
sort of understand where your boxes are.

41
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:22,930
It'll make coding it up a lot easier.

42
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:24,830
Okay.

43
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:26,540
So jumping into the code here.

44
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:29,430
This is sort of just
my jumping off point.

45
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:31,333
This is mostly just boiler plate.

46
00:02:31,333 --> 00:02:32,690
I'll walk through it
really quickly here.

47
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:36,150
We're basically just telling
the browser that yes we're HTML.

48
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:38,160
We're setting our doc type.

49
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,179
We're saying the language
in this case is English.

50
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,250
We're setting our character set here.

51
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:46,560
That basically just makes sure that the
browser is displaying the characters in

52
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,210
the way that I intend it to.

53
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:53,060
The next meta tag down here is
just telling Internet Explorer

54
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:56,830
use the best engine you've got, give
the user the most up to date experience.

55
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:03,090
The meta tag here is for mobile and
what we're saying is just sort of,

56
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:06,110
how to display the page
initially when it loads.

57
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:10,698
There's a title tag,
you should always name your pages and

58
00:03:10,698 --> 00:03:13,744
we'll call this the Puppy Portfolio.

59
00:03:13,744 --> 00:03:17,371
The thing below that is actually us
bringing Bootstrap into this page and

60
00:03:17,371 --> 00:03:19,987
that's pretty much it for
the head of our document,

61
00:03:19,987 --> 00:03:24,065
the body is where we're going to
start putting in the page itself.

62
00:03:24,065 --> 00:03:26,030
So when we start up with Bootstrap,

63
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:28,060
we're going to put everything
inside of Bootstrap's container.

64
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:33,800
And then going back to our mock here
we'll just start with this top section.

65
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:38,312
So I'm going to make a row with
a logo and the name in it.

66
00:03:41,784 --> 00:03:44,940
Now, I'm going to just split
this right down the middle.

67
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:47,930
We might decide to do it a little
off-center something like that but for

68
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:49,940
right now, I'm just going to
cut it down the middle.

69
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:53,440
Everything in Bootstrap
is done in 12 columns, so

70
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:56,715
the whole width is divided up
into 12 different columns.

71
00:03:56,715 --> 00:04:00,245
We'll start out splitting
it in half six for each.

72
00:04:00,245 --> 00:04:03,915
We'll drop in our logo here
in images it'll be logo.png.

73
00:04:03,915 --> 00:04:06,586
Always make sure you set Alt text.

74
00:04:06,586 --> 00:04:09,930
Alt text allows people to see and
understand your website.

75
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:13,618
When maybe the image didn't load or
if they're visually impaired,

76
00:04:13,618 --> 00:04:17,434
their screen reader will read the
contents of this instead of obviously

77
00:04:17,434 --> 00:04:19,676
being able to display
that image to them.

78
00:04:21,394 --> 00:04:25,098
All right, so
here we're going to put in the name.

79
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:26,200
This whole area of here.

80
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,453
This Jane Doette and her subtitle.

81
00:04:40,538 --> 00:04:43,227
And I'm just going to put these
in heading tags right now.

82
00:04:45,294 --> 00:04:50,119
The h1 in general is the most important
thing, the title, the largest piece,

83
00:04:50,119 --> 00:04:53,950
the largest heading on the website and
then go down from there.

84
00:04:55,640 --> 00:05:00,840
So now, if we go over to our page,
we actually have our logo and

85
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,510
we have our name.

86
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:04,030
But you'll notice that the name doesn't,

87
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:06,260
we're not really looking a whole
lot like our mock at the moment.

88
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:10,910
The mock is right aligned and
capitalized and

89
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:13,410
here we are left aligned and
normally capitalized.

90
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:18,341
And so if we apply a style to this md-6

91
00:05:18,341 --> 00:05:22,930
div here, the container of the name and

92
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:28,320
the subtitle, we're actually going to
apply those styles across everything.

93
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:33,179
Now, Bootstrap has some
nice built-in methods,

94
00:05:33,179 --> 00:05:36,690
text-right and text-uppercase.

95
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:39,540
And those will pull all
the text to the right side, and

96
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:43,300
those will set the text
to all be uppercase and

97
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:47,000
again, don't expect to know all
of these going out the gate.

98
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,120
Bootstraps documentation is
really good about this and if you

99
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,620
browsing through there you'll just pick
up things every time you look at it.

100
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:57,700
So now refreshing our page there we go
now, we've our text is on the right.

101
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:00,750
Everything's capitalized and
we'll move on from there.

102
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:04,690
So the next thing I'm looking at in
the mock is this horizontal rule and

103
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:05,860
we'll drop that in next.

104
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:15,020
All right, so you'll notice
that the horizontal rule for

105
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:19,090
boot strap is very thin,
we can come back and address that later.

106
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:21,930
Right now, we're just going to
go through with just the vanilla

107
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:23,260
capabilities of Bootstrap and

108
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:26,560
we'll worry about fine tuning and
doing all that kind of stuff later.

109
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,704
So going back to our mock the next
thing up is this big sort of central

110
00:06:30,704 --> 00:06:32,290
image here.

111
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:35,690
That'll be taking up all 12 columns and
we'll drop that in.

112
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:40,160
So source of our images
will be in images.

113
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,180
So now, if we go to our page.

114
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:47,120
There's a puppy, one of the things
that you'll notice is that it's

115
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,270
actually coming off the edge
of the screen here.

116
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:50,750
It's actually overflowing
it's container.

117
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:57,360
So we can go and we can use Bootstrap
class responsive which will make

118
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:02,180
sure that, that image pulls itself in to
fit inside of its parent container so

119
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:07,180
that that the 12 columns,
this image now fits inside of it.

120
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:08,690
So there's our first puppy.

121
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:10,730
Now, the puppies
are starting to make sense.

122
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:12,280
Let's go back to our mock.

123
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,830
The next section we're going to work
on here is just this Featured Work.

124
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:21,020
So we'll considered Featured Work
to be its own 12 columns wide and

125
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:25,760
then we'll have each one of these sort
of featured work elements be their

126
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:30,270
own four columns wide each,
col 4 each and we'll just split it up.

127
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:32,373
And we're going to just work
through it top to bottom.

128
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:42,960
Featured Work is sort of the second
most important title on our page.

129
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,460
It's a section heading here,
so we're going to use an h2.

130
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:50,075
And you can flip back and forth in
between your browser and your coding

131
00:07:50,075 --> 00:07:53,771
environment to make sure that sort
of just sanity check along the way.

132
00:08:14,388 --> 00:08:17,537
Well when we have repeated
elements like this,

133
00:08:17,537 --> 00:08:21,787
we can actually just code them up
once and copy and paste that it,

134
00:08:21,787 --> 00:08:27,665
in this case a couple x more times, and
then update the elements within it.

135
00:08:27,665 --> 00:08:29,811
It'll save us a little bit of typing and
a little bit of time.

136
00:08:37,427 --> 00:08:39,644
All right, so there's our puppy.

137
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:41,873
There's our title.

138
00:08:41,873 --> 00:08:48,518
So let's add Getting
that image response and

139
00:08:48,518 --> 00:08:52,370
we'll just make sure that puppy stays
inside of his little container.

140
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:55,240
So now, we've got one of them.

141
00:08:55,240 --> 00:09:00,265
We can just copy paste over a few
more times and then modify those and

142
00:09:00,265 --> 00:09:04,508
we should be coming up close
to what our mock looks like.

143
00:09:04,508 --> 00:09:08,140
So let's go grab that text and
we'll just do some updates here.

144
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:12,990
Now, I'm copying and pasting to save
myself a little bit of time typing.

145
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:18,760
But make sure when you're copy paste
that you are actually updating

146
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,590
everything that you need to update.

147
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:24,930
It's very easy to introduce
errors when you're copying and

148
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:29,536
pasting because you might not see
one of the minor differences.

149
00:09:29,536 --> 00:09:33,750
So maybe it's not changing this image
source or not changing the Alt text.

150
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:34,800
Just go through and

151
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,780
make sure that you're really
thorough when you copy paste.

152
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:40,510
It's a shortcut but make sure
you don't take it too casually.

153
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:41,010
All right.

154
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,500
So there are our featured work.
