Sometimes mutators are useful. But they can be tricky to think about. For

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:06,630
example, what does this sequence of statements make? First, we create a

3
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:10,970
variable box of type Rectangle, and put a Rectangle in it. Then, we create

4
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:15,890
another variable of the same type, but I want it to be the same. So, I'm just

5
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:19,590
going to use box. Now, I actually realize I need to get the original box out of

6
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:22,580
the way. So, I'm just going to translate it. So, this would look something

7
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:26,260
like, we would create a rectangle. And then, we create another rectangle that's

8
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:30,800
the same. Then, we translate it out of the way. What is the value of box.getX?

9
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,832
What is the value of box2.getX?
