1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:01,770
So what was your answer, David?

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:05,320
>> So comparing the X coordinate of
the various cases I found that there's

3
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:10,460
two cases that match the X coordinate
of the new problem, A and C.

4
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:13,930
Comparing the Y coordinates,
though, A is all the way up here,

5
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:19,090
so I would choose C which matches
the X and the Y coordinate exactly.

6
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:19,660
>> That's right, David.
