We've already talked a little bit about Cohen's d named after the statistician

2
00:00:03,436 --> 00:00:07,695
Jacob Cohen. Cohen's d is an effect size measure, which gives us the

3
00:00:07,695 --> 00:00:12,530
standardized mean difference. Lets break this apart. We already know what it a

4
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:17,780
mean difference is. Mean difference is simply the difference between two means.

5
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:21,599
For example, between X bar and mu, as in the one-sample z-test and the

6
00:00:21,599 --> 00:00:26,257
one-sample t-test. The word standardized, you may recall from our discussion of

7
00:00:26,257 --> 00:00:30,273
z-scores. Remember, when we called z-scores standardized scores, what that

8
00:00:30,273 --> 00:00:33,628
meant was we were taking a difference between a raw score and the mean, and

9
00:00:33,628 --> 00:00:39,582
dividing by the standard deviation. Cohen's d does something very similar. It

10
00:00:39,582 --> 00:00:43,913
takes a difference in this case, in the one sample case between X bar and Mu

11
00:00:43,913 --> 00:00:49,790
and it divides by the standard deviation of the sample. So, it's called the

12
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:52,390
standardized mean difference because we have a mean difference and then it's

13
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:57,808
turned into standard deviation unit. So, the interpretation of Cohen's d is how

14
00:00:57,808 --> 00:01:03,700
far apart these means are in standard deviation units.
