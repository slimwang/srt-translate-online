1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:05,140
The correct answers are date/time and
price of the stock.

2
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:09,590
Let me mention a couple of
reasons why some of these others

3
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:10,660
aren't correct answers.

4
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:17,240
Sure, the company name is important to
know, but it doesn't change over time,

5
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:21,970
so there's no need to allocate space for

6
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:25,470
this information every day over time.

7
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:27,520
Company's home town, same thing.

8
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:33,745
Number of employees can be
important data and actually it's

9
00:00:33,745 --> 00:00:40,005
Information that is sometimes provided
via proprietary data feeds, but

10
00:00:40,005 --> 00:00:46,025
it's not something you typically find in
a historical data file of stock prices.
