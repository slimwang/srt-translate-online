Figuring out a good way to divide a program into modules is one of the toughest

2
00:00:04,326 --> 00:00:08,555
skills and biggest engineering challenges a programmer has. To get you started

3
00:00:08,555 --> 00:00:12,272
thinking about this, here's a quiz about the kinds of properties we want our

4
00:00:12,272 --> 00:00:15,863
modules to have, if they're going to help us Manage Complexity. Check all the

5
00:00:15,863 --> 00:00:19,751
answers that are correct. The choices are; All modules should be of similar

6
00:00:19,751 --> 00:00:24,224
size, No module should be larger than one programmer can understand, There

7
00:00:24,224 --> 00:00:28,734
should be no dependency between modules. Modules should provide narrow, well

8
00:00:28,734 --> 00:00:29,903
defined interfaces.
