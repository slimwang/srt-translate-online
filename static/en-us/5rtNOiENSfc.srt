So here is another simple question for all of you to ponder about.

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:06,800
And this might be something, you know, computer science people that some of

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:09,160
you are might actually have a very good sense of.

4
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:12,400
How many bits do we need to represent a pixel,

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,940
if the intensity values range from 0 to 255 that we've talked about?

6
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:18,710
Please choose one of the right answers here.
