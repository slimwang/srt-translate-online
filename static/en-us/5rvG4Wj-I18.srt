00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:04,043
We can see that there's a common factor of x minus 5 in the numerator and in the

2
00:00:04,043 --> 00:00:09,079
denominator. So we know those simplify to 1. This would leave us with x minus 6

3
00:00:09,079 --> 00:00:13,482
in the numerator and x minus 4 in the denominator. Great job on that

00:00:13,482 --> 00:00:14,762
simplification.
