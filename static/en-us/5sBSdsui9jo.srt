00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,105
Remember, when we start this problem we always start this by identifying our

2
00:00:04,117 --> 00:00:08,300
unknown and in this case it was the angle. We don't know the angle, so we call

3
00:00:08,312 --> 00:00:12,505
it x. Next we want to identify an equation in words. The supplement of an angle

4
00:00:12,517 --> 00:00:16,550
is 40 more than twice its complement. These words actually represents our

5
00:00:16,562 --> 00:00:20,405
equation. We have the supplement on the left and 40 more than twice the

6
00:00:20,417 --> 00:00:24,943
complement on the right. This word is often serves as the word equals. This

7
00:00:24,955 --> 00:00:29,763
allows us to set the supplement equal to 40 more than twice the compliment. The

8
00:00:29,775 --> 00:00:34,583
supplement of our unknown angle would be 180 minus x, and the compliment of our

9
00:00:34,595 --> 00:00:39,292
unknown angle would be 90 minus x. Now we solve this equation like before. We

10
00:00:39,304 --> 00:00:44,275
distribute the positive 2 to get 180 minus 2x. Then we combine like terms to get

11
00:00:44,287 --> 00:00:48,765
220. Next, we add 2x to both sides and we get 180 plus x equals 220. I've

12
00:00:48,777 --> 00:00:53,620
rewritten this statement over here and my last step, I just subtract 180 from

13
00:00:53,632 --> 00:00:58,460
both sides. So x is 40 degrees. If you got that one right, great work. You've

14
00:00:58,472 --> 00:01:03,725
really come a long way in understanding equations and expressions. This stuff is

15
00:01:03,737 --> 00:01:08,490
pretty tough. The last thing we want to do is make sure our answer is correct.

16
00:01:08,597 --> 00:01:13,515
The supplement of 40 degrees is 140 degrees, since these two add up to 180. And

17
00:01:13,527 --> 00:01:18,440
the compliment of our angle is 50 degrees. So let's compare these results with

18
00:01:18,452 --> 00:01:23,340
what we've started with. Is this complement 40 more than twice our supplement?

19
00:01:23,532 --> 00:01:29,621
If I double the complement, I get 100 degrees. And if I add 40 to it, I get 140

20
00:01:29,633 --> 00:01:32,940
degrees. So, yeah, that's my supplement.
