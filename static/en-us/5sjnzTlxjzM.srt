00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,360
One of the main things
professional prototypers and

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:05,530
UX engineers do is build
out prototypes in code.

3
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:11,380
Often, we use things like Framer.js,
Sublime Text, Android Studio, or Xcode.

4
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:14,750
With these tools, we can make
prototypes of arbitrary fidelity.

5
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:18,620
This is really useful when you have a
particular feature that needs to be seen

6
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:19,410
to be understood.

7
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:23,120
Often, users will have trouble
understanding such a feature

8
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:25,570
from a low or medium fidelity prototype

9
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:28,420
since it doesn't always come
through in those mediums.

10
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:32,549
By building out a minimum viable version
of that feature, we can test whether it

11
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:35,320
makes sense to build a production
quality version later on.

12
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:38,920
Another use case that makes
code prototypes vital

13
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:41,680
is dealing realistically
with user input.

14
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,450
We use this when making prototypes for

15
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:47,430
Google Maps, we want to understand how
the changes impact a user's ability to

16
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:49,950
find the information
they're looking for.

17
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:52,250
Building a prototype that
leverages real data and

18
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:57,220
user input can provide valuable insight
into how a user approaches the app.

19
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:59,970
Remember, that Jeremy wanted
to type his information

20
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:02,100
when presented with our
inVision prototype.
