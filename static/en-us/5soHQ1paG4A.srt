00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,330
On the subject of sizing,
there are some CSS units

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:07,350
that you may not have heard of, but
which are now really widely supported.

3
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:10,540
How about if you want an image
to responsively cover the whole

4
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:12,210
height of the viewport?

5
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:16,890
Now, you can always do that by setting
the height of the image to 100%.

6
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:19,880
But that only works if
the height of the HTML and

7
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:23,156
the body elements are also set to 100%.

8
00:00:23,156 --> 00:00:28,340
A simple way is to use the VH unit,
which stands for viewport height.

9
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:33,044
One VH unit corresponds to
1% of the viewport height,

10
00:00:33,044 --> 00:00:37,400
and so 100 VH means 100% height.

11
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:41,250
You can do the same with VW for
viewport width.

12
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:46,203
Here you can see we've set
the width of the image to be 100vw,

13
00:00:46,203 --> 00:00:48,792
100% of the viewport width.

14
00:00:48,792 --> 00:00:52,460
And you can see that it
resizes responsibly.

15
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:56,640
Another common responsive use case is
when you want an image to resize to

16
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,080
fit the smaller of the height or
the width of the viewport.

17
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:03,443
The vmin unit, viewport minimum,

18
00:01:03,443 --> 00:01:08,580
corresponds to 1% of the viewport
width or height, whichever is smaller.

19
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,510
If you set both the width and

20
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:16,250
the height to 100vmin,
you'll get the effect you're after.

21
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:19,330
How about if you want an image
to cover the whole viewport but

22
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:22,300
without stretching or squashing?

23
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:24,530
For this you can use the vmax unit,

24
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:29,960
which corresponds to 1% of the viewport
width or height, whichever is greater.

25
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:36,480
So, if you set both the height and
the width to 100vmax,

26
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:40,795
the image responsively resizes
to cover the viewport.
