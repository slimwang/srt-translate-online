1
00:00:00,495 --> 00:00:02,540
Philip did really really well
throughout the interview.

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:06,830
He was able to make sure that he was
communicating what he was thinking

3
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:07,810
all the time.

4
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:11,220
So I never worry that he had
no idea what was going on.

5
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:15,720
He went into great depth when I asked
him a question and he was usually on

6
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:20,270
point with run times and thinking
about how much space things take up.

7
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:22,430
So the three things he did well were,

8
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:26,000
he was great at making sure was
communicating his thoughts,

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,930
being very specific about run times,
and memory space.

10
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:34,850
And I'd say the third thing that he
did really well was when needed he

11
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:38,200
put out a diagram and made sure it
was very clear what he was saying.

12
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:42,440
Things that I think he
could've done better,

13
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:48,480
where I think he needed his
testing on the first question.

14
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:53,510
The fact that he wasn't using
the syntax of a testing library would

15
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:56,860
show to an interviewer that he hasn't
written that many tests, potentially.

16
00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:01,500
So using the actual syntax of Python
testing library would be one thing

17
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,000
that would be important.

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,129
Number two would be

19
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:11,690
making sure he has the runtimes of basic
things like using data structures.

20
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:14,670
He ended up being fine in the end and
he ended up driving the right runtime.

21
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:18,880
But making sure that's down pat
is something interviewers usually

22
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,280
are looking for.

23
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,950
And I'd say the last thing is as
a full stat candidate, companies

24
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:28,113
are usually looking for people who can
not only work in the back end which

25
00:01:28,113 --> 00:01:32,710
Philip clearly shows he can do, but
also work on the front end well also.

26
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:35,810
I think at the end of the Google
question where Phillip said,

27
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:37,700
not too sure about how
the rendering works.

28
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:41,500
That would indicate that he's more
backend leaning, and a real really

29
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:45,060
really strong full stat candidate would
have been able to do that part as well.
