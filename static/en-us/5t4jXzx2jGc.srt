1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:04,610
So we're going to talk about another big
cyber security incident that happened in

2
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:10,050
the later part of 2014, and
it involved Sony Pictures.

3
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:12,730
There was a movie called,
The Interview, and

4
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:17,110
it didn't show the North Korean
leader in positive light.

5
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:19,640
Just before the movie was
going to be released,

6
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:22,872
Sony Pictures' networks were hacked.

7
00:00:22,872 --> 00:00:27,520
We're going to use that incident to
explore our security mindset that

8
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:28,735
we're talking about.

9
00:00:28,735 --> 00:00:31,805
So the first question is,
what was the threat source?

10
00:00:31,805 --> 00:00:36,155
What was the goal of the attack, and
what happened as a result of the attack?

11
00:00:36,155 --> 00:00:39,095
Think about, again,
why would someone want to do it,

12
00:00:39,095 --> 00:00:40,515
and what did they accomplish?
