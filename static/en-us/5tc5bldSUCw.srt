As we discussed in the last lesson, one

2
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:04,850
of the first challenges of developing for mobile

3
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:08,109
devices is the screen. As mobile developers, we

4
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:10,740
need to design pages that can adapt across various

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:14,570
screen sizes and scenarios. This lesson will prepare

6
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:17,630
you for building fluid layouts, designs that can adapt

7
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:20,590
across different screen sizes. And hopefully we'll break

8
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:22,860
the bad habits of designing to the fixed page.
