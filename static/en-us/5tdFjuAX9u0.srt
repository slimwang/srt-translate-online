00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,692
>> There should be an equal to sign here, because the mean equals the median

2
00:00:04,692 --> 00:00:09,403
equals the mode. We can see that the mode occurs here, in the bin where the

3
00:00:09,403 --> 00:00:13,871
frequency is highest. But also, you can see that the distribution is

4
00:00:13,871 --> 00:00:18,849
symmetrical. Therefore, the mean and the median will both occur pretty much

5
00:00:18,849 --> 00:00:22,536
right in the center. This data is normally distributed.
