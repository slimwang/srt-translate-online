1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
If we sum all of those up, you get 50, so the mean is 5.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The mean is always precisely determined.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
The median is a bit more difficult to compute.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
If you sort the numbers, you get this sequence here.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Both the 3 and the 4 sit in the center,

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
so I accept both as valid answers, either 3 or 4.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
The mode in this case happens to be 9.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
But realize had there been one fewer 9,

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
there would have been other candidates for the mode as well.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
So, with one less 9,

11
00:00:33,000 --> 99:59:59,999
2, 3, and 9 would have all been valid answers for the mode.
