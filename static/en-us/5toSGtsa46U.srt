1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:04,140
Hopefully, your analytics dashboard
is now showing some activity in

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:07,960
the shopping behavior and
checkout behavior dashboards.

3
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:11,960
But so far, the checkout
process has been very simple.

4
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:19,250
The steps are, view product, add to
cart, start checkout and purchase.

5
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:21,390
But there are some steps missing.

6
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:24,040
Where do we send the tasty dinner?

7
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,180
And what are the payment details?

8
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:29,490
The checkout process itself
is a multi step process.

9
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:33,550
You have to get the shipping address,
get payment address,

10
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:40,225
get payment details,
confirm the details, review order,

11
00:00:40,225 --> 00:00:45,725
and then finally, do the purchase.

12
00:00:49,005 --> 00:00:52,095
So here's an example of a checkout
process with a bunch of steps.

13
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:55,250
Start the checkout.

14
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:56,370
Get the customer info.

15
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:59,134
Get the billing info.

16
00:00:59,134 --> 00:01:01,270
Let the customer review the cart.

17
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:03,230
Confirm the checkout.

18
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:06,670
And there would be one more step
which is to complete the purchase.

19
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:10,640
There are two things you have to do to
display the checkout steps in analytics.

20
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,209
You have to update your code to include

21
00:01:13,209 --> 00:01:16,673
the step number when your
app sends a check out hit.

22
00:01:16,673 --> 00:01:19,804
And then the admin console,
you can add funnel sections for

23
00:01:19,804 --> 00:01:21,630
the checkout process.

24
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:23,480
This part's actually optional but

25
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:28,550
if you don't name the check out
steps then they appear as step one,

26
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:33,540
step two, step three and so
on which is not very helpful.

27
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:36,230
So here's an example where we have
step one, step two, step three,

28
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:40,100
step four and we don't know what's
going on at each of these steps.

29
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:44,701
It's really very easy to add
nice labels for these steps.

30
00:01:44,701 --> 00:01:46,940
So here's how to set a heading for
the steps.

31
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:52,959
You go to the admin console,
choose Ecommerce settings down here for

32
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:57,123
the view, and
then just add some funnel steps.

33
00:01:57,123 --> 00:02:00,310
So you add the steps that you'll be
tracking, and give them relevant names.

34
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:05,230
And don't forget to press
submit when you're done.

35
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:09,008
Sometimes the submit button scrolls
off the bottom of the screen and

36
00:02:09,008 --> 00:02:09,850
it's easy to forget it.

37
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:14,930
Then, take a look at
the Checkout report.

38
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:24,613
So go to Reporting >
Ecommerce Shopping Analysis.

39
00:02:24,613 --> 00:02:29,840
And checkout behavior and then you'll
see the steps with the new labels.

40
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:35,359
It's your turn now to add the checkout
step to analytics account.

41
00:02:35,359 --> 00:02:36,609
Go to Ecommerce.

42
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,550
And set up the funnel steps, right here.

43
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:44,150
Then go back to the reporting tab to

44
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:46,850
see the steps in the checkout
behavior analysis screen.

45
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:51,350
Check the boxes here when you've
added the checkout steps.

46
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:52,700
We'll be adding the code next.
