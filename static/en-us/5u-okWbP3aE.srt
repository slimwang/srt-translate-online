1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:05,040
The plus 1 in Kruchtens' 4 plus 1 is the use case view.

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:10,240
Use cases are important execution sequences from the external actors or

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,220
user's point of view.

4
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:17,170
We'll have a look at the use case diagram that UML offers.

5
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:21,730
Some other UML diagrams that can be used to convey individual use cases.

6
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:26,960
And we'll even see some structured text that can convey a use case.

7
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,280
Here's a use case diagram from UML.

8
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:33,210
Each of the ovals corresponds to a use case.

9
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:38,040
The stick figures correspond to external actors.

10
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:45,470
Some of the lines indicate are, are labeled and

11
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:51,550
indicate that the particular use case is used for a special purpose such

12
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:56,760
as being included in another use case or being shared among several use cases.

13
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:04,190
Important thing is that the use case diagram in UML conveys a set of use cases,

14
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:05,570
not an individual use case.
