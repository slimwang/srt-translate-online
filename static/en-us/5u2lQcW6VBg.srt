1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:04,652
So I know that words that end with s or o need to have an es added. So if the

2
00:00:04,652 --> 00:00:11,159
last letter is o, or the last letter is s, I return letters plus es. This

3
00:00:11,159 --> 00:00:15,022
condition is pretty ugly. And it seems like I'm going to be talking about the

4
00:00:15,022 --> 00:00:20,930
last letter index a lot. So I'm going to declare a variable. And now I can

5
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:25,775
replace all of these with just last. That looks a bit better. Let's see if our

6
00:00:25,775 --> 00:00:29,290
program works for this case now. I'll need to return something in the else

7
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:34,665
clause. Since just adding an S seemed to be sort of a default leftover case,

8
00:00:34,665 --> 00:00:41,379
I'll just return letters plus S here. I'll run my word tester. We want to look

9
00:00:41,379 --> 00:00:47,706
at the cases that end with O or S. For example, kisses. It looks like right

10
00:00:47,706 --> 00:00:51,952
now, our actual value for kisses matches what we expected. It looks like we

11
00:00:51,952 --> 00:00:55,600
also got some for free. All of the leftover default cases where you just add an

12
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:01,954
s, are working pretty well right now. Massages look good, judges looks good,

13
00:01:01,954 --> 00:01:06,572
laps, cats, clocks. But there are some that still aren't working, and dishes

14
00:01:06,572 --> 00:01:13,251
should be disches, and not dish. So let's go back to our word. The case for y

15
00:01:13,251 --> 00:01:15,875
being the last letter was a little bit more complicated, because it mattered

16
00:01:15,875 --> 00:01:20,778
whether there was a consonant before it, or a vowel before it. So let's add a

17
00:01:20,778 --> 00:01:25,520
case for when the last letter is y. We need to account for two possibilities.

18
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:32,248
If the second to last letter is a consonant, we take off the y and add yes. We

19
00:01:32,248 --> 00:01:39,044
can use substring to cut off the last letter, which is the y. And then add back

20
00:01:39,044 --> 00:01:46,905
ies. Otherwise, if the letter before the y is a vowel, we just add s. Now it

21
00:01:46,905 --> 00:01:51,150
should be better. If I go back to my word tester, and run it one more time. It

22
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:59,127
should work for cherries, which it does. And it hasn't broken. Boys, or days,

23
00:01:59,127 --> 00:02:07,004
which also ended in y. So that's a good sign. Still not working well for

24
00:02:07,004 --> 00:02:11,779
dishes, or witches. It looks like if it ends in an h, then we need to return

25
00:02:11,779 --> 00:02:17,881
the letters with an es instead of just s. Let's check that. It looks like

26
00:02:17,881 --> 00:02:23,722
dishes is right, now. Witches is also looking better. Judges, laps, cats,

27
00:02:23,722 --> 00:02:30,018
clocks, these all look good. But bathes isn't right now. Bathes just turned

28
00:02:30,018 --> 00:02:34,684
into bathes. I think we need an exception for when there's a t before the h. So

29
00:02:34,684 --> 00:02:40,514
let's go back and do that. If the last letter is H, then if is the 2nd to last,

30
00:02:40,514 --> 00:02:51,590
so if the 2nd to last letter is an S or a C, then we add ES. Otherwise, just S.

31
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:56,560
And now, they should all match. So it looks like it works. But can we simplify

32
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,590
the code at all? The code I just wrote was pretty complicated. Now that you

33
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:05,640
have a working version, you could spend 5 minutes trying to simplify the code.

34
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:08,620
You can check whether your simplifications work by running the tester again.

35
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:11,304
And if you get a very simple or very short version, compare it with another

36
00:03:11,304 --> 00:03:15,093
short version that I'm going to post in the forum. There should be a link

37
00:03:15,093 --> 00:03:16,592
somewhere on the page.
