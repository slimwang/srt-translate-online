00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
[Thrun] So let's begin by taking the hidden out of the Markov model

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
and study Markov chains.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
We're going to use an example for which I will quiz you.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Suppose there are 2 types of weather--rainy, which we call R,

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
and sunny, which we call S--

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
and suppose we have the following state transition diagram.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,000
If it's rainy, it stays rainy with a 0.6 chance while with 0.4 it becomes sunny.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Sunny remains sunny with 0.8 chance but moves to rainy with 0.2 chance.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:41,000
This is obviously a temporal sequence so the weather at time 1 will be called R1 or S1,

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
at time 2, R2 or S2.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Suppose in the beginning we happen to know it is rainy,

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
which means R times 0 when we begin.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:59,000
We have the probability of rain equals 1 and the probably of sun, S times 0 equals 0.

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'd like to know from you what's the probability of rain on day 1, the same for day 2,

15
00:01:08,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and the same for day 3.
