1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,036
All right. You're done.

2
00:00:02,036 --> 00:00:03,827
Let's look at the solution.

3
00:00:03,877 --> 00:00:06,538
All right. We'll move to WeatherProvider.

4
00:00:07,008 --> 00:00:09,110
We start by creating
a third selection query

5
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:10,830
up at the top of our provider,

6
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:14,590
much like the second query except that
we search for the exact date

7
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:16,730
rather than a greater than or equal date.

8
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:19,800
We then add a function
that uses the weather contract functions

9
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,810
to get the date
and postal code from the URI.

10
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:25,560
We use the new query we just wrote.

11
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,513
And the same SQLI query builder
we used before,

12
00:00:28,513 --> 00:00:30,766
since it only defines the join.

13
00:00:31,966 --> 00:00:34,280
And then we just call
this function in the weather

14
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:37,420
with location and date switch statement
in our query.

15
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:39,300
That's it.

16
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:42,060
Those are all the queries we
plan to use for Sunshine,

17
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:44,370
but we still need to test.

18
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:46,670
Let's go back to test provider.

19
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:51,930
As you can see, our test
has a very, very good model already.

20
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:54,870
Let's fix up some of these old tests
and close the weather cursor.

21
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:58,400
Now, we can simply copy this test over.

22
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:02,730
It turns out that the exact same data
is required for our new URI.

23
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,350
All we have to do
is to build weather location with date,

24
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:08,790
instead of saying weather location
with start date,

25
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:12,880
and we should get the same result.

26
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,414
Let's see if that's really true
by running our tests.

27
00:01:16,834 --> 00:01:18,605
And our test passed.

28
00:01:18,605 --> 00:01:21,076
So we've now implemented
all of the queries,

29
00:01:21,076 --> 00:01:23,877
but we're not done
with our content provider yet.

30
00:01:23,877 --> 00:01:26,670
After all, we're not writing any data
into the database

31
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:28,590
through our content provider.
