1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:02,700
So let's actually start talking
about this whole concept.

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:06,689
We start with feature detection, again
we've looked at how we can do feature

3
00:00:06,689 --> 00:00:09,330
detection using concepts like sift.

4
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:11,500
Something is also that
you're playing around with,

5
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:15,210
with the development environment
you're experimenting with right now.

6
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:17,610
Here basically means is I
take a bunch of images.

7
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:20,090
And again we have all
of these images here.

8
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:22,540
And now we're interested in basically,

9
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:26,050
is running a feature detector
on all of these images.

10
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:29,020
So here you basically kind of see
in a pictorial manner that each and

11
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:31,920
every image now has a bunch
of different features.

12
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,240
Now recall again what we learned
about feature detection,

13
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:38,790
that of course might have similarities
that would actually be dealing with both

14
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:42,730
illumination changes,
scale changes and rotation changes.

15
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:44,910
I'm here just showcasing
some simple examples.

16
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:46,850
These are not the actual features.

17
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:49,050
And again,
you can do this in your code yourself.

18
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:50,600
You can basically take
a bunch of pictures and

19
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,550
start dong feature detection on it.

20
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:55,260
Let me show you an example of what
this feature detection look like for

21
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:56,510
real images.

22
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:57,420
Here's an image.

23
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:59,210
And we run a feature detector.

24
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:02,250
Basically it identifies veracity
of different types of things at

25
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:03,640
different scales.

26
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:06,290
And this would allow me to
start kind of now finding

27
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:09,110
interesting features that we
can do of course matching with.

28
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:12,480
Recall we did this kind of stuff
already when we looked at panoramas.
