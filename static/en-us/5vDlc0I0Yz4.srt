1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:04,390
For example, attacker can insert
data into the packet stream,

2
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:07,410
to cause the IDS to miss
detecting the attack.

3
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:11,530
For example, by including
a packet with bad checksum value,

4
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:15,760
the end host may reject this packet,
and yet, the IDS may accept it.

5
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:21,110
As a result,
the end host gets the attack, and

6
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:23,020
yet, the IDS misses detecting it.

7
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:26,440
Here's an illustration
of the Insertion Attack.

8
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,800
For example,
the attacker sends these packets.

9
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,020
Although out of order,
both of the IDS and

10
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:37,860
the end host will assemble them
according to the sequence numbers.

11
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:41,360
One of the packets, X,
has a bad checksum value.

12
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,960
The IDS will accept it.

13
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,790
Therefore, the IDS sees ATXTACK.

14
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:53,040
On the other hand, the end host rejects
this packet with a bad checksum value.

15
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:58,420
In other words, the end host gets
attacked by the traffic, yet,

16
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:00,340
the IDS misses the attack.
