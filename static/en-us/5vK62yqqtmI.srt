00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,140
The common pattern is to support the
ability to autocomplete what you were

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:06,980
typing, hopefully taking what we know
about your context into account to give

3
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:08,560
a better result.

4
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:11,920
It's not recommended that one do that
against our weather server since they

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:15,520
want to limit queries to no more than
one every ten minutes per device.

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,120
Look at using a Google Play service
to do this later on in the course.
