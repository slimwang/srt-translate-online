1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,420
So, I want to know, what do you understand by

2
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:04,350
a distributed system and I am going to give you three

3
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:07,220
choices, nice perfectly fine if you don't get it right

4
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:09,980
but I just wanted to get you thinking in terms of

5
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:12,770
what a distributed system is and what your understanding is.

6
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:16,620
The first choice says that a distributed system is a collection

7
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:20,310
of Nodes connected by a Local Area Network or a

8
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:25,320
Wide Area Network. Second choice says that, a distributed system is

9
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,370
one in which communication happens only via messages. And

10
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:32,729
the third choice is that, a distributed system is

11
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:35,230
one in which events that are happening on the

12
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:38,740
same node, here like A and B. The time

13
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:41,160
between that is called the event time. And the

14
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,490
event that is happening across nodes, which is a

15
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:46,970
communication event, Node N1 sends a message to node

16
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:49,880
N2, it's a communciation event from A to C. So,

17
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:53,630
the third choice is saying that communication time

18
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:59,410
TM, is much more Significantly more than the event

19
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:02,050
execution time. That is the third choice so

20
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:03,630
you have three choices and I want you to

21
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:05,940
think about what's your definition, what's your mental

22
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:08,980
model of distributed system is and how any of

23
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:12,280
these choices fit or do not fit your mental

24
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,420
model of what you think a distributed system is.
