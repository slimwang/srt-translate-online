00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
[Narrator] So, let me ask you a second quiz.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
In particular I would like to know whether distributions

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
that can be represented may be unimodal

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
or can also be multimodal.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
So, check unimodal if this is all we can do,

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
whereas if we can have multiple bumps in our probability distribution,

7
00:00:19,000 --> 99:59:59,999
check multimodal.
