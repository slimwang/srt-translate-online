1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:04,194
I would argue that the second answer is best. The difference between the first

2
00:00:04,194 --> 00:00:07,346
and the second is whether we print out a number or we return the number.

3
00:00:07,348 --> 00:00:10,623
Returning a number is much more useful. If we return the number, then we can do

4
00:00:10,623 --> 00:00:14,036
more computation with it. If we print it out, well, then it gets printed out and

5
00:00:14,036 --> 00:00:17,813
it's hard to use for anything else. So, I'm going to assume that what we want to

6
00:00:17,813 --> 00:00:22,085
do is the second choice. The third choice doesn't really match what was stated.

7
00:00:22,085 --> 00:00:25,746
Maybe, we want the age in days, the third choice says, we'll give the age and

8
00:00:25,746 --> 00:00:29,856
years, months, and days. Note that this answer depends on the assumption we have

9
00:00:29,856 --> 00:00:33,931
about no time travel. We haven't described what that should be if the first date

10
00:00:33,931 --> 00:00:37,961
is after the second date and we don't need to because we're going to assume that

11
00:00:37,961 --> 00:00:42,194
could never happen. That the first date must always be the same or before the

12
00:00:42,194 --> 00:00:43,009
second date.
