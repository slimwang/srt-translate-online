00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:03,650
Planning is another process central to cognition.

2
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:08,260
It is central because action selection is central to cognition. You and

3
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:12,060
I are constantly faced with the problem of selecting actions.

4
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:16,170
Where should I go for dinner today? What should I cook for dinner today? How do

5
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:21,530
I cook what I wanted to cook? I got a bonus. What should I do with the bonus?

6
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:24,600
Shall I go for a vacation? How should I go to a vacation?

7
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:29,840
Where should I go to a vacation? These are all problems of action selection. And

8
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,800
I need planning to select the appropriate actions.

9
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:38,110
Cognitive agents also have multiple goals. As a professor, one of my

10
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:42,300
goals right now is to talk with you. Another goal that I have is to become rich,

11
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:45,290
although I know that becoming a professor is not going to make me rich.

12
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:48,340
The point is that cognitive agents have multiple goals that can

13
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:52,410
have interactions between them. Sometimes interaction is positive.

14
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:56,420
Achieving one goal provides an opportunity for achieving the second goal.

15
00:00:56,420 --> 00:01:01,570
Sometime the interaction is negative, there are conflicts. Cognitive agents

16
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:06,000
detect those conflicts. They avoid those conflicts. And planning, then,

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,780
is a central process for achieving multiple goals at the same time.
