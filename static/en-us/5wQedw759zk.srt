00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,777
In the last lesson, we learned how to add and subtract polynomials. Let's

2
00:00:03,777 --> 00:00:07,792
continue building on that knowledge and try to multiply polynomials. You'll

3
00:00:07,792 --> 00:00:11,906
still need to remember how to work with exponents and the idea of like terms. If

4
00:00:11,906 --> 00:00:15,838
any of those gave you some trouble, I would go back and do some more review.

5
00:00:15,838 --> 00:00:19,874
Before we multiply polynomials, let's start with something a little bit more

6
00:00:19,874 --> 00:00:21,715
simple. Let's try an area problem.
