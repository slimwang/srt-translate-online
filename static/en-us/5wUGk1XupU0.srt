Perhaps surprisingly, you're going to run into a very similar issue when you

2
00:00:03,124 --> 00:00:08,042
compare strings. Check out this code. I have two strings, Uda and city. I

3
00:00:08,042 --> 00:00:11,470
concatenated the two together, to form a string that are called firstAndSecond.

4
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:15,697
And over here I have a third string, Udacity. And now I check wether, the first

5
00:00:15,697 --> 00:00:20,938
and second which we would expect to be Udacity, is the same as, Udacity. And if

6
00:00:20,938 --> 00:00:24,634
so this program prints, they are the same, otherwise it prints what

7
00:00:24,634 --> 00:00:29,536
firstAndSecond is. Again, go ahead and run this program yourself and tell me

8
00:00:29,536 --> 00:00:37,683
what you find. Just put your output into this box.
