00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,339
Now we're going to get into a little bit more regular fractions. We're going to

2
00:00:03,351 --> 00:00:06,727
tackle another chocolate problem. This is going to be chocolate math 2. So

3
00:00:06,739 --> 00:00:10,091
here's our question. How many batches of brownies can you bake if a recipe

4
00:00:10,103 --> 00:00:13,997
requires 4/5 cup of sugar, and you have 3 1/2 cups of sugar at home. Write your

5
00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:17,484
answer as a mixed number, and I'll provide the boxes. Use any math reason that

6
00:00:17,496 --> 00:00:20,947
you know. Remember, the important part is just to try to reason. It doesn't

7
00:00:20,959 --> 00:00:22,838
matter if you're right, right now.

8
00:00:22,841 --> 00:00:26,198
We'll be coming back to this problem later. Just give your best guess now, and

9
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:28,079
you can always change it and revise it later.
