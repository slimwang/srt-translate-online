1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,950
So we just saw the Android manifest
file for the first time and

2
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:07,580
even though it's an XML file,
it can be intimidating to look at

3
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:09,480
because it looks different
from the layout and

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:13,290
resource XML files that we've been used
to seeing in other parts of the app.

5
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:16,239
So I think it might be helpful to
provide you some context for this file.

6
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:21,200
So every app must have an Android
manifest.xml file with exactly that

7
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:24,620
name but luckily for us we don't
have to worry about creating one.

8
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:27,150
So this file is automatically generated

9
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:30,160
whenever we create a new
app in Android Studio.

10
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,170
You can think of this file as
a table of contents for your app.

11
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:34,240
Let me explain.

12
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:37,580
In a book like this, we have a table
of contents that helps summarize

13
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:39,400
what's contained inside the book.

14
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:43,520
Similarly, the manifest file
summarizes the important information

15
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,105
about the whole app in a single place.

16
00:00:46,105 --> 00:00:49,065
When you install your app on a device,
the Android system

17
00:00:49,065 --> 00:00:52,315
first looks at this file before it
runs any of the code on your app.

18
00:00:52,315 --> 00:00:53,746
So, what is contained in this file?

19
00:00:53,746 --> 00:00:57,625
From the last exercise you notice that
all the activities to have to be listed

20
00:00:57,625 --> 00:00:59,066
in the Android manifest file.

21
00:00:59,066 --> 00:01:03,642
Well, this manifest also contains other
important information such as the Java

22
00:01:03,642 --> 00:01:08,182
package name which is the app's unique
identifier, components of the app, for

23
00:01:08,182 --> 00:01:12,511
example, the activity names, intents,
permissions for notifications or

24
00:01:12,511 --> 00:01:17,861
using the camera, and also it help sets
the minimum Android API, which means

25
00:01:17,861 --> 00:01:22,251
to specify which versions of the Android
platform the app is compatible on.

26
00:01:22,251 --> 00:01:26,511
So in the Android manifest file for our
Miwok app, here's the package name and

27
00:01:26,511 --> 00:01:28,147
these are the components of our app.

28
00:01:28,147 --> 00:01:30,971
This points to the theme of our app,
this is where

29
00:01:30,971 --> 00:01:34,861
the app theme from the styles.xml
file's applied to so that our app and

30
00:01:34,861 --> 00:01:39,320
status bar will be brown, and
this is where our icon is specified.

31
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:43,200
In the all apps screen of our device,
we see a basket as the app icon for

32
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,380
our Miwok app.

33
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:47,820
Within the Miwok app,
we have five activities listed here.

34
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:52,070
Within the MainActivity tag, we also
see something called an intent filter.

35
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:56,020
Remember that an intent is a message
that requests some type of action to be

36
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:57,800
performed by another app.

37
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:02,060
In turn, apps can specify intent
filters to announce to other apps, hey,

38
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:05,730
I could receive a certain type of
intent and perform an action for you.

39
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:08,220
This intent filter with
the action main and

40
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:12,100
category launcher indicates that
this is an entry point into our app.

41
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:15,905
When a user taps on the Miwok app
icon in the device home screen,

42
00:02:15,905 --> 00:02:18,145
Android will send
an intent to start our app.

43
00:02:18,145 --> 00:02:21,465
This activity will receive that
intent and open up the screen.

44
00:02:21,465 --> 00:02:24,415
We'll have a chance to practice
modifying the Android manifest.xml

45
00:02:24,415 --> 00:02:27,395
later in this lesson but for
now let's go back to building our app.
