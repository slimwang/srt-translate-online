When finding the sum of polynomials, we want to identify like terms first. I

2
00:00:04,336 --> 00:00:08,676
have 3x squared y squared, and negative 14, x squared, y squared, these are

3
00:00:08,676 --> 00:00:13,666
like-terms because they're the same variables with the same exponents. Negative

4
00:00:13,666 --> 00:00:18,812
8xy and negative 2xy are also like terms, so I can list those together, down

5
00:00:18,812 --> 00:00:23,837
here. These last two terms are tricky, they're actually not like, so I can only

6
00:00:23,837 --> 00:00:28,787
list them separately, I won't be able to combine them, or add them. Now I simply

7
00:00:28,787 --> 00:00:32,879
count up the number of x squareds y squared that I have, I have positive 3 and

8
00:00:32,879 --> 00:00:37,182
negative 14 of them, so that's a total of negative 11. For the next term, I have

9
00:00:37,182 --> 00:00:41,441
negative 8xy, and negative 2xy, so that makes negative 10xy altogether. And

10
00:00:41,441 --> 00:00:46,049
finally, we just list these terms as sums on the end, because they're not like

11
00:00:46,049 --> 00:00:49,710
with anything else in our expression, so here's our answer.
