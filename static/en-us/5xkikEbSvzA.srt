00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:04,610
To illustrate production systems, let us imagine that you are a baseball

2
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:09,050
pitcher. This illustration is coming from a game between Atlanta Braves and

3
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:13,240
the Arizona Diamondbacks. Here is a pitcher on the mound, and a pitcher has to

4
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:18,560
decide, whether to pitch a ball to the batter, or whether to walk the batter.

5
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:23,980
To be more specific, take a look at the story here in the left. Read it.

6
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:27,270
And to decide what would the pitcher do. What would you do?

7
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:30,920
What would an intelligent agent do? If you don't know much about baseball,

8
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:34,491
don't worry about it. Part of the goal here is to see what someone who

9
00:00:34,491 --> 00:00:37,201
does not know about, a lot about baseball may do.
