1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:04,100
All right, so the last thing we have
to talk about are the logistics

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:06,960
of how you actually do the work.

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,460
And essentially,

4
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:11,220
there's going to be two places that
you're going to be doing the doing.

5
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:13,090
Well, three.
First,

6
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:15,880
there are these Arpin quizzes, where
you just have to click on the dots or

7
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:18,720
fill in the things, and usually those
are just going to be making sure that

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,820
you're not asleep while
watching the videos.

9
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,580
The real work's going to come in terms
of doing some computer vision work.

10
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,401
First, whenever we introduce
certain image processing or

11
00:00:30,401 --> 00:00:34,839
computer vision types of new algorithms
or methods, as often as we can,

12
00:00:34,839 --> 00:00:38,263
we'll produce some embedded
programming exercises,

13
00:00:38,263 --> 00:00:43,180
which you can actually use while you're
doing the videos and work within them.

14
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:47,140
And in particular there, there may be a
function that Matlab already implements.

15
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:52,020
And so, you will play with the function
in the embedded system that you can just

16
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,830
use, so you might come to
understand the different, say,

17
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:56,400
the effect of the parameters.

18
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,130
But then,
when we get to the problem sets,

19
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:01,670
you'll actually be writing some
of these functions for your own.

20
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:04,879
So let's talk about your
own software environments.

21
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:07,440
Most of the examples
that I will describe and

22
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:10,110
talk about come from using Matlab.

23
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:12,080
I use Matlab normally when I teach here.

24
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:16,090
I use the base Matlab, plus what's
called the image processing toolbox.

25
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:20,230
By the way, there is a computer
vision toolbox also for Matlab.

26
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:22,845
I don't make use of that in this course.

27
00:01:22,845 --> 00:01:25,150
It has some of the more advanced things.

28
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:28,320
For what we do, we just need Matlab and
the image processing toolbox.

29
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:33,350
By the way, for any of you that
are actual students with a student ID or

30
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:38,330
academic affiliation,
there is a student version of Matlab,

31
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:42,440
which costs less than most
computer vision textbooks.

32
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,770
If you go to a company and
you have to buy Matlab,

33
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:47,800
it is a relatively significant
piece of software to acquire.

34
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:52,650
The fact that you as a student can
get Matlab at a student discount, and

35
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:54,620
by the way, the license never expires,

36
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:58,050
you just get to use it, I highly
recommend you go out and do that.

37
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:00,820
And no, MathWorks has not
paid me anything to say that.

38
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,510
Really, honestly.

39
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:04,116
Honest, I wouldn't kid you.

40
00:02:04,116 --> 00:02:09,264
But, if you don't want to do that, there
is an open source version of something

41
00:02:09,264 --> 00:02:14,270
called Octave, and Octave is a open
source, sort of equivalent of Matlab.

42
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:21,311
And there's also image processing
toolbox equivalent available for Octave.

43
00:02:21,311 --> 00:02:24,465
Arpin will give you a little more
detail about exactly how to get that,

44
00:02:24,465 --> 00:02:26,250
in order to get that installed.

45
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:31,659
But that's the examples, that's the sort
of system that I'll be using as example.

46
00:02:31,659 --> 00:02:36,775
For some of you, you might rather
do this using Python and OpenCV.

47
00:02:36,775 --> 00:02:39,810
OpenCV is something that
originally came out of Intel,

48
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:43,110
took a winding path through Willow
Garage for a while, is now a part of,

49
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:46,350
I think the Open Source Robotics
something.

50
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:50,526
It's moved into a not-for-profit,
that's sustaining it.

51
00:02:50,526 --> 00:02:55,486
OpenCV has really enabled people to do
a lot of image manipulation stuff in

52
00:02:55,486 --> 00:02:58,452
a robust way, from either Python or C++.

53
00:02:58,452 --> 00:03:02,007
When we give out the problem sets,
if there's something special that

54
00:03:02,007 --> 00:03:05,440
you need to know about how to do
it in Python/OpenCV versus Matlab,

55
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,020
we'll describe both of them.

56
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:10,580
And you can use either one of
those programming environments.

57
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:12,770
Matlab tends to make
things a little easier,

58
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:16,850
things like plotting and clicking on
images and seeing what's going on.

59
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:20,090
Python and Open CV is a little more
connected to what you might actually

60
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:22,480
have to do out there in the job world,

61
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,340
to actually produce
computer vision code.
