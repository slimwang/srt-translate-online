00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,300
Now, when talking about the end-to-end argument, it

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:05,610
is worth remembering that the end-to-end argument is

3
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:09,560
just that. It's an argument. Not a theorem,

4
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:11,660
or a principle, or a law. And there are

5
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:14,375
many things that have come to violate the

6
00:00:14,375 --> 00:00:18,100
end-to-end principle. Network address translators, which we'll talk about

7
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:21,340
in the next lesson, violate the end-to-end argument.

8
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:25,560
VPN tunnels, which tunnel traffic between intermediate points on

9
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,860
a network, violate the end-to-end argument. Sometimes

10
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:32,170
TCP connections are split at an intermediate

11
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:35,130
node along an end-to-end path, particularly when

12
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:37,340
the last hop of the end-to-end path is

13
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:40,688
wireless. This is sometimes done to improve

14
00:00:40,688 --> 00:00:44,090
the performance of the connection because loss on

15
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:46,439
the last hop lossy wireless hop may

16
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:50,894
not necessarily reflect congestion, and we don't necessarily

17
00:00:50,894 --> 00:00:53,486
want TCP to react to losses that are not

18
00:00:53,486 --> 00:00:57,462
congested related. Even spam, in some sense, is a violation

19
00:00:57,462 --> 00:01:00,182
of the end to end argument. For e-mail the end

20
00:01:00,182 --> 00:01:03,080
user is generally considered to be a human, and by

21
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:06,116
the end to end argument, the network should deliver

22
00:01:06,116 --> 00:01:08,890
all mail to the user. Does this mean that spam

23
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:12,350
control mechanisms are in violation of end to end and

24
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:15,920
if so are these violations appropriate? What about peer to

25
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,570
peer systems? Where files are exchanged between

26
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:23,020
two nodes on the Internet but are assembled

27
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:24,880
in chunks that are often traded among

28
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:29,250
peers. What about caches, and in-network aggregation? So,

29
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:31,900
when considering the end to end argument,

30
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:34,860
it's worth asking whether or not the argument

31
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:38,200
is still valid today. And, in what cases.

32
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,840
There are questions about what's in versus out,

33
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:43,980
certainly. And, what functions belong in the dumb

34
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:47,210
minimal network. For example, routing is currently in

35
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:49,250
the dumb minimal network, do we really believe

36
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:53,204
that it belongs. What about multicast? Mobility quality of

37
00:01:53,204 --> 00:01:56,575
service. What about NAT's, and it's worth considering

38
00:01:56,575 --> 00:01:59,875
whether the end to end argument is constraining innovation

39
00:01:59,875 --> 00:02:02,779
of the infrastructure by preventing us from putting

40
00:02:02,779 --> 00:02:05,947
some of the more interesting or helpful functions inside

41
00:02:05,947 --> 00:02:08,228
the network. In the third course,

42
00:02:08,228 --> 00:02:11,252
we will talk about software defined networking,

43
00:02:11,252 --> 00:02:15,580
which in some sense reverses many aspects of this end to end argument.
