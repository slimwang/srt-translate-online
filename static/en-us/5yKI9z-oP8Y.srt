[SOUND] [COUGH] We

2
00:00:04,358 --> 00:00:09,431
did it, Marty.

3
00:00:09,431 --> 00:00:10,320
We're back.

4
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:16,149
That's you, only seconds before
you turn your phone back on and

5
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:18,150
find your algorithm is gone.

6
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:21,430
Only this time,
your algorithms should still be there.

7
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:29,421
Come.

00:00:29,421 --> 00:00:31,380
Great Scott, Marty!

9
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:33,645
I was still in the app.

10
00:00:33,645 --> 00:00:36,400
Your algorithm's too big and
it takes up too much memory.

11
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:41,370
We need to find out
another way of saving.

12
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:45,690
But first, we need to find more
about your iPhone file system.

00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:48,400
>> I was reading something recently.

14
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:52,436
Something about a sandbox?

15
00:00:52,436 --> 00:00:54,901
>> We'll see Marty, we'll see.
