00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,934
When thinking about solving this problem, we know that the insides can both be

2
00:00:03,945 --> 00:00:07,943
positive numbers, so we leave them alone. We also said that they could both be

3
00:00:07,955 --> 00:00:11,796
negative. Remember, a negative number equaling a negative number. But this

4
00:00:11,808 --> 00:00:15,419
equation is the same one we just had. We've just multiplied both sides by

5
00:00:15,431 --> 00:00:19,422
negative 1, so I don't need to solve this. The other case we had was a positive

6
00:00:19,434 --> 00:00:23,188
number and a negative number. This second number or this expression could be

7
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:27,576
negative, or we could have this first number be negative, and that case this

8
00:00:27,588 --> 00:00:31,941
first part would be negative. But notice, if I multiply both sides by a negative

9
00:00:31,953 --> 00:00:36,306
1, this side will become positive and this side will become negative. So this is

10
00:00:36,318 --> 00:00:40,488
the same equation, I don't need to solve it. Whenever we solve the absolute

11
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:44,706
value on both sides, we always write 2 equations. We keep both sides positive

12
00:00:44,718 --> 00:00:49,767
and then we multiply one side by a negative. And again, it doesn't matter which

13
00:00:49,779 --> 00:00:54,002
side has the negative, usually we make the second one the negative. Alright, to

14
00:00:54,014 --> 00:00:58,187
wrap up this problem, what's the solution set to this absolute value equation?

15
00:00:58,283 --> 00:01:00,207
Be sure to write your answer as a set.
