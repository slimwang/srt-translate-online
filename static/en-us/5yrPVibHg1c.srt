00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,756
Now let's go back to the individual. So just how is it that we're able to

2
00:00:03,756 --> 00:00:08,740
develop language? We see that children have the ability to understand words

3
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:13,894
before they develop the ability to produce words. Do you remember from lesson

4
00:00:13,894 --> 00:00:18,066
three that the Wernicke's area is in the left hemisphere of the brain? And this

5
00:00:18,066 --> 00:00:22,200
is where language comprehension occurs. In the Broca's area, which is also in

6
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:27,228
the left hemisphere of the brain, is associated with language production. Now,

7
00:00:27,228 --> 00:00:32,002
because infants can understand language before they can produce it, this

8
00:00:32,002 --> 00:00:38,830
suggests that the Wernicke's area may develop earlier than the Broca's area.
