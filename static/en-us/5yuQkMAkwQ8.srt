1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,451
But where does this show up in my equation? If we subtract 4 from both sides,

2
00:00:04,554 --> 00:00:09,100
we're going to isolate the absolute value. We'll get the distance of p plus 3

3
00:00:09,112 --> 00:00:13,576
alone. This is where the 8 shows up. The absolute value or the distance of p

4
00:00:13,588 --> 00:00:18,159
plus 3 from 0 must be 8. When solving absolute value equations, we need to make

5
00:00:18,171 --> 00:00:22,723
sure we get the absolute value symbol on one side of the equation alone. That

6
00:00:22,735 --> 00:00:26,736
way, we can represent the distance. Once we isolate the absolute value, we want

7
00:00:26,736 --> 00:00:30,819
to check. We want to make sure that it's greater than or equal to 0. Remember,

8
00:00:30,831 --> 00:00:34,949
distance is always positive, so if we had a negative answer on this side, there

9
00:00:34,961 --> 00:00:38,990
would be any number that could make it true, there'd be no solution. This is a

10
00:00:39,002 --> 00:00:42,713
difficult concept and it's one that we'll stumble upon, too, later.

11
00:00:42,718 --> 00:00:47,299
So now, we're back into the same case before. The value of p plus 3 could be 8

12
00:00:47,311 --> 00:00:52,038
units to left of 0 at negative 8, or it could be 8 units to the right of 0, at

13
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:57,103
positive 8. So, let's split this equation up into 2 equations, setting p plus 3

14
00:00:57,115 --> 00:01:01,460
to negative 8 and p plus 3 equal to positive 8. Just like from before. And at

15
00:01:01,472 --> 00:01:05,652
this point, you might even be able to solve it in your head, which is great. For

16
00:01:05,664 --> 00:01:09,492
more complicated questions, it's best to stick to the equation solving.

17
00:01:09,588 --> 00:01:13,634
Subtracting 3 from both sides, p could equal 5. And subtracting 3 from both

18
00:01:13,646 --> 00:01:17,910
sides, p could equal negative 11. So, the solution set or the values for p, are

19
00:01:17,922 --> 00:01:21,834
negative 11 and 5. And just like all our other equations, we can check these

20
00:01:21,846 --> 00:01:25,302
values in our original equation to see if we are right. That's one of the

21
00:01:25,314 --> 00:01:29,109
beauties of mathematics. This can help build your confidence in math. If this

22
00:01:29,121 --> 00:01:32,939
don't check, maybe it's a good idea to look back at your work. You might rethink

23
00:01:32,951 --> 00:01:34,622
your process or catch a small error.
