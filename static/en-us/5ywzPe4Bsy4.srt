1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,780
The second step is the preparation itself. During this preparation period,

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:06,990
the participants should individually study the material,

3
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:12,700
noting any potential defects. The idea here, is to save time in the meeting

4
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:17,510
by having the participants detect particularly superficial type

5
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:21,600
problems that can be reported to the, reported before the meeting. And not have

6
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,020
to take time during the meeting to go over them. The expected rate of individual

7
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:29,210
review should be about ten pages of text or 100 lines of code per hour.
