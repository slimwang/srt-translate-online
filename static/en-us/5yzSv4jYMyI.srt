00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,210
Hi Michael, how are you doing?

2
00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:04,480
>> Oh, good thanks. What the, what's on tap for today?

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:06,310
>> Well, as you can see on your

4
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:08,920
screen today we're going to talk about support vector machines.

5
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:09,920
>> Hmm.

6
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,930
>> And at the end of it, we are going to circle

7
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:16,350
back to boosting, so that I can try to explain to you

8
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:19,240
why it doesn't seem to over fit as much as you might

9
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,080
think or at least not in the ways that you might think.

10
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:24,470
>> Ooh, that would be cool. I was worried that that was maybe a command.

11
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:25,320
>> What

12
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:25,980
was a command?

13
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:28,512
>> The thing that you wrote on the screen.

14
00:00:28,512 --> 00:00:32,009
>> [INAUDIBLE] [LAUGH] Man you know that reminds me of one of my favorite

15
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:34,780
little thing about police. That any combination

16
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:36,838
of the word police is a legal sentence

17
00:00:36,838 --> 00:00:39,571
>> [LAUGH] I see.

18
00:00:39,571 --> 00:00:39,990
>> Please.

19
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:45,030
>> Please. Police Please please. Please police.

20
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:46,230
>> Please please please please please

21
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:47,760
please police. Those are all legal sentences.

22
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,140
>> All right, we'll please stop.

23
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:49,660
>> [LAUGH] Man,

24
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,085
this is why I hang out with you, Michael.

25
00:00:53,085 --> 00:00:56,330
Ok,so today we're going to talk about support vector machines

26
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:59,720
and I'm going to do something unexpected. I'm going

27
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:02,870
to start out The beginning of this with a quiz.

28
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:03,430
>> With a quiz.

29
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:08,300
>> Yes, with a quiz. So here's the quiz for you, Michael. I've drawn on

30
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:12,040
here ,uh, some points, some labeled positive

31
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:16,040
and some labeled minus, representing two different classes.

32
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:18,550
And, you'll notice that you could draw

33
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:20,710
a line to separate them, therefore they are

34
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:22,590
>> Linearly separable.

35
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:28,400
>> Exactly. So the question I have for you is simply this, which is the

36
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,128
best line? And here's how you're going to show

37
00:01:31,128 --> 00:01:33,610
me. Here's how you're going to show me. I'm

38
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:37,210
not just going to ask you to draw some random line because that's too hard for

39
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:41,079
us to get feedback on. So instead what I've done is I've drawn three green dots.

40
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:46,720
Here on the sort of upper left and three red dots here on the bottom right

41
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:52,000
and what I want to you to do is select one of the green dots and one

42
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,380
of the red dots and since you'll have

43
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:57,040
two dots that will define a line and that'll

44
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:02,090
be the way you indicate to me which of the lines is in fact The best line.

45
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:03,450
>> The best line.

46
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:05,160
>> The best line. And I'm not going

47
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,550
to even tell you what best means. You tell

48
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:11,008
me what best means, when you justify why you would choose one over the other.

49
00:02:11,008 --> 00:02:13,680
>> If I think they're all the best, I can choose any one I want?

50
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,740
>> That's right. Ok. So you got it?

51
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:17,100
>> I think so.

52
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,680
>> OK. Go.
