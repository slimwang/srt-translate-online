00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,780
In this session we're
going to talk about classes,

2
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:05,550
a concept at the heart of
object oriented programming.

3
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:06,955
Classes are similar to structs,

4
00:00:06,955 --> 00:00:09,274
in that they bring together
related data and methods.

5
00:00:09,274 --> 00:00:13,248
In the upcoming session, we'll compare
and contrast classes and structs, and

6
00:00:13,248 --> 00:00:15,950
talk about how to choose
the right type for your needs.
