00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:06,500
about the advantages of using R to perform data analyses.

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:09,280
We'll install R Studio. And we'll learn the basic data

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,360
types and commands of R. Before we get started, I

want to share with you how one data scientist used R

6
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:17,710
to improve the health outcomes for the citizens of Chicago,

7
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:22,520
Illinois. Data scientist Corey Nissen used the R programming language

8
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:25,665
to analyze tweets from people in the city of Chicago.

9
00:00:25,665 --> 00:00:29,790
Corey analyzed tweets in real time by searching for the words food poisoning

00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:32,689
in each of them. I want you to read more about his analysis and
