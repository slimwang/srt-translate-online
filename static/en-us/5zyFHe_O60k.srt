Hello, and welcome to this new lesson. Today we're going to be taking about

2
00:00:03,208 --> 00:00:07,134
Array Lists. An Array List collects objects and all the objects in the Array

3
00:00:07,134 --> 00:00:11,840
List need to be of the same type. Now what would we like to collect? Me,

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:16,360
personally I'd like to collect valuable paintings. So let's see how we would do

5
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:21,297
that in Java. Here you see the rather long declaration of an Array List that

6
00:00:21,297 --> 00:00:26,821
can collect pictures. Let's work through the pieces. We're declaring a

7
00:00:26,821 --> 00:00:31,294
variable, called gallery, its type is an ArrayList, but whenever we have an

8
00:00:31,294 --> 00:00:37,814
ArrayList we need to also specify the type of the objects that it collects.

9
00:00:37,814 --> 00:00:42,170
That's the pictures here, so the whole thing here, ArrayList of picture, is the

10
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:46,610
type of the gallery object. To the right you simply have a constructor call,

11
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:50,707
where you again have to type ArrayList of picture. We have the new operator,

12
00:00:50,707 --> 00:00:55,243
because we make a new object off the ArrayList type and the parenthesis here

13
00:00:55,243 --> 00:01:01,892
simply mean that we pass nothing to the constructor. What we get is an empty

14
00:01:01,892 --> 00:01:08,250
ArrayList, which can, as we add them in, hold as many pictures as we like.

15
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:12,621
Here, we add a couple of pictures to the gallery. The add method, takes as its

16
00:01:12,621 --> 00:01:18,466
argument, the object that we want to add. Once you've added objects to an Array

17
00:01:18,466 --> 00:01:22,973
List, you'll want to be able to do something with the contents. Let's look at

18
00:01:22,973 --> 00:01:23,680
that next
