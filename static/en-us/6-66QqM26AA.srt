1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,955
What we need to see here in the graph is a bunch of triangles. So, if we let

2
00:00:03,967 --> 00:00:08,160
each side length, or each of these distances that we're looking for, be the

3
00:00:08,172 --> 00:00:12,400
hypotenuse of a right triangle, then we can as we've done so many times before,

4
00:00:12,497 --> 00:00:16,855
use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of that side. Conveniently, since

5
00:00:16,867 --> 00:00:20,897
we're using graph paper, made up of these little tiny squares, we have right

6
00:00:20,909 --> 00:00:24,731
angles all over the place. That made drawing these right triangles super simple.

7
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:28,430
If you look at the opposite ends of one of these side lengths, we can just draw

8
00:00:28,442 --> 00:00:32,131
lines along the lines that are already given to us by the graph paper. And the

9
00:00:32,143 --> 00:00:35,884
intersect to help us form the right triangle. Then, we just need to figure out

10
00:00:35,896 --> 00:00:39,924
the length of each of these legs for each of these triangles. Let's look at leg

11
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:44,623
AB as an example for how to deal with the other three triangles on here. We need

12
00:00:44,635 --> 00:00:49,074
to find out the length of either of the two shorter legs in order to find out

13
00:00:49,086 --> 00:00:53,343
the hypotenuse. So, we could just count one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

14
00:00:53,446 --> 00:00:58,133
Seven is the length of this side. We'll do the same thing for this side. This is

15
00:00:58,145 --> 00:01:03,046
five. In looking at this modified version of the Pythagorean theorem, we can

16
00:01:03,058 --> 00:01:07,981
just say that the length of AB, this hypotenuse, is the square root of 7 squared

17
00:01:07,993 --> 00:01:12,753
plus 5 squared. Simplifying that gives us the square root of 74. Once we find

18
00:01:12,765 --> 00:01:17,613
the lengths of the legs of all of the other right triangles, calculating their

19
00:01:17,625 --> 00:01:19,726
hypotenuses is also easy.

20
00:01:19,727 --> 00:01:26,427
And so, at long last, here are our final answers. The length of AB is the square

21
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:32,818
root of 74, BC, square root of 180, CD is the square root of 40, and DA is the

22
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:34,403
square root of 130.
