00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:02,230
When you select blue for
both the background and

2
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:05,810
the text color, the watch face is
not very useful in interactive mode.

3
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:09,310
But when it goes back into ambient
mode the colors are ignored and

4
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:11,030
the text is visible again.

5
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:14,040
You should avoid letting the user set
the same color for the foreground and

6
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:17,030
the background, otherwise the user
might think the watch face is broken.
