1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
And now for the answer. This is something that we can best find out by testing.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Here's our first input, here comes the second, number 3 with the quotes outside,

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and number 4 with the quotes inside of the text.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
For the first input, the output should be just the text foo.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
For the second one, it should be the same but enclosed in double quotes

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
as is the same for the third one.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
For the fourth one, we'd simply expect the text foo. Let's go and test this.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Surprise, surprise. The output is very different from what we expected.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
To start with, the third output still has HTML markup,

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
but for the second input has also something fishy going on because the quotes

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
that were actually part of the text have been removed.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
In our quiz, we only cared for the HTML markup,

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
so the third input definitely produces HTML markup.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
And therefore, this is the correct answer.
