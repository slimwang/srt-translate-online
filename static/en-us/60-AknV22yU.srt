1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,430
Let's take a look at what
the Analytics Dashboard reveals

2
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:06,510
about the path that users
take to buy products.

3
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:08,870
You go to the Shopping Behavior page and

4
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:11,380
you should now see some
sessions with transactions.

5
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:14,540
Now let's look at the checkout behavior.

6
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:20,840
So this screen shows the sessions where
users got as far as the checkout step.

7
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:25,180
So we had seven sessions where
they started checkout and

8
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:28,720
two sessions that ended
in a transaction.

9
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:31,480
We'll look more into how you
can track users' progress

10
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:34,600
through the checkout
process in a minute.

11
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,410
Now let's look at
the Product Performance Screen.

12
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:41,700
Earlier, you saw that this screen shows
all the products that have been included

13
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,210
in analytics hits.

14
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:47,379
But up until now, there was zero
revenue associated with any of them.

15
00:00:47,379 --> 00:00:51,280
But you expect that to change now
that some actual sales have occurred.

16
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,290
Oh and it has $15.00 for dinner.

17
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:56,720
So here we see the revenue for

18
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:00,300
the products that were included
in the purchase actions.

19
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,760
You can drill down into
the products to get more details.

20
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:07,960
So we see that these three
dinners here got bought.

21
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,630
There's money associated with them.

22
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:12,180
And these other dinners
did not get bought.

23
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,640
So again you can set
a secondary dimension,

24
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:21,650
if you want to see the labels for the
products: Ecommerce > Product Variant.

25
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:25,780
And now I can see which dinners
were the ones that got bought.

26
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:31,370
So the product SKU, also pronounced
skew, is the ID for the product.

27
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:33,650
SKU is a stock keeping unit.

28
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:36,430
It's something that retailers
use to uniquely identify

29
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:37,930
each product they sell.

30
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:41,600
So here it's called product SKU,
but here in the code,

31
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,600
we talk about the product ID,
but actually it's just the ID.

32
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,500
The method that sets it is setId.

33
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,360
You can drill down into the Products.

34
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:56,085
I didn't set any coupon code or
affiliations.

35
00:01:56,085 --> 00:01:59,705
But you can see that this is where
they would show up if you'd set them.

36
00:01:59,705 --> 00:02:03,115
You can also see other kinds of
information, such as the quantity that

37
00:02:03,115 --> 00:02:07,123
got added to the cart, and the quantity
that got removed from the cart.

38
00:02:07,123 --> 00:02:08,335
And, of course, for

39
00:02:08,335 --> 00:02:12,395
a remove cart hit to be registered,
you'd actually have to write the code to

40
00:02:12,395 --> 00:02:16,715
send that hit in the method that
implemented the remove from cart action.
