1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,550
So let's see how do we access the magnetic disks

2
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:06,270
and how long does it take to get to our data?

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:08,792
We will assume that the disk is already spinning. If

4
00:00:08,792 --> 00:00:12,668
the disk is not spinning it takes possibly several seconds to

5
00:00:12,668 --> 00:00:15,380
actually spin up the disks. So most of the time

6
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:18,572
if you're accessing the data frequently, the disk would just keep

7
00:00:18,572 --> 00:00:22,014
spinning. So if the disk is spinning then the axis

8
00:00:22,014 --> 00:00:25,325
time consists of the seek time, which is the time it

9
00:00:25,325 --> 00:00:31,020
takes to move the head assembly to the correct cylinder for our data. So we know

10
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:33,940
where the data is, we know which cylinder,

11
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:37,600
which sector, which surface. We first have to get

12
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,100
the heads so that they are above the

13
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:42,930
correct cylinder. So at that point, one of the

14
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:46,070
heads will be above the track where our

15
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:51,490
data really is. Next, there is the rotational latency.

16
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:54,500
After we have moved the heads, they're somewhere

17
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,580
along the track, but not necessarily, and usually

18
00:00:57,580 --> 00:00:59,820
not, above the very sector that we are

19
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:04,762
interested in. So the rotational latency is about waiting

20
00:01:04,762 --> 00:01:07,614
for the start of our sector to finally

21
00:01:07,614 --> 00:01:11,288
get under the head that will read it. Note

22
00:01:11,288 --> 00:01:13,829
that the head is actually sitting in one

23
00:01:13,829 --> 00:01:16,986
place at this point, but the platter is rotating

24
00:01:16,986 --> 00:01:19,758
so different parts of the track are getting

25
00:01:19,758 --> 00:01:23,223
under the head and the rotational latency's how long

26
00:01:23,223 --> 00:01:26,303
until the beginning of our sector gets under the

27
00:01:26,303 --> 00:01:30,190
head. Next we have the data read which is,

28
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:32,920
we read until the end to the sector is

29
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:36,534
seen by the head. Again the data read really

30
00:01:36,534 --> 00:01:38,812
depends on how fast a disk is spinning and

31
00:01:38,812 --> 00:01:42,038
how many sectors we have per track. For example,

32
00:01:42,038 --> 00:01:44,882
if the whole track is just one sector, then

33
00:01:44,882 --> 00:01:47,726
the data read will be a whole rotation of the

34
00:01:47,726 --> 00:01:51,074
disk. If we have ten sectors per track, then

35
00:01:51,074 --> 00:01:54,870
the data read will be one-tenth of a rotation. Then

36
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:57,840
there is some controller time for the disk controller

37
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,750
to actually check the check sound, determine that the sector

38
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:04,135
is okay, and so on. And the IO bus time

39
00:02:04,135 --> 00:02:07,600
which is once the disk drive itself and its controller

40
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,910
have the data, how long does it take

41
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:13,420
to actually get that data to the main memory?

42
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:15,970
Now note that unlike a cache or a DRAM

43
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:20,390
where we could actually be doing multiple axises potentially

44
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:23,280
at the same time, on a magnetic disk once

45
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,000
we seek to one track we cannot really be

46
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,271
reading other tracks. So really what happens is accesses

47
00:02:30,271 --> 00:02:33,095
to the disk are happening one at a time.

48
00:02:33,095 --> 00:02:35,867
We go to a track, possibly read several

49
00:02:35,867 --> 00:02:39,647
sectors, but we cannot access another track until we

50
00:02:39,647 --> 00:02:45,090
are done with this one and move to the next track. So all of this is the

51
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:47,810
latency to do one disk access and often

52
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:50,785
times the latency of a disk request made by

53
00:02:50,785 --> 00:02:54,865
the operating system includes this, plus a significant

54
00:02:54,865 --> 00:02:58,180
queuing delay because we first have to wait for

55
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:03,280
previous accesses to finish doing this and only then our access can move

56
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,360
the heads to the correct position and do a read or a write.
