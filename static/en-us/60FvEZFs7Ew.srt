1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
So what happens as we go down here, at least one vertex added and so on.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
So what does this have to do with measuring the hardness of vertex cover?

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Well, we'll get there in a minute.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
What I would like you to think about now is the following:

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Let's say we were looking at the decision variant of vertex cover

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
where as input we were given a graph and an integer K,

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and our output was an answer to the question,

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
does the graph have a vertex cover of size at most K?

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
So now here comes my next question to you,

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
what is the maximum height of the search tree

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
if we are not using it to solve the optimization version of vertex cover

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
but the decision version of vertex cover?

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Would that height be in half, would that height be K,

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
would that height be N, or something we can't say?

15
00:00:44,000 --> 99:59:59,999
And please choose the best possible one here.
