1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The answer is the box over here.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Some of you might have chosen this box, but I'll tell you in a second why this is the better box.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
This is the resulting pie chart where the red class is 20-32,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
and the remaining black class is the age group 33 and older.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Now let's do the math.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
To understand what area the red curve will occupy, we're going to divide 96,000

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
by the total number of students, which is 96/144.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
It happens to be the same as 8/12.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Now, the 8 mark is the one over here, but I chose the 9 mark.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
This is the 9 mark--1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
The reason is one mark has already been used up by the first class,

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,000
and now we incrementally add 8 to those to arrive over here.

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The surface area in the pie shown in red really corresponds to 8/12 of the total surface area.

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:12,000
If we now plug in the final class of 36,000 students, which is the same as 36/144 or 3/12,

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:20,000
you'll find this area over here occupies exactly 3/12 of the total area.

16
00:01:20,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Hence this is the correct pie chart.
