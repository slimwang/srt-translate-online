00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,500
Here, we're going to
talk about metacognition.

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:06,000
Metacognition is thinking about
thinking, or knowing what you know.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,634
It's really any thought process,
where the target of the thought process,

4
00:00:08,634 --> 00:00:10,560
is actually inside you're own brain.

5
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:12,660
So it might be thinking about
what you're thinking about,

6
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:15,160
or knowing what knowledge that you have.

7
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:18,352
Now, a key type of metacognition,
in learning, is called self-regulated

8
00:00:18,352 --> 00:00:22,180
learning.-Self regulated learning is the
process by which a person plans out how

9
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:25,150
they're going to learn something,
monitors how learning is going,

10
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:27,585
evaluates it, and
then adjusts it accordingly.

11
00:00:27,585 --> 00:00:30,850
Self-regulated learning is really
the goal that we want students to reach.

12
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:34,210
We want them to become self-regulated
learners because it's more about

13
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:35,680
active learning rather
than passive learning.

14
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,690
It's about driving your own learning
process as opposed to being a passive

15
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:41,640
consumer of whatever information
is presented to you.

16
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,880
Now a key part of self-regulated
learning is the mindset that one has

17
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,000
towards learning.

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,750
There are a lot of people out
there that think they have

19
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:50,660
a fixed amount of intelligence, that
they are as smart as they'll ever be,

20
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:53,420
and if they can't do something it's
just because they aren't smart enough.

21
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:55,930
That's not really an accurate
way of framing intelligence.

22
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:59,920
Intelligence is much more something that
we can work at, we can grow through.

23
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:04,090
Through effort and intensive study we
can actually get smarter, effectively.

24
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:06,940
Now I think everybody has that one book
that they recommend that everybody read

25
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:08,200
and mine is actually on this topic.

26
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:14,070
Carol Dweck is a Stanford psychologist
who spent decades working on motivation

27
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:16,870
and learning, especially at the lower,
middle and high school levels.

28
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:20,800
And what she found was that ability
does not necessarily predict success at

29
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:21,880
the next level.

30
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,940
But the mindset that one
has towards learning and

31
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:26,680
towards intelligence is really
the chief predictor at whether or

32
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,990
not someone will be
successful at the next level.

33
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:31,350
She found that those people who
recognized that failure is just

34
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:35,590
an opportunity to learn, as opposed to
a referendum on one's own intelligence,

35
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:37,970
are really the ones who
succeed at the next level.

36
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:41,140
So I highly recommend picking
up this book, especially for

37
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:46,530
both designing educational
technology and for self-improvement.

38
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:49,780
So in this lesson what we're going to
talk about is really how to use

39
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:53,290
technology to facilitate
metacognitive development.

40
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:56,660
We'll talk about how technology can give
a kind of open-ended and self-driven

41
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:59,720
opportunities to students that would
be difficult in a regular classroom.

42
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,430
Typically classrooms are driven
by a lesson and a lecture and

43
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:05,240
it can be difficult to give students
the opportunity to drive what they're

44
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,030
learning In time.

45
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:08,630
But through technology,
we can build more open-ended

46
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:11,600
environments in which the learner
is put into the driver's seat.

47
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,440
And they get to control what they
learn and when, and how, and

48
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:17,140
learn at that process of monitoring it
and planning it, and evaluating it.

49
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:20,210
So we'll talk about how technology
can really facilitate meta-cognative

50
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:20,750
development
