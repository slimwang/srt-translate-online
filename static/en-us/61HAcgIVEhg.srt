>> When we answer these sorts of questions and make these types of calculations,

2
00:00:04,107 --> 00:00:08,369
we're actually using algebra. We're creating and using linear equations. But in

3
00:00:08,369 --> 00:00:12,682
algebra, we don't stop at the question, how much would 20 miles cost. We ask how

4
00:00:12,682 --> 00:00:16,808
much would x miles cost. I want to know the cost of my truck rental for any of

5
00:00:16,808 --> 00:00:21,167
the number of miles I drive it. So here's the big question. What expression can

6
00:00:21,167 --> 00:00:25,187
we write here that represents the cost of our truck rental in terms of the

7
00:00:25,187 --> 00:00:29,411
number of miles we drove x? Try thinking about the pattern in this table, and

8
00:00:29,411 --> 00:00:33,223
take some time. Don't worry if you don't know how to do this just yet. I want to

9
00:00:33,223 --> 00:00:36,970
get you thinking, and I want to try and give you a shot at it. Finally, when you

10
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:40,454
enter your answer, don't use the dollar sign. Just write the expression.
