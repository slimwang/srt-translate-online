00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:03,800
View controllers are deinitialized when
they slide off the screen to the right.

2
00:00:06,285 --> 00:00:10,380
DeInIt is invoked as view controllers
are popped off the navigation stack.

3
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:14,110
I'm overriding the deinit method in the
make your own adventure view controller,

4
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:16,860
and you can see that when
I press the back button

5
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:19,750
one print statement
appears in the console.

6
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:23,630
If I press the start over button, two
print statements appear in the console,

7
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:26,550
one for each view controller
that's popped off the stack.

8
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:30,650
This deinitializer is only
available in swift classes.

9
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:34,190
What else is specific to swift
classes as opposed to structs?

10
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:37,850
We've seen both classes and structs in
many of the apps we've built so far.

11
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:40,610
How does one know when to use
a struct and when to use a class?
