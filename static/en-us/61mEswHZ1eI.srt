So you might notice that these quizzes at the end of every single lesson have

2
00:00:02,969 --> 00:00:06,700
asked you to talk about what you learned in this lesson, to reflect on what you

3
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:10,280
learned in this lesson. One of the goals of these final quizzes is to

4
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:13,840
facilitate your own metacognition about your learning of this material as well.

5
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,379
So by answering this, you think about your own learning, and

6
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:19,680
hopefully improve it for the future. So what did you learn during this lesson?
