1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,801
So, we've done a lot of work with cake. And, as much as I like cake, especially

2
00:00:03,812 --> 00:00:07,631
chocolate cake, let's see how else we can use our fractions. Even if I spend all

3
00:00:07,643 --> 00:00:11,461
that time baking, I probably want to go outside. So, let's see our fractions in

4
00:00:11,473 --> 00:00:13,311
another content. Walking.

5
00:00:13,317 --> 00:00:17,360
So here's our next problem with fractions. You walk two fifths of a kilometer

6
00:00:17,372 --> 00:00:21,522
and then three tenths of a kilometer. How far did you walk? When thinking about

7
00:00:21,534 --> 00:00:25,652
this problem, I know I need to do something with these fractions. I'm trying to

8
00:00:25,664 --> 00:00:29,836
figure out the total distance I have to walk. So I should probably. Add these

9
00:00:29,848 --> 00:00:34,683
fractions together. So I have two fifth added to three tenths. Here I don't have

10
00:00:34,695 --> 00:00:39,438
common denominators, I cannot just add these together. So lets see what we can

11
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:44,151
do. But you might be wondering what's a kilometer. A kilometer is a measure of

12
00:00:44,163 --> 00:00:48,772
distance. We use the letter km to stand for kilometer. There's also the word

13
00:00:48,784 --> 00:00:52,517
kilo. Kilo means a thousand. So we know one kilometer is really a thousand

14
00:00:52,917 --> 00:00:58,130
meters. And you're probably wondering what's that distance like? So here's a

15
00:00:58,142 --> 00:01:03,505
picture of about a kilometer. In New York City, Central Park is about 849 meters

16
00:01:03,517 --> 00:01:08,430
across. 849 meters is just shy of 1,000 meters. So we know Central Park is.

17
00:01:08,742 --> 00:01:12,718
About a kilometer, but a little bit less then that. If you wanted to see for

18
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:16,515
yourself how long a kilometer is you could go outside, it takes about twelve

19
00:01:16,527 --> 00:01:20,685
minutes to walk a kilometer depending on how fast you walk. Alright, now that we

20
00:01:20,697 --> 00:01:24,971
know what a kilometer is let's get back to problem solving. Okay, I've rewritten

21
00:01:24,983 --> 00:01:28,619
our problem at the top, we walk two fifths of and then walked three tenths of a

22
00:01:28,631 --> 00:01:33,385
kilometer. How far did you walk? Let's picture this using a kilometer. I'm going

23
00:01:33,397 --> 00:01:37,654
to draw a bar that represents a kilometer. So this distance, or the full bar,

24
00:01:37,753 --> 00:01:42,258
would be one kilometer. Two fifths of a kilometer would only be this much. Let's

25
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:46,415
say the same thing for three tenths. Let's split up our kilometer bar into

26
00:01:46,427 --> 00:01:50,936
tenths. So I have a full kilometer bar, I have tenths, And three of them are

27
00:01:50,948 --> 00:01:55,326
shaded to repr esent three tenths of a kilometer. If I wanted to ever add two

28
00:01:55,094 --> 00:01:59,497
fifths and three tenths together, it would look like this. I would have the two

29
00:01:59,265 --> 00:02:03,570
fifths and then the three tenths Don't fall into the trap of thinking this is

30
00:02:03,582 --> 00:02:07,668
five out of fifthteen. I don't have fifthteen equally divided regions here. Even

31
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,851
though I have five of them, they're not equally spaced. I can't add two fifhts

32
00:02:12,095 --> 00:02:16,617
and three tenths together because I'm not dealing with the same dimensions or

33
00:02:16,629 --> 00:02:20,662
length. I know one fifth of a kilometer is actually longer than one tenths of a

34
00:02:20,674 --> 00:02:25,245
kilometer, so I can't simply add fifth and tenths together. Remember, I need to

35
00:02:25,257 --> 00:02:29,450
get a common denominator. So, what do you think? What would be the common

36
00:02:29,462 --> 00:02:33,353
denominator for two fifths and three tenths? You can enter your answer in this

37
00:02:33,365 --> 00:02:37,785
box here. Just give me only the denominator. What would you change tenths and

38
00:02:37,797 --> 00:02:38,465
fifths into?
