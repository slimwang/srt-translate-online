1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:02,719
Suppose you've just returned to your home on

2
00:00:02,719 --> 00:00:05,689
a cold, winter day. The house is cold.

3
00:00:05,689 --> 00:00:07,510
So you want to get to a comfortable

4
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:11,677
temperature as quickly as possible. Suppose that's say,

5
00:00:11,677 --> 00:00:15,720
73 degrees Fahrenheit or 23 Celsius. What temperature

6
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:19,400
should you set the thermostat to? Very high,

7
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:22,760
like 90 degrees Fahrenheit or 35 Celsius. You

8
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:25,710
know, to get it up there fast. Or set

9
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:31,760
it to what I really want it to end up with, like 73 Fahrenheit or 23 Celsius.

10
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,740
Explain the reason for your choice. In other words,

11
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:37,930
what's your conceptual model of how the heater works?
