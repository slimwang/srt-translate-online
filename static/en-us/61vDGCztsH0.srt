1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,790
So now let us try our hand at some tree height reduction.

2
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:08,680
Suppose we have these six instructions. We are adding R1 and R2,

3
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:14,420
putting the result in R10. Then subtracting R3 from that. Then adding R4.

4
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:19,590
Then subtracting R5. Then adding R6, and then subtracting R7.

5
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:25,150
If we now do a tree height reduction on this, what do we get? And

6
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:28,630
I already pre-populated most of the answers for you. So,

7
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:34,820
we're still going to add R1 and R2, and put the result in R10. But then,

8
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:39,910
what do we add and put in R11? What do we add R11 to and

9
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:44,070
put that in R10? What do we then add up and put the result in R11?

10
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:50,340
And then we add R7 to what, and put the result in R11? And

11
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:56,050
finally, we will subtract R11 from R10, and get the final result in R10.

12
00:00:56,050 --> 00:01:00,970
And this should be the same result that we got here. So, the question for

13
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:06,320
you is what should be in these five places? And also,

14
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:13,090
the ILP here is clearly six cycles for six instructions, which gets us a one.

15
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:17,750
Why? Well, because each of the instructions depends on the previous one.

16
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:23,010
With your new tree height reduced code, what is the LP?

17
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:27,100
We still have six instructions. How many cycles do we need to do them now?
