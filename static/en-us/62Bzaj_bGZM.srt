1
00:00:00,002 --> 00:00:05,309
Interestingly enough, in this case the range is also just values that are

2
00:00:05,309 --> 00:00:10,180
greater than 0. Since the endpoint that we are starting from is this open circle

3
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:14,789
at the origin. And that all of the points lie to the right and above this point.

4
00:00:14,789 --> 00:00:19,350
No value of a of x is ever going to drop below the x axis. We also have to know

5
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:23,620
about the overall shape of the entire function, a of x, without the domain

6
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:27,793
restriction. So if you're looking at this in an idealist environment. Maybe it

7
00:00:27,793 --> 00:00:31,947
would help us out to look at this entire function without the domain restriction

8
00:00:31,947 --> 00:00:34,243
or the range restriction for just a second.
