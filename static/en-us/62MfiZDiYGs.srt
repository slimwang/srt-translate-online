1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:05,160
So our video, as shown here by this
candle that's flickering here,

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:07,050
basically it's nothing else but

3
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:12,230
a stack of images on top of each other
that are displayed to us over time.

4
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:15,270
So we still have the x and
y coordinates we had before.

5
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:16,000
And, of course,

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,160
the stack of images basically means
that we put them on top of each other.

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,890
And, of course,
as the next one comes, and

8
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:25,500
in this case I've actually also
layered them to kind of show you

9
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,800
that basically time is
progressing in this direction.

10
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,370
So this is basically the time axis.

11
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:34,940
Of course, they're offsetted here
to showcase the details of this.

12
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:39,320
So digital video essentially is,
same as an image in numeric

13
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:44,820
representation in two dimensions,
x and y, stacked in time t.

14
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:48,000
And, of course, just like we did with
images, now we actually will look at

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,280
a three dimensional data
structure where we can access any

16
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,180
information on this stacked image here
by traversing this in of course x and

17
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:56,690
y here and of course in time.

18
00:00:56,690 --> 00:01:00,185
So this basically becomes accessing
things in a continuous function,

19
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:06,480
I(x,y,t) and a discreet function
(i,j,t) in a discrete formulation.

20
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:09,370
So, similar to what we've done for
images, except now we also want

21
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:14,280
to traverse for information in this
dimension, the time dimension.

22
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,030
In case of video, just like images,

23
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:18,410
we have to discuss
the concept of resolution.

24
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:21,610
It's expressed as a representation
of width and height of an image.

25
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:26,152
But, usually, and this is again more
standardization exists on video and

26
00:01:26,152 --> 00:01:29,470
actually was much more
standard until recently, and

27
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:32,890
most of the videos you see are in
the aspect ratios of four by three.

28
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:36,270
So, most television footage that
you got in the old days when you

29
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:39,430
had bigger TVs was four by three,
much more standard definition.

30
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:42,880
As we move to higher definition, we
move to resolutions of sixteen by nine.

31
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,590
An important thing to note, even when
I'm showing here a video which is

32
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:50,220
square, most of the time, you never
actually saw videos that were square.

33
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:53,600
You always saw them in aspect ratios
of four by three or sixteen by nine.

34
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:58,540
Of course, only recently have we
started seeing videos that are actually

35
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:01,740
in portrait form, not landscape form.

36
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:05,840
And that is because again, the artifact
of using handheld cell phone cameras

37
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,508
which usually have this form
factor as opposed to this.

38
00:02:08,508 --> 00:02:11,250
But mostly, and one of the things
that's standardized in video,

39
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:13,980
of course, both the resolution and
the aspect ratio.

40
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:17,780
And again, it's pretty much driven
again by the display mechanisms,

41
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:20,760
because most of the videos are watched
on televisions and they're, of course,

42
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:21,940
of specific resolutions.

43
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:26,888
Of course, these days, we're going away
from even just standard resolutions of

44
00:02:26,888 --> 00:02:31,670
sixteen by nine, into real 4D or
4k videos and stuff like that which

45
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:35,515
have more resolution, the aspect ratios
are still being kind of made consistent.

46
00:02:35,515 --> 00:02:37,915
But, a lot of changes
are coming in this discipline.

47
00:02:37,915 --> 00:02:41,315
The other thing that is different
about images on a videos,

48
00:02:41,315 --> 00:02:45,085
is basically again that it has
different types of file formats.

49
00:02:45,085 --> 00:02:49,060
These file formats include the images,
and of course, what they also include is

50
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:52,980
information about what frame
rates to play these images at.

51
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:57,330
And additionally there is much more
information about, what kind of

52
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:00,690
compression code acts are being used and
what kind of wrappers are being used.

53
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:04,250
And of course, there are lots of
different file formats available for

54
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:04,850
videos.

55
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:09,790
I'm sure you've played around with
things like AVI, MPEG, MP4 and what not.

56
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:12,750
Again, we were not going to get into
any conversations about compression

57
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:16,040
in this class, but there's a lot of
literature out there you can look at.

58
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:20,300
But, overall we're interested in
being able to access the pixels

59
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:23,830
over time to be able to do the kinds
of processing we're interested in, and

60
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:27,000
that's what this whole lecture is about,
to get you thinking about that concept.
