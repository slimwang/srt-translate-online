00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,650
There are a number of commercial
technologies for centralized HIE.

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:08,390
In addition, the federal government
sponsored the development of CONNECT,

3
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:11,130
an open-source solution for
centralized or

4
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:13,740
other models of health
information exchange.

5
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:16,780
CONNECT is a very robust, complex system

6
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:21,920
that uses web services to facilitate
connectivity with other systems.

7
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:27,270
Its architecture is modular with some
elements, as indicated by these colors,

8
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:30,760
being required, others being optional or

9
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:34,750
replaceable, and
still others being customizeable.

10
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:39,220
It's also a gateway to the proposed
National Health Information Exchange,

11
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:40,610
as shown here.

12
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:44,495
Why would some CONNECT modules
be replaceable or customizeable?
