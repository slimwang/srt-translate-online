00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:04,230
In your main activity, you should
now populate the Geofence list.

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:09,500
To do this, first create an array
list of Geofence objects.

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:14,520
Then, create a helper function,
call it populateGeofenceList, and

4
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:17,051
in this helper function
perform the following steps.

5
00:00:17,051 --> 00:00:19,022
Number one, read the HashMap.

6
00:00:19,022 --> 00:00:24,067
Number two, create Geofence objects out
of the data that was in the HashMap.

7
00:00:24,067 --> 00:00:26,934
And then add these Geofence objects
to this ArrayList<> that you

8
00:00:26,934 --> 00:00:27,760
created earlier.

9
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,280
When you're done with this,
check this box.
