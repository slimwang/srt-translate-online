1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:03,590
So the second requirement talked
about being able to express

2
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:05,939
the address of a book.

3
00:00:05,939 --> 00:00:08,080
It's phone number, library card,
how to reference it.

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,570
And that information was
apparent in the diagram.

5
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:13,040
You could see that those
attributes were supported.

6
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:17,500
So two seems like it's expressed,
at least already in the diagram and

7
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:20,480
then I said about requirements.

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,100
>> Okay, let's just stick with two for
the time.

9
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:23,750
>> Okay.

10
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:29,230
>> So, typically, in situations
where the requirements talk

11
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:34,099
about the availability of information,
such as with requirements two,

12
00:00:34,099 --> 00:00:38,960
the UML notation is completely
adequate for describing that.

13
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,300
You were saying three partially.

14
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:42,470
>> Three partially.

15
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:47,450
There's mentioning of, based on the
functional stubs, that things could be

16
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:51,660
overdue, or that you could, I believe,
get the information about that.

17
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,500
But there's a lot that needs to be done
in order to fulfill that requirement

18
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:59,690
that I don't think the diagram
can actually do by itself.

19
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:02,140
>> Okay, I think you're exactly right.

20
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:04,150
And requirement three talked about

21
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:09,750
essentially some queries being made in
order to find out information about

22
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,610
items a patron has checked out for
example.

23
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:16,110
And a query is a kind of operation and

24
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:20,070
whenever the requirements indicate
that there's an operation,

25
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:25,460
you can in your UML diagram give
the signature of the operation.

26
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:30,130
But the actual details of what
the operation is supposed to compute,

27
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:32,330
UML can't deal with that.

28
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:34,380
So we're going to need OCL for that.

29
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:38,570
Was there another one that you thought
the diagram was sufficient for?

30
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:42,680
>> I listed both five and nine, and
requirement five talks about audio

31
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:47,050
visual materials, which there is
a class for that in the UML diagram.

32
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:51,611
And then for reference books,
I believe magazines

33
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:57,290
that can't be checked out,
they have classes in the UML diagram.

34
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:02,290
In that sense I think they're
kind of partially specify, or

35
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:05,460
they're partially taking care of the
requirement, but in terms of not being

36
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:08,930
able to check them out, that type
of functionality, it doesn't exist.

37
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:14,150
>> Okay, so recall in the diagram,
we invented some subclasses,

38
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:18,045
one for things that were loanable and
things that were not loanable.

39
00:02:18,045 --> 00:02:22,640
So references and
magazines were not loanable.

40
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,140
>> Right.

41
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:25,660
>> So by the nature of the diagram
we were able to express that.

42
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:27,280
So that's requirement nine.

43
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:27,810
>> Right.

44
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:33,170
I guess I don't know if it was
enforceable by the diagram.

45
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:38,630
In terms of, functionally when you
actually try to check something out,

46
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:41,970
it seems like there's still something
you have to do as a programmer,

47
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:43,410
outside of the diagram.

48
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:49,090
>> Okay, so another thing to look at
in the diagram is the association line

49
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:53,200
between the patron and
it went only to loanable item.

50
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,230
It didn't go to the non-loanable item.

51
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:55,780
Okay?

52
00:02:55,780 --> 00:03:00,870
So there's no association
expressed in the diagram

53
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:05,810
that supports checking out
references and and magazines.

54
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:08,740
Okay, so nine I think is covered.

55
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:11,430
The other one you mentioned was
requirement five which talks

56
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:15,210
about a patron checking out books and
audiovisual materials.

57
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:18,600
This is also an operation.

58
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:22,170
This is going to require
that the system,

59
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:25,390
ultimately implemented, do some
work at the time that that happens.

60
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:27,190
And that corresponds to an operation,
and

61
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:31,275
once again,
we need to say what that means, okay?

62
00:03:31,275 --> 00:03:33,080
>> Mm-hm.
>> So for example,

63
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:39,960
if we were to talk about checking things
out, some record has to be kept of that.

64
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:47,080
We have to be able to ensure
the other requirement about

65
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:51,580
the kids only being able to check out
a limited number of books and so on.

66
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:53,150
So there's going to be work to do there,
and

67
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:55,940
we need to be able to express that work.

68
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:59,436
So five is something that is going to
require us to say a little bit more

69
00:03:59,436 --> 00:04:00,370
about it.

70
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:00,870
>> Okay.
