1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:06,920
I start with a model, that I think it's
good to figure out your persistence,

2
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:10,840
figure out the objects that will be
in the model, write it and test it.

3
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:15,001
Once your model is in place, it's tested
enough that you're confident in it,

4
00:00:15,001 --> 00:00:18,455
it's just much easier
to proceed from there.

5
00:00:18,455 --> 00:00:23,185
>> So, once I have everything all
ready to build a new project,

6
00:00:23,185 --> 00:00:26,975
my first step in Xcode is
>> File new project.

7
00:00:26,975 --> 00:00:30,070
[LAUGH]
>> So the way I started out,

8
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:34,080
when I have an idea, is I want to sort
of validate the core proposition and

9
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:37,360
just verify that I can
actually build it.

10
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:42,220
So I just dig in as fast as I can,
I don't worry a lot about code quality.

11
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:46,000
I don't worry a lot about what
the final app is going to look like.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,340
I just want to validate that
usually its inspiration and

13
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:53,220
that's what keeps me coming
back to finish the app.

14
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:57,749
>> So, when I'm starting to build the
app I think the most important thing is

15
00:00:57,749 --> 00:01:00,100
to get from a to b as quick as you can.

16
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:01,890
>> I've done a lot of
different projects and

17
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:05,810
where I usually get stuck or
stalled is when I try to optimize for

18
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:09,870
every little corner case that might
happen, so taking what your idea is and

19
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:13,390
trying to figure out how to get to stage
one, version one of the app, just have

20
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:17,630
something that you can use and that's
usually what I try to build first.

21
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:23,740
>> I take a lot of time to read
the documentation and to make sure

22
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:30,850
the tools that I'm going to be using to
make the project are the right tools.

23
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:34,880
Sometimes you find that the tools
are no longer supported and

24
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,170
you have to pivot and
find something new.

25
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:38,620
Sometimes you find

26
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,770
something that just came out that's
better and easier to implement.

27
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:48,290
Sometimes you find the documentation
is really hard to read, and

28
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:52,200
you have to take more time
to just decipher what it is.

29
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:57,485
When I'm starting a new project
from scratch, I think of,

30
00:01:57,485 --> 00:02:00,150
at first I try and
make a minimum viable product.

31
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:03,780
I think of the simplest version of
the app that I can possibly think of,

32
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:05,380
and then I build that.
