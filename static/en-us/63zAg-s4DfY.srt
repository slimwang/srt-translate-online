00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:06,540
What interfaces do you need to implement
in order to use the Google API Client

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:11,000
with connection callbacks,
connection failed listeners, and

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,080
location listeners?

4
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,550
Read these pieces of code carefully and

5
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:17,770
then check the one that
you believe applies.
