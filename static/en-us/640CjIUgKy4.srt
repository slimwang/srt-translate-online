1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:04,760
Now let's talk specifically about organizational libraries.

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:08,710
Organizational libraries are libraries, just like jQuery, but instead of

3
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:14,740
focusing on AJAX and DOM manipulation, they focus on application organization.

4
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:15,980
MVC or MVVM,

5
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:21,970
what we know as model view octopus, and often some other things as well.

6
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:24,990
Now, there are a lot of organizational libraries out there, but

7
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:29,650
they're all solving the same problem in fundamentally similar ways.

8
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:32,040
They do have slight differences in organization or

9
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,540
implementation, and that's what the documentation is for.

10
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:40,200
But by now, if you understand the basics of separation of concerns,

11
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,830
then you can understand any of these organizational libraries.

12
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:45,846
Now, what about frameworks?

13
00:00:45,846 --> 00:00:50,918
What is a framework, and how do they differ from organizational libraries?

14
00:00:50,918 --> 00:00:53,690
Well, while scripting this course, I talked to a bunch of

15
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:57,350
people about this question because I was a little fuzzy on it myself.

16
00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:00,290
And it turns out, everyone has a different answer and

17
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:05,480
none of them fit 100% with what libraries and frameworks call themselves.

18
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,450
So let's take a step back.

19
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:09,120
Here's the real issue.

20
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:12,530
It's not one person or institution defining these words.

21
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:14,330
It's a community of thousands and

22
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:18,470
thousands of developers, and they aren't all on the same page as each other.

23
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:21,500
Some people say frameworks are collections of libraries.

24
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:24,680
Some other people say that frameworks call view render methods,

25
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:27,330
while the libraries require you to call them.

26
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:29,210
There's a wide range of definitions, and

27
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:33,630
if you do want proof of this, do a quick Google search and start counting.

28
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:35,470
In fact, if you look at the edit history for

29
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:38,050
the Wikipedia pages on JavaScript for libraries and

30
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:42,200
frameworks, you'll even see disagreement among the editors themselves.

31
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:46,340
So, what is the difference between an organizational library and a framework?

32
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:50,120
Well, it feels like a cop-out, but I would say, don't worry about it too much.

33
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,540
Organizational libraries and

34
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:55,370
frameworks both solve the same problem and in similar ways.

35
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:59,170
So, to me at least, it doesn't matter a ton what we call it.

36
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:02,870
It just matters that we can use them regardless of what they call themselves.
