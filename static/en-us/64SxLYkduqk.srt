1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:04,990
You had to use the T table for this and the degrees of freedom is 23 and the t

2
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:12,034
critical value is 2.069. This is because we're going a nondirectional test. In

3
00:00:12,034 --> 00:00:17,745
other words, our alternative hypothesis is this one. So we'll have 2.5% in each

4
00:00:17,745 --> 00:00:22,808
tale. With 23 degrees of freedom. Out t statistic is greater than this,

5
00:00:22,808 --> 00:00:28,104
therefore there is evidence to reject the null. Meaning that there is evidence

6
00:00:28,104 --> 00:00:33,066
of a significant relationship between x and y in the population. The observed

7
00:00:33,066 --> 00:00:36,450
relationship is not likely due to sampling error.
