00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,660
To start off,
I need to give credit to Jake Archibald,

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:07,760
who came up with the idea for this quiz,
and who also wrote this code.

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:10,220
There are two parts to the ready method.

4
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:14,060
It checks the ready state when
the readystatechange event fires, and

5
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:17,090
it also checks the ready
state immediately.

6
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:18,460
By checking it immediately,

7
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:22,240
this ready method will still work if
the ready state becomes interactive.

8
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:26,090
Before creating this promise,
so that's pretty useful.

9
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:29,170
And if the readyState is still
loading when the promise is created,

10
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:33,830
it'll call checkState every time
the readystatechange event fires.

11
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:37,560
Once the readyState is no
longer loading, it resolves.

12
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:38,950
So here's how I'll test it.

13
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:43,380
I simply call ready, and
then chain, then wrapperResolved.

14
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:45,340
Time to see how it looks.

15
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:47,600
To test this quiz it's
kind of hard to see but

16
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:53,080
I'm using to 2G so that the image
takes a little bit to load.

17
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:57,020
Remember this text should say
resolved before the image shows up.

18
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:58,500
Now, it already say resolved but

19
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,690
let see what happens when
the page get refreshed.

20
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:05,390
You can see that its resolved
immediately before the image even

21
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:08,160
finishes loading, that's pretty cool.

22
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:08,800
Okay.

23
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,780
Now it's time to try some air handling.
