1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:03,100
In fact, this is a really important point. The

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:07,290
browser can't really tell that it's definitively online. It

3
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:10,330
can't tell that it's definitively offline either, unless it

4
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:13,670
really has no connection to another device at all.

5
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:18,090
In fact there's an attribute, navigator.onLine, that supposedly tells

6
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:20,370
you whether you're online or not. There's also a

7
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:22,300
pair of events that fire up the body of

8
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:25,880
the document when you go online or offline. However,

9
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:29,060
I don't recommend relying on these, they really just tell

10
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:31,270
you if there's a network connection or not, they don't

11
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:33,620
tell you if that network connection is actually connected to

12
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:38,130
anything. For example, my computer at home is occasionally fooled

13
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:41,080
because my cable modem will go out, but my computer

14
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:45,130
is still connected to the router. Sometimes, computers or applications

15
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:47,560
will use pings to various servers to tell them if

16
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:51,360
there's a connection to the internet. But fundamentally, as a developer

17
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,310
the only offline status that matters to you is can

18
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:57,650
you get to your own servers, and of course in the

19
00:00:57,650 --> 00:01:01,250
cellular radio case it can be even more complex we've all

20
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:04,300
had the experience of having a one bar signal. And trying

21
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:07,680
to use the network. In fact, this is a critical

22
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,490
point to offline use, and why we say you need to

23
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:14,200
build offline first. You might think the way to support offline

24
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,740
is to use the network first and then if it fails

25
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:18,990
you can rely on the cash, but that doesn't

26
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:22,010
really work in the real world. Precisely because it can

27
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:24,580
take a long time to determine, if you don't

28
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:27,880
really have an internet connection. If you only offer cache

29
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:31,570
data once a network request has difinitively failed, you

30
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:35,380
leave users waiting while their device desperately tries, but fails

31
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:38,850
to actually transfer data over the network. This is what

32
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:42,160
we mean by offline first, not that you should code

33
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:45,040
offline first, but to underscore that your app has

34
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,980
to be able to use cache data first. And then

35
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:51,460
update the cache contents when it's online, but continue

36
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:53,800
to use old data from the cache when it's offline.
