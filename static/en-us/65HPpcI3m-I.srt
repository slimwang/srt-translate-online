1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:04,890
We use the outer 2 bits to index
into the rows of the table.

2
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:09,630
The outer 2 bits is 01,
so it's this row, 01.

3
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:15,360
And the middle 4 bits are used to
index into the columns of the table.

4
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,024
And the middle 4 bits here are 1101.

5
00:00:18,024 --> 00:00:21,130
So the 1101, and that's this column.

6
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:24,040
The entry in a table is the output.

7
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:29,490
In this case, the entry is 1001,

8
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:32,520
therefore 1001 is the output for
bit value.
