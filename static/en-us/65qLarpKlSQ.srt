00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:04,930
There are two models that examine the role of stress in relation to our health.

2
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:09,010
One is the Physiological Reactivity Model, which attempts to explain the causal

3
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:14,736
role of stress-related bodily changes in illness. The second model is called

4
00:00:14,736 --> 00:00:18,660
the Health Behavior Approach. Here the explanation for illness or health is

5
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:23,880
focused on the role of behaviors such as diet, exercise, and substance abuse.

6
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:27,699
We already discussed how diet, exercise, and substance abuse are ways of coping

7
00:00:27,699 --> 00:00:32,759
with stress, so we won't say much more about the health behavior approach.

8
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:36,819
However, let's talk about the physiological reactivity model. So let's take

9
00:00:36,819 --> 00:00:40,275
this example, let's say you walk in the class and the professor says, put your

10
00:00:40,275 --> 00:00:44,993
books away, take out a piece of paper, we're having a test. Hearing this

11
00:00:44,993 --> 00:00:49,230
statement from your professor may cause stress. The fact that you're not

12
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:54,367
prepared for the pop quiz results in a stressful response. However, if you have

13
00:00:54,367 --> 00:00:58,271
read the material and studied, hearing the professor say put your notes away

14
00:00:58,271 --> 00:01:03,980
and get out a sheet of paper may not result in a stressful response. So here we

15
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:08,540
have an event, which is the pop quiz, and then your appraisal of the situation.

16
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:13,344
And this, is what's really important here. You may appraise a situation in a

17
00:01:13,344 --> 00:01:18,896
positive and beneficial way which produces positive emotions. However on the

18
00:01:18,896 --> 00:01:22,202
other hand you may see the situation as negative or even potentially

19
00:01:22,202 --> 00:01:27,063
threatening and that produces negative emotions. From here the negative

20
00:01:27,063 --> 00:01:32,116
emotions causes the stress response. Which you can recall is the activation of

21
00:01:32,116 --> 00:01:37,161
the sympathetic nervous system. However, prolonged exposure to the stressful

22
00:01:37,161 --> 00:01:41,449
situation causes extended release of cortisol and sustained activation of the

23
00:01:41,449 --> 00:01:47,699
sympathetic nervous system which in turn weakens the body. As we discussed

24
00:01:47,699 --> 00:01:51,920
earlier the body is negatively effected by the suppression of the immune system

25
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:57,150
which increases our succeptability to illness. Now one factor we did not

26
00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:01,054
discuss was that prolong exposure to activation of the sympathetic nervous

27
00:02:01,054 --> 00:02:06,246
system also has negative consequences on our cardiovascular health.
