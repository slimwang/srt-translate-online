00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:03,106
Let's go through each of these statements to decide whether or not they're each

2
00:00:03,106 --> 00:00:08,200
true. So, first things first, all functions have inverses. Well we know that

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:12,693
that's not true. Some functions, like y equals x squared, don't pass the

4
00:00:12,693 --> 00:00:17,424
horizontal line test. So, this doesn't have an inverse. We can't check this

5
00:00:17,424 --> 00:00:21,344
first one off then. Moving onto the second one, we have all inverse functions

6
00:00:21,344 --> 00:00:26,540
have inverses. This one is true. If we start off with one function, and reflect

7
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:30,982
it across the line y equals x. If we start off with one function, and then

8
00:00:30,982 --> 00:00:34,384
reflect it across the line, y equals x and end up with another function, then

9
00:00:34,384 --> 00:00:39,423
the second function is the inverse of the first one. But if we reflect the

10
00:00:39,423 --> 00:00:42,216
second one back across the line y equals x again, we'll end up with its

11
00:00:42,216 --> 00:00:46,564
inverse, which is the first one. This is basically the same as the property I

12
00:00:46,564 --> 00:00:50,891
showed you before. If we have a function f inverse that we know is the inverse

13
00:00:50,891 --> 00:00:56,660
of f, and then we take its inverse, that just equals the original function f.

14
00:00:56,660 --> 00:01:00,635
So yes to the second choice. Now third, we have a function's domain can

15
00:01:00,635 --> 00:01:06,035
influence whether or not it has an inverse. This one is definitely true. We saw

16
00:01:06,035 --> 00:01:09,512
this with our parabola, which we took only portions of, and saw that those

17
00:01:09,512 --> 00:01:14,130
portions had inverses, while the whole parabola didn't. And we also saw the

18
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:17,667
same thing with our absolute value function. Fourth, all functions pass the

19
00:01:17,667 --> 00:01:22,305
vertical and horizontal line tests. Well all functions pass the vertical line

20
00:01:22,305 --> 00:01:26,196
tests. That's how we know that they're functions. But not often past the

21
00:01:26,196 --> 00:01:31,399
horizontal line test. So this isn't true. The last choice however, is true. All

22
00:01:31,399 --> 00:01:37,211
inverse functions pass both the vertical and horizontal line tests. Inverse

23
00:01:37,211 --> 00:01:40,762
functions are functions, so they pass the vertical line test, and since inverse

24
00:01:40,762 --> 00:01:44,207
functions all have inverses as we've already decided, that means they have to

25
00:01:44,207 --> 00:01:48,934
cross the horizontal line test, as well. Now I personally think this was a

26
00:01:48,934 --> 00:01:52,589
really, really tough quiz. This required you to show some very in-depth

27
00:01:52,589 --> 00:01:55,785
understanding of inverse functions, and to think really critically about all of

28
00:01:55,785 --> 00:02:00,749
these statements. Awesome job on this quiz and on the entire lesson.
