00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,380
The proliferation of mobile devices has
revolutionized a number of industries,

2
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:05,300
and education is no different.

3
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:08,630
One of the real big strengths in
mobile devices is their ubiquity.

4
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:11,240
Most of our students already have
these kinds of mobile devices

5
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:13,520
in their pocket right now,
with them at all times.

6
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:16,010
And that gives us a real opportunity
to create some really interesting

7
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:17,290
learning activities.

8
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:19,550
So, for example,
if a student's at a national park or

9
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:22,700
a Civil War battlefield, they can have
their mobile device guide them around

10
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:25,200
the battlefield telling them different
things that happened at different times,

11
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,460
complete with animation and voice-overs.

12
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:31,150
So there's real opportunities to create
some really interesting learning

13
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:31,780
experiences.

14
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:35,620
As a new father, I'm very grateful for
the use of this technology in this way,

15
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:38,460
because my daughter gets a phone
call from Elmo every day, and

16
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:40,770
it just makes her face light
up whenever it happens.

17
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:43,500
So I'm very appreciative of
the possibility to use educational

18
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,370
technology in cahoots
with mobile devices.

19
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:48,520
But there are other things
to mobile devices as well.

20
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,540
There are different
features that they have.

21
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:52,380
They're different than anything
we've dealt with in the past.

22
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:52,950
They have a GPS.

23
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:53,790
They have a camera.

24
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:55,150
They have motion sensors.

25
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:57,955
And all of these things can be used
to create some really interesting

26
00:00:57,955 --> 00:01:00,110
educational experiences and
different domains.

27
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:02,450
So what we're going to talk about
in this class is a lot about how

28
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:05,860
the ubiquity of mobile devices can be
leveraged to create unique experiences,

29
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:07,770
but also about how some of those
other features can be used in

30
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:08,720
other context as well.
