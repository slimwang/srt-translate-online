00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,425
Before we conclude this lesson, let's discuss some useful

2
00:00:03,425 --> 00:00:07,740
multithreading patterns for structuring applications that use threads.

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:11,570
We will look at the boss-workers pattern, the pipeline pattern, and

4
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:12,720
the layered pattern.

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:16,430
Before we start, let's take a look at the toy shop application.

6
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:20,230
We will describe these pattern in the context of this application.

7
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:24,020
In this application, for each toy order we receive, and let's say

8
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:28,620
we're sticking to wooden toy orders, we have to perform the following steps.

9
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:31,470
First, we have to accept the order from the customer.

10
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:34,310
Then, we have to parse the order to see what it's for.

11
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:37,320
Then, we have to start cutting the wooden parts for the toy.

12
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,920
Then, we need to paint and add decorations for the toy parts.

13
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,580
Then, all those parts need to be put together to assemble the wooden toy.

14
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:47,540
And finally, we need to ship the order.

15
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:49,670
Depending on the multithreading pattern,

16
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:54,140
these steps will be assigned differently to the workers in the workshop.
