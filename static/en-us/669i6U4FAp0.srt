1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,270
It's an interesting
example of using PCA,

2
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:06,930
the stuff that we just talked about
on image patches and it's funny.

3
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:10,100
Like I said, I couldn't show you this
during the tracking part that we did

4
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:11,380
because you didn't know about PCA yet,
or

5
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:15,640
you certainly didn't know about it from
me and this really wasn't recognition,

6
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:19,240
but I thought it fit in well here
because now that you understood PCA

7
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:23,090
as a low dimensional representation,
we can use that for a lot of things.

8
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:23,940
So.

9
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:25,720
Now we get back to recognition.

10
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:28,050
Actually next time we'll
get back to recognition.
