1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,880
Now I'm going to draw a very similar--well, in a way very similar network for independent set.

2
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:12,550
At least, I'm going to place the vertices at the same locations and we'll just how similar they are.

3
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:16,670
And now, we're going to use similar quiz and this time, I would like you to check all vertices

4
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:20,270
not that belong to the largest clique but to the largest independent set.

5
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:23,030
Then you can make your check marks on each of the vertices

6
00:00:23,030 --> 99:59:59,999
that you think belong to the largest independent set.
