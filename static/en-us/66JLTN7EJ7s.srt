In addition to attributions we also use schemas to make sense of our world. Do

2
00:00:03,786 --> 00:00:06,194
you remember when we talked about schemas and how as humans we try to

3
00:00:06,194 --> 00:00:10,780
categorize things? Well, we do this with our social world when trying to form

4
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:15,676
impressions of other people, especially in ambiguous situations. And one way to

5
00:00:15,676 --> 00:00:19,478
do this is through stereotypes. Stereotypes are schemas of how people are

6
00:00:19,478 --> 00:00:24,262
likely to act, based on the group they belong to. We stereotypes that draw

7
00:00:24,262 --> 00:00:28,168
inferences about people based on the knowledge we have of the categories to

8
00:00:28,168 --> 00:00:30,350
which they belong.
