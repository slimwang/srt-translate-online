00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,710
Generally speaking, you won't have these symbols on your keyboard. You can find

2
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:06,710
them in your character map and you are welcome to use them if you'd like to.

3
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:09,455
But for the exercises in the rest of this lesson and in the next lesson,

4
00:00:09,455 --> 00:00:13,000
feel free to use the symbols given over here. These are the symbols for AND,

5
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:18,600
NOT, OR and Equals that come from Java or Python. So, feel free these when you

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,540
are doing the exercises that you'll come across in the rest of this lesson.
