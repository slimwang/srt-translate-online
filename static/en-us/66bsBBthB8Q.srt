1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Let's go through these and find an example

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I'm going to focus my attention here.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:11,000
This could either be 1 minus 2 minus 3 or 1 minus 2 minus 3.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
This ends up being 2--1 minus -1.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
This ends up being -4.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Very different answers.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
The parse tree for this interpretation looks a bit like this.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
It's left heavy with this other subtraction--1 minus 2--down and to the left.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Over here the parse tree would be right heavy.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Now, I'm not drawing all the nodes in the parse tree just to save a bit of time.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Mostly, I'm highlighting its shape.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
This is an example of a string that has more than one parse tree in our grammar.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Similarly, this bigger string has more than one parse tree in our grammar.

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
It might even have four different parse trees, possibly even more.

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
You'd have to try that and find out.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Notably, it contains 1 minus 2 minus 3 as a subpart.

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Even if this -4 at the end is perfectly unambiguous,

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
it still has exactly the same problems we saw here.

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
It still has at least two parse trees.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
It's even worse than its friend two lines above.

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
If you look carefully, all of the other examples don't demonstrate ambiguity.

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Each one of these has exactly one parse tree.

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Even this big complicated thing at the bottom only has one parse tree.

24
00:01:26,000 --> 99:59:59,999
It's perfectly balanced--1 minus 2 on the left, 3 minus for on the right.
