00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:04,902
Whenever we start factoring, we want to first look for a GCF, a Greatest Common

2
00:00:04,902 --> 00:00:09,820
Factor. There is a Greatest Common Factor for these two terms, it's 3. So I can

3
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:15,150
see that I have a GCF times the quantity a squared minus b squared. The a is

4
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:20,921
really 3x and the b is really 2. So to factor this pattern, we use a plus b

5
00:00:20,921 --> 00:00:26,462
times a minus b. We want to make sure we include our GCF in the front, and then

6
00:00:26,462 --> 00:00:31,003
we have 3x plus 2, times 3x minus 2, our a plus b, and a minus b.
