1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,650
The central processing unit on your
computer can do just about anything.

2
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:07,780
But even the craziest computers' CPUs
only have about eight cores these days

3
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:10,158
which isn't enough to render
a complex scene in real time.

4
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:14,190
Fortunately, your computer and
phone also have say,

5
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:16,730
graphics processing unit, or GPU.

6
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:19,960
GPUs are chips purpose built
to pump out pixels, and

7
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,630
some can have thousands of cores.

8
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,720
Each of these cores is pretty
limited in what it can do,

9
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,130
though, and groups of these cores
have to work together in a lock step,

10
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:30,650
each executing the same
instructions each clock cycle.

11
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:34,200
So while the GPU is less
flexible than a CPU,

12
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,700
it can spew out pixels
at some absurd rate.

13
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:40,440
So the code we run on the CPU
determines what we want to draw.

14
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,420
And then we send those
instructions over to the GPU

15
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:46,480
which will actually figure
out the pixel colors.

16
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,234
To do this we need a language for
communicating between the CPU and

17
00:00:50,234 --> 00:00:50,786
the GPU.

18
00:00:50,786 --> 00:00:52,041
The most common language for

19
00:00:52,041 --> 00:00:55,760
this purpose is called
the Open Graphics Language or OpenGL.

20
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,842
Smartphones use a slightly scaled
down version of this language called

21
00:00:58,842 --> 00:01:02,440
OpenGL ES, where the ES stands for
embedded systems.

22
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:06,390
If in a Microsoft universe
you've ever heard of DirectX,

23
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:09,610
that's a language that serves
essentially serves the same purpose.

24
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:14,570
So to sum up the CPU uses OpenGL
to tell the GPU what to draw.

25
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:17,330
The GPU builds up the actual
array of colors and

26
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:19,140
ships it to the electronics
that run the screen.

27
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:22,940
Brief aside, I'd be failing
as a nerd if I didn't mention

28
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:26,850
that you can actually do far more
with GPUs than just color pixels.

29
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:30,170
There's a whole field of
general purpose GPU computing.

30
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:32,750
Algorithms that run on GPUs
need to be very clever

31
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:36,170
about how they get those
lock-stepping cores to work together.

32
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:36,820
But when they do,

33
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:41,050
they can be extremely fast, and as is
often even more important these days,

34
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:44,140
extremely energy efficient in
terms of power per calculation.
