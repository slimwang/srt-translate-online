00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:04,580
Here are both coordinate systems with the architect's scheme in blue, Minecraft

2
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:10,217
in red. We're in luck with the x axes, in both systems we know the x axes match.

3
00:00:10,218 --> 00:00:14,956
Whatever happens with the y and z axes won't affect the x axis value. So in the

4
00:00:14,956 --> 00:00:19,404
second system x will also be 10 . In the architect system, z goes up and in the

5
00:00:19,404 --> 00:00:24,038
mine craft system y goes up. That's simple enough. The height of the point in

6
00:00:24,038 --> 00:00:29,110
the architect system is 13. The height is still 13 in the mind craft system so y

7
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:33,637
will be 13. Finally in the architect system, y goes north and z goes south in

8
00:00:33,637 --> 00:00:38,365
mind craft. The y coordinate in the architect system is 24. Since z is going in

9
00:00:38,365 --> 00:00:45,463
the opposite direction. Z must then be negative 24. So the answer is 10, 13,

10
00:00:45,463 --> 00:00:47,105
negative 24.
