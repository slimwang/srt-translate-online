00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,850
We'll now take a quick look at the other three qualities and

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:04,870
their effect on pipe and filter.

3
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:08,310
For reliability, okay, the reliability of a pipe and

4
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:12,420
filter system may be reduced because, the reliability of

5
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:15,810
an overall system is only as good as its weakest, weakest link.

6
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:19,750
That is, if any of the filters in the pipeline or if any of the pipes break down

7
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:23,970
for some reason, the whole application breaks down.

8
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:28,420
Safety may also be reduced because of the multiple dependencies.

9
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:29,020
On the other hand,

10
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:33,360
it's easier to verify because all of the output comes from a single source.

11
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,190
Security benefits because of the simplicity of

12
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:38,190
the architecture increases opportunities for

13
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:41,460
authentication, encryption and implementation of security levels.
