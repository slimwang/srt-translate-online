N² kind of beats everything here. So it's Θ(n²). It's order of n², as well as order of n³.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Okay. So basically (log n)⁷ beats 9n(log n)² and n²/³ beats (log n)⁷ and 9n(log n)² beats n²/³.

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I think it was the most dominant one. So let's see what the options were.

4
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Θ(n²), O(n²), and O(n³).

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm going to add a little like for n³, this is valid because the big O notation is an upper bound.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
>>Upper bound. Okay. >>Yup.
