1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:05,007
So we saw that the operating system is
really the trusted computing base, and

2
00:00:05,007 --> 00:00:07,734
it has to be isolated
from untrusted code.

3
00:00:07,734 --> 00:00:12,380
We saw the hardware features and
how they could be used to achieve this.

4
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:16,250
We saw how hardware support sets
its process execution modes.

5
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:20,494
And memory protection are used to
meet the complete mediation and

6
00:00:20,494 --> 00:00:21,883
tamper resistance or

7
00:00:21,883 --> 00:00:26,605
tamper-proof property that we require
from a trusted computing base.
