00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:04,259
Let's recap what we've learned so
far about strings.

2
00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:06,669
We saw how to define string
using a string literal.

3
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:11,250
We also learn that Swift strings
are encoded with Unicode scalars.

4
00:00:12,669 --> 00:00:15,960
For this reason, we're able to
incorporate any Unicode character into

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,949
a Swift string including emojis.

6
00:00:19,309 --> 00:00:24,993
Remember, to access the emoji keyboard,
you can press Ctrl+Cmd+spacebar.

7
00:00:24,993 --> 00:00:27,769
The Swift string also has
many useful properties.

8
00:00:27,769 --> 00:00:31,109
For example, the characters of a string
can be accessed through the characters

9
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:31,599
property.

10
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:36,240
We saw how the characters property
also gives us access to functions like

11
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,240
reversed, and

12
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:40,490
also makes it possible to loop through
all the characters in a string.

13
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:44,539
Here's what it looks like when you
print the characters of forwardString

14
00:00:44,539 --> 00:00:45,170
backwards.
