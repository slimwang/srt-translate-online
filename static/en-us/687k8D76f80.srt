1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,493
So, here we have another case of
substitution. We know that money from

2
00:00:04,505 --> 00:00:09,533
funders is equal to $3 million. So
wherever we see money from funders in the

3
00:00:09,545 --> 00:00:14,693
top equation, we can replace that with
$3,000,000. So down here, we can write, 3

4
00:00:14,706 --> 00:00:19,450
million in the first box, and we can do
the same thing with money spent each

5
00:00:19,462 --> 00:00:24,317
month. We see that right here, in the
first equation, and we know that this is

6
00:00:24,329 --> 00:00:29,280
equal to $100,000, so, we write $100,000
right there. So to summarize this, we can

7
00:00:29,292 --> 00:00:33,913
see that the money that Grant has left
over at any given time is equal to the

8
00:00:33,925 --> 00:00:38,710
initial $3 millions that he got from
venture capitalists minus the $100,000 he

9
00:00:38,722 --> 00:00:42,731
spends each month, times the number of
months he's been in business.
