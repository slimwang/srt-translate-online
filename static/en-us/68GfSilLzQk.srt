1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,859
The other way that, that we can do
certain types of understanding what's

2
00:00:03,859 --> 00:00:07,860
going on in the brain is with what's
called physiological measurements.

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:12,540
And so again using animals, typically,
what you'll have is you'll have a screen

4
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:15,490
where certain display,
certain things are being displayed.

5
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:19,010
An animal whose head is restrained so
it's looking at a particular direction.

6
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:23,630
And there's actually an electrode
recording from the neurons in the brain.

7
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:24,902
You hook that up to an amplifier.

8
00:00:24,902 --> 00:00:27,680
In the old days, you'd look at it
on oscilloscope, and actually,

9
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,790
you'd just connect it to a speaker and
you'd listen.

10
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:33,180
And more clicks meant you
were getting more response,

11
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:34,760
and you have to write it down,
and report it.

12
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:37,160
Then you'd have an oscilloscope
with traces, now of course,

13
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:38,730
it's all computerized, all right?

14
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:41,520
You've seen this picture before, this
is a picture of what it looks like for

15
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,090
a microelectrode to be
recording from a neuron.

16
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:49,650
And up on top, this is what the actual
voltages look like, these spikes.

17
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:50,690
And so then down here,

18
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:54,880
you have something that just sort of
counts the, the spikes that go across.

19
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:59,698
So one of the first areas that people
want to look is what was called V1.

20
00:00:59,698 --> 00:01:02,517
Back in to old days, it was actually
called area 17, I think, but

21
00:01:02,517 --> 00:01:04,458
that sounded too much like UFOs or
something.

22
00:01:04,458 --> 00:01:07,160
I don't know.
It's V1, the first visual area.

23
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:10,270
And when you record from
the first visual area, and

24
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:14,960
here's an example, the way you get
a monkey to look at a particular place

25
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:19,542
is you give him juice whenever he
pushes a button when something happens.

26
00:01:19,542 --> 00:01:23,030
And he, so he'll attend very carefully
there, and it, and it happens,

27
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:23,840
he pushes the right button,

28
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,120
he gets juice, and apparently,
monkeys really like apple juice.

29
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:31,920
But while you're doing that, you're
doing other things to the visual field.

30
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,320
And one of the things they've
found is that there are cells

31
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,780
that if you put up a bar,
if you put the bar,

32
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:44,460
let's say horizontally,
you get hardly any reaction at all.

33
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:49,010
In fact, put it up at a 45 degree,
still hardly re, any reaction.

34
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:53,270
Put it up vertically in this case,
and you get a tremendous amount.

35
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:55,860
And by the way, again,
this is the part where it's off.

36
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:56,830
This is the part where it's on.

37
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:58,640
This is the part where it's off.

38
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,900
Now, for this particular trace, I don't
know if the bar was moving at all,

39
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:03,430
or just being flashed up there.

40
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:05,330
The movement I'll,
I'll show you in just a minute.

41
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:10,258
But the idea is that within V1,
the first visual area of cortex, there

42
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:16,420
are cells that are extremely sensitive
to the orientation of essentially edges.

43
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:18,880
Remember, we did
oriented edge detection?

44
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:21,600
So this feels an awful lot
like oriented edge detection.

45
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,740
It would be an oversimplification
to say that's what it's doing, but

46
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:25,770
it's related.

47
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:28,720
If you recall,
we also talked about motion.

48
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:34,570
Well, it turns out in V1, you also get
directional selectivity, all right?

49
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:38,680
So here, we have a cell, and these,
of course, are the spike trains.

50
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:42,230
And this particular cell, if you have
a bar that's almost, that's tilted just

51
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:46,000
a little bit and moving upwards,
you get a small amount of motion.

52
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,920
If you have a bar that's here
on this 45 degree angle and

53
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,910
you moved it upwards,
you got a lot of spikes.

54
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:58,430
What's remarkable is when you move it
down, you got no spikes at all, or

55
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:01,570
even less than resting state spikes.

56
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:04,640
So not only do we have
orientation selectivity,

57
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,890
we have movement selectivity.

58
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:10,530
And you can actually make a pretty
cool plot of how this distributes

59
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:11,760
in the brain.

60
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:16,830
And so this is, this is essentially,
I guess this is your brain on drugs

61
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:18,570
because, I don't know,
anyway, it's all colored.

62
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:21,070
But the idea is that each
of these colors represents

63
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:23,050
these different orientations.

64
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:24,740
And you can get these mappings, and

65
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:28,340
you can see that it's not randomly
scattered individual points.

66
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:30,815
There are regions, all right?

67
00:03:30,815 --> 00:03:31,552
And in fact,

68
00:03:31,552 --> 00:03:35,639
these were referred to as hyper columns
in the sense of that little tissue

69
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:39,875
areas within the brain will all be
associated with a particular movement.

70
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:41,730
Now remember, it was retina topic.

71
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:44,710
So this area is all up on
one part of the retina.

72
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:47,960
Sure, but within that area, there'll
be little sub parts that are for

73
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:52,990
verticals and oriented edges like that,
including different kinds of motion.

74
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:57,830
So those were the kinds of things that
people saw in these first visual areas.

75
00:03:57,830 --> 00:04:01,140
There was a group of neuro-physiologists
Hubel and Wiesel at Harvard,

76
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,020
who I think they worked in,

77
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:06,230
in cats originally, where they first
looked at these some of these cells.

78
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:09,740
They also look at a thing called XY
cells having a steady state in motion,

79
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:12,430
and they won the Nobel Prize for
this work, okay?

80
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:16,680
So this idea of trying to understand
how the visual cortex was

81
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:22,950
processing the visual
signal was really in fact,

82
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:26,520
that Nobel Prize was announced during,
when I was in grad school.

83
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,450
So it was in the 80s at some point.

84
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:32,310
So that gives you an idea of sort of
the recency of some of this work.
