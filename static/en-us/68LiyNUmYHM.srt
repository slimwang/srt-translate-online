1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,726
When building apps that use the API
Client, you have the usual onStart() and

2
00:00:03,726 --> 00:00:06,350
onStop() methods that
need to be implemented.

3
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:10,110
Go ahead and do these now, and make
sure that you connect the API Client to

4
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:13,560
the onStart(), and
you disconnect it at the onStop().

5
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:16,670
You also need the onPause() and
the onResume() overrides, and

6
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:18,836
these are a little more
complicated in this case.

7
00:00:18,836 --> 00:00:20,620
So an onPause(),

8
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:25,348
you should get a LocalBroadcastManager,
and use that to unregister our receiver.

9
00:00:25,348 --> 00:00:28,660
For onResume( ),
you're going to do the opposite.

10
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:32,850
You get the LocalBroadcastManager and
you re-register the receiver.

11
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:36,660
But make sure when you re-register it,
you're going to use an IntentFilter.

12
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:40,870
And that IntentFilter should have
the same name as the one in the service.

13
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:43,530
In which case we called
it BROADCAST_ACTION.

14
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:45,980
Implement all these now
in the main activity, and

15
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:47,180
check this box when you're done.
