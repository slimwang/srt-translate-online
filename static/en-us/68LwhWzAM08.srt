00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,020
Now that we have our own
custom app built in Unity,

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:05,810
lets learn how we can
get it onto our phones.

3
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:10,960
The next two nodes will cover how you
get your @Unity app into Android or iOS.

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,000
Feel free to jump into the video
related to your phone.

5
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:16,650
Or, if you have both devices,
then check out both.

6
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:21,010
That said,
if you do own both iOS and Android,

7
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:25,010
I recommend developing on Android, as
the process is much more streamlined and

8
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:28,140
will result in faster
development cycles.

9
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:31,650
But, nevertheless, Unity does make
it really easy to support both

10
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:33,600
platforms with the same code base.

11
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,520
So, let's learn how to do it.
