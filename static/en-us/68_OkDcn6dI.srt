1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:04,510
So now let's calculate the z critical values for two-tailed tests at the other

00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:10,796
two levels. So first let's do the significance level of 0.01. If both critical

00:00:10,796 --> 00:00:15,183
regions add to 1% then what percent should be here and here?
