00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
In a bar chart, we take our raw data and pull it together.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
For example, we might say all the data that falls into this interval over here

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
should be summarized by a single value.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Such a value would lie halfway in between these two data points

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
and form what's called a bar.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Similarly, we might pull together this data over here into a single bar and so on.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Let me ask you a question. What is the height in terms of the dollar figure

8
00:00:33,000 --> 99:59:59,999
for the very first bar?
