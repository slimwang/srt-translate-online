Throughout this unit, we've been working with quadratic equations. Now, let's

2
00:00:04,261 --> 00:00:08,749
check out quadratic inequalities. A quadratic inequality looks a lot like a

3
00:00:08,749 --> 00:00:12,409
quadratic equation, except instead of an equal sign, we'll either have a

4
00:00:12,409 --> 00:00:16,129
greater than symbol, a less than symbol, a less than or equal to symbol, or a

5
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:22,895
greater than or equal to sign. When we solve a quadratic inequality, we want to

6
00:00:22,895 --> 00:00:27,720
find all the values of x that make this statement true. In this case, we want

7
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:33,622
any x value. So that way, when we evaluate this side, it's greater than 0. Now,

8
00:00:33,622 --> 00:00:36,790
we have an inequality here. So we know there's going to be more than one

9
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:41,086
solution. In fact, there's going to be an infinite number of solutions. So to

10
00:00:41,086 --> 00:00:45,748
find the range of all possible values, let's start by finding which x values

11
00:00:45,748 --> 00:00:51,690
make this statement equal to 0. So, what two values of x make this statement

12
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:55,610
equal 0. Write the smaller number here and the larger one here.
