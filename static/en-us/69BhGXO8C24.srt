Thank you Greg. Now, as you may know, the rate at which we consume energy is

2
00:00:04,406 --> 00:00:09,282
known as metabolism. When our energy stores and blood sugar levels have been

3
00:00:09,282 --> 00:00:13,720
depleted, we have drives that tell us to replenish, and we do so by eating.

4
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:19,610
Hunger has four biological components. And those are the stomach, blood, brain

5
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:25,127
and hormones and neurochemicals. In addition to CCK, some other hormones

6
00:00:25,127 --> 00:00:30,891
suppress appetite where as others stimulate it. Among those that suppress

7
00:00:30,891 --> 00:00:36,344
appetite are leptin, peptide yy and insulin. Insulin has a very important

8
00:00:36,344 --> 00:00:42,254
effect on hunger and its produced by the pancreas. As we eat, our blood glucose

9
00:00:42,254 --> 00:00:48,138
levels rise, and insulin is produced. Insulin transports glucose out of the

10
00:00:48,138 --> 00:00:53,920
blood and into the cells for energy use. As a result of increases in blood

11
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,093
glucose and insulin, hunger decreases.
