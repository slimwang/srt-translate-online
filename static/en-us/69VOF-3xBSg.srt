1
00:00:00,538 --> 00:00:03,479
And the answer is 14 messages. And the first message

2
00:00:03,479 --> 00:00:07,391
Alice is essentially telling onion router 1 to tell onion router 2

3
00:00:07,391 --> 00:00:10,583
to extend onion router 3. Then onion router 1 tells

4
00:00:10,583 --> 00:00:13,299
onion router 2 to extend onion router 3.

5
00:00:13,299 --> 00:00:17,765
And the third message onion router 2 tells onion router 3

6
00:00:17,765 --> 00:00:21,729
to create a circuit. Onion router 3 responds onion router 2

7
00:00:21,729 --> 00:00:25,314
saying I’ve created it. Onion router 2 responds back to

8
00:00:25,314 --> 00:00:29,750
onion router 1 saying I’ve extended. And onion router 1

9
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:33,238
responds back to Alice saying that I’ve extended.

10
00:00:33,284 --> 00:00:36,563
To then extend on to onion router 4, there will be two new

11
00:00:36,563 --> 00:00:39,745
messages between onion router 3 and onion router 4.

12
00:00:39,745 --> 00:00:42,649
So takes six messages to extend to onion router 3 and eight

13
00:00:42,649 --> 00:00:46,649
more messages to extend onion router 4 to get 14.
