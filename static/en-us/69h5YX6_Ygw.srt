00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,950
Two K S squared is the lowest common denominator, great work if you found it. If

2
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:08,300
you're wondering why that's true, it's because these two numbers share a common

3
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:12,578
factor of two. Remember these variables are the placeholders of numbers so two

4
00:00:12,578 --> 00:00:16,598
times K would be a number and two time S squared would really be a number as

5
00:00:16,598 --> 00:00:21,078
well. We don't know what K is, but it's the other factor for this denominator.

6
00:00:21,079 --> 00:00:25,958
And the same is true for s squared. It's the other factor for 2 s squared. We

7
00:00:25,958 --> 00:00:30,507
multiply all these together to get 2 k s squared. Now I know I did a little bit

8
00:00:30,507 --> 00:00:35,787
of reordering in this situation, but we usually list the coefficient or number

9
00:00:35,787 --> 00:00:39,243
first. Then we list the variables in alphabetical order.
