00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,760
>> We'll be using GitHub to download the files we need for

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:05,880
our resume and once we're finished to host it.

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:07,520
>> If you don't already have a GitHub account,

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,340
you can find the link in the instructor's notes to get one.

5
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,830
You'll see a few options, but don't worry,

6
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:15,010
you don't need anything fancier than a free account for this class.

7
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:17,580
This is where we can find all the files that we'll need for this project.

8
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:18,900
Let's go ahead and take a look at them.

9
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,100
Hey, James.

10
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:23,080
What text editor do you like using?

11
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:24,000
>> Emax.

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,960
But to keep it simple, let's say, Sublime Text.

13
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:27,460
>> Okay, cool.

14
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:30,650
In this course, we'll be using Sublime Text but

15
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:32,259
feel free to use whatever text editor you'd like.
