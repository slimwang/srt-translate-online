1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,390
Before we end, I wanted to now
actually talk a little bit about

2
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:05,870
some additional types of
things that are now known.

3
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:11,200
For example, there are many well-known
RGBD, that's the kind of a new camera,

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:16,100
because not only does it capture RGB,
but also depth information.

5
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:18,885
Perhaps the most widely used
these days is the Kinect camera.

6
00:00:18,885 --> 00:00:21,685
This actually does have a VGA camera,

7
00:00:21,685 --> 00:00:25,790
in addition has a infrared projector and
sensor.

8
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:27,560
It has lots of other types of things.

9
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:32,509
What it basically does is actually,
it projects from one of them,

10
00:00:32,509 --> 00:00:36,970
a pattern of light, infrared light,
that this sensor picks up.

11
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:38,500
And, in essence, what it does is,

12
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:42,378
again, a pair, but
one part is illuminating a 3D surface.

13
00:00:42,378 --> 00:00:46,350
The other one knows a little bit
about how to use that, again, and

14
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:48,880
it solves correspondence problems and
everything else.

15
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,740
How the light shape
is kind of coming in.

16
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:55,530
Here you kind of see this and
uses that to construct a depth in it.

17
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:58,760
So again, just by using a pair of this,
and then, of course, there's an RGBD

18
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:04,160
camera that also gives you the RGB
information, creating an RGBD camera.

19
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:07,180
So that's basically one of the very
well-known methods, and actually

20
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:10,430
a relatively cheap method if you know
the cost of these types of cameras,

21
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:15,020
that's been widely used to
now capture depth images.

22
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:17,930
There are other types of cameras
also coming onto the market.

23
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:21,836
Of course after the first Kinect
we now have a newer Kinect.

24
00:01:21,836 --> 00:01:27,540
I'm just comparing the examples of the
Kinect image from Kinect 1 to Kinect 2.

25
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:30,086
So the big difference
between the Kinect 1,

26
00:01:30,086 --> 00:01:34,207
which as I've said is basically an RGBD
camera, but it's using structured

27
00:01:34,207 --> 00:01:37,010
light that actually is used
to reconstruct the scene.

28
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:41,419
The Kinect 2 is known to use
the time of flight sensor.

29
00:01:41,419 --> 00:01:46,700
A time of flight sensor camera
is basically one that, basically

30
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:51,040
computes the range or the depth of an
image by measuring the time of flight of

31
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:57,130
the light signal between the camera and
the subject on each point of the image.

32
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:59,240
More details,
you can please look up yourselves, but

33
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:03,030
as you can see, the two big things that
actually were improvements on this one,

34
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:06,480
one was resolution, which actually
becomes much better in time of flight

35
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:09,560
types of cameras and also more detail.

36
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,630
Of course, these days,
additional cameras are also showing up.

37
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:16,890
This is a handheld camera from
Google called Project Tango.

38
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:20,440
Which actually basically lets
you extract depth sequences

39
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,300
in real time on a handheld
device like this.

40
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:25,520
And, of course,
if you paid attention these days,

41
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,150
the Amazon Fire phone actually
has five front-facing cameras.

42
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:32,760
And in fact, one of the applications
they have with these four of the cameras

43
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:36,770
around the corners to create basically
a way that when you move your camera,

44
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:39,950
it basically shows parallax
effects on the scene itself.

45
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:41,320
Again, a lotta computer vision and

46
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,805
face tracking goes into
all of this kind of stuff.

47
00:02:43,805 --> 00:02:47,305
We're not going to talk much about
the kinds of face tracking or

48
00:02:47,305 --> 00:02:49,495
stereo reconstruction
anymore in this class, but

49
00:02:49,495 --> 00:02:53,805
I want you to everybody to think about
how you can leverage depth information

50
00:02:53,805 --> 00:02:55,025
in computational photography.
