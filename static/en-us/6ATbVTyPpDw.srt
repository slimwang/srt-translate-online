00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,980
Like so many concepts with refinement necessary in sufficient conditions, for

2
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:08,640
typical concepts in typical conditions, what about exemplar concepts?

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:12,180
Exemplar concepts don't even have typical conditions, let alone necessary and

4
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:18,120
sufficient conditions. In case of exemplar concepts, I can give you examples.

5
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:21,670
Perhaps I can do some implicit abstraction of some examples, but

6
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:26,060
it's about as far as I can go. Consider the example of beauty for a second.

7
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:31,160
There are four examples of something beautiful. Here's a painting by Van Gogh,

8
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:35,150
here's a beautiful sunset, a beautiful flower, a beautiful dance and

9
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:38,700
so on. While I can give examples of the concept of beauty,

10
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:42,010
it's really hard to come up with the typical condition of a beauty.

11
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:46,590
Exemplar concepts are very hard to, define. And for that reason, they

12
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:51,590
are also very hard to, communicate to each other, or to teach in a art program.

13
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:55,570
Exemplar concepts can be culture specific, sometimes even individual specific.
