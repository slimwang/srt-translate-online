1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:03,450
In our last lesson, we discussed various psychological disorders and in this

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:07,808
lesson we're going to discuss the treatment of those disorders. Now, the bottom

3
00:00:07,808 --> 00:00:10,752
line is that there many effective treatments for all sorts of psychological

4
00:00:10,752 --> 00:00:11,945
disorders.

5
00:00:11,945 --> 00:00:14,983
>> That's right, and we're going to break this lesson up into three broad areas,

6
00:00:14,983 --> 00:00:18,413
and that includes biological treatments, psychological treatments and combined

7
00:00:18,413 --> 00:00:23,218
treatments. I am going to be discussing the biological treatments. And those

8
00:00:23,218 --> 00:00:27,095
include drug therapy, psychosurgery, and electric and magnetic therapies.

9
00:00:27,095 --> 00:00:30,852
>> And I'll be discussing the psychological therapies. Which include

10
00:00:30,852 --> 00:00:35,760
psychoanalytic therapy, humanistic positive therapy. Behavioral therapy.

11
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,885
Cognitive behavioral therapy, and group therapies.

12
00:00:38,885 --> 00:00:43,078
>> And finally I will be discussing combined therapies. And combined therapies are

13
00:00:43,078 --> 00:00:46,886
when we combine drugs and psychotherapy, integrative therapies, as well as when

14
00:00:46,886 --> 00:00:52,096
we combine mindfulness in psychotherapy. So without further ado lets begin this

15
00:00:52,096 --> 00:00:56,395
last lesson in psychology beginning with the biological treatments. Susan.

16
00:00:56,395 --> 00:00:57,877
>> Alright lets get started.
