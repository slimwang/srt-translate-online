Tables can be tricky.

2
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:02,790
If they're more than a few columns,

3
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:05,970
there's a pretty good chance that it's
going to overflow the viewport on

4
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:09,130
smaller screens,
forcing horizontal scrolling.

5
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:12,180
Yuck, To fix this,
there's several options, and

6
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:13,570
I'm going to show you three.

7
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:18,580
Hidden columns, a technique called no
more tables, and contained tables.

8
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:22,140
Like break points, you want to
experiment to decide what works best for

9
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:25,760
your content, and remember,
different content might call for

10
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:26,640
different answers.
