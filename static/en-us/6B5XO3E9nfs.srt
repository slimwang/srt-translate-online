1
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:04,700
In lesson three, we studied
the Indiana Health Information Exchange,

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:09,240
as the premiere example of centralized
health information exchange in the US.

3
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:14,720
PopHealth is designed to deal with
the reality in most other places,

4
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:16,990
where there may not even
be an HIE in place.

5
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:23,420
You'd expect that IHIE could do more
with their more facile access to data,

6
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:23,940
and they do.
