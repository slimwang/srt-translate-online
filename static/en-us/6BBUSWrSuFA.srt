1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,260
When I stretch out of the graph, I notice that I

2
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:05,758
get more of a cyclical pattern. It's almost like a sine or

3
00:00:05,758 --> 00:00:09,030
a cosine graph. And this makes sense with what the story

4
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:12,870
the data's telling. I mean, there are seasons in Nebraska, so we

5
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:16,580
should see fluctuation in the temperature every 12 months. This is

6
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:19,350
one example of how it's so important to get perspective on your

7
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:21,936
data. You want to make sure you put your data in

8
00:00:21,936 --> 00:00:25,520
context. Another important point to make here is that the proportion and

9
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:29,980
scale of your graphics do matter. Pioneers in the field of data visualization

10
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:31,890
such as Playfair and Tukey studied

11
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:34,240
this extensively. They determined that the nature

12
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:37,580
of the data should suggest the shape of the graphic. Otherwise, you should

13
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:40,690
tend to have a graphic that's about 50% wider than it is tall.
