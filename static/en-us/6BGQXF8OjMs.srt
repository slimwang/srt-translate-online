1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:01,690
Fantastic work.

2
00:00:01,690 --> 00:00:03,925
You've now created a master
resume spreadsheet.

3
00:00:03,925 --> 00:00:06,280
Selected keywords and
phrases for a target job.

4
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:09,170
And tailored your career
experience to fit on one page.

5
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:12,370
You have also organized your resume
sections in a logical order.

6
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:15,770
Your final step is to perfect
the visual style of your resume.

7
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:19,020
Though this stage may seem tedious,
it helps communicate your attention to

8
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:21,560
detail and can be an opportunity
to show your personality.

9
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,428
To begin, be sure your name is
the largest text on the page.

10
00:00:25,428 --> 00:00:30,320
Make titles, sub-categories, dates and
locations distinct from one another.

11
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,980
To do so we recommend using
text formatting like bold,

12
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:34,910
italics, spacing and size.

13
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:38,210
Though some may choose to use color
to make text visually distinct,

14
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:40,240
keep it minimal and subtle.

15
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,850
We found that color works best,

16
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:46,120
if it all, when used after you've
explored the limits of text formatting.

17
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:49,930
If you aren't graphically gifted
simplicity might be your best bet.

18
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:53,710
Keep text aligned to the left side and
use the entirety of the page.

19
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:56,480
If you're short on space,
widen your margins.

20
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,930
Use single spacing and font that are
easy to read and not overly stylized.

21
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:03,460
Review the checklist on the instructor
notes to see if your resume

22
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:04,040
is up to par.
