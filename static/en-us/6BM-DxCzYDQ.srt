1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Now I want you to define the function two pair,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
which takes ranks as input, and if there are two pair

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
within the ranks, then it should return

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
a 2-tuple of the highest and lowest rank,

5
00:00:12,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and if there aren't 2 pairs, it should return none.
