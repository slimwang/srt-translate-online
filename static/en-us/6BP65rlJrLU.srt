1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:03,940
Right, I am a little
bit stuck right now.

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:10,580
So what I do when I have a bug, and I
can't quite pin down what's causing it,

3
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:15,830
I make the feature that's broken,
simpler.

4
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:21,910
So I take out, take components out

5
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:25,740
until I have a working feature again and
then I gradually add them back in.

6
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:32,268
And then each one that I add back in,
I'm tweaking to fix it.

7
00:00:32,268 --> 00:00:34,427
>> Gosh, there's a lot of
different ways to be stuck.

8
00:00:34,427 --> 00:00:38,681
But if I'm writing something that has a
lot of calculation and somehow it's not

9
00:00:38,681 --> 00:00:43,125
coming through the way I expected,
sometimes it's best just to start over.

10
00:00:43,125 --> 00:00:46,575
There can be something powerful about
starting again with a blank slate, and

11
00:00:46,575 --> 00:00:48,365
rewriting something.

12
00:00:48,365 --> 00:00:51,175
>> Sometimes when I get stuck
in the developing process

13
00:00:51,175 --> 00:00:53,890
because I'm frustrated or
I just don't really,

14
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:56,930
I can't see how to get from where
I am to where I want to go.

15
00:00:56,930 --> 00:01:01,450
I find the smallest possible thing
that I know I can get done, and

16
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:03,100
I just go after that.

17
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:08,320
And a lot of times just closing
that tiny little gap, that easy

18
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,470
chore that had to be done, is enough
to just sort of get you going again.

19
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:15,750
>> So when I get stuck, it kind of
depends on the mood or the reason.

20
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:19,730
A lot of times I get stuck because I'm
just using poor debugging practices,

21
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:20,880
and being lazy,

22
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,350
instead of actually digging through the
debugger and finding out what's wrong.

23
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:27,370
Other times, if its more of
an inspiration thing, I'll just go for

24
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:30,020
a walk, get outside, get away
from the computer for a while and

25
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:31,710
then come back to the project.

26
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:32,650
>> So when I get stuck,

27
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:36,200
my first instinct is to go to
the team that I'm working with.

28
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,960
I find that everybody
has different skills and

29
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:44,580
different expertise, and
leveraging that is to your benefit.

30
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:48,440
So a quick hey,
have you seen this before?

31
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:52,740
Do you have a fix for it,
is always worth a try.

32
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:56,770
Barring that, I go to Google, and

33
00:01:56,770 --> 00:02:00,100
normally it spits out something
like StackOverflow.com.

34
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:05,260
But sometimes it also goes to
the Apple documentation, and

35
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:08,440
just carefully reading the methods
that are provided to you,

36
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:14,420
the properties that are provided to you,
and trying to find a way

37
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:18,300
around the problem instead of through
the problem can often help fix your bug.
