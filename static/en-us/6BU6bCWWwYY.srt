00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Now, let's just take a look at each of the steps one-by-one.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
This first step "E" can be rewritten by (E) corresponds to rule two.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Must have used rule two to do that. Then here, I just changed the "E" to a "T" that's rule one.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
But then down here, I somehow changed this "T" to an "E + E".

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
We only have two rules to play with, and only one of them starts with a "T".

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
So, I must have used rule four to do this, and this tells me exactly what it has to be.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
"T" goes "E + E", so it must've been "E + E", and down here,

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
the only thing I've changed is "E" goes to "int".

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
That's not currently one of my grammar rules. It must have been rule three, "E" goes to "int".

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Remember, every step in the parse tree

11
00:00:40,000 --> 99:59:59,999
corresponds to taking some part of the current input and using one of the rewrite rules.
