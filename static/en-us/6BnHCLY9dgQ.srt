00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,078
The answer is, no, we can't. I can't think of two numbers that add to equal

2
00:00:04,078 --> 00:00:08,546
184,000 and multiply to equal product of negative 200 and negative 133,200. Or

3
00:00:08,546 --> 00:00:13,196
even if those numbers do exist, they're going to be really, really hard for me

4
00:00:13,196 --> 00:00:17,695
to think of. So what are we going to do now? We can't just read these off the

5
00:00:17,695 --> 00:00:21,615
graph either. It's really hard to tell exactly where they are.
