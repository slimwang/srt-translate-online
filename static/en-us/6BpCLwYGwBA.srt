1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The correct answer is--you should be looking at the HTTP request.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I'll try it myself--okay--we have our form, I click submit,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
and--boom--here we are.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
This is actually--what we're looking at--is the HTTP request.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
We'll look at the code in a sec to remind ourselves how all of this happened.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
But do you remember from our first lesson when we talked about

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
HTTP requests and how they look?

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Well--here's our request line--

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
GET--and then our URL--/testform,

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
and then q equals the text we typed in the field.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
You can see a couple more headers,

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Accept and what languages we are expecting to receive--

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
what character sets are okay.

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
We can see the host header--we're familiar with that one.

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
You can see the referer header--referer header is interesting.

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
This refers to the URL that sent this request.

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
So--the URL of our form is localhost8080/

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
and the URL we're on right now is /testform,

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
but this header is helpful for telling the server where the request came from.

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
You'll notice that referer is misspelled here,

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
that's because in the original HTTP spec

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
the word referrer was spelled wrong. It normally has two Rs.

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
But it's lived on for backwards compatibility reasons,

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
for nearly 20 years now.

25
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
And--this is actually symptomatic of how a lot of things

26
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
in HTTP or on the web are, which is--you know--

27
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
somebody made a decision--you know--20 years ago

28
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
that still haunts us today,

29
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
and it's not necessarily a bad thing, it's just

30
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,000
a side effect of when things grow organically over time.

31
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Another header we've talked about--our user agent--

32
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,000
in this case I'm using Chrome--you can see that here--

33
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
amidst a bunch of version information on Mac OSX.

34
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Looking at our code--here's what we did.

35
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
We set the content type to text plain.

36
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,000
If we hadn't done that, the response we were looking at in HTML,

37
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
or in the browser would have looked weird,

38
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
because the browser would have assumed it was HTML,

39
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
and a lot of that text wouldn't have shown up.

40
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
So, we set it to plain because I knew what we were going to do.

41
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Then instead of writing text or writing out our q parameter,

42
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
we actually wrote out this request object itself,

43
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
which is the Python object that represents the request,

44
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
but conveniently it prints out very much like HTTP looks,

45
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
which is not a coincidence.

46
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
So--it's a handy little tool though when you're writing web applications

47
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
and debugging, you want to see--you know--where something broke

48
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
or what's going on, you can just print out the request and see.

49
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
So--let's replace these two lines again, back to the way they were,

50
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
and move on to something else.

51
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I'm just going to comment these lines out, however,

52
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
because we're going to need them for later.

53
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
So--this is how our file was before, let's move on to a new section.
