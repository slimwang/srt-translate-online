00:00:00,331 --> 00:00:02,883
Given a graph and a source vertex S,

2
00:00:02,883 --> 00:00:07,402
what's the distance of all other
vertices of the graph from S?

3
00:00:07,402 --> 00:00:12,091
To find out, you can perform a
breadth-first search or a BFS for short.

4
00:00:12,091 --> 00:00:13,531
Here's how you might do it.

5
00:00:13,531 --> 00:00:16,518
For each vertex,
we'll keep a shortest distance.

6
00:00:16,518 --> 00:00:21,341
Now, the source is a distance
of 0 edges away from itself,

7
00:00:21,341 --> 00:00:24,048
so let's set its distance to 0.

8
00:00:24,048 --> 00:00:27,348
Now for all the rest, you don't
know any of the distances yet, so

9
00:00:27,348 --> 00:00:29,034
let's set them all to infinity.

10
00:00:29,034 --> 00:00:33,657
Next, start the source and
look at its immediate neighbors.

11
00:00:33,657 --> 00:00:36,364
These neighbors are one
away from the source, so

12
00:00:36,364 --> 00:00:38,684
let's update their distances to be one.

13
00:00:38,684 --> 00:00:41,078
Now, let's visit
the neighbor's neighbors.

14
00:00:41,078 --> 00:00:43,729
Now, most of these are not yet
visited, so

15
00:00:43,729 --> 00:00:47,571
they must be one more away from
the previous nodes we visited.

16
00:00:47,571 --> 00:00:50,621
But one of these, we've seen already,
so that means we already know its

17
00:00:50,621 --> 00:00:52,983
shortest distance, and so
we can leave that one alone.

18
00:00:52,983 --> 00:00:56,568
And you'll continue this process
until you've seen all the vertices.

19
00:00:56,568 --> 00:01:01,001
The way a BFS works is a little bit like
dropping a drop of water into a bucket.

20
00:01:01,001 --> 00:01:04,554
The drop hits the source, and
that causes a ripple of waves through

21
00:01:04,554 --> 00:01:07,101
the graph where we
propagate the differences.

22
00:01:07,101 --> 00:01:10,166
These waves are sometimes
called frontiers.

23
00:01:12,627 --> 00:01:13,665
Here's a pseudocode for

24
00:01:13,665 --> 00:01:16,340
a sequential algorithm that
implements the scheme we just saw.
