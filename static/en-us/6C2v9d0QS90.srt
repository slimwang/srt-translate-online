00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:08,820
let's do a quick quiz to check that
you're understanding where to go

00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:10,630
to get what kind of information.

4
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:13,200
Where do you go in
the Analytics Dashboard

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,920
to see the number of sessions where the
user got as far as viewing a product?

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,612
And there might be multiple pages that
you can go to for this information.

00:00:20,612 --> 00:00:23,880
Where do you go to get the number
of sessions where the user

00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:26,058
got as far starting
the check out process?

9
00:00:26,058 --> 00:00:29,490
And where do you go to see
which products were purchased?
