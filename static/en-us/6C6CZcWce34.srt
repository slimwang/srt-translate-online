1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,440
In Phase 1 we divided our system up into components responsible for

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:07,230
handling events and providing percepts. We also saw how guarantees were

3
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:13,010
specified by invariants. Note that although the example invariants we saw was,

4
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:18,360
were attached to associations, other invariants, invariants might be directly

5
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:22,942
provided by the components themselves. For Phase 2, we want to determine

6
00:00:22,942 --> 00:00:27,480
the systems architecture. What this means is determining how the components will

7
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:32,369
interact. This determination takes the form of selecting an architectural style.

8
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:35,920
An architectural style is a generic pattern of interactions that can be used to

9
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,300
to address non-functional concerns such as performance, reuse, or reliability.
