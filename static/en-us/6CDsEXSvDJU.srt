Here's another system of equations. The second equation already has one of the

00:00:05,058 --> 00:00:09,832
variables solved for or isolated, it's x it's a loan on one side of the equal

00:00:09,832 --> 00:00:14,823
sign. So what expression can be substituted in for this x, what could we put in

00:00:14,823 --> 00:00:15,500
this box?
