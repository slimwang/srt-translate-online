1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Okay, so here we are. Here's my version of the solution.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
We take in day from the user.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
First thing we need to do is we need to check if day is a number or not.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Remember everything we get from--we get in our web app is going to be strings.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
HTTP and our web app doesn't know whether the user is typing in numbers

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
or strings or whatever, so we get all strings, and we have to make sure

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
our string is made up of digits.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
That's what the isdigit function does before we convert it to an integer,

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
which is what the int type does here when we call it as a function.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
So now day, here, will be an integer, and if it's between 0 and--

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
if it's greater than 0 and less than or equal to 31, we return it.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
You can see down here, I've run it on 25, and we got 25.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Let's try some of the error cases. I'll try 0.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
We'll run that.

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Our function returns none, which is what we expected.

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
If I type in 'foo', one of our test strings--we'll run that.

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
We get none again.

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Let's try a correct date again--31. We'll run that.

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Okay, all is well.

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Now, we could have made this more complicated by also taking the month,

21
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,000
and then making sure that February has only 28 days and March has 31

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
and that sort of thing, but we don't need to make this too complicated.

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm not trying to quiz you on calendars. I'm just trying to quiz you on writing basic functions.
