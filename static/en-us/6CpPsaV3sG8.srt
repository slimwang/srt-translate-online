00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:03,481
Now that you've seen a couple of exponential functions, let's talk a bit more

2
00:00:03,481 --> 00:00:08,699
in generally about them. We use exponential functions to model relationships in

3
00:00:08,699 --> 00:00:13,121
which a constant change in x creates a proportional change, a percent increase

4
00:00:13,121 --> 00:00:18,893
or a decrease in f of x. In other words, as we saw in our tables that we worked

5
00:00:18,893 --> 00:00:22,797
with, whenever we add a certain amount to x, we're looking at adding one every

6
00:00:22,797 --> 00:00:29,415
time in this case. f of x is going to be multiplied by a certain amount. In the

7
00:00:29,415 --> 00:00:33,768
case of this function, that amount was two. Now the general form of an

8
00:00:33,768 --> 00:00:40,221
exponential function looks like this. f of x equals a to the x power. Here a is

9
00:00:40,221 --> 00:00:46,148
a positive constant other than 1. Before we move on, lets just look at why a

10
00:00:46,148 --> 00:00:53,107
can't be 0 and can't be 1. Well, what is f of x if a equals 0? What if a equals

11
00:00:53,107 --> 00:00:57,249
1? For each of these, rewrite the function as simply as possible.
