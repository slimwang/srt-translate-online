1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:02,620
Now that the housekeeping
is out of the way,

2
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:05,400
let's get back to drawing
things on the screen.

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,250
Let's draw the udacity logo in
the middle of our game world.

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,170
There's a number of things we're going
to have to do to make that happen.

5
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:14,187
First of all we need a sprite batch.

6
00:00:14,187 --> 00:00:16,845
Sprite batch is pretty much like
the shape renderer we were using for

7
00:00:16,845 --> 00:00:20,165
drawing simple shapes,
except it draws textures.

8
00:00:20,165 --> 00:00:23,745
We also need to declare a texture
to hold onto the Udacity logo.

9
00:00:23,745 --> 00:00:27,069
Remember that a texture is just
an in-memory representation of an image.

10
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:31,130
In the create callback of
our application listener,

11
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:35,930
we need to initialize the sprite batch,
and we also need to load up the texture.

12
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:39,630
If we open up the project pane,
and we go to android assets,

13
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:43,650
we can see the Udacity logo that
we're loading up and about to draw.

14
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:48,400
Down here in the render callback, when
we're getting ready to actually draw,

15
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:51,020
first we need to set the sprite
batch's projection matrix,

16
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:54,090
just like with the shape renderer,
and then begin the sprite batch.

17
00:00:55,270 --> 00:01:00,050
The draw method of the sprite batch is
ridiculously overloaded, but in a way

18
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:03,880
that's actually very similar to the
rectangle methods on the shape renderer.

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,530
In this case, we are drawing the Udacity
logo with its bottom left corner at zero

20
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:12,510
zero with width logo size and
height logo size.

21
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:15,640
Just like with the shape renderer, we've
got to remember to end the sprite batch.

22
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:20,070
And there we go, we've successfully
drawn the Udacity logo.

23
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:22,488
I'll leave it up to you to figure
out how to center it in the world.

24
00:01:22,488 --> 00:01:26,320
Follow the to-dos in the course
code to try loading and

25
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,570
drawing a texture for yourself.
