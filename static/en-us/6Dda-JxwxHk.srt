00:00:00,402 --> 00:00:03,650
All right we're going to show you how
to create a CursorLoader in three

2
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:05,360
easy steps.

3
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:08,790
We start by creating an integer
constant for a Loader ID.

4
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:11,110
Then we implement the Loader Call backs.

5
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:14,410
Finally we initialize the Loader
with the LoaderManager.

6
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:18,910
We start just by creating a Loader ID,
which is an integer constant.

7
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:21,570
A single activity can
use multiple Loaders and

8
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:23,580
they are differentiated by these ID's.

9
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,020
The we have to fill in
the Loader Callbacks.

10
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:30,760
The Loader Callbacks
are a generic interface class,

11
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:33,150
with one parametrized type.

12
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:37,260
When we use the Loader Callbacks with a
CursorLoader, the parameterized type we

13
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:41,480
use is Cursor, which makes
the callbacks look like they do here.

14
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:44,430
The most interesting one for
us is onCreateLoader.

15
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:50,165
OnCreateLoader returns a loader
with parameterized type, Cursor.

16
00:00:50,165 --> 00:00:52,990
This is where we create and
return our CursorLoader.

17
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:57,795
CursorLoader has a constructor that
takes all of the standard content

18
00:00:57,795 --> 00:01:02,445
provider query parameters, and will
call the content provider on our behalf.

19
00:01:02,445 --> 00:01:05,114
When it is executed
by the LoaderManager.

20
00:01:05,114 --> 00:01:07,774
Since CursorLoader derives
an Async TaskLoader,

21
00:01:07,774 --> 00:01:10,765
it will be executed in
a background thread.

22
00:01:10,765 --> 00:01:15,010
OnLoadFinished is called when the loader
completes, and our data is ready.

23
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:19,100
To use the data in our cursor adaptor,
we just call SwapCursor,

24
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:22,860
but this is where we would also perform
any other UI updates we'd want to make

25
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:24,585
when the data is ready.

26
00:01:24,585 --> 00:01:28,920
OnLoaderReset is typically only called
when our loader is being destroyed.

27
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,780
It means that we need to remove
all references to the Loader Data.

28
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:37,190
To do that we call SwapCursor
on our cursor adaptor with null.

29
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:41,150
Finally, we use the LoaderManager
to initialize our loader.

30
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:42,780
We pass in that loader ID,

31
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:48,130
the loader call back we just filled out,
and an optional bundle.

32
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:51,840
This will do all that cool life cycle
stuff we covered in the loader intro,

33
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,880
such as, calling onCreate loader if
the loader doesn't already exist.

34
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,920
When using loaders in a fragment,

35
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,990
we initialize our loader in
the onActivityCreated method.

36
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:05,910
And that's it,
you've got a basic CursorLoader.

37
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:08,120
We're going to have you write one for
our next exercise.
