00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,430
In the first lesson, we are able to simplify radicals because they were perfect

2
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:07,635
squares or perfect cubes. But not everything we come across is going to be so

3
00:00:07,635 --> 00:00:11,770
perfect. What about this square? If this square had area of two units squared,

5
00:00:16,826 --> 00:00:20,654
these answers for the side length, is this one of these numbers or it is

6
00:00:20,654 --> 00:00:22,923
something else?
