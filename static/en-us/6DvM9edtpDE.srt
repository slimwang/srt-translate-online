00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:06,180
Okay, get out your tcpdump again and
ask it to show you traffic to and

2
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:10,690
from some made up port like 12345.

3
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:16,640
And then use nc to connect to that port
on a machine that actually exists,

4
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,230
say www.udacity.com.

5
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:24,380
Now when you do that,
what do you see in nc and in tcpdump?

6
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:28,460
Is it that tcpdump shows several packets
sent to that host, but slower and

7
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:32,600
slower, but
then after a long delay nc exits?

8
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:36,320
Is it that tcpdump shows one
packet sent to the chosen host and

9
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,450
a connection refused error after
which nc immediately exits.

10
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:44,860
Or is it that tcpdump shows
nothing being sent and nc crashes?
