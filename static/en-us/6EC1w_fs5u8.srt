1
00:00:00,182 --> 00:00:03,320
I'm going to start with parametric
regression, which is a way of building

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:08,130
a model where we represent the model
with the number of parameters.

3
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:09,990
Let's start with a simple example.

4
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:15,080
Suppose we want to build a model that
will predict how much it will rain today

5
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:18,050
based on changes in barometric pressure.

6
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:23,140
So as you may know,
if barometric pressure declines,

7
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:27,030
that usually means there's bad
weather coming and it's going to rain.

8
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:29,870
And when barometric pressure increases,

9
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:33,860
it typically means that we've
got good weather coming.

10
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:38,090
So on this scatter plot each
individual point represents one day.

11
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:41,680
So let's consider a particular day,
say here.

12
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:49,155
And what this means is that on this day,
the barometric pressure decreased by 10

13
00:00:49,155 --> 00:00:54,690
millimeters and we had 50
millimeters of rain, about 2 inches.

14
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:59,040
So let's consider that over time we
collect data for many different days and

15
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,740
that's what this looks like.

16
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:04,819
So again, each one of these dots
represents one day's worth of data and

17
00:01:04,819 --> 00:01:07,590
we have multiple day's
worth of data here.

18
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:12,340
And as you can see there's a general
trend of as barometric pressure

19
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:17,980
decreases, we typically have more rain
and as it increases we have less rain.

20
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:22,880
We'd like to create a model based on
this data that when we query it at any

21
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,760
particular point it'll give us a
prediction of how much is going to rain,

22
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:29,380
so we would measure
barometric pressure or

23
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:32,900
its change and
then estimate how much is going to rain.

24
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:37,120
The classic solution to this problem
is to fit a line to the data.

25
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,770
So let's give that a shot.

26
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:42,000
As you probably know, this approach
is called linear regression.

27
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,110
And the model looks like this.

28
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:49,642
So if you remember, from algebra in
elementary school, or high school,

29
00:01:49,642 --> 00:01:50,967
wherever you got it.

30
00:01:50,967 --> 00:01:56,050
[LAUGH] The equation for
line is simply y equals mx plus b.

31
00:01:56,050 --> 00:02:02,760
So x is our barometric
pressure change variable here,

32
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:08,030
and m and
b are the parameters of our model.

33
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:12,980
Our model now is fully described by
these two parameters, and if we want

34
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:18,190
to estimate or query how much it's
going to rain at any particular point.

35
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:20,620
We measure the barometric pressure.

36
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:26,727
Let's say the barometric
pressure today increased by 5.

37
00:02:26,727 --> 00:02:32,149
We would then plug that 5
into our model here and

38
00:02:32,149 --> 00:02:35,143
multiply it by m and add b.

39
00:02:35,143 --> 00:02:38,780
And that's our estimate for
that day of how much it's going to rain.

40
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:45,460
And the linear regression approach
is how we arrive at m and b.

41
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:47,930
This model is decent, but

42
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:52,890
it doesn't track the actual
behavior of the data, for instance,

43
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:58,290
in this region and in this region,
so we can make a more complex model.

44
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:03,530
Instead of fitting a line we can fit
a polynomial, we can add one more term x

45
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:09,910
squared and now we've got to also
find this additional parameter m2.

46
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:14,130
So, when we find our model it's now
represented by three parameters

47
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:14,910
mm2 and b.

48
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:19,660
This polynomial model will
look something like this.

49
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:23,670
It fits the data pretty well over here,
but not so well over here.

50
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:25,260
Now, we can add more terms.

51
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:31,350
We can fit an x cubed term and
have another parameter and so on.

52
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:36,110
In general, these parametric
approaches come away with

53
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:41,500
a number of parameters, and the more
complex the model, the more parameters.

54
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:45,390
Still, three parameters
is a pretty simple model.

55
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:49,780
All of these models, whether it's
linear, with just mx plus b, or

56
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:55,680
polynomial, with a cubed or
squared term, are parametric models.

57
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,740
In the end, after we learn these models,
we have our parameters,

58
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:03,510
in this case, m2, m, and b.

59
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:04,790
And we throw away the data,

60
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:08,290
and the model's represented
just by these three parameters.

61
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:11,080
But there's another way to approach it,
and I'll show you that next.
