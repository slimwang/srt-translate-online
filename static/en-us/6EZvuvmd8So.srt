00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:03,620
Great job connecting the random sentence spout to your topology.

2
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:09,310
Notice that we're emitting the sentences to redis-send our visualization twice.

3
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:13,210
The first time emits three exclamations appended to our sentence,

4
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:14,590
here in the exclamation bolt.

5
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:18,650
And the second adds three more, here in the second exclamation for

6
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:22,680
a total of six exclamations appended to the sentence.

7
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:27,950
In our visualization this is our random sentence spout here is exclaim one and

8
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:29,660
here is our exclaim two.

9
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:34,830
Finally they are connected with a shuffle grouping and the second is connected,

10
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:38,180
again, with a shuffle grouping with an exclaim one to an exclaim two.

11
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:42,842
And again in exclaim one we see three exclamation points, and

12
00:00:42,842 --> 00:00:47,080
exclaim to three more appended for a total of six.

13
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:50,300
In part one of this exercise, I'd like you to modify your topology to

14
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:54,130
omit only sentences with three exclamation points.

15
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:59,550
Do not modify the exclamation bolt themselves, but instead modify the topology.

16
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:02,640
There are actually three ways to link your random sentence spout

17
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,230
to accomplish this.

18
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:05,540
I'd like you to implement all three.

19
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:11,980
So in order to append only three exclamation points, one solution is

20
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:18,110
to connect your random sentence spout, directly to exclaim one bolt.

21
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:22,760
And here we'll remain consistent and only use a shuffle grouping.

22
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:27,260
Once you've accomplished this and run your visualization.

23
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:31,720
The second apology is again to use the same random sentence spout.

24
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:36,930
Connect only to exclaim two and again using a shuffle grouping.

25
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:42,680
Finally the next way to emit only sentences with three exclamations is to

26
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:50,040
connect your spout to exclaim one and exclaim two using a shuffle grouping.

27
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,400
I'd like you to build and run each topology.

28
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:58,490
And remember that the sentences should only come out with three

29
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:03,920
exclamation points appended to the random sentences, not six.

30
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,170
Finally, choosing one of the topologies,

31
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:09,410
in part two I'd like you to navigate to stage two.

32
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:11,870
Into the spout and the random sentence spout.

33
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:14,810
Scroll down and remove the original sentences and

34
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:18,360
write new sentences that let us know how you're finding the class.

35
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,360
Or share your favorite song lyrics.

36
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,690
Take a screencast of your visualization and post this to the forum.

37
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:28,230
Remember that the visualization should have your personalized sentences,

38
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:31,150
appended with only three exclamation points.

39
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:34,720
Comment on two other posts, and optional if you already have a Twitter account,

40
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,250
why don't you tweet a screenshot to your followers?

41
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:41,100
And as an example, just remember that your sentence should have only three

42
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:42,490
exclamations at the end of it.

43
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:44,765
And these are the original sentences, but

44
00:02:44,765 --> 00:02:47,620
we'd like these sentences to be personalized to let

45
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:51,420
us know what you think about the course or perhaps your favorite song lyrics.

46
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:53,500
Good luck with stage two and the end of lesson one.
