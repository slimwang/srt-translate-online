1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:06,830
So color is a psychological phenomenon,
all right.

2
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:10,870
You know what In fact let me go back to,
to something here.

3
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:13,270
If I turn on a red light and
a green light and

4
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:15,550
I blend them together
what color will I see.

5
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:16,180
>> Yellow.

6
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:17,920
>> Yellow, right.

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,630
So why?

8
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:22,490
When I tell people this at Georgia Tech,
some of them tell me,

9
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:24,850
oh well, you know,
red is here in the spectrum.

10
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:26,110
And green is here in the spectrum.

11
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:29,420
And when you turn on both of them
you get the average spectrum.

12
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:30,400
No.
[LAUGH]

13
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,010
The light doesn't know
anything about averaging.

14
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:38,680
So here's a green light,
and here is a red light.

15
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:42,090
What happens is this light
over here in the green,

16
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:46,000
triggers the green cones a little
bit more than the red cones.

17
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:52,530
And the red light makes the red cones go
a little bit more than the green cones.

18
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:54,730
Kay, so let's pretend for
a moment they were sort of balanced.

19
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:59,250
So in other words,
if I had a yellow light,

20
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:02,300
which makes both of the cones
go about the same amount.

21
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:09,720
Your system can't tell the difference
between a green light and

22
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,910
a red light turned on
versus a yellow light.

23
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:15,290
Forget this little blue stuff here for
now, all right?

24
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:19,090
So the reason that red plus green make
yellow with lights has nothing to do

25
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:23,210
with physics and everything to do
with how your retina is put together.

26
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:23,770
Right?
The red and

27
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:25,890
green cones go on at the same time.

28
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:27,600
So, color is psychological.

29
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,760
That is you can think of
color as representative.

30
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,420
Some combination,
linear combination otherwise of red,

31
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:35,880
green and blue and
it's related to cones not to physics.

32
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,930
By the way almost all of
us have the same cones, but

33
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:41,590
there are some people who don't.

34
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:45,240
Right, so the sky might not really look
blue to them although actually to them

35
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:45,990
it looks blue, but

36
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:48,560
it's actually not blue because
they actually can't see blue.

37
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,330
So these people are referred
to as color blind,

38
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:55,800
all right, a bunch of people
are missing one type of cone.

39
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,499
Almost all of them, by the way, are men.

40
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:02,160
It, it's, it's some reasonable
percentage of men are colorblind.

41
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,820
Some tiny,
tiny percentage of women are colorblind.

42
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:08,580
So it was kind of funny back when I
was a grad student, psychology class,

43
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:11,265
people have to sometimes do a,
so I was the TA,

44
00:02:11,265 --> 00:02:15,405
people would have to do an experiment
and write it up and hand it in.

45
00:02:15,405 --> 00:02:17,765
And you can tell, every now and
then, when somebody, shall we say,

46
00:02:17,765 --> 00:02:20,235
ran out of time to actually
do a real experiment.

47
00:02:20,235 --> 00:02:22,715
because they'd say they worked
with 20 color-blind patients,

48
00:02:22,715 --> 00:02:23,705
ten men, ten women.

49
00:02:24,815 --> 00:02:27,135
For them to find ten color-blind women,

50
00:02:27,135 --> 00:02:30,035
they probably would have had to
sample more than Massachusetts.

51
00:02:30,035 --> 00:02:32,475
So there are very few color-blind women.
