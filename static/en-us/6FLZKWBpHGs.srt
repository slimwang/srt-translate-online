00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:05,890
Two important TLS concepts are the TLS
sessions and the TLS connection.

2
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:09,320
A TLS session is an association
between a client and

3
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:13,480
a server that is created
by the Handshake Protocol.

4
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,970
It defines a set of
cryptographic parameters

5
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:20,100
that are used by a set of
connections within the session.

6
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:24,099
So that we can avoid repeated
expensive negotiation of new

7
00:00:24,099 --> 00:00:27,369
security parameters for
each new connection.

8
00:00:27,369 --> 00:00:32,016
A TLS connection is a transport layer
relationship between a client and

9
00:00:32,016 --> 00:00:32,720
a server.

10
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:38,016
For example, a TLS connection can be
an email connection between a client and

11
00:00:38,016 --> 00:00:41,700
a server, or
it can be a set of such connections.

12
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:46,150
A TLS connection is transient, for
example if the client terminates

13
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:49,765
the email connection,
the TLS connection may terminate.

14
00:00:49,765 --> 00:00:54,892
Whereas TLS session is much
longer term because it is created

15
00:00:54,892 --> 00:00:59,840
by a Handshake Protocol rather than a a
transport layer service such as email,

16
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,770
each TLS connection is
part of a TLS session.

17
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:07,070
Therefore, negotiation of
new security parameters for

18
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:08,750
each connection can be avoided.
