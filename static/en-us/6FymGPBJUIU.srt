>> If I label the points A, B and C, I can write their coordinates. Notice that

2
00:00:04,391 --> 00:00:08,989
the x-coordinate is always the same, it's always 2. It doesn't matter the value

3
00:00:08,989 --> 00:00:13,415
of y. We just know that the x value is 2. For every point on this line, we're 2

4
00:00:13,415 --> 00:00:17,837
units to the right of the origin. For the slope, it's rise over run, and we know

5
00:00:17,837 --> 00:00:22,037
that vertical lines have tons of rise but zero run. Uh-oh. Zero in the

6
00:00:22,037 --> 00:00:27,147
denominator? That means it's undefined, so u. I hope these patterns are helping

7
00:00:27,147 --> 00:00:29,045
you figure out the equations.
