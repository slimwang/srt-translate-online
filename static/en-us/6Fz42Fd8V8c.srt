00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Here's my answer. I've rolled eight 6s.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
That gives me 48 points, and then a 2--that gives me 50--and that allows "A" to win.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
There are other sequences that are

4
00:00:10,000 --> 99:59:59,999
of the same length, but none that are shorter.
