00:00:00,172 --> 00:00:03,370
The classpass map feature
doesn't require identifying

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:06,250
any meaningful relationships,
patterns, or trends from data.

3
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:10,740
The map feature isn't recommending
anything to customers based on

4
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:11,340
their activity.

5
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:16,510
But this map feature does help
users see data, fitness studios,

6
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:18,030
in an engaging way.

7
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:20,009
Instead of just listing studios,

8
00:00:20,009 --> 00:00:24,246
the state of visualization allows users
to see studio locations on a map.
