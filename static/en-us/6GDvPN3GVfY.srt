00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:03,060
In this session we're going to
talk about a new data type

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:04,480
called an optional.

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:07,290
Optionals were introduced into the Swift
programming language to handle

4
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:11,210
the concept of nullability,
or the absence of a value.

5
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:14,670
There's no denying that optional
types are both unusual and tricky.

6
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:17,200
But if you're going to become
confident using Swift,

7
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:20,630
it's essential to understand
optionals inside and out.

8
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:21,270
Let's get started.
