00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:02,410
In the last couple of lessons, we learned

2
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:05,130
to build fluid designs that reflow across different screen

3
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:09,010
sizes smoothly. Of course, truly adapting a design

4
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:12,000
across multiple environments, from a four inch cell phone

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,620
to a 27 inch desktop monitor, it's not

6
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:16,600
quite as easy as just dividing the screen app

7
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:21,400
using percentages. Sometimes, different devices ,call for fundamentally

8
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:25,090
different design. We can accomplish this using media queries.
