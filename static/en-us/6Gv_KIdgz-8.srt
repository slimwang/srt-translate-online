00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,780
Okay, let's take a quick look at the code.

2
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:05,550
Here's where we entered the user argument, passed the

3
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:08,610
user argument. Here's where we check if the user

4
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:13,390
is now and if it is throw unauthorized exception. Here's

5
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:15,680
where we set the default display name if the

6
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:19,330
user doesn't submit it in the form. Yup and that's

7
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:21,420
all there is to it, so we've defined a

8
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:26,540
wonderful safe profile method except it doesn't actually save anything.

00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:30,040
The next lesson you are going to learn to use the data store to save your data.
