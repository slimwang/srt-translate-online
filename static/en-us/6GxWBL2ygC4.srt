1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,569
And another question I had, I guess.

2
00:00:01,569 --> 00:00:04,440
One of my friends who can't be here now wanted to know

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:07,595
what are the use cases of, say, Storm versus Hadoop?

4
00:00:07,595 --> 00:00:08,640
>> Mm-hm. >> You know, like I know, you know,

5
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:11,140
Storm and Hadoop can be used, like, at the same time.

6
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:14,360
I feel like Hadoop is more of like, you do batch processing, so

7
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:17,900
maybe store the Storm data in this, like, Hadoop cluster and

8
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:20,960
then, do some analysis there, but.

9
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,980
>> Yeah. >> If you could just list some stuff.

10
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,669
>> Yeah, I think the the Hadoop is generally used in param called store m query.

11
00:00:25,669 --> 00:00:29,460
>> Uh-huh. >> Store m query in the sense like once the data comes in,

12
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:32,259
you store the data forever in that cluster.

13
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:33,130
>> Yeah.

14
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:35,655
>> And whenever you'd like to run analytics, you can run against it.

15
00:00:35,655 --> 00:00:36,930
>> Mm-hm.

16
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:39,930
>> And so because the shared size of the data,

17
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:43,195
the amount of time it takes could be longer.

18
00:00:43,195 --> 00:00:47,435
Or shored up depending upon the size of the data that you are looking at, right?

19
00:00:47,435 --> 00:00:52,170
>> Mm-hm. >> And Hadoop storage system, and also an analytic system.

20
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:55,148
>> Yeah. >> Okay. On the other hand there the Storm is

21
00:00:55,148 --> 00:00:59,504
essentially a streaming analytic system where you will.

22
00:00:59,504 --> 00:01:02,696
As the data is being produced immediately you want to do the analysis.

23
00:01:02,696 --> 00:01:03,500
>> Mm-hm.

24
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:07,852
>> Because if you don't do the other Storm does not have a way, but

25
00:01:07,852 --> 00:01:09,337
which >> Yeah.

26
00:01:09,337 --> 00:01:13,733
>> The whole idea is to as the data is flowing immediately do that out takes and

27
00:01:13,733 --> 00:01:17,886
eye for the trans patterns whatever's happening on the data right away.

28
00:01:17,886 --> 00:01:20,938
Unlike Hadoop there will just store the data, and

29
00:01:20,938 --> 00:01:24,790
when you decide oh, I wanted know about these things.

30
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:25,960
>> Yeah. >> Then you can do it.

31
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,830
On the other hand in storm you ignore [INAUDIBLE] what you are looking for.

32
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:31,190
And you program it to look for what you want it to look for.

33
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:35,240
>> Are there some use cases where, say, Storm wouldn't be appropriate.

34
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:39,120
You know, for example based, because you have to do things in parallel.

35
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,720
>> Mm-hm. >> Or if you want to, like, do things and keep track of,

36
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:42,725
like, per user.

37
00:01:42,725 --> 00:01:45,130
>> Mm-hm. >> And, like, show this graphically.

38
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:49,834
>> So make prod example the, take the example of top and tax.

39
00:01:49,834 --> 00:01:50,452
>> Uh-huh.

40
00:01:50,452 --> 00:01:52,910
>> And that is when I use Storm application.

41
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:56,100
>> Yeah. >> Because as the tweets are coming in a, what do you call it?

42
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:56,870
A real time fashion.

43
00:01:56,870 --> 00:02:00,930
Then you're looking at continuously computing the top ten

44
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:02,710
hashtags because it might be changing.

45
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:07,200
Because suddenly something happens suddenly things will change, right?

46
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:07,883
>> Yeah. >> But if we look at

47
00:02:07,883 --> 00:02:10,130
the lab that [INAUDIBLE] top ten trending hashtags, right?

48
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:10,630
>> Yeah.

49
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:15,310
>> And when you look at those hashtags, and that's kind

50
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:19,860
of changing depending upon what time of the day you open that, right?

51
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:22,055
So that is ideal Storm application.

52
00:02:22,055 --> 00:02:22,560
>> Mm-hm.

53
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,730
>> And it because you got the, it's continuously changing.

54
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:25,916
It's looking at the data and all the.

55
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:31,320
Now, on the other hand, like if you wanted to look at something like,

56
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:35,534
by the way, I was interested in I mean, I have all this data, but

57
00:02:35,534 --> 00:02:39,150
just couldn't for several years.

58
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:40,120
I wanted to know,

59
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:45,390
like, what were the hashtags that were trending for, like, two years?

60
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:45,901
>> Yeah.

61
00:02:45,901 --> 00:02:47,530
>> The right?

62
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:48,955
So that is more a part of.

63
00:02:48,955 --> 00:02:50,060
>> Mm-hm.

64
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:52,000
>> Because it's looking at a lot of data,

65
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,860
plus also looking at trending not of the last ten minutes or

66
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:58,915
five minutes, it's looking at over like a year, or months full of data, right?

67
00:02:58,915 --> 00:03:02,460
>> Yeah. >> So that's not what our storm is made for.

68
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:02,970
>> Okay. >> Okay.

69
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:08,300
So that is that, that thing is like how real-time you want to be versus.

70
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:10,529
How lazy you want to be in that cardboard, right?

71
00:03:10,529 --> 00:03:11,050
>> Mm-hm.

72
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:12,740
>> That is the distinction between the two.
