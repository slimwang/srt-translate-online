00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:02,913
When you've declared
your ArrayAdapter of Strings,

2
00:00:02,913 --> 00:00:04,746
it should look something like this.

3
00:00:05,276 --> 00:00:09,340
We pass in the context,
which is this fragment's parent activity,

4
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:12,420
as well as the ID of the list item layout,

5
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:15,200
and the ID of the TextView we want to populate.

6
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,610
And lastly, we pass in the forecast data.
