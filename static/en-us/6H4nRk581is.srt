1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:04,520
So getting your first users,
it's really important, right?

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:07,730
And you just have to do everything and

3
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:10,630
anything that comes to mind and
whatever you think will work.

4
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:14,071
So in our case, we put up this landing
page and I started emailing my friends.

5
00:00:14,071 --> 00:00:17,501
And when they started using it and
were stories about sharing and

6
00:00:17,501 --> 00:00:21,819
people were helping one another out, the
moment we got these first stories off,

7
00:00:21,819 --> 00:00:25,460
someone was able to borrow something,
borrow a bike from a friend.

8
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:28,680
And someone was able to
find a language exchange,

9
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,320
an English to Chinese language exchange.

10
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,640
When we got those stories, I knew that
those are really heart warming, so

11
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:36,850
I just went to the local press in
Palo Alto, to Palo Alto Online and

12
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:37,460
Palo Alto Weekly.

13
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:40,370
And like, look, this is happening,
it's really local, and

14
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:41,600
look at all these amazing stories.

15
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,940
And I was able to get a story out.

16
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:45,700
So, that brought another
few hundreds of people, and

17
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:47,515
my friends invited their friends.

18
00:00:47,515 --> 00:00:49,645
We tried things that
are totally not scalable.

19
00:00:49,645 --> 00:00:53,235
Like we printed postcards and we went
and put them in people's houses and

20
00:00:53,235 --> 00:00:54,605
door hangers.

21
00:00:54,605 --> 00:00:58,815
Just anything to get those
first few hundreds of users and

22
00:00:58,815 --> 00:01:02,125
to prove to yourself,
that they want it and they'll use it.

23
00:01:02,125 --> 00:01:04,385
To start your first user base,

24
00:01:04,385 --> 00:01:08,890
just figure out where your users
hang out, where they do it.

25
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:09,780
Is it offline?

26
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:10,780
Is it online?

27
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:12,120
If it's online, that's great,

28
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,400
maybe there's a forum where
they all just hang out.

29
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,770
Maybe it's all the moms forum.

30
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:17,190
Maybe it's the small business forum.

31
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:18,510
Maybe it's the accounting forum.

32
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:23,310
Whatever your space is, figure that
out and go there and be active.

33
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:26,880
And approach them and tell them,
here's my thing, I just started it,

34
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,320
will you check it out?

35
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,685
A lot of startups do that in
places like Hacker News, and

36
00:01:30,685 --> 00:01:33,480
Reddit, and
those are their type of communities,

37
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,650
but maybe it's a different
type of community for you.

38
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:40,380
So just go there, put it out there, just
be very authentic about who you are,

39
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:41,730
don't try to advertise.

40
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:45,080
Just say look, this is who I am,
I've started this startup, I think

41
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,896
it can be useful for you, and I'd
appreciate your feedback, go sign up.

42
00:01:47,896 --> 00:01:51,270
I think people will respond to that,
better than if you try to

43
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:54,950
post something very pompous about,
I'm changing the world and

44
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:58,280
you should all be on this,
because you really haven't yet.

45
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,210
So just be authentic.

46
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:01,770
Common mistakes, I see.

47
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:05,490
Start ups, I don't do or kind of like,
a misconception that they have,

48
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:08,870
is that marketing is something
you can hire for, right?

49
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:10,210
You build your product and

50
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:13,630
you get the marketing person and
they will just make the product grow.

51
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:18,150
And, actually marketing
is inside the product.

52
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:20,170
It's a core part of it.

53
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:24,480
And marketing is the language that you
use in your product, it's the flows you

54
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,910
have in your product, it's the social
elements you have in your product.

55
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:31,800
It's the incentives you give people,
to invite others to your product.

56
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:36,020
So, marketing, the product person
should be a marketing person.

57
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:38,200
Or the marketing person you hire
should be there from the get-go and

58
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,820
help define the product.

59
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:42,844
When you're just starting out and
you don't have a budget, don't think

60
00:02:42,844 --> 00:02:45,984
about how you can grow, grow, grow to
millions and millions and millions.

61
00:02:45,984 --> 00:02:48,301
Just think about how
you can experiment and

62
00:02:48,301 --> 00:02:52,790
perform the largest number of
experiments to see what will work.

63
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:56,760
So kind of, take the pressure off,
trying to get a million users tomorrow.

64
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,380
And see how you can get two users, and

65
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:01,600
get those two users to
bring two more users.

66
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,150
And if that experiment
has been successful, and

67
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:07,060
it's something that's replicable,
then now, maybe you have something.

68
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:09,798
So just think small, try a lot of
things and figure out what works.

69
00:03:09,798 --> 00:03:15,220
>> So, to grow your user base from 0 to
1000, the first thing that I would do.

70
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:20,530
The first thing that I did, actually, is
understanding what makes my user tick.

71
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:24,000
Where are they spending their time?

72
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,270
What are they doing there?

73
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:28,660
I mean what are the apps
that they are using?

74
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:31,890
What kind of website they're going to,
what are they doing

75
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:36,830
on those web sites and apps?

76
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:38,670
Whats interesting for them?

77
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:39,770
What are their habits?

78
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:43,202
What are the social platforms
that they are using?

79
00:03:43,202 --> 00:03:46,190
And start focusing on those places.

80
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:47,270
You can't do everything.

81
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:48,688
Everybody wants to do everything.

82
00:03:48,688 --> 00:03:55,370
You can do incentives and the SCO and
social and an offline presence.

83
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:58,603
You need to know exactly what's
working and what's not and

84
00:03:58,603 --> 00:04:00,161
double in what's working.

85
00:04:00,161 --> 00:04:01,604
So for example,

86
00:04:01,604 --> 00:04:07,282
let's assume that you are doing
a keyword research for your SEO.

87
00:04:07,282 --> 00:04:12,038
But one of the by products that
you're getting from keyword research

88
00:04:12,038 --> 00:04:15,710
is understanding your
audience interests.

89
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:18,757
What they care about,
what are they asking Google,

90
00:04:18,757 --> 00:04:21,603
when they're trying to
find something online?

91
00:04:21,603 --> 00:04:24,120
What kind of apps are they using?

92
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,540
What are their habits?

93
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:28,660
And when you're finding out
what people care about,

94
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:32,090
you can start to
strategize your next plan.

95
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:35,400
You can start understanding
what you need to do.

96
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:39,920
>> The important question is how we got
from 0 to just 100,000 views a day,

97
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,040
or 100,000 to 1 million views a day.

98
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:45,843
How did we get from 0 videos
uploaded to 100 videos uploaded,

99
00:04:45,843 --> 00:04:47,790
to 1,000 videos uploaded?

100
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:52,680
And that was sort of the summer of 2005,
we went out there to a lot of different

101
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:58,180
forums out there and
told people that, if you needed to

102
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:03,900
use a method, a server,
to be able to host your videos,

103
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:08,430
use this as the free place,
we don't charge storage fees.

104
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:12,780
We don't charge any fees for you, as a
host, to be able to upload your videos.

105
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:15,050
Just upload the content and
we'll do all the trans-coding, and

106
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:17,690
we'll do all the bandwidth and we'll
pay for all the bandwidth for you, for

107
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:20,330
all the views that you
want to use the site for.

108
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:23,310
So, that was really what,
I think in the beginning.

109
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:28,141
But there was another part of it,
was MySpace in 2005,

110
00:05:28,141 --> 00:05:32,683
was one of the largest users or
largest sites out there,

111
00:05:32,683 --> 00:05:36,950
that utilized its ability
to be able to host videos.

112
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:41,080
And so, they themselves, didn't have
a service to able to host videos.

113
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:45,980
Their users were desperate for a way
to be able to upload and share videos.

114
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:50,113
And in comes YouTube with perfectly,
every time you uploaded a video

115
00:05:50,113 --> 00:05:53,746
on to YouTube, there was this
little snippet at the bottom,

116
00:05:53,746 --> 00:05:56,046
you barely have to scroll down at all.

117
00:05:56,046 --> 00:05:59,840
And here's a copy and paste and
we can add this copy and

118
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,550
paste HTML snippet on to everywhere.

119
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:06,730
So, we allowed pretty much any
site that allows HTML snippets.

120
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:10,230
eBay, Craigslist, but
MySpace was one of the big ones,

121
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:15,150
where people were seeking out this
solution and we provided the solution.

122
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:16,239
I think the equivalence,

123
00:06:16,239 --> 00:06:18,963
as well as the differences between
I think different companies,

124
00:06:18,963 --> 00:06:21,958
different startups, but key metrics and
how do you actually get that.

125
00:06:21,958 --> 00:06:26,760
I think with YouTube it was about giving
sort of almost free bandwidth out and

126
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:29,630
accumulating more users,
getting the brand name out there.

127
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:30,920
For PayPal it was different, right?

128
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:34,470
It was getting the people's trust and
it was trying to get people,

129
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:37,760
to see this as a way to
make payments online.

130
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,820
People were still back in that time,
1999,

131
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:42,690
this was something they've
never heard of and

132
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:46,550
they were still kind of trying to
feel out what the internet can do.

133
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:50,140
So one thing that PayPal did early
on was to be able to assign a very

134
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:51,070
high value.

135
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:54,552
I think that when we were
looking at banks out there.

136
00:06:54,552 --> 00:06:58,346
And every customer,
had a sort of a value of about $750.

137
00:06:58,346 --> 00:07:02,881
And so, when PayPal took a look at it
and said well, if it only takes us

138
00:07:02,881 --> 00:07:07,655
$10 to get a new user, it's
an investment that we're making that's

139
00:07:07,655 --> 00:07:12,290
very costly now, but the returns on
it years from now will be very big.

140
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:15,823
And so, it was a sign in for
every new user that you would create,

141
00:07:15,823 --> 00:07:20,339
every new user account automatically
gets $10 into their PayPal account, and

142
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:22,182
they can start making payments.

143
00:07:22,182 --> 00:07:25,016
And then,
to try to create that virality,

144
00:07:25,016 --> 00:07:29,662
to try to create more users and
get you are automatically connected and

145
00:07:29,662 --> 00:07:34,090
comfortable with this idea of
payment to payment service.

146
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:38,800
It automatically gave you $10 for
every new user, that you brought online.

147
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,790
But, you can quickly see that, once you
start getting your first 1000 users and

148
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:46,840
they're actually getting another 10,000
users it starts accumulating very

149
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:49,900
quickly, that you're actually just
paying out all the funding that you're

150
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:53,270
getting from VCs in
checks to these people.

151
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:54,460
But ultimately,

152
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:57,930
it also created a network that
people were comfortable with.

153
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:03,415
Down the line people, it became
harder and harder to get that $10, so

154
00:08:03,415 --> 00:08:05,790
initially it was,
you would sign up for the account and

155
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:08,760
confirm your email address, and
here's the $10 in your account.

156
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:14,040
Later on it became, you have to give
us your credit card information.

157
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:17,406
And then, even later on it was,
you have to give us your ACH or

158
00:08:17,406 --> 00:08:20,779
banking account information and
then you would get $10.

159
00:08:20,779 --> 00:08:25,131
And by that point, I think, if you're
a new user that's actually giving credit

160
00:08:25,131 --> 00:08:28,267
card information,
as well as your banking information,

161
00:08:28,267 --> 00:08:31,160
it's well worth the $10
to get that information.

162
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:35,429
One of the questions that I get a lot
from, sort of, new entrepreneurs where

163
00:08:35,429 --> 00:08:38,650
they give a talk, for example, and
I get questions coming up afterwards.

164
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:46,666
And, it's kind of this model of question
which would be, I've this great idea.

165
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:51,099
And two things, I think, one of them is,
I've been thinking about it for

166
00:08:51,099 --> 00:08:54,743
a long time, but I don't know
what the next step should be and

167
00:08:54,743 --> 00:08:57,700
I think the obvious is,
why don't you start it?

168
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:00,575
And it's like well, no I don't know
if it's going to work, and I'm still

169
00:09:00,575 --> 00:09:03,560
working on something else at the time,
and it's taking up a lot of my energy.

170
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:06,915
But at the end of the day, I think
behind every company there was that risk

171
00:09:06,915 --> 00:09:10,435
and there was the ability to say forget
it for six months, three months, for

172
00:09:10,435 --> 00:09:12,317
a year I'm going to go without a salary.

173
00:09:12,317 --> 00:09:17,017
And without that sort of safety net and
I'm going to take a chance, and

174
00:09:17,017 --> 00:09:21,450
I'm going to take some risk,
to be able to see this through.

175
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:24,020
But, without ever taking
that risky first step,

176
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:25,530
no company's ever been created.

177
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:30,470
So, I think that's one
of the key things there.

178
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:33,590
I think, the second one is always this
question that people come up and say,

179
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:35,260
well, what do you think?

180
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:37,610
They would pitch this idea and
they would say, but

181
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:40,910
one of the reasons why I'm not so
ecstatic about starting this,

182
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:44,100
is that I don't see this as
a billion dollar company.

183
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:47,726
And I have to say, I don't think that
whenever one of these companies,

184
00:09:47,726 --> 00:09:51,959
whenever Facebook started, or PayPal,
or YouTube started, we talked earlier,

185
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:53,360
YouTube was a dating site.

186
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,930
We didn't think YouTube was
a billion dollar company.

187
00:09:56,930 --> 00:10:01,960
I think as long as,
it's an idea that you believe in.

188
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:07,640
As long as it's an idea that you see,
either yourself or somebody, you can see

189
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:11,610
and visualize the users behind the site,
then create it because people will come.

190
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:14,273
And it's going to be a question as to
how many people will use this site.

191
00:10:14,273 --> 00:10:18,701
But I think that's more important,
rather than trying to create

192
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:23,613
something that you think is going to,
rather than having to qualify that

193
00:10:23,613 --> 00:10:28,630
the actual start up idea with, is it
going to be this billion dollar idea?

194
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:31,070
I think it's more important to just say,

195
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:34,230
is it creating a solution to
a problem that I can see?
