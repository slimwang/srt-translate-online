1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,340
So, what's a bit? And a bit is the smallest

2
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:07,160
unit of information. So suppose I tell you that there are

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:10,550
two boxes. There's a green box and a blue box, and

4
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:14,530
in one of those two boxes, there's a gold star. And

5
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:16,570
it's equally likely to be in either the green box or

6
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:20,100
the blue box. One bit is the answer to one yes

7
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:22,750
or no question. So if you ask one yes or no

8
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:26,170
question, you ask, is the gold star in the green box,

9
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:28,140
then you get one bit back as the response. You get an

10
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,820
answer that's either yes or no. And when you learn which one it

11
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:33,350
is, that's one bit of information that allows you to go from

12
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:36,590
having two choices down to one choice and then you know, well, if

13
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:39,710
the answer was yes, the gold star's in the green box, that's

14
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:43,230
the one you should open. So when we think about bits in computing,

15
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:46,362
we don't usually call them yes or no. We call them 0

16
00:00:46,362 --> 00:00:51,180
and 1. 0 more readily maps to no, and 1 to yes. So

17
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:53,730
I switched blue and green here. But we could

18
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:56,240
pick any two things. We could use green and blue.

19
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:00,010
We could use yes or no. If we have two

20
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:04,019
things And we can choose one of them. Knowing which

21
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:06,990
one to choose is one bit of information. So that's

22
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:08,720
what one bit can do. It allows us to decide

23
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,160
between two things. For the ancient Greeks network, maybe that's

24
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:16,230
all it could transmit. There was either the no bit,

25
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:19,260
which said there weren't any enemies arriving. Or if there was a

26
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:22,660
smoke signal, that was one bit saying, yes there is an enemy

27
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:26,135
arriving. So it's possible if it was only able to transmit that

28
00:01:26,135 --> 00:01:30,210
1 message, that it only conveyed 1 bit of information. If all we

29
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:32,396
can do is send bits, we can send either a 0 or

30
00:01:32,396 --> 00:01:34,518
a 1, or a yes or a no. But let's think of

31
00:01:34,518 --> 00:01:37,890
it as 0 and 1s now. Can we send anything more interesting?

32
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:41,240
Can we just send one thing? And it turns out that we can

33
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,340
actually send everything that we want, just

34
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:46,290
using bits. So instead of just picking between

35
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:48,780
two boxes, now let's suppose there are four

36
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:54,530
boxes. So let's say, there's, a purple box,

37
00:01:54,530 --> 00:02:00,910
and there's a dark red box. So now there're four boxes. There's still only one

38
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:06,400
gold star. So can we figure out which box the gold star is in with just yes,

39
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,030
no questions? Well one way to do that would be to ask

40
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:13,770
four questions, right? We could say is it in the green box?

41
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,520
We could ask is it in the purple box? We could ask

42
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,370
is it in the blue box and as long as we know there is

43
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:23,950
at least one gold star. We don't really need to ask if

44
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:26,420
it's in the dark red box, because if we got no for all

45
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:29,760
three of these well then we know the answer to that next question,

46
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,560
if we asked if it was in the red box, would be yes.

47
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,040
So here we needed up to three questions, to figure out which box the gold star

48
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:42,690
was in. Can we do better? So the question is, how many bits do we need to

49
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:44,700
find the gold star? And remember each bit

50
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:48,190
is the answer to one, yes or no question.

51
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:50,210
And we have four possible boxes and the

52
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:51,940
gold star could be any anyone of those four.
