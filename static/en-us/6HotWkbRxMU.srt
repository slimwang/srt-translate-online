00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:04,980
This picture that we have here actually
puts a number of different concepts,

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:07,540
in terms of how they're
related to each other, so

3
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:10,700
let's just sort of quickly
look at it from two sides.

4
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:15,850
People who rely on computer systems and
network systems, these are owners

5
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:19,640
of the data that's stored, and
the systems where the data is stored.

6
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:23,110
They deploy those because those
are critical towards the do.

7
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:26,330
At the same time we know that
there are threat sources and

8
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:30,520
they're going to pose threats to
the systems that we're talking about.

9
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:33,790
But one way we deal with
both the threat source and

10
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:37,300
a vulnerability that we may
have is deploying defenses.

11
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:39,650
Owners obviously want
to reduce this risk.

12
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:44,200
And one way to do that is to deploy
the defenses that we have in place.

13
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:48,513
And the risk is to the online assets
which are valued by the owners.

14
00:00:48,513 --> 00:00:51,913
That's sort of the picture
on the legitimate owners and

15
00:00:51,913 --> 00:00:53,656
what they do in cyberspace.

16
00:00:53,656 --> 00:00:59,176
In terms of the attackers, or
the malicious actors, threat sources,

17
00:00:59,176 --> 00:01:04,590
they basically increase risk to
these online assets that we have.

18
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:09,660
And that happens because they exploit
vulnerabilities and launch attacks.

19
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:13,360
By doing that they wish to profit and
that's the way they do it.

20
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:19,310
The big picture is sort of the center is
what is of value, who poses a threat and

21
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:23,950
what do we do to somehow manage
the risk that we have for

22
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:26,920
our online assets from
the threat sources.

23
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,660
But the key concepts in cyber security,

24
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:33,530
this diagram sort of nicely relates
the idea of threats, vulnerabilities,

25
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:36,460
attacks, cyber risk, and so on,
and how they're all connected.
