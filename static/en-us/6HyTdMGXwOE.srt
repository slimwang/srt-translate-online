1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,470
Okay, give me another one.

2
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:04,477
>> Okay,
tell me what find view by ID is?

3
00:00:04,477 --> 00:00:07,221
[BLANK_AUDIO]

4
00:00:07,221 --> 00:00:12,109
>> I feel like it has something to
do with finding a view by its ID?

5
00:00:13,189 --> 00:00:15,599
>> Okay, but
try to define it without using its name.

6
00:00:18,149 --> 00:00:18,989
>> Hey there.

7
00:00:18,989 --> 00:00:21,299
We're actually fiddling around
with that app that you just made,

8
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:22,800
you know, Quiz Example.

9
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,699
>> Yeah, good job completing
it just in time to study up

10
00:00:25,699 --> 00:00:29,230
on all the new terms you just learned in
this lesson, like Content Provider, URI,

11
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:31,080
and Content Authority.

12
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:34,019
>> But you did more in this lesson
than learn all these new terms.

13
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:36,600
You also used a preexisting
Content Provider.

14
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,410
By doing this, you grabbed another
developer's app data that was

15
00:00:39,409 --> 00:00:43,789
already on the phone and employed it
in an entirely new app experience.

16
00:00:43,789 --> 00:00:46,280
You can use the same steps to grab
things like the user's contact

17
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,660
information and their calendar events.

18
00:00:48,659 --> 00:00:52,254
>> In addition, you now have insight
into when content providers are useful

19
00:00:52,255 --> 00:00:53,390
and why you might want to make one.

20
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:57,975
So now if you do make a content provider
say, as part of your sunshine app,

21
00:00:57,975 --> 00:01:01,265
you'll understand what the benefits
are for yourself and other developers.
