00:00:00,315 --> 00:00:04,860
The answers I was looking for
are either P squared or P squared log P.

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:05,939
Why?

3
00:00:05,939 --> 00:00:08,029
Take a look at steps three and four.

4
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:11,260
The root has to sort how many samples?

5
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:14,860
Well, it's P times P minus 1,
which is about P squared.

6
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:18,000
So then sorting these samples
would cost you either P squared or

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,650
P squared log P, depending on what local
algorithm you assume for the sort.

8
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:26,510
The main thing to remember is
this fact of a P squared factor,

9
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:31,400
could be a severe limiter to scalability
if the system is truly, truly massive.
