1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,140
So if the learning goal of this class is
that you would know enough to contribute

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:06,020
to the educational technology community,
what's the learning outcome?

3
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:08,330
A learning outcome is
something demonstrable.

4
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:10,330
A learning goal is something you
should know by the end of the course.

5
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:12,060
A learning outcome is something
you should be able to do.

6
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:15,300
And here the learning outcome is
a subtle twist on that learning goal.

7
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:17,450
If the goal is to know
enough to contribute,

8
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:20,210
the outcome is that you will
have actually contributed.

9
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:23,050
Now of course the way you contribute
is dependent on your interests or

10
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:25,280
your passions in this class.

11
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:28,040
For example, if you're more interested
in designing educational technology,

12
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:31,040
then your contribution and your learning
outcome will be that you have actually

13
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:33,230
designed educational technology.

14
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:35,630
If you're interested more
on the research side,

15
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:38,450
then by the end of this course your
outcome will be you have done research.

16
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:41,600
You have actually participated in
researching educational technology and

17
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,670
made a contribution to
the research community.

18
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:46,550
So depending on your interests, the
nature of your learning outcomes will

19
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:49,290
differ, but the overall outcome
is the same for everybody.

20
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:51,410
By the end of this class,
you should be able to, and in fact,

21
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:54,710
you will have contributed to
the educational technology community.
