1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,960
So small size or reducing the size
of the trusted computing base,

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:05,620
will it help the testing?

3
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:06,260
Yes.

4
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:09,480
Remember, testing,
you need to have code coverage.

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:13,070
Larger the code you have, harder it
is going to be for you to cover.

6
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:15,100
All these possible execution paths.

7
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:16,810
So testing would be easier.

8
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:20,770
Verification we talked about state
space and explosional state space and

9
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:21,410
exponential.

10
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:24,260
Well, size is small,
that's going to be easier, too.

11
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:27,020
Finally, isolation of the TCB.

12
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:31,860
Depending on how isolation is being
done, in general if it's smaller,

13
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:35,130
fewer interactions with other
components and things like that.

14
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:37,810
So small size is actually good for
everything.

15
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:40,050
So I'm going to go ahead.

16
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:43,520
The details as they say,
the devil is in the details.

17
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,930
So you could say well what exactly how,
what isolation you talking about.

18
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:51,770
But in general, we say reducing
the size is a good thing.
