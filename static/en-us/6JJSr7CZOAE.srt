1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,115
So we learned something really cool

2
00:00:03,115 --> 00:00:08,551
and we ask ourselves, shall we fake or not fake our data?

3
00:00:08,551 --> 00:00:10,536
I'm not so sure.

4
00:00:10,536 --> 00:00:16,040
When the data is scarse, I believe faking it gives you a better result.

5
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:19,695
It is unreasonable to assume that after a single coin flip

6
00:00:19,695 --> 00:00:22,758
you know the exact probability and it's either 0 or 1.

7
00:00:22,758 --> 00:00:25,388
It's much more reasonable to say we don't know yet

8
00:00:25,388 --> 00:00:29,083
and take a more caution 2/3 or 1/3 as a probability.

9
00:00:29,083 --> 00:00:35,678
So obvioulsy I've shown to you that even under very very very simple methods

10
00:00:35,678 --> 00:00:40,884
faking it might be justified and in fact give you better results.

11
00:00:40,884 --> 00:00:44,884
That blows my mind.
