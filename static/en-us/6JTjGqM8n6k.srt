The function will pass through these points here, and these points here. It

2
00:00:03,948 --> 00:00:07,910
won't be at all in this part of the graph, or in this part of the graph.

00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:11,595
Interesting. Slant asymptotes really change things up. Now since this is a

4
00:00:11,595 --> 00:00:15,341
major tease, let me just show you the full graph of the function. And here it

5
00:00:15,341 --> 00:00:19,788
is. We can see our slant asymptote right here. The graph is getting closer and

6
00:00:19,788 --> 00:00:24,436
closer to it, as x gets bigger on both sides, positive and negative. And we can

7
00:00:24,436 --> 00:00:27,930
also see our vertical asymptote right here. Pretty cool. Asymptotes clearly are

8
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:30,800
what determines the behavior of rational functions.
