00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,636
The answer is negative 5 is less than x is less than 5. Let's look at that on a

2
00:00:04,636 --> 00:00:09,383
number line. We know that the distance between x and 0 needs to be less than 5,

3
00:00:09,383 --> 00:00:13,411
so it can be any value between negative 5 and 5 on the number line.
