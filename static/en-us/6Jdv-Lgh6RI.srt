1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:04,756
The correlation coefficient now goes down to 0.231, which is a lot lower than

2
00:00:04,756 --> 00:00:12,004
this one. As you can see, r is sensitive to outliers just like the mean is. In

3
00:00:12,004 --> 00:00:16,441
other words, outliers can dramatically change the value of r. That's why it's

4
00:00:16,441 --> 00:00:20,662
important to look at data with a critical eye and think, what is causing this

5
00:00:20,662 --> 00:00:27,420
outlier to be there? Should we include it in the measurement of our statistics?

6
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:31,980
Remember how before, when we created box plots, we looked at just the

7
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:37,340
interquartile range, and outliers weren't used in the actual box-and-whisker

8
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:44,251
plot. They were drawn as circles on the outside. Kind of like this. Sometimes

9
00:00:44,251 --> 00:00:48,167
it's good to take outliers into account. Other times, you want to see the trend

10
00:00:48,167 --> 00:00:49,749
of the data without them.
