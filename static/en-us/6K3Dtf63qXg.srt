1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,760
Let's try another example,
follow along with me.

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:06,360
This time we're going to write
a function that takes in a string and

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:08,840
returns a string with
the first letter removed from

4
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:11,868
the beginning of the string,
and instead placed at the end.

5
00:00:11,868 --> 00:00:14,680
We've got the func let's give it a name.

6
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:18,880
Let's call it a placeFirstLetterLast.

7
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,550
It's going to take in
a string as a parameter.

8
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:25,720
Let's call that parameter myString and
it will return a string as well.

9
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:29,582
And now comes the meat of the function.

10
00:00:29,582 --> 00:00:33,010
Just going to put a placeholder
string here to quiet the compiler.

11
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:36,350
Let's start out by adding the first
letter to the end of myString.

12
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:38,172
We can do that using
the append function.

13
00:00:38,172 --> 00:00:42,360
Append is a method, a function
that's part of the String class.

14
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:46,208
So we call the method append on an
instance of the String class using dot

15
00:00:46,208 --> 00:00:47,070
syntax.

16
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:48,430
We just type the name of the string,

17
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:52,430
a dot, and the name of the method
followed by parentheses.

18
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:55,570
We place any input parameters
between the parentheses.

19
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:59,450
In this case the parameter is
a character to append to myString.

20
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:02,058
So how will we get the first
character of myString?

21
00:01:02,058 --> 00:01:05,730
Well, we just wrote a function that
returns the first character of a string.

22
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:09,140
Let's use that and
put it here is the argument to append.

23
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:12,100
Hm, okay the compiler's
upset about something.

24
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:14,210
Let's see what this error says.

25
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:19,262
Immutable value of type String only
has mutating members named depend.

26
00:01:19,262 --> 00:01:23,630
See, because myString is a parameter,
it defaults to being a constant,

27
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:26,270
as if it were declared with let.

28
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:29,130
If we declare it with var,
the error should go away.

29
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:36,350
Sweet, so far we've appended the first
letter to the end of the string.

30
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:39,830
Now we need to also remove it
from the beginning of the string.

31
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:43,225
For that we can use the function,
removeAtIndex.

32
00:01:43,225 --> 00:01:45,900
RemoveAtIndex takes
an index as a parameter.

33
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:49,200
The index we want to
remove is the startIndex.

34
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,900
And of course instead of returning
placeholder, we want to return myString.

35
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:55,190
And that ought to do it.

36
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:58,562
So let's test it out by
calling the function, and

37
00:01:58,562 --> 00:02:00,820
we'll call it on the string Mom.

38
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:04,223
Over here in the sidebar you can
see that Mom becomes omM, and

39
00:02:04,223 --> 00:02:06,160
we're ready for yoga.

40
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:09,758
But before we move on, I'd like you to
notice the difference between how we

41
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:12,598
call global functions,
and how we call methods.

42
00:02:12,598 --> 00:02:16,080
For example, append is called on
an instance of the string class

43
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,470
using dot syntax, it's a method.

44
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:22,170
Global functions, on the other hand,
like placeFirstLetterLast,

45
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:24,260
are not called by any
object in particular.
