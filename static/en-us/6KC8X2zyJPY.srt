1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,620
So, now that we've seen a couple of different functions, let's talk about how to

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:09,161
actually use them. When we had a computer program, we saw that we would take our

3
00:00:09,161 --> 00:00:13,715
function, type the name out, and then in the parentheses, where we know that the

4
00:00:13,715 --> 00:00:17,924
input goes, we could type a specific number like 4 for example, like we did

5
00:00:17,924 --> 00:00:22,339
before. And then because the function was already defined in the program, when

6
00:00:22,339 --> 00:00:26,418
we ran this, with an actual number as the input, it would give us an answer. It

7
00:00:26,418 --> 00:00:31,562
would spit out in this case a 1. We can do a similar thing with the mathematical

8
00:00:31,562 --> 00:00:35,289
version of this function. Once again, in the slot where the input goes. Inside

9
00:00:35,289 --> 00:00:39,733
the parenthesis right here, we can write a number. Let's pick a different one

10
00:00:39,733 --> 00:00:44,309
this time just to spice things up a little bit. Maybe 5. Now the way that we use

11
00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:49,128
this new input of 5, is we substitute it in to all the places where we see x in

12
00:00:49,128 --> 00:00:53,987
the expression on the right hand side over here. So, in fact the first term you

13
00:00:53,987 --> 00:00:57,556
see is an x, so we replace that with the 5. And then the rest of the expression

14
00:00:57,556 --> 00:01:02,283
is the same. We started off with f of x equals x minus 3 and that means we know

15
00:01:02,283 --> 00:01:06,992
that f of 5 is equal to 5 minus 3. We can evaluate this to see that f of 5 is

16
00:01:06,992 --> 00:01:12,514
equal to 2. So 5 here is our input, and when plugged in to this function, the

17
00:01:12,514 --> 00:01:18,052
function relates the input of 5 to an output, which in this case is 2. This in

18
00:01:18,052 --> 00:01:22,263
fact creates a point for us. We can now plot the point 5 comma 2. This is a

19
00:01:22,263 --> 00:01:27,018
point that lies on this line. Since we know that we're just replacing our

20
00:01:27,018 --> 00:01:31,837
dependent variable with f of x instead of y, we graph all the values of f of x

21
00:01:31,837 --> 00:01:36,879
of the function of the output just as we would y values on the vertical axis.

22
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:42,012
So, what if I have a different function instead? Maybe f of x equals x squared.

23
00:01:42,012 --> 00:01:45,752
What if I want to plug in 4 as the input for this equation? What would the

24
00:01:45,752 --> 00:01:49,584
function give me as the output then? Please simplify your answer as much as

25
00:01:49,584 --> 00:01:51,920
possible, so that it's just a single number.
