1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,850
There's some more cool applications.

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:06,110
There's a whole bunch of work in building up

3
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:12,240
structures from multiple images taken of that same structure.

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,610
And there's a system and a whole bunch of work that came out of the folks at

5
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:20,280
Microsoft Research and also University of Washington.

6
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:22,140
Here's an example published at SIGGRAPH.

7
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:24,010
And they built this system called Photosynth, and

8
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:27,750
what you can see here are a bunch of pictures that were taken of Notre Dame.

9
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:32,509
And, what these little things down here are meant to show,

10
00:00:32,509 --> 00:00:37,461
are the locations of the image with respect to the structure.

11
00:00:37,461 --> 00:00:41,560
And that has to do with relating between the views that you have things.

12
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:44,145
When you do that, you can do some really cool things.

13
00:00:44,145 --> 00:00:46,797
They basically launched a site, this whole photo tourism,

14
00:00:46,797 --> 00:00:50,240
this idea of that being able to put in your images and this is their Photosynth.

15
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,305
And I encourage you to check it out if, if, if,

16
00:00:52,305 --> 00:00:54,910
when you're using this we still use computers.

17
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:58,587
In fact, here's a really cool demonstration done by Agarwal in,

18
00:00:58,587 --> 00:01:00,197
back in 2009, isn't it.

19
00:01:00,197 --> 00:01:04,894
So what you're seeing is, there's a whole bunch of these little dots,

20
00:01:04,894 --> 00:01:09,950
these, those are camera view points of the Colosseum, in Rome.

21
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:13,140
You should go see that, see the, I mean, this is nice, see the real one,

22
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,140
it's really cool.

23
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:17,940
And this is just, flying you around the reconstruction of

24
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:22,400
all these points based upon the solution to where all these cameras were.

25
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,710
And this all relates to, first sun, solving fundamental matrix issues and

26
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:29,650
then getting the full 3D calibration.

27
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:33,480
I don't want to claim that you can do this with just the fundamental matrix,

28
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:36,830
because in fact you eventually end up getting full 3D reconstruction here.

29
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:39,830
But the idea is you have to know how the, the points correspond.
