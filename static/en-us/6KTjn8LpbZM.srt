1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,000
And the answer is there are 8 states.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
There are 2 physical states that the robot vacuum cleaner can be in--

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
either in state A or in state B.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
But in addition to that, there are states about how the world is

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
as well as where the robot is in the world.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
So state A can be dirty or not.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
That's 2 possibilities.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
And B can be dirty or not.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
That's 2 more possibilities.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 99:59:59,999
We multiply those together. We get 8 possible states.
