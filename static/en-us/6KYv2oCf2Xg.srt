1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:05,836
If Grant invests $10,000 at a 3% annual rate compounded twice a year, then in 6

2
00:00:05,836 --> 00:00:13,470
months, he'll receive 1.5% on this $10,000 investment. This means that $150.00

3
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:19,700
will be added to his account, in interest. The total balance will then be

4
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:26,737
10,000 plus 150, or $10,150. After six more months pass, Grant will again

5
00:00:26,737 --> 00:00:35,272
receive 1.5% interest, but now on this new amount. The interest added this time

6
00:00:35,272 --> 00:00:44,696
will be 0.015 times 10,150, or $152.25. This will make the total amount of

7
00:00:44,696 --> 00:00:52,222
money in the account after one year equal to $10,302.25. Note that in the

8
00:00:52,222 --> 00:00:55,732
second six months, more interest is added, since Grant is getting interest on

9
00:00:55,732 --> 00:00:58,810
the interest from the previous six months, as well as on his original

10
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:03,550
investment. Seems like a pretty good deal to me.
