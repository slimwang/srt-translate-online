00:00:00,422 --> 00:00:03,540
In Objective-C,
the class is the principal mechanism for

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:06,230
bundling together data and
functionality.

3
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:09,054
Whereas Swift might employ
a diversity of types,

4
00:00:09,054 --> 00:00:14,760
including classes, strucks, and eNUMs,
Objective-C primarily uses classes.

5
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:17,640
In this lesson, we'll write
a class from top to bottom, and

6
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,560
then do it again and then do it again.
