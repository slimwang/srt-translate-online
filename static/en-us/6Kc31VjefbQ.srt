Congratulations on making
it to the last lesson.

2
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:06,600
In this lesson, you're going to iterate
on your previous work with Meme Me and

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:10,808
get the app portfolio ready by adding
the ability to view sent memes.

4
00:00:10,808 --> 00:00:14,690
That might sound pretty simple, but
the sent memes feature is a tricky one.

5
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:17,800
It employs a tab view,
a table view, a collection view,

6
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,590
not to mention implementing navigation,

7
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:24,000
so you'll need to extend your UIKit
knowledge in each of these areas.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,710
We'll take you through each
topic one step at a time.

9
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:31,611
Let's start with a close look at this
updated version of the app, Meme Me 2.0.
