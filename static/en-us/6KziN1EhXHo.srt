1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:03,160
So let's look at that one now in a little more detail.

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:06,020
The step two of course is detecting and matching.

3
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:08,170
Here I'm just showing you two different examples.

4
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:12,340
And here we need to do is find features that are common between both.

5
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:13,820
Let's zoom in a little bit so

6
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:17,400
we can actually look at this detail a little bit more carefully.

7
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,440
So I'm zoomed in.

8
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:20,570
Now this should give you an interesting sense.

9
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:21,949
These are two different images.

10
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:25,520
Right, because as the game was progressing,

11
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:30,220
even when the camera was being panned from left to right, this megatron the kind

12
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:35,730
of the display of the stadium changed, so it went from lighter to darker.

13
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:39,040
The rest of the scene, of course, is still the same, but we want to

14
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:43,120
find matches between this and that for doing various types of alignment.

15
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,880
Looking at that a little bit more carefully,

16
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,420
let's look at these two examples again.

17
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,090
What I want to do is now find features.

18
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:52,370
Now, of course you see a bunch of numbers in both of these images.

19
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:54,740
So, the software I used already found those measures.

20
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:58,820
Now I'm going to find and connect, basically, specific examples of this.

21
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:00,740
So look at these circles.

22
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:02,380
I just put up five of them.

23
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:07,830
They need to match to other ones in the image, the corresponding next image.

24
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:12,550
So the same five ones and there and basically what you see is this feature and

25
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:15,500
this feature match, this feature and this feature match, this feature and

26
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,160
this feature are a match.

27
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:21,970
All five of these highlighted features have found a match from one to the other.

28
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:26,390
This is an important part of the matching of features from one to the other,

29
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:29,190
because that will be important to align these images together, and then,

30
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:31,220
of course, merge them.

31
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:34,470
We will cover the techniques of how to do this much later in the term, but

32
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:37,160
I just want to use this as an example of why you would want to do this.
