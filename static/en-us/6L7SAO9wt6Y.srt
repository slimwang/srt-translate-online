00:00:01,150 --> 00:00:03,330
The first way lets us take a page that

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:06,650
was designed to be precisely one size. This is an

3
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:09,450
application I built that's using a fixed layout, and

4
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:14,410
it's a bit smaller than default. It's 916 pixels wide.

5
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:16,430
Notice that it's not using all the space on

6
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:19,350
the screen because the browser by default is assuming the

7
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:23,170
layout wants to be 980 pixels wide. So let's

8
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:26,610
a viewport that tells the browser it was designed for

9
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:30,800
916 pixels across. What would you put in the viewport

10
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,880
to tell the browser that this should be 916 pixels?
