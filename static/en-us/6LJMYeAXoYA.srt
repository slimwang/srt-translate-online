00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,757
From our table here we can see that the quantity x minus four times the quantity

2
00:00:04,757 --> 00:00:09,356
x plus four is positive, or greater than zero, only when x is either less than

3
00:00:09,356 --> 00:00:14,200
negative four or greater than positive four. So, these must be the intervals of

4
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:19,075
values of x that satisfy our original inequality. Since we now know that x minus

5
00:00:19,075 --> 00:00:23,737
16 is greater than zero, it satisfied when either x is less than eight of four

6
00:00:23,737 --> 00:00:28,032
or x is greater than four. Can you tell me about the solution set to sort of a

7
00:00:28,032 --> 00:00:32,174
related inequality. X squared minus 16 is less than or equal to 0. Of course,

8
00:00:32,174 --> 00:00:36,122
you can use our table down here for reference. And I'd like you to write the

9
00:00:36,122 --> 00:00:40,612
answer using interval notation. Remember, that involves brackets that are either

10
00:00:40,612 --> 00:00:44,762
square or round. Two numbers inside and then comas in between those numbers, and

11
00:00:44,762 --> 00:00:48,722
of course, you can combine the brackets differently depending on what you need

12
00:00:48,722 --> 00:00:49,640
for the interval.
