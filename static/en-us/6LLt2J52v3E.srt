Let us talk about what is design. Design in journal takes us input some sort

2
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:10,390
of needs, so goals or functions. It gives us output that's specification of

3
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:13,910
this structure of some artifact that satisfies those needs and goals and

4
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:18,150
functions. Note that the artifact need not be a physical product.

5
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:22,690
It can be a process. A program, a policy. Some example for

6
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:26,660
design, design a robot that can walk on water.

7
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:30,270
Design a search engine that can return the most relevant answer to a query.

8
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:35,270
The Federal Reserve Bank designs and monitor the policy to optimize the economy.

9
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:39,555
Note the design is very wide ranging, open ended and

10
00:00:39,555 --> 00:00:44,940
ill-defined. In problem solving, typically the problem remains fixed, even

11
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:50,350
as the solution evolves. In design, both the problem and the solution co-evolve.

12
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:55,390
The problem evolves as the solution evolves. We are studying design and

13
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:58,560
AI because we are working with AI agents that can do design.

14
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:03,900
At least potentially, we want AI agents that can design other AI agents.
