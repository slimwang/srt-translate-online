00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,731
>> This distribution is not symmetrical, it's skewed, >> With most incomes

2
00:00:04,731 --> 00:00:10,006
falling toward the left of the distribution. >> The most common household income

3
00:00:10,006 --> 00:00:15,196
is here, which is less than $25,000 per year. >> We can also say that most

4
00:00:15,196 --> 00:00:22,188
households make less than 100,000. >> If you see here, it says 95% of households

5
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:28,576
make less than 166,000, and 80% of households make less than 91,705. >> So,

6
00:00:28,576 --> 00:00:34,946
somewhere between 80% and 95% of households make less than $100,000, which is

7
00:00:34,946 --> 00:00:40,191
most of them. >> We cannot say, though, that no households have an income

8
00:00:40,191 --> 00:00:46,059
greater than $250,000. >> 98% have less than $250,000, which must mean that 2%

9
00:00:46,059 --> 00:00:50,080
of households have an income greater than $250,000.
