00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,746
Let's see if we can use this equation to help us solve a different type of

2
00:00:02,746 --> 00:00:07,282
problem. Our problem solving method will still be the same. We'll just want to

3
00:00:07,282 --> 00:00:11,450
use a minus sign instead of a plus sign. For this last problem we'll solve it

4
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:15,995
using this general equation. Here, we'll have a pool that has a pipe system

5
00:00:15,995 --> 00:00:21,110
that can fill it with water. An inlet pipe can fill the pool in 10 hours time.

6
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:26,195
While an outlet pipe can drain it in 12 hours. If both pipes are left often by

7
00:00:26,195 --> 00:00:30,480
mistake. How long would it take the pool to fill? Think carefully about where

8
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,730
each of these numbers should go in your equation, and then solve for the number

9
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:35,130
of hours.
