Here's a perspective projection matrix. Say you multiply a point with a

2
00:00:04,345 --> 00:00:09,450
coordinate, 3,7,0,1 by this matrix. I'll save you the effort. You get 3, 7,

3
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:14,610
negative 2.2, 0. W is 0. If you try to divide negative 2 by 2 by 0 without

4
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:19,496
safety glasses on, the world ends. In fact for any point X, Y, 0, 1, we'll get

5
00:00:19,496 --> 00:00:24,340
a W of 0. What do all of these points have in common? The points are exactly on

6
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:27,892
one of the faces of the frustum itself. The points are in the anti-frustum, a

7
00:00:27,892 --> 00:00:31,426
mirrored frustum behind the camera. The points are on a plane parallel to the

8
00:00:31,426 --> 00:00:35,590
near plane that goes through the origin. Or the points are behind the camera.
