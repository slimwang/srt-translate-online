Variables are called variables because they can vary. Here's a variable. It's

2
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:13,240
initial value is 228, but I can vary that if the need arises. Maybe the trip

3
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:17,850
took longer than I thought. Here I'm setting the variable to a different value.

4
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:24,685
Note that. The declaration looks almost the same as the assignment, where I

5
00:00:24,685 --> 00:00:30,490
assign a new value to an existing variable. The only way you can tell them

6
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:37,660
apart is that the assignment has no type. The declaration has the type in here.

7
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:42,920
The assignment looks just like a declaration except there's no type. That tips

8
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:47,402
us off that traveltime is an existing variable, whereas over here where we say

9
00:00:47,402 --> 00:00:52,760
int traveltime, it is a new variable. One way of thinking about a variable is

10
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:58,800
as a little box with a name. Of course, the value is inside the box, and it can

11
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:05,340
vary. As a result, of such an assignment. Now we've assigned a new value, to

12
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:09,640
the variable, and the new value is stored, in the little box.
