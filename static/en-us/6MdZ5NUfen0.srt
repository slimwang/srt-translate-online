1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,776
I know this is pretty complicated and that's why this entire lesson is pretty

2
00:00:04,776 --> 00:00:09,470
much on confidence intervals. Let's just analyze a good old normal distribution.

3
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:17,990
So here we have 95%, well if 95% is in the middle that means 2.5% is here and

4
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:25,772
2.5% is here. So what's the Z score here? If you look at the Z table, and look

5
00:00:25,772 --> 00:00:35,627
for 0.025, or 2.5%, you see that it's at negative 1.96. So Z is negative 1.96

6
00:00:35,627 --> 00:00:44,019
here and positive 1.96 here. So 0.13 can either be 1.96 standard deviations

7
00:00:44,019 --> 00:00:51,279
above the mean, like it is here if this were the population distribution. Z 0.13

8
00:00:51,279 --> 00:00:58,511
is 1.96 standard deviations above mu sub i. Or 0.13 can be 1.96 standard

9
00:00:58,511 --> 00:01:05,720
deviations below the true population mean. So if this sample mean is 1.96

10
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:13,090
standard deviations below the true population mean, then this true population

11
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:20,387
mean would be the sample mean plus 1.96 standard deviations away. And you found

12
00:01:20,387 --> 00:01:27,379
that 1 standard deviation is 0.024. However, if the sample mean is actually

13
00:01:27,379 --> 00:01:34,483
greater than the true population mean, then the true population mean is 0.13

14
00:01:34,483 --> 00:01:41,988
minus 1.96 standard deviations. And then if we calculate what these values are

15
00:01:41,988 --> 00:01:49,176
we get .083, approximately, and .177. So then our interval estimate for the 95%

16
00:01:49,176 --> 00:01:57,713
confidence interval has a lower bound of 0.083. And an upper bound of 0.177. Now

17
00:01:57,713 --> 00:02:02,850
really quick, always remember what these numbers mean. Most numbers have units

18
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:09,216
of some sort. This is the ratio of minutes watched of all the lessons to total

19
00:02:09,216 --> 00:02:15,781
minutes available. So we're predicting that, if I incorporated this musical

20
00:02:15,781 --> 00:02:21,981
lesson then the entire population of 8,702 students will watch between 83

21
00:02:21,981 --> 00:02:28,430
thousandths and 177 thousandths of all content available. So if we set it up

22
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:34,730
like this and we want to know how many minutes students will watch out of every

23
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:41,257
60 minutes available, 60 times 0.083 is about 5 minutes. And then on the upper

24
00:02:41,257 --> 00:02:48,298
bound, they could watch up to 0.177 minutes for every minute available. And out

25
00:02:48,298 --> 00:02:55,680
of 60 minutes, that's about 10.62. Since we found that the engagement ratio

26
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:02,020
right now Is 0.077. That's about 4.62 minutes watched out every hour of content

27
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:07,044
available. Then according to our calculations, we're pretty sure that this

28
00:03:07,044 --> 00:03:12,060
musical lesson will increase the amount video watched to at least 5 minutes and

29
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:17,115
possibly up to 10.62 minutes for every hour of content available. So if all of

30
00:03:17,115 --> 00:03:23,073
this actually happened, then we could say that my song increased the engagement.
