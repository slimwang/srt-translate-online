1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:05,378
The distance between the means for food A and B is three, and this is greater

2
00:00:05,378 --> 00:00:13,245
than 2.51. For B and C it's also three, and for A and C the difference is six.

3
00:00:13,245 --> 00:00:18,346
Therefore, all of the differences are honestly signifigantly different. If we

4
00:00:18,346 --> 00:00:21,910
just looked at the means, we wouldn't know whether or not their differences are

5
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:27,025
simply due to sampling error, but now we can conclude that cows prefer food C.

6
00:00:27,025 --> 00:00:31,953
Before we move on from Tukey's HSD, note that we can only compute this when the

7
00:00:31,953 --> 00:00:37,873
sample sizes are all the same, in this case they were all 3.
