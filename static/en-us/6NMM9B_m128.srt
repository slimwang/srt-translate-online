1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
No surprise in the implementation.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:09,000
We're subtracting step size times velocity times the estimate of the derivative

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and that estimate stems from our central-difference formula.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
In the residing diagram, you see that overall you achieved the right effect,

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
the sine curve is being shifted, but we definitely need to take care of the boundary--

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
at least when our signal reaches the boundary.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
And let's try an experiment, I'm inserting the number 30 here,

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:36,000
meaning that I want to start off with 30 periods of the sine--not the single period of the sine.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
And to make the image less clutter, let's use the number of 500 down here.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
This is the result that we get--we can see the artifacts at the boundaries, which we already know,

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
which we already know, but there's a second phenomenon.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
We can see that the amplitude is slightly growing.

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
We're growing from the blue curve to the green curve. So this looks unstable.

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
The higher the frequency that we fit in, the more unstable this becomes.

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
This is why I start with the sine wave and not with some rectangular function.

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
The good thing is if we combine this way of shifting the function with diffusion,

17
00:01:09,000 --> 99:59:59,999
diffusion washes out the high frequencies and saves us from instability
