00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,932
Back at the beginning of the course, we worked a lot with exponents. So, if you

2
00:00:03,932 --> 00:00:08,718
remember that well, then great. But if not, let's look at a certain pattern. We

3
00:00:08,718 --> 00:00:13,158
know that 2 to the 2nd power is four, and we know that 2 to the 1st power is 2,

4
00:00:13,158 --> 00:00:19,459
2 to the 0 is 1. So, every time we decrease our exponent by 1, we're halving

5
00:00:19,459 --> 00:00:24,527
the numbers over here. So, if we need to halve 1, to get 1 half, which is what

6
00:00:24,527 --> 00:00:30,235
we're looking for, then we need to decrease this exponent one more time. So

7
00:00:30,235 --> 00:00:34,801
that means that 1 half should be equal to 2 to the negative 1. That means we

8
00:00:34,801 --> 00:00:40,272
can write log base 2 of 1 half as log base 2 of 2 to the negative 1. That just

9
00:00:40,272 --> 00:00:41,373
gives us negative 1.
