1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The answer is, yes, there is.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
There's a variety of possibilities.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I'll show you a somewhat complex one.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
This one says we can look at the table and look at the chair.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Then if the color of the table and the color of the chair is the same, c,

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
then do nothing. We're done. We don't have to do any painting.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Otherwise, we can remove the lids from can one and look at it,

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
remove the lid from can two and look at it.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
If the color of the table is the same as the color of the can,

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
then we can paint the chair with that can.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
This is for any possible can, either can one or can two.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Otherwise, if the color of the chair and the color of the can match,

13
00:00:48,000 --> 99:59:59,999
then we can paint the table, and otherwise we have to paint both of them.
