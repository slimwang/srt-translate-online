1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,469
Recall our overall template for

2
00:00:02,469 --> 00:00:05,610
a merge sort on a two level
memory hierarchy machine.

3
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:09,190
Phase 1 has two parts,
partitioning the input into chunks, and

4
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:10,780
then sorting each chunk.

5
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:14,570
Phase 1 produces a bunch
of sorted chunks, or runs.

6
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:17,970
The goal of Phase 2 is then
to merge all of these runs.

7
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:22,170
Now suppose you implement phase two
using the the two way merging scheme.

8
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:26,840
What then become the overall asymptotic
costs of the entire merge sort.

9
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:28,940
I want you to give
symbolic answers here and

10
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:32,740
here for the number of comparisons and
the number of transfers respectively.

11
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:36,300
Express your answer symbolically
in terms of n, z, and L.

12
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,440
As usual, you can assume that
things always divide evenly, and

13
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,700
they're convenient powers of two, etc.,
etc., so your answer isn't too messy.
