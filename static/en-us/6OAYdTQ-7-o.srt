1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:01,670
Maybe this is not a great example.

2
00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:06,460
But I want to say if we were in the
situation, what would we we actually do?

3
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:11,260
I mean if it really is kind, if we're
doing don't boost reach for example.

4
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:13,920
What would you do to encourage me to

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,820
maybe participate in
the other nash equilibrium?

6
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:18,190
>> I guess I would just state
that's what we're going to do and

7
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:19,210
you have no reason not to do it.

8
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:21,350
>> Yeah but I'd be like I have
no reason to do it either.

9
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:22,130
>> This is true, but

10
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:25,470
since all the utilities are inside
the Matrix, might as well just do it.

11
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:26,224
>> I might as well not do it.

12
00:00:26,224 --> 00:00:26,978
>> Well, you gotta do something.

13
00:00:26,978 --> 00:00:28,382
>> Well, I'm going to don't boost.

14
00:00:28,382 --> 00:00:29,256
>> But why?
They're both the same.

15
00:00:29,256 --> 00:00:31,270
They're both 0.

16
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:34,130
I thought you wanted to make me happy?

17
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:35,150
>> That's not game theory.

18
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:37,260
Me making you happy is not game theory.

19
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,540
Game theory is about utilities.

20
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:43,190
So is there anything that you could
do to change the utility for me?

21
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:43,710
>> Sure.

22
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:44,760
I could offer you a banana.

23
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:45,870
>> Aha!

24
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:46,710
Could share.

25
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:50,550
Yes, and so the essence of what happens
in Cocoa Values is that we're going to

26
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,390
talk about making side payments.

27
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:57,220
So the punch line is going to be we're
going to do this thing that actually

28
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:58,580
benefits us mutually.

29
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:01,720
Like the sum of the payoffs is maximal.

30
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:04,970
And then we're going to
dispense the spoils.

31
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:06,740
Right, we're going to get
as many bananas as we can.

32
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:10,962
And then give them out in
a way that's fair sort of.

33
00:01:10,962 --> 00:01:13,330
A priori might not be so
obvious what would be fair.

34
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:15,600
Like maybe I would say I'd hold out for

35
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,172
no I'm not going to give you boost
unless you give me three of the bananas.

36
00:01:18,172 --> 00:01:19,540
You can keep just one.

37
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:22,110
But it's going to turn out
in this particular case that

38
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:24,470
one banana payment
actually is justifiable.

39
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:25,880
>> That's cool because
that's what I was thinking.

40
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:28,678
I was thinking,
look man I'll give you one banana.

41
00:01:28,678 --> 00:01:32,010
>> [LAUGH]
>> Now what if this was forty?

42
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:34,960
Would you still feel like
one banana would suffice.

43
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:35,720
>> For me?
Yeah.

44
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,710
>> But for
me to act to actually give you a boost?

45
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,800
>> I guess you would expect more.

46
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,080
>> Maybe more.

47
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:45,026
>> So I don't know that I
really thought this through.

48
00:01:45,026 --> 00:01:49,560
But if, when the number was four like
look I can get two if I want to.

49
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:53,320
So, really this is about why
don't we split the extra benefit?

50
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,000
>> There, nice nice.

51
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,590
Okay and
that is a really powerful intuition for

52
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:58,880
understanding how these things go.

53
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:59,380
>> Okay.
