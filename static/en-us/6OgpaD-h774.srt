1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,690
The thing that makes
this mean shift tracking

2
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:06,120
is essentially what the model is and
how we compare them.

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:09,310
So, we've got this initial
area that we want to track and

4
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:12,780
we have to choose what
the model is going to be.

5
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:16,660
And in mean shift what we do is
we choose a feature space that is

6
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:18,840
the quantized color space.

7
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:23,360
So, what that means is that we

8
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:27,470
carve up the different RGB
values into a histogram.

9
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:29,440
So it's written as a 1D histogram here,
but

10
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,560
it's typically a three
dimensional histogram.

11
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:32,340
R, G and B.

12
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:36,080
You might carve R up into four bins,

13
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:39,240
G up into four bins,
B up into say four bins.

14
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,820
That'd be how many bins together?

15
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:43,718
4 times 4 times 4?

16
00:00:43,718 --> 00:00:44,489
1,000,090, no.
64, okay,

17
00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:48,300
in which case you have a 64 bin
histogram and at every point

18
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:52,100
within that region you take its color
and you put it in the right bin.

19
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:55,970
And that would give you
your probability histogram

20
00:00:55,970 --> 00:01:00,320
which you can think of as a PDF
of the color over that region.

21
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,450
That's the representation of the region
that we're going to try to track.
