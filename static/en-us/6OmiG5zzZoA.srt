00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:01,930
The final type of data we'll talk about is

2
00:00:01,930 --> 00:00:05,070
time series data. Time series data is simply a

3
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:09,600
collection of observations obtained through repeated measurements over time.

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:12,590
In plain English, a time series is simply a sequence

5
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:15,450
of numbers collected at regular intervals over some period

6
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:19,500
of time. For example, we might measure the average number

7
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,600
of home runs per players for many different years.

8
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:26,020
Time series data is not so different from numerical data.

9
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:28,800
The real difference here is that rather then having a

10
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,159
bunch of numerical values which don't have any time ordering,

11
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:35,560
time series data does have some implied ordering. There's a

12
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:38,170
first data point collected and a last data point collected.
