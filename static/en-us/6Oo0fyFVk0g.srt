00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,574
Congratulations, you've made your
first step towards a path in back-end

2
00:00:03,574 --> 00:00:04,220
programming.

3
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:08,753
It's essential for back-end programmers
to understand databases in order to

4
00:00:08,753 --> 00:00:11,335
design, debug and maintain applications.

5
00:00:11,335 --> 00:00:16,074
In this next course, you'll learn about
the basics of SQL, database design,

6
00:00:16,074 --> 00:00:17,135
and Python API for

7
00:00:17,135 --> 00:00:21,254
connecting Python code to a database
by creating a game tournament.

8
00:00:21,254 --> 00:00:23,042
As you dive into back-end programming,

9
00:00:23,042 --> 00:00:25,300
there may be times where
you reach your strain zone.

10
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:29,270
I encourage you to use
the Udacity forums for support.

11
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:32,479
By the end of this course, you should
have a better idea of whether back-end

12
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:33,830
programming is the right fit for you.
