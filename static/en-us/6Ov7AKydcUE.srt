1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:04,460
We said old threats exist,
what about vulnerabilities?

2
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:08,090
So vulnerabilities
could be of many kind.

3
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:13,390
For example, if you use a weak password,
that is a vulnerability.

4
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:17,920
Someone can guess that password and
then be able to use that

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,790
to launch an attack which in this case
would be taking control of your account.

6
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:25,310
If they are able to take
control of your account, well,

7
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:28,300
that is a compromise of your account.

8
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:32,890
If able to do it more broadly to
a system, that's a security breech.

9
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:37,940
So an attack is a successful
exploitation of vulnerability

10
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:42,900
by a threat source, resulting in this
system that has been compromised.

11
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:47,860
Unfortunately whatever it is,
are very hard to get rid of completely.

12
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:52,220
And they can be found in software
that runs on our computer systems,

13
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:56,710
networks, and lot of times
the biggest source of vulnerability

14
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:58,740
people say humans are the weak link.

15
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:03,110
We do things that actually introduced
vulnerability into the systems.

16
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:08,080
So the security mindset starts with
threats then we have to talk with

17
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:12,690
vulnerabilities and exploitation
of those within two attacks and

18
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:16,900
attacks result in compromise and
security breaches.

19
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:19,440
We're going to use
a really simple example.

20
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,330
You can call it a trivial example.

21
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:25,170
To illustrate this idea of
a vulnerability an attack.

22
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:27,200
So many of us ride our bikes.

23
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,910
And of course it's
an important asset to us.

24
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:34,278
It costs money to get one,
it gets you around, so obviously,

25
00:01:34,278 --> 00:01:38,063
it's useful to you, so,
it's the valuable asset.

26
00:01:38,063 --> 00:01:41,301
There are threats against it,
people steal bikes.

27
00:01:41,301 --> 00:01:44,258
Let's think about,
if we just leave it anywhere, obviously,

28
00:01:44,258 --> 00:01:46,460
there's a serious vulnerabilities in it.

29
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:49,460
The thief can walk and
take the bike away.

30
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:52,130
So what we normally do, is we lock it.

31
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:53,380
So as you see in this graphic,

32
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:58,450
this person who is security conscious
actually has locked the bike.

33
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:02,462
And they've gone off to class, or
to work, or whatever it is, and

34
00:02:02,462 --> 00:02:06,848
you look at the system and you say well,
are there any vulnerabilities?

35
00:02:06,848 --> 00:02:10,213
Vulnerabilities, some we
may actually know about,

36
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:12,467
others many not even know about it.

37
00:02:12,467 --> 00:02:15,113
It's the threat actor who
actually discovers it.

38
00:02:15,113 --> 00:02:17,940
And in cyber security
we call them zero day.

39
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:21,879
The thief actually is not going
to fight the security that you

40
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:24,438
have in place here, which is the lock.

41
00:02:24,438 --> 00:02:26,606
And certainly what it is going to do is,

42
00:02:26,606 --> 00:02:29,581
it is going to walk away with
the bike minus the wheel.

43
00:02:29,581 --> 00:02:34,457
So vulnerability here was that this
asset that we have here the bike.

44
00:02:34,457 --> 00:02:37,300
Of course the people
have to buy a new wheel.

45
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:40,490
But what he or
she is able to walk away with is

46
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:42,370
actually still fairly valuable,
isn't it?

47
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:46,620
It's most of the bike, add a wheel and
you have a functioning bike.

48
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:50,920
So the vulnerability we never
thought was that we had to secure

49
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,620
more then just the wheel, okay.

50
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:56,460
The lock that we put is actually
only protecting the wheel.

51
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:58,770
It's not protecting the entire bike.

52
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:00,700
That's the example of vulnerability.
