00:00:04,541 --> 00:00:09,208
would have been for 1/2 to be in 10ths? And also, I want you to write in your

3
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:13,988
own equivalent fraction for 1/2. You can write any fraction in this box. You

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,495
want to put our answer like 3 slash 4, or 3 divided by 4, 3/4. You can put your

5
00:00:18,507 --> 00:00:22,355
answer in as a number, a slash, and then another number, just make sure that

00:00:22,367 --> 00:00:23,115
