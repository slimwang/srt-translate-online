00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
We're going to modify this rank algorithm that we had before to do what I suggested.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
It's going to return a kind of slightly sorted or less than the one that was given

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
with regard to some value of v.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
There is a lot of ways to do this some are cleaner and more efficient that others.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I'm going to do the way I'm doing it just to be simple.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
This is a very simple idea all we're going to do is we're going to keep track of a list of values

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
that are known to be smaller than v that are in L and the ones that are bigger than v.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
We're going to loop through all the values.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Anytime we encounter one that's smaller than v, we put it in the smaller list.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Every time we find one that's bigger than v, we put it in the bigger list

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
and then we glue them altogether.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
First the smaller then v and the bigger. Now, this sort of plus equals a list construct.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
It's not immediately obvious what the running time of this is in Python.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
In fact, I think its probably not constant time, but you can create a version

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
where each of these steps is constant time so that this entire routine runs in Î¸n

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
because all we're doing is we're touching each of the values in the list to construct a new list

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Let's run this and see what it does. All right. It seems to be done.

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Here is 84, and you'll notice that these are all the elements of the original list.

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
84 is here. Everything to the right of it is bigger than 84.

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Everything to the left of it is smaller than 84. So we partition the list around 84.
