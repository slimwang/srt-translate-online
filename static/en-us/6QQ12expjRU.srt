1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:06,782
So, you might have noticed that x^2 and
6x^2 may be combined to 7x^2.

2
00:00:06,782 --> 00:00:11,549
And for now, we're going to leave the rest
of the expression as it is. So now, the

3
00:00:11,549 --> 00:00:16,904
next thing I noticed with this expression
is that we need to multiply the quantity

4
00:00:16,904 --> 00:00:29,232
x+2 times 7x^2-1.
This gives us 7x^3-x+14x^2-2, and we'll

5
00:00:29,232 --> 00:00:33,933
leave the rest of the expression the same.
So, our next step is to distribute

6
00:00:33,933 --> 00:00:39,822
the 4 with everything inside the
parenthesis. When we do this, inside the

7
00:00:39,834 --> 00:00:51,553
parenthesis, we get 28x^3-4x+56x^2-8 and
we'll leave the rest of the expression the

8
00:00:51,553 --> 00:00:57,512
same for now. So, our next step is to
distribute the -1 in front of the

9
00:00:57,512 --> 00:01:03,533
parenthesis with everything inside and
combine like terms. This gives us our

10
00:01:03,533 --> 00:01:12,609
solution of -28x^3-56x^2+7x+1.
