00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,952
In the last quiz we determined an interval estimate that you're likely to make

2
00:00:04,952 --> 00:00:10,063
with either major. So, in the case of nursing majors, between 50,000 and 60,000

3
00:00:10,063 --> 00:00:15,229
and in the case of geography majors, between 40,000 and 55,000. But ideally, we

4
00:00:15,229 --> 00:00:20,413
want one number that describes the entire data set, this allows us to quickly

5
00:00:20,413 --> 00:00:25,141
summarize all of our data. Here's an analogy. Let's say you're describing

6
00:00:25,141 --> 00:00:29,740
someone to a friend, there are a few words that you could use to describe that

7
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:34,339
someone like, tall, dark and handsome. Sometimes, 3 words will be accurate

8
00:00:34,339 --> 00:00:38,803
descriptions, but let's say you can only choose one, cus you want to quickly

9
00:00:38,803 --> 00:00:43,343
describe this person. Which word would you choose? The same with data, and just

10
00:00:43,343 --> 00:00:47,501
like there are multiple words that could describe a single person, there may be

11
00:00:47,501 --> 00:00:50,454
multiple numbers used to describe the whole data set.
