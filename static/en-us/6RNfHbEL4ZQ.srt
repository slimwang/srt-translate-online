00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:05,662
Okay, now let's say we're interested in a critical region of only 1%. Because

2
00:00:05,662 --> 00:00:10,700
we decided that a sample mean with probability less than 0.01, will be

3
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:15,383
considered unlikely. So what z score marks this cutoff?
