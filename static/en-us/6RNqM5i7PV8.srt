1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:03,010
Before you can officially
choose an idea for you app,

2
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:06,490
you need to start thinking through
the features you might want to include.

3
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:07,770
But, how do you do that?

4
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:10,770
Consider the following questions.

5
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:12,900
Does your app have competitors?

6
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:13,770
What features do they use?

7
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,370
What about your users, who are they?

8
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:18,930
Why don't you ask them what they want?

9
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:24,670
And lastly, what are some features on
unrelated apps that you really love?

10
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:25,860
Do they have a place in your app?

11
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:29,550
Compile a list of features to include.

12
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:31,430
Don't worry about being
selective at this point.

13
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:35,280
Just jot down anything that you
might want to add to the app.

14
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,370
You'll refine it later, and then check
this box when you're ready to continue.
