1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,469
So now how do we generate the video
textures of the dynamic regions?

2
00:00:03,469 --> 00:00:07,070
Again, those pixels that were just
the dynamic parts of the image

3
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:10,470
are the ones now we're going
to figure out how to basically

4
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:12,040
convert them into video textures.

5
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:15,080
So just to kind of start
thinking about it,

6
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:18,680
I'm now laying out this whole thing and
I'm basically kind of saying is,

7
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:21,690
this is the y axis, and
this is x and this is time.

8
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:23,680
So basically now we're
going to stack each and

9
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,460
every of these images in time and
just show the X and t.

10
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,790
So as time evolves, of course, we're
getting more and more of these frames.

11
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:34,840
So in this case, I'm basically kind of
saying is, this is one frame, second

12
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:38,620
frame, third frame and all of them kind
of create this video volume, right?

13
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:40,880
Let's think about it
a little differently.

14
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:43,450
And that basically
suggests is let's actually

15
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:46,180
only concentrate on the dynamic regions.

16
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:49,360
So here, this part of the frame,
not the whole frame,

17
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,120
this is the only part of the frame
where there is some dynamic.

18
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:55,160
And again as I go down in time,
there other frames come in.

19
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:59,930
Remember again, this is similar to
the whole part that we looked at before

20
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:03,010
which said that if I
had an image like this,

21
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:06,770
there's only a part of this
image where the dynamics is.

22
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:09,650
So, in essence that basically
means if this is my X,

23
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:13,890
I'm going to be only looking for small
parts in that image, not the whole part.

24
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:16,570
And in this case I'm basically
kind of suggesting for each and

25
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:18,550
every image in the region.

26
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:22,680
Only a part of it is the one that
is where the dynamics is, and

27
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,160
as I move further into time,
this part may have moved here.

28
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,620
And that's where I have other frames.

29
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:28,670
So, in essence,

30
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:32,270
this is the only part of the dynamics
that I actually want to model.

31
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:34,680
So how do we use that information?

32
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:39,450
Well, for example, what we can now start
doing is build video textures just for

33
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:41,060
those small regions.

34
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:44,020
So in essence what that basically means,
this is where the video texture is,

35
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:46,120
I don't actually have to do it for
the whole part of it.

36
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:51,170
I can find a sub part of this region and
use that to generate a video texture.

37
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:54,990
So the video volume in this instance
would simply be in time, in,

38
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:59,610
in the local coordinate X,
simply a part like this.

39
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:01,810
So this would be my small video region,
and again,

40
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:04,250
I have well defined slits here.

41
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:08,008
So this allows me to create now
a smoother transition from each and

42
00:02:08,008 --> 00:02:10,060
every one of the frames and
generate a nicer,

43
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:13,560
smoother video volume to
represent this region here.

44
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,100
So, in this case what it basically
says we're going to map the continuous

45
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:21,230
diagonal slice of the input video
volume to the output panorama.

46
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:23,860
That's what we actually will do,
in outputting

47
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:28,260
the video textures onto panorama, again
in that region where the dynamics are.

48
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:32,500
Of course, in this case we will restrict
the boundaries to each and every frame.

49
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:35,610
So each and every frame basically is
kind of looking at just that frame and

50
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:37,760
you're going to find
a match the next frame.

51
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,810
And the problem with this is,
while it works fine,

52
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:44,230
actually creates some sort of
shearing motions across time.

53
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:47,289
Now remember we actually had these
issues when we talked about video

54
00:02:47,289 --> 00:02:50,455
textures too, and we basically said,
match one frame to the other and

55
00:02:50,455 --> 00:02:53,137
of course, either you'll get
a little bit of blurriness,

56
00:02:53,137 --> 00:02:54,717
because it has not the best match.

57
00:02:54,717 --> 00:02:57,431
Or you might actually
see unnecessary motions

58
00:02:57,431 --> 00:03:01,610
that are impacted because how things are
matching from one frame to the other.

59
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:02,830
What does that mean?

60
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:04,275
Well, let's look at that example.

61
00:03:04,275 --> 00:03:06,765
This is my original video frame or
sequence,

62
00:03:06,765 --> 00:03:10,564
just from the part from the water
flow is happening and approximately

63
00:03:10,564 --> 00:03:15,700
the same region, where we basically are
now doing a continuous diagonal slices.

64
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:18,641
So here's my original video,
you kind of see nicer motion, and

65
00:03:18,641 --> 00:03:21,977
here you basically see a little bit
of you know, shearing going on.

66
00:03:21,977 --> 00:03:25,567
Motion is not the most cleanest, and in
fact, basically its the first frame, and

67
00:03:25,567 --> 00:03:28,847
it actually generates it, because it's
not actually doing a very good job

68
00:03:28,847 --> 00:03:32,460
ungenerating the video volume, it's
actually keeping the boundaries stable.
