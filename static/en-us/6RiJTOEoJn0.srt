1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,740
In this particular question we're
saying Alice had SELECT access.

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:06,860
So, someone has,
if it's centrally done, admin or

3
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:10,570
whoever's responsible for
controlling access to various databases,

4
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:13,930
has given SELECT access
to Alice to a table.

5
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:17,140
And she can propagate
this access to Bob.

6
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:20,490
So Alice wants to share the data

7
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:24,680
she can pull out of the database
through the SELECT operation with Bob.

8
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:25,940
When can she do that?

9
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:27,500
There are two options here.

10
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:31,720
So you choose the one that you think
would allow Alice to propagate

11
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:33,980
this access rights she has to Bob.
