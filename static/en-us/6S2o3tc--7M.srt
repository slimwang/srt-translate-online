1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:01,980
Remember this crazy site?

2
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:06,120
For this quiz, you're going to be
improving its performance a little bit.

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:09,340
I've hit the Animate button to
start what could only be described

4
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,560
as somebody's spiral from
their worst nightmare.

5
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:14,090
There's something about
the Aren't I lovely?

6
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:16,178
part that makes it especially creepy.

7
00:00:16,178 --> 00:00:18,910
In dev tools, I've hit the Show
paint rectangles button and

8
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:22,250
you can see that the entire page
is flashing green for every frame.

9
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:24,740
What you're seeing here is
really inefficient, so for

10
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:29,150
this quiz promote the box class
elements using will-change transform so

11
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:31,480
that they get isolated
to their own layers.

12
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,900
You could also hit the transform
button back on the site,

13
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:36,270
which uses a 3D transform.

14
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:39,240
And once you've used will-change
transform to let the browser know that

15
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,290
the box elements
are going to be changing,

16
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:43,475
you'll see a code appear on the screen.

17
00:00:43,475 --> 00:00:45,050
Type that code into
this box to continue.
