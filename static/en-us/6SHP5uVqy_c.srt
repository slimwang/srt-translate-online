Hey Magnus, I was looking for you.

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:04,760
>> Hi Jocelyn,
how's your app coming along?

3
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:05,980
>> It's doing okay but

4
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:09,330
I want to run adds in it and
I don't know how to do that.

5
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:11,570
>> Have you come to the right person.

6
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:14,120
I just finished a course on ad mob.

7
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:16,050
>> Cool and how's your app doing?

8
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:18,170
It's been out in the play store for
a while now hasn't it?

9
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:21,250
>> It's doing great,
tons of people have downloaded it.

10
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:23,138
>> And what parts of your
app do they use the most?

11
00:00:23,138 --> 00:00:25,930
>> I don't know.

12
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:29,480
>> Do they use it more on phones or
tablets, Android TV?

13
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,070
>> I don't know.

14
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:34,490
>> Do they use it more in Africa,
America, Iceland, Australia-

15
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:35,450
>> Stop, stop, stop.

16
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:37,690
How am I supposed to know
the answer to all these questions?

17
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:39,500
>> You could use Google Analytics.

18
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:40,840
>> Google what?

19
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,340
I don't how to use that.

20
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:43,620
>> Have I got a deal for you.

21
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:46,630
I'll teach you how to
use Google Analytics

22
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:48,840
if you'll teach me how
to run ads in my app.

23
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,730
>> That sounds like a great idea.

24
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:51,840
>> Let's get started.
