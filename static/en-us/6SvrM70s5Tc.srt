1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:04,330
This project is in the same
state as we left off last time.

2
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:06,970
There's a Bricks A Bunch store and
a Lots O Brick store.

3
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:09,280
And both of them get their
data from a service.

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,870
What you need to do is add
a cart feature that will list

5
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:13,440
everything in the cart.

6
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,530
There won't be anything in
the cart by default, so

7
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:19,490
you'll also need to add a button to the
Lego brick items that lets a customer

8
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:21,710
add the brick to the cart.

9
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:24,210
Here's the specific information
that you need to follow,

10
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:27,030
the link to the starter code for
this project is in the instructor notes.

11
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:29,760
When you've finished the feedback
extension will give you a code.

12
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,600
Enter that code on the next page.

13
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,080
Ember uses the queue unit
testing framework and

14
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:36,910
I've created a number of tests
that you need to satisfy.

15
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:39,740
These tests help guide you through
completing the assignment.

16
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:43,245
Once all the tests have passed the
feedback extension will give you a code.

17
00:00:43,245 --> 00:00:44,990
Enter that code on the next page,

18
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:47,890
you can find a link to this project's
test page in the project's read me file.
