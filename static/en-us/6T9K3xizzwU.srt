00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,262
Now I'm going to talk about Tag Manager.

2
00:00:02,262 --> 00:00:05,014
I'll be covering two
main uses of Tag Manager.

3
00:00:05,014 --> 00:00:09,343
First, I'll talk about how to use it
to send dynamic configuration data to

4
00:00:09,343 --> 00:00:10,580
your app.

5
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:14,340
For example, if your app's a game,
you could offer different challenges for

6
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:18,960
different levels, depending on
the attack strength the player has left.

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,380
If you ran a shopping app,

8
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:24,080
you could use Tag Manager to
change the daily discount offer.

9
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,965
The second use of Tag Manager relates
to organizing and managing tags.

10
00:00:27,965 --> 00:00:32,549
A tag is a fragment of code that
performs some kind of tracking function.

11
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:33,908
In the previous lesson,

12
00:00:33,908 --> 00:00:38,540
you added tags to your app to send
tracking data to Google Analytics.

13
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:40,830
Instead of sending data
directly to Google Analytics,

14
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:45,790
you could send it to Tag Manager, which
can then send it on to Google Analytics.

15
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:49,727
It's easy to change the way the data
is reported to Google Analytics using

16
00:00:49,727 --> 00:00:53,234
the Tag Manager dashboard,
without having to change your code.

17
00:00:53,234 --> 00:00:57,029
And Tag Manager helps you visualize and
organize your tags.

18
00:00:57,029 --> 00:01:00,733
You'll learn how to create tags to
forward hit data from your app to

19
00:01:00,733 --> 00:01:03,450
Google Analytics in the next lesson.

20
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:04,629
In this lesson,

21
00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:08,450
you'll learn how to use Tag Manager to
dynamically update values in your app.
