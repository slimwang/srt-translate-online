00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,354
So let's start off really simple. Let's try creating a table to help us out. If

2
00:00:04,366 --> 00:00:08,561
I started with two dimes, then I'd have to have three quarters. For ever two

3
00:00:08,573 --> 00:00:13,367
dimes there's three quarters, so five coins in total. If I add two more dimes,

4
00:00:13,465 --> 00:00:17,502
then I have to add three more quarters. So I'd get ten coins in total. The

5
00:00:17,514 --> 00:00:21,817
ration is a way of representing this constant increase. For every increase of

6
00:00:21,829 --> 00:00:26,836
two in dimes I increase, and three in quarters. I could also have 6 dimes and 9

7
00:00:26,848 --> 00:00:31,331
quarters, which is 15 coins in total. But I don't know which case I'm in. I

8
00:00:31,343 --> 00:00:36,203
could have had any number of coins. So, it's actually impossible to know. And in

9
00:00:36,215 --> 00:00:41,083
fact, I had 10 coins in my hand. For every two dimes, I have three quarters. Two

10
00:00:41,095 --> 00:00:45,762
more dimes, three more quarters. This ratio is constant. I know that last

11
00:00:45,774 --> 00:00:50,371
question wasn't obvious, so don't worry if you didn't get it right. I just

12
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:52,823
wanted to get you thinking about ratios.
