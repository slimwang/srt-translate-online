1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
All right. Let's go take a look at the big reveal,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
for how it actually started.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Up here is our string; we start at characters zero, on line 1, with ' This '.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
1, 2, 3, 4, 5--now we're on line 1, character 5, with the ' is '.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,000
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11--we're on line 2, character 11,

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
and we're starting the Left Angle, then the ' b ',

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
then the Right Angle, then the ' webpage '.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
And to reverse engineer this, you might note--for example--

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
that you know the Left Angle is 1 character.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
If it starts on character 11, and the ' b ' comes right after it on character 12,

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
there must be no spaces between them.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Similarly, since the ' b ' is 1 character and it starts on character 12,

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
the RANGLE, there must be no spaces between the ' b ' and the RANGLE.

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
So the real trick here is figuring out what happens

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
after the "is" and before the ' b ',

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
and knowing that you need these 3 extra spaces

17
00:00:56,000 --> 99:59:59,999
ao all the action's happening here.
