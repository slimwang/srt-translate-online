1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,980
I think any founder who ultimately
plans to sell something to somebody

2
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:07,200
should be thinking about their
modernization strategy from day one.

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,140
The reason is not,
because the early revenue, I think makes

4
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:13,490
a meaningful difference for your
business from a cash flow perspective.

5
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:18,190
But because acquiring revenue is the
ultimate form of customer validation.

6
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:20,540
It's pretty easy as
an entrepreneur to go out and

7
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:22,600
find somebody to tell you
that you have a cool idea.

8
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,400
The difficult part is getting
them to open their wallet.

9
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,460
So from that perspective,
I see it as a really,

10
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:32,729
really great tool in
understanding your customer and

11
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:35,190
understanding that you've found
something that people want.
