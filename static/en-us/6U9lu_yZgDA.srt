1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:04,270
I've created a JSON file with data for
each of the menu items.

2
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:06,350
These files are in the instructor notes.

3
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:10,900
The process to get a menu item's data is
almost exactly the same as what we just

4
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:11,816
did with menu.

5
00:00:11,816 --> 00:00:17,036
When the URL is item/ some item name,
Ember calls the item route.

6
00:00:17,036 --> 00:00:20,255
Again, we use the model
hook to fetch the data.

7
00:00:20,255 --> 00:00:22,965
But how will Ember
know which item to get?

8
00:00:22,965 --> 00:00:26,385
The item will be stored in item_name.

9
00:00:26,385 --> 00:00:28,680
The model hook is passed
a params object and

10
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,350
we can get the item name
off of that object.

11
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:33,580
Now let's update the item template.

12
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:37,400
Just like updating the menu template,
we need to replace the static info

13
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,230
with the dynamic data
provided by the JSON file.

14
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:43,410
Remember that the data returned from
the model hook is stored in a model

15
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:43,910
variable.

16
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:48,480
And now we can finally
see the other menu items.

17
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,880
Awesome.

18
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:52,650
Have you noticed that clicking back and
forth, though, shows us a blank page for

19
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:53,760
a few seconds?

20
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,020
Let's fix that.

21
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:58,650
The problem is that we're using
an anchor tag to link to specific URLs

22
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:01,890
instead of letting Ember
manage the URLs for us.

23
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:04,599
Ember provides us a template
helper called link-to.

24
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:08,670
The link-to helper needs to know
which route it should link to.

25
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:11,070
We want this link to
link to the item route.

26
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:13,040
So item should go here.

27
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,290
The item route needs to have an item, so

28
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:17,880
we need to give one to
the link-to helper.

29
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:21,050
One thing that would trip me up in the
beginning is that this one needs quotes,

30
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:23,970
but this one doesn't, since it's
using the local item variable.

31
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:27,360
Using link-to with nested
routes is very similar.

32
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:31,530
Because the nutrition route
is nested inside item,

33
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:36,290
the route we need to reference in
the link-to helper is item.nutrition.

34
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:40,070
We don't need to worry about which item
to use, because to display the nutrition

35
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:43,120
template, we'll already
be on this item page.

36
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,670
Ember knows that and
handles that for us.

37
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:47,700
For more information
on the link-to helper,

38
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:48,890
check the link in the instructor notes.

39
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:53,010
Now there are no page refreshes and
all transitions are smooth and

40
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:54,460
instantaneous.

41
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:56,720
And what's cool is that the back
button works with all of this too.
