1
00:00:00,315 --> 00:00:05,090
And that was what the ordered
part of our specification for

2
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:06,970
sort was all about.

3
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:10,840
Now let's look at the second part which
had to do with whether the elements

4
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:15,060
were the same in the output
as they were in the input.

5
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:19,330
So we're going to begin the same way
we did before and I'd like you, Jared,

6
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:21,300
see if you can state in
English what it means for

7
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,610
two vectors X and
Y to have the same elements.

8
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:28,700
And we're going to call this function
that we're defining same elements as.

9
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:30,410
>> Okay.

10
00:00:31,558 --> 00:00:33,660
Do we need to start by
writing a signature and

11
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,230
going through this whole process.

12
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:37,860
>> That's the process, yes.

13
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:41,190
>> So for this function,
we will take two vectors.

14
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:42,520
A vector X.

15
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,240
Oh, before I forget.

16
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:45,040
>> Go ahead.

17
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:46,300
>> Okay.
>> And finish what you got.

18
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:47,170
>> All right.

19
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:50,030
I've noticed the flaw, but
we will be taking two vectors.

20
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:54,200
We'll take a vector X and a vector Y,
and a comparison will happen.

21
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,980
We can assume, and it will return a
boolean value representing whether they

22
00:00:57,980 --> 00:00:59,880
have the same elements or not.

23
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,225
>> And
what did you label your boolean result?

24
00:01:02,225 --> 00:01:05,850
>> As Y, which is the same,
we've already assigned that.

25
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:11,004
>> Okay, so obviously,
this is actually a legitimate signature,

26
00:01:11,004 --> 00:01:14,480
well, I shouldn't say it's legitimate.

27
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:17,830
It's a syntactically correct signature,
but it's not meaningful because we're

28
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:21,035
using the same value,
the same letter in two different places.

29
00:01:21,035 --> 00:01:23,150
>> Mm-hm.
>> So, as I said before,

30
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:26,800
the actual letter that we use
doesn't make any difference,

31
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,320
as long as we consistently use it.

32
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,530
So we could say here,
bool Y, we could say bool Z.

33
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:36,440
As long as it's different than
those input names that we used.
