00:00:00,202 --> 00:00:04,470
This makeGreyScale function is fairly similar to what we did before.

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:09,330
After retrieving the data from the imageData object, we call makePixelGrayScale

3
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:13,370
on it, and then we store that information back into imageData.

4
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:17,200
I used a slightly more optimized formula to calculate the grayscale

5
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,000
of the pixel.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,990
It takes 30% of the red value, 59% of the green value and 11% of the blue value.

7
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:27,530
So when we go over here and

8
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:31,630
refresh our page, we'll see that it's gone to a grayscale.

9
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:34,360
There's some interesting science that explains how and

10
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,760
why we perceive color the way we do.

11
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:40,820
See the instructor's notes for links if you'd like to learn more about it and

12
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:44,610
also for a link to the image that we used in this example.
