1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
That's amazing--even though there is not a fixed dollar price per square foot,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
the relationship is linear.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Here is a a really challenging question.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:16,000
In this data, the prize is linear in the size plus or minus a constant dollar amount.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Can you fill in those values?

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I should say this is a nontrivial question,

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and I don't expect you to get this right, but it's a wonderful, wonderful preview

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
of what I'll teach you to do in this class very automatically using really amazing

9
00:00:31,000 --> 99:59:59,999
pieces of statistics.
