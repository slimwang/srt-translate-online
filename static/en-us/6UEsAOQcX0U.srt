1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:03,770
So these were the accurate reasons
I highlights for using a provider.

2
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:07,970
One, it allows us to easily
share data with other apps.

3
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:14,310
Two, it acts as a good abstraction
layer between our data source and

4
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:17,700
our UI helping us with data
validation if we need it.

5
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:22,090
And lastly,
content providers work well with

6
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:27,210
other Android framework classes such
as cursor loaders, and sync adapters.

7
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:29,200
So we'll be seeing a lot
more of this later on.
