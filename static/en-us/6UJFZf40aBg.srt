1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Now I have a really challenging piece of software for you.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I would like you to augment this to print something entirely different,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
which is the final solution.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
This is nothing to do with expand,

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and you have to implement a new delta structure for this similar to expand.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Here is the output I would like to see.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
There is an arrow to the right, which is the optimal action to take in this cell over here.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Again, this is ambiguous.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
There might be a different optimal action that is equally good,

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
but my software picked the one to the right.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Here I want to go down.

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
This little v over here is an arrow down.

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
An arrow to the right again, an arrow to the right, an arrow to the right,

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
an arrow to the right, down, down, down.

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
In the end we find a star, which indicates the location of the goal.

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Let me modify the maze.

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm closing up the wall over here, opening the wall down here, run it.

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Here is my policy.

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
You can see in the grid this is the only way to make it to the grid over here.

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
You should write for me a piece of software that outputs this specific thing over here.

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Part of this is the delta name that I kind of brushed over before.

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
These four symbols over here are the ones being used

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
to indicate arrows to the top, left, down, and right.

24
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
They correspond to the four actions over here: go up, left, down, and right.

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
So use those over here to print out the table over here.

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
It's very, very nontrivial to write this, as you will find out.

27
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
In the end it's not much code, but you have to carefully think about how to cache actions

28
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
and how to assign them to this table over here.

29
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
So take a while; do it.

30
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
It's challenging.

31
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
If you fail, not a big deal.

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
You can completely understand how the lecture works and not sure of the code

33
00:01:39,000 --> 99:59:59,999
once you hit the submit button, and you move on.
