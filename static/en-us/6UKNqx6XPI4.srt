00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,490
If the function f(n) is contained in O(g(n)), this means that g(n) grows at least as fast as f(n).

2
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:17,520
Now this might sound a little more complicated that it actually is.

3
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:22,440
Let's use some examples to see how functions outgrow each other.

4
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:28,940
Here I have a graph and is on the x axis and I'm going to draw three functions on this graph.

5
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:36,510
The first function is called f(n), the second function is called g(n), and the third function is called h(n).

6
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:40,280
What I would like you to tell me know is which of the following statements is true.

7
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:57,030
Is f(n) contained in O(g(n))? Is f(n) contained in O(h(n))? Is g(n) contained in O(f(n))?

8
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:18,820
Is g(n) contained in O(h(n))? Is h(n) contained in O(f(n))? Or is h(n) contained in O(g(n))?

9
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:23,110
So more than one of these is true and I would like you to check each one that is true.

10
00:01:23,110 --> 99:59:59,999
So every time that this function here outgrows the other function, I would like you to check this box.
