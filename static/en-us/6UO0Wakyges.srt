1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:02,660
So, let's dig a little deeper into handedness.

2
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:05,130
So, let's review the answers on the quiz. The

3
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:07,180
one here that's correct, I really like this because

4
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:09,360
the touch targets are nice and big and they're

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,960
in a place that's really easy to touch

6
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,120
if you're using a phone with one hand. This

7
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,200
one here, on the right the touch targets are

8
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,890
really tiny so they're going to really hard to press.

9
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:21,510
>> Yeah, on phones you should try and have a 48dp minimum touch target and lots

10
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:23,600
of padding. Yeah, when users are on the

11
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,910
go, it's even harder for them to touch precise

12
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:27,212
little areas like that.

13
00:00:27,212 --> 00:00:31,720
>> Yeah and these other two are not so good because if you look at the placement

14
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:34,360
of these buttons, they're actually in an area of

15
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,770
the screen which is not very easy to touch.

16
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:38,040
>> Just if you don't believe me, just pull out

17
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:41,110
your phone and try and touch those areas, it's not easy.

18
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:44,630
>> So, that brings us to something called the ow zone.

19
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:47,430
>> So here's some interesting statistics, fifty percent

20
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:50,590
of smartphone usage occurs with a single hand.

21
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:51,390
>> So this

22
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:53,200
diagram is really important to keep in mind

23
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,480
when you're building applications for people to use.

24
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,950
>> These red areas are the ones that

25
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:58,930
you should avoid they're called the ow zones.

26
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:03,670
>> What you really want to reach for is this green area, which is the temp zone.

27
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:08,030
>> If you put actions and buttons or any kind of interaction in that area.

28
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:09,620
>> It'll make your application much easier to use

29
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:12,040
with a single hand. So take out your smart phone

30
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:14,030
and see if you can identify where the natural

31
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:16,480
zones are and where the owl zones are for you.

32
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,990
This varies depending on what phone you have and how big your hand is.

33
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:20,510
>> Yeah, exactly.

34
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:24,980
>> And one hand use is not the only way to hold your phone, there's also two

35
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:27,040
handed use. That's kind of like when I'm

36
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,180
sending an IM or a text to somebody, right?

37
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:29,660
>> Yeah, exactly.

38
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:31,370
>> And there's also what's called cradling,

39
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:32,950
which is hold with one hand and point

40
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:36,330
with the other. Yeah, I commonly do that when I'm like when browsing the web.

41
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:38,750
>> Yeah, so handedness and other ogle constraints

42
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:42,220
are all part of thinking about the user.

43
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:45,320
>> And making your application fit in their lives in a way

44
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,760
that they're comfortable performing tasks and

45
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,560
using your applications to achieve those tasks.

46
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,530
>> So, when you're building an application keep

47
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:53,770
the user in mind and make sure to

48
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:56,630
make the appropriate decisions, whether it's handedness or

49
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:59,390
respecting other constraints to deliver a compelling experience.
