1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,500
I used the functions that I wrote
earlier to calculate the same three

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:05,630
metrics that I already looked at,
but this time for

3
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:08,490
both passing and non-passing students.

4
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:11,190
First I used the group data
function to group the data for

5
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:13,720
passing students by account key.

6
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:17,090
And then I did the same for
non-passing students.

7
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:19,295
Next, I summed up the total
minutes visited for

8
00:00:19,295 --> 00:00:22,960
non-passing students, and
described the results.

9
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,980
I also did the same thing for
passing students.

10
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:29,280
I decided to print the data for both
groups of students within the same cell

11
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:32,280
so that it would be easier
to compare the output.

12
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,990
And because of this,
I also added these print statements so

13
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:38,080
that I could differentiate which
output went to which group.

14
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,940
The first thing that I noticed about
this output is that the average time

15
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:42,910
spent in the classroom
is a lot higher for

16
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:45,890
passing students than for
non-passing students.

17
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:49,240
These means correspond to about six and
a half hours in the first week for

18
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:51,690
students who pass, and
two and a half hours for

19
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:54,550
students who don't pass,
which is quite a difference.

20
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:58,370
The standard deviation is also
a lot higher for students who pass.

21
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:01,030
This isn't surprising to me since
the mean is so much higher for

22
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:02,310
passing students.

23
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:03,960
And the more time students are spending,

24
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,530
the easier it is to have a lot
of variation among the times.

25
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:10,510
The minimum is zero for both,
which is as I expected.

26
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:13,600
I wouldn't guess that not visiting the
classroom during the first week makes it

27
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,860
impossible to pass your project.

28
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:18,620
And the maximum amount of time
spent is also a lot higher for

29
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:23,400
passing students, roughly 60 hours
a week compared to 30 hours a week.

30
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,670
Next I ran a very similar
piece of code for

31
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:28,480
the number of lessons
completed in the first week.

32
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:32,490
Again, I saw a much higher mean for
students who passed the first project.

33
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:35,040
I find it interesting that students
who pass are completing on

34
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,740
average two lessons per week,
since I would have guessed

35
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:40,300
that a reasonable pace might
be one lesson per week.

36
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:45,210
However, it is true that a problem set
counts as a lesson within this data,

37
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:48,290
so we might be seeing students
who are completing one lesson and

38
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:49,720
one problem set.

39
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:52,970
The maximum is also higher for students
who pass, although the difference here

40
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:57,020
isn't as dramatic as it was for
total minutes spent in the classroom.

41
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:01,570
And finally, I ran very similar coding
again to examine the has_visited field.

42
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:04,950
In this case, I saw that the minimum and
maximum days visited weren't different

43
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:07,740
between students who passed and
student who didn't pass.

44
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:10,139
They were zero and seven in both cases.

45
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:12,830
That's not really surprising since
there are hard limits on how many

46
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:14,500
days you can spend in your first week.

47
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,590
It has to be at least zero and
at most seven.

48
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,990
The mean again is noticeably higher for
passing students,

49
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:24,235
although possibly not as dramatic as in
the other two cases, at about three and

50
00:02:24,235 --> 00:02:26,030
a third for passing students, and

51
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:29,660
a little less than two days in the first
week for non-passing students.

52
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:32,540
If I had to pick which of these
difference I found most interesting,

53
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:36,070
I would probably pick total number of
minutes visited, since the difference

54
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:39,590
between roughly six and a half hours
in the first week versus two and

55
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:42,380
half hours,
seems like the most striking difference.

56
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:44,160
But this is pretty subjective.
