00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,440
The pressure on address space usage spurred the

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:07,420
adoption of classless interdomain routing or CIDR which

3
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:10,460
was adopted in 1994. The idea is that

4
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:13,880
instead of having fixed network ID and host

5
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:17,200
ID portions of the 32 bits. Instead, we

6
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,450
would simply have an IP address, and what

7
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:21,570
is known as a mask. Where the mask

8
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:25,310
is variable length, and indicates the length of the

9
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:28,590
network ID. So, for example, suppose we have

10
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:34,970
an IP address like 65.14.248.0/22. Well in this

11
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:40,150
case our 32 bits look like so, but this doesn't tell us how long the network id

12
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:42,322
and how long the host ID should be.

13
00:00:42,322 --> 00:00:45,760
The /22 indicates the mask length, which says

14
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,060
that the first 22 bits should represent the

15
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:50,910
network ID. Now the key is that this mask

16
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:53,460
can be variable length. And the mask length

17
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:56,990
no longer depends on the range of IP addresses

18
00:00:56,990 --> 00:01:00,830
that are being used. This allows those allocating IP

19
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:05,150
address ranges, to both allocate a range that's more

20
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:07,450
fitting to the size of the network. And also

21
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:09,580
not have to be constrained about how big the

22
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:12,840
network ID should be depending on where in the

23
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,930
IP address space the prefix is being allocated from.

24
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:21,950
Of course now the complication is that it's possible to have overlapping address

25
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,410
prefixes. For example, 65.14.248.0/24

26
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:33,330
overlaps with 65.14.248.0/22. The red prefix is actually

27
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:37,560
a subset of the black one. So supposing these two entries both show

28
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,630
up in an Internet routing table, what are supposed to do? The solution

29
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:43,810
is actually to forward on what's called the

30
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:47,200
longest prefix match, meaning that if a routing

31
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,580
table has two overlapping entries that it should

32
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:52,030
forward according to the entry that has the

33
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:55,430
longest prefix, or the longest mask length. Intuitively

34
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:58,800
that makes sense. Because the prefix with the

35
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:02,170
longer mask length is more specific than the

36
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:05,160
prefix with the shorter mask, or the larger prefix.
