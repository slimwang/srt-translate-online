00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:01,524
So you introduced your business and

2
00:00:01,524 --> 00:00:03,380
provided some details
about your startup.

3
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:05,500
Now it's time to end by
wrapping everything up.

4
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:09,360
To do this we'll focus on introducing
your founding team, your next steps, and

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,960
the final thought you want
to leave investors with.
