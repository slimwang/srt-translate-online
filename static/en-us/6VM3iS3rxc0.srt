1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,820
So the first statement,
can only infect Microsoft Windows.

2
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:05,780
This is clearly false.

3
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:10,290
The second statement,
can modify hidden and read-only files.

4
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:10,850
This is true.

5
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:17,300
You may ask, how can a malware find a
hidden file or modify a read-only files?

6
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:21,270
If you think about it, a malware can
be inserted into the operating system,

7
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,530
which has the highest privilege.

8
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:28,090
It can find any hidden file on a system,
and it can override any permissions,

9
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:30,010
such as read-only permission.

10
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:33,980
The third statement,
spread only on disks or in email.

11
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:36,090
This is clearly false.

12
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:40,540
The fourth statement,
cannot remain in memory after reboot.

13
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:43,150
This is a somewhat tricky question.

14
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:46,690
If this refers to the particular
instance of the virus,

15
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:48,770
then this statement is true.

16
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:53,090
Because after reboot, the memory
is wiped clean, and start over.

17
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:57,670
On the other hand, although we say that
the particular malware instance is gone,

18
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:59,450
after the system reboots,

19
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:03,340
we should know that if the virus
is part of a operating system,

20
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:08,210
then when the system reboots, the virus
will be loaded into the memory again.

21
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:11,510
So we really have to think about
this statement in a context.

22
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:14,520
The fifth statement,
cannot infect hardware.

23
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:15,950
This is true.

24
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:18,840
But we have to note that by hardware,
we mean,

25
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,570
that hardware that does not have any
software component, such as firmware.

26
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:26,590
The last statement,
can be malicious or benign.

27
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:28,850
Although this may appear
to be subjective,

28
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:31,000
I will say the answer is false.

29
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,010
The reason is that,

30
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:36,920
any malware that gets on your system
without your knowledge or authorization,

31
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:41,110
already violates security policy, and
therefore, it is already malicious.
