00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
What is a game?

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The philosopher Wittgenstein said that there is no single set of necessary

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
and sufficient conditions that define all games.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Rather games have a set of features, and some games share some of them,

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
and other games share others of them.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
It's a complex overlapping set rather than a simple criteria.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Here I've listed six different games and in some cases sets of games

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
like Chess and Go are similar, Robotic Soccer, Poker,

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
hide-and-go-seek played in the real world,

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Cards Solitaire, and Minesweeper, the computer solitaire game.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I want to ask you, for each one, which of these properties they exhibit.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Are they stochastic? Are they partially observable?

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Do they have an unknown environment? Are they adversarial?

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
For each game tell me all that apply.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Let me add that your answers may not be the same as mine,

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
because these very terms are not that precise.

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Sometimes you can analyze a problem in two different ways

18
00:01:07,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and flip from one of these attributes to another, depending on how you analyze it.
