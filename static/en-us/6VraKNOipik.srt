1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:04,520
So here's if we were doing a homography, here would be our RANSAC loop.

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:07,810
Select four feature pairs at random.

3
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:11,470
Compute the homography H, that's the thing that moves it from one to the other.

4
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:18,020
And then, what this means is, take a look at the square distance between, some

5
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:24,550
point in the image, transformed by H, and it lands someplace, and take a look

6
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:30,270
at its distance from what it claimed was the putative match in the other image.

7
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:34,422
And count all the ones that are less than some threshold, just do that loop for

8
00:00:34,422 --> 00:00:38,150
a while, and then you keep the one with the largest set of inliers.

9
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:40,900
You then compute, we don't use the old H,

10
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:44,860
you compute the least squares, the best H for

11
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:49,770
that set of inliers and that'll be a much more robust estimate of the transform.
