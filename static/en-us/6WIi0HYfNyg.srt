00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:04,705
Getting back to our analysis of the variability between samples by looking at

2
00:00:04,705 --> 00:00:09,241
their means and comparing it to the grand mean, what conclusions can we draw

3
00:00:09,241 --> 00:00:16,760
after we find these deviations? The greater the distance between sample means,

4
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:21,083
the less likely population means will differ significantly. Or is it the

5
00:00:21,083 --> 00:00:27,380
opposite? The smaller the distance between sample means, the less likely

6
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:33,090
population means will differ significantly.
