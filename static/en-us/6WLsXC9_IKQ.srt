1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,460
So as we said, understanding these 3 components of value proposition

2
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:10,910
work together with understanding the 3 components of customer segments.

3
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:16,129
And in value proposition, the goal of this is to find out that minimum viable product.

4
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:20,450
And in customer segments, the goal is to understand in detail

5
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:22,920
the customer archetype or persona.

6
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,670
And again, this equals product market fit.

7
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:31,400
I can't emphasize enough that the business model canvas is just a start.

8
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:34,860
It's great to strategize and think about who customer segments are

9
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:36,930
and value proposition and channel,

10
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:40,820
but remember all you're doing is writing down hypotheses.

11
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:44,810
Your job is to turn those hypotheses into facts.

12
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:47,800
And there are no facts inside your building.

13
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:53,720
So your job is to get outside and test them personally in a physical channel

14
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,880
by talking to hundreds of customers;

15
00:00:55,880 --> 00:01:01,590
in a Web and mobile channel by talking to thousands virtually and some portion physically.

16
00:01:01,590 --> 99:59:59,999
You need to watch people's pupils dilate when they actually see and like your product.
