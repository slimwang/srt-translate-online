00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
This is what the HTML code of bugzilla.mozilla.org looks like.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
It actually is almost 900 line of HTML,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
so you feed this into the Mozilla browser, select print, and it crashes. But why?

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
In the early days of Mozilla, problem reports such as this one and failures such as this one

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
came in quicker than Mozilla programmers could possibly simplify them or even look at them.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
But then the Mozilla product managers had a clever idea.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
They started the Mozilla Bugathon,

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
which meant that volunteers would go and simplify test cases.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
This was a very simply process.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
What you needed is a text editor such as this one,

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
and then you would go and remove parts of the HTML page,

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
say this, for instance, run this through Mozilla,

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
and see whether the failure still persists.

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
And again, remove some part of the input and see whether the failure still persists,

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
again and again and again,

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
and you repeat this until you have a page left, a small page, in which everything

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
is relevant for reproducing the failure.

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
If you do this and keep on removing one part after the other,

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
then all of a sudden you end up in a situation where the failure no longer occurs.

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
After you remove some part the failure no longer occurs, what do you do next:

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
do you put the part you just removed back in

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
and try to remove other parts,

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,159
or do you keep only the part that you just removed and remove everything else,

24
00:01:26,162 --> 00:01:30,883
or you keep on removing until the failure occurs again? Over to you.
