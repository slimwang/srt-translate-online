1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,910
I'm here with Jacques, our lead front end engineer.

2
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:04,120
Hi. >> Hi.

3
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:06,520
>> So, documentation.

4
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:07,340
Love it?

5
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:07,990
Hate it?

6
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:09,159
>> You really need it.

7
00:00:09,159 --> 00:00:10,212
>> You really need it?

8
00:00:10,212 --> 00:00:14,350
>> yeah. It's, it's not the best, it's not the most fun thing to write.

9
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:15,850
it's.

10
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,820
The most amazing thing when you start working on a project, and

11
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:21,040
there is documentation.

12
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:22,930
>> So, what about reading documentation?

13
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:27,030
>> Reading documentation is a core thing that engineers do, all the time.

14
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:32,159
>> So, if I were to give you an API, or

15
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:35,720
a piece of software, or something like that, and asked you to work with it,

16
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:38,960
and let's say that I didn't allow you to use documentation.

17
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:41,900
Would your productivity, okay, and

18
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:46,130
also let's say you are 100% productive before.

19
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:48,110
Without documentation where would you be?

20
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:49,358
>> Oh, I would be in the 20% range.

21
00:00:49,358 --> 00:00:49,983
I mean. >> Really?

22
00:00:49,983 --> 00:00:52,113
>> Yeah, we'll coz your going to have to parse, I mean,

23
00:00:52,113 --> 00:00:53,670
it depends on how big the code is.

24
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:54,780
You know, I can sort of read through it and

25
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:57,650
sort of figure out what's, what's going on, if I have access to that,

26
00:00:57,650 --> 00:01:00,475
to that code, if it's not just a black box.

27
00:01:00,475 --> 00:01:03,890
But even then, you know, that means I have to go through and

28
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:07,600
fully understand the inner workings of what someone else has come up with.

29
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,010
And without documentation, that's hard!

30
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:13,250
That's a lot of time spent understanding something that could have

31
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:17,380
been very easily handled with, this hands back this object.

32
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:22,090
>> So, what would you say to students, who are taking our course,

33
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:24,260
who are learning to read documentation?

34
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:27,640
I mean, like, I, I know when I first started programming,

35
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:31,770
I had a huge resistance to reading documentation, and furthermore,

36
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:35,180
I felt like it reflected negatively about me as a programmer.

37
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:36,980
Like, I don't already know this?

38
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:41,140
I'm looking up string.split or something like that, which I use all the time.

39
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:42,630
What's wrong with me?

40
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:43,880
>> Absolutely nothing.

41
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:46,950
I mean, it's, it's, programming, you know, we're,

42
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:51,620
we're making, you're taking an idea about what you want it to do, and, you know,

43
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:56,130
what you want your code to do, and turning into reality, right?

44
00:01:56,130 --> 00:02:00,669
And. >> Mm-hm. >> The nitty-gritty of what the fourth argument for

45
00:02:00,669 --> 00:02:06,250
this built-in API is, is not really an important thing, right?

46
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:09,160
You know, and if it's something you use literally all of the time,

47
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,030
it'll eventually get stuck in your head.

48
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:12,960
And until then, just look it up.

49
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,910
It's, there's, it absolutely does not reflect poorly on you.

50
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,350
We look up stuff, all the time.

51
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:25,060
And it's stuff from the most arcane randomness that you can think of,

52
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:28,160
all the way down to, how are we going to split a string.

53
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,860
Right? >> Hm. >> I mean, that, that comes up, and

54
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:31,200
if you don't have it on the top of your head,

55
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,340
if it's faster for you to go look it up than it is to sit there and try and

56
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:38,850
type a bunch of things into the console, and figure it out, go look it up.

57
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:42,210
>> So, it seems almost like it's like writing with English.

58
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:46,318
So, if you're writing a paper, and you are looking up a word, for example, and

59
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:47,949
you look it up again and again and

60
00:02:47,949 --> 00:02:51,112
again, eventually it'll, it'll get stuck in your brain.

61
00:02:51,112 --> 00:02:53,688
But the fact that you don't have it the second in time,

62
00:02:53,688 --> 00:02:56,939
doesn't reflect negatively on you as a human being, or as a writer.

63
00:02:56,939 --> 00:02:58,820
>> No, no, absolutely not.

64
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:02,460
I mean as an engineer, your ability to, to be an engineer, to

65
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:06,480
be an effective engineer, is not that you have everything committed to memory.

66
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,390
If you use something enough, it'll be in there.

67
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:09,970
>> So it's not memorization.

68
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:10,760
>> Absolutely not.

69
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,890
>> It's building with pieces, and then,

70
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:16,108
if you don't remember how to use the pieces or the tools, then you look it up.

71
00:03:16,108 --> 00:03:19,930
>> Exactly, and I mean, if you were to hold up an engineer who knows

72
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:26,050
every little nitty bit about some package, or framework, or whatever, and

73
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:30,460
makes terrible programming decisions, versus somebody makes good programming

74
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:34,190
decisions, and looks everything up, this guy is the guy you want on your team.

75
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:35,140
>> Yeah.

76
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:36,560
Yeah that makes sense.

77
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,485
All right, so, don't be afraid to look things up.

78
00:03:38,485 --> 00:03:39,950
[LAUGH] It's important.

79
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:40,850
>> Absolutely.

80
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:41,522
>> Awesome, thanks Jacques.

81
00:03:41,522 --> 00:03:42,022
>> Mm-hm.
