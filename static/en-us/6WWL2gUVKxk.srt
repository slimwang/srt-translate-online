00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So now coming back to this picture here,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
you see what I meant when I said that hardness of a problem

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
can be measured as both a function of

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
the size of the imput and the structure of the imput,

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
so in the case of the vertex covered, it turns out that

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
what makes solving vertex cover hard

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
is actually the size of the vertex cover itself.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
So if there's a small vertex cover, then the problem is easy

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
and if it's large, then the problem becomes hard.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Now of course, this immediately raises a question for

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
the book of the laws of NP-completeness

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and that question is, is every problem fixed-parameter tractable?

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
That depends, it depends on what you consider as a parameter,

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
and one parameter I will soon introduce to you as well

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
is a parameter called distance from triviality,

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
but unfortunately in general, not every NP-complete problem

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
seems to be fixed-parameter tractable.

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
So for vertex cover, we have just shown

19
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
that if you use the size of the solution as a parameter,

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
then yes, this problem is fix-parameter tractable

21
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
using K, and by K I mean the size of the solution of course.

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Now what about clique and independent set?

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
And again, we can consider these 2

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
problems together because they're so similar.

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
And here unfortunately, I have a bit of bad news for you

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
because using K, by which I mean the size of the solution,

27
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
that's highly unlikely to be fixed-parameter tractable.

28
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
So by highly unlikely, what I mean is it would not

29
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
be something as similar as P=NP or something like that,

30
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
but still there is evidence in a way that is similar to P versus NP

31
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
that clique and independent set are not fixed-parameter tractable

32
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
at least if you consider the parameter to be the size of an optimal solution.

33
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Now what about shortest tour?

34
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Well, one possible parameter here would be using D,

35
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
the size of a shortest tour,

36
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
and here again, it seems somewhat unlikely

37
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
that the problem is fixed-parameter tractable,

38
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
but for shortest tour, another parameter has been investigated

39
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
that actually seems rather promising,

40
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
and that parameter is called using distance from triviality,

41
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
and there it turns out shortest tour actually could be fixed-parameter tractable.

42
00:01:54,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Now what is distance from triviality?
