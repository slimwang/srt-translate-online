1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,833
Remember how in the last lesson you
discovered that the highest port

2
00:00:04,833 --> 00:00:08,071
number you could use with NC was 65535?

3
00:00:08,071 --> 00:00:10,706
Well this tells us something
about how port numbers work.

4
00:00:10,706 --> 00:00:14,000
The reason you can't connect to
a port number higher than that is

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:14,915
that the space for

6
00:00:14,915 --> 00:00:18,459
port numbers in a packet header is
only a certain number of bits wide.

7
00:00:18,459 --> 00:00:22,259
Now, given what you've seen about
binary representations in this lesson,

8
00:00:22,259 --> 00:00:24,722
I'll bet you can figure
out how many bits that is.

9
00:00:24,722 --> 00:00:28,557
So based on the fact that port
numbers only go up to 65,535,

10
00:00:28,557 --> 00:00:32,130
figure out how many bits are used
to represent a port number.
