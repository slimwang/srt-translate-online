00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:04,488
First we look for a greatest common factor. The only factor shared between the

2
00:00:04,488 --> 00:00:08,206
three terms is 1, so we don't need to worry about that. We want to find the

3
00:00:08,206 --> 00:00:14,462
factor pair of 42 that sums to 17. That must be positive 3 and positive 14. We

4
00:00:14,462 --> 00:00:20,128
can rewrite 17x with 3x and 14x. Then we use factoring by grouping to get our

5
00:00:20,128 --> 00:00:25,241
final answer. Great work if you got all or even part of it correct. I know this

6
00:00:25,241 --> 00:00:27,463
factor pair was probably hard to find.
