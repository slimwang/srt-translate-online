00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,288
People with learning disabilities, need to be assessed differently, because IQ

2
00:00:03,288 --> 00:00:07,979
doesn't really work for them. In fact, we have that. It's called the Adaptive

3
00:00:07,979 --> 00:00:11,873
Skills Test, and what the Adaptive Skills Test is all about, is assessing every

4
00:00:11,873 --> 00:00:17,407
day functioning. So how well you understand what people are saying can you feed

5
00:00:17,407 --> 00:00:23,802
yourself, can you dress yourself. And things like that. So, adaptive skills

6
00:00:23,802 --> 00:00:28,666
tests are better ways of assessing intellectual functioning in people with

7
00:00:28,666 --> 00:00:32,152
disabilities than IQ tests are.
