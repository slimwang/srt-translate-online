00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:02,800
Finally, Sunshine has
multiple activities, and

2
00:00:02,799 --> 00:00:04,790
we can move between them using intents.

3
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:07,879
>> We also know how to use intents
to integrate multiple activities

4
00:00:07,879 --> 00:00:10,879
within your app as well as
activities from other apps.

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:11,594
In this lesson,

6
00:00:11,593 --> 00:00:14,921
we'll dive into just how the Android
framework deals with your activities.

7
00:00:14,922 --> 00:00:18,210
In particular, how the activity
lifecycle may be different from what

8
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:21,170
you're used to from other platforms and
environments.

9
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:23,410
>> Don't worry, it's not all theory.

10
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:26,240
We'll work with parts of the framework
that help you handle this lifecycle,

11
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:27,509
such as loaders.

12
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:30,310
>> If you leverage the framework,
properly the users of your app

13
00:00:30,309 --> 00:00:34,149
never have to think about things like
activity and process lifecycles.

14
00:00:34,149 --> 00:00:35,509
Everything just works naturally.
