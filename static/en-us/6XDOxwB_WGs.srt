1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,891
Comparing each x value to the one that came before it, as we move down our

2
00:00:04,903 --> 00:00:10,294
table, every entry is one greater than the one that came before it. If we do the

3
00:00:10,306 --> 00:00:15,262
same thing to the y side of the table, we notice that every value is three

4
00:00:15,274 --> 00:00:20,511
greater than the one before it. So, when x changes by 1, positive 1, y changes

5
00:00:20,523 --> 00:00:21,433
by positive 3.
