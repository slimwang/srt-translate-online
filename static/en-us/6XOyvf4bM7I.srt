Natural Selection, the driving force of evolution, takes a population of

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:10,651
organisms, and selects, only for those which are fit enough to survive. For

3
00:00:10,651 --> 00:00:16,306
example, after a drought in the Galapagos Islands that leaves tough dry seeds

4
00:00:16,306 --> 00:00:21,874
for bird food, only finches with big, durable beaks can crack open and eat the

5
00:00:21,874 --> 00:00:30,166
seeds to survive. The rest will die. Thus, those genes that produces the big,

6
00:00:30,166 --> 00:00:34,099
durable beaks are naturally selected for and passed down to the next

7
00:00:34,099 --> 00:00:39,820
generation. Hopefully allowing their offspring to survive a drought as well.

8
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:44,346
This process of natural selection is responsible for shaping the genetic

9
00:00:44,346 --> 00:00:50,953
information and development of every species as they evolve, including humans.
