2
00:00:02,684 --> 00:00:05,793
Kaggle has a lot of different
benefits for students or

3
00:00:05,793 --> 00:00:10,400
young professionals looking to
build a career in machine learning.

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,860
The first is that employers pay a lot
of attention to your Kaggle profile.

5
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:16,890
For a couple of examples of that,

6
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:20,330
I think Google DeepMind has now hired
about four competition winners from

7
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:22,700
people who've won computer
vision competitions.

8
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:26,520
And these are people that DeepMind
probably wouldn't have come across had

9
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:29,900
they not done a really good
job in Kaggle competitions.

10
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:33,560
So strong competition performances are a
really effective way to stand out from

11
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:37,090
the crowd and to demonstrate how
well they can do on a problem.

12
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,970
The second way that we help
people looking to find data

13
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:44,010
science jobs is running
their own jobs board,

14
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:47,930
where we highlight jobs from some of
the best companies around the world that

15
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:52,250
are hiring data scientists from
machine learning engineers.

16
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:56,780
The guidance that we typically
give companies who are hiring

17
00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:00,700
from recruiting competitions that
we ran is to look at the top

18
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:05,430
two to three hundred out of a pull of about
a thousand people in those competitions.

19
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:10,190
And usually they use that as a starting
point and look at a number of other

20
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:13,370
factors from there,
when they're evaluating candidates.

21
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:15,910
There's actually a third way
that's really helpful for

22
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:20,550
people who are currently in a career and
either they want to

23
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:25,390
swap to doing more data science, machine
learning within their current company or

24
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:28,870
they want to swap, make switches.

25
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:32,482
If you participate a lot in Kaggle,
and do well in Kaggle and

26
00:01:32,482 --> 00:01:36,160
it's a really effective way for finding
the most interesting projects and

27
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:40,370
getting access to the most interesting
projects within your company.

28
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:45,410
For example, one of our top users
is a chemical engineer by training.

29
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:49,430
But he's been pulled into pretty
much every special project around

30
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:51,970
the analytics machine
learning that his company's

31
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:54,530
done by virtue of his Kaggle profile.

32
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:58,680
And many executives four and five levels
higher than him in that company know who

33
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,220
he is and brag about his Kaggle
profile and Kaggle performance.

34
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:05,484
So it's a really great way for people
currently in large companies to get

35
00:02:05,484 --> 00:02:07,583
greater visibility
within those companies.

36
00:02:07,583 --> 00:02:10,823

37
00:02:10,823 --> 00:02:15,046
The way to make your profile
more attractive to employers is

38
00:02:15,046 --> 00:02:18,935
to showcase to the best of
your ability what you can do.

39
00:02:18,935 --> 00:02:23,835
And the three mechanisms of doing that
are, the first is competitions and

40
00:02:23,835 --> 00:02:26,275
having a strong competition performance.

41
00:02:26,275 --> 00:02:28,203
Then the other two
touch on collaboration.

42
00:02:28,203 --> 00:02:32,065
In enterprise data science teams or
commercial machine learning teams,

43
00:02:32,065 --> 00:02:34,825
working collaboratively
is incredibly important.

44
00:02:34,825 --> 00:02:38,920
And the two ways to showcase how you can
do that are, first, to write clean and

45
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:42,460
well-architected code which can be
published through Kaggle scripts.

46
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:46,810
And then secondly to participate
in discussion on the forums and

47
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:51,080
give helpful tips and advice,
share insights about the data, and

48
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,320
things along those lines.
