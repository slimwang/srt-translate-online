1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:05,360
Now I want to describe the notation,
which we call classical planning, which

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:11,510
is a representation language for dealing
with states and actions and plans.

3
00:00:11,509 --> 00:00:13,969
And it's also an approach for

4
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:19,690
dealing with the problem of complexity,
by factoring the world into variables.

5
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:24,640
So under classical planning,
a state space consists of all

6
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:29,096
the possible assignments
to k-Boolean variables.

7
00:00:29,096 --> 00:00:35,429
And so that means they'll be 2 to
the k states in that state space.

8
00:00:35,429 --> 00:00:39,179
And if we think about the two
location vacuum world,

9
00:00:39,179 --> 00:00:42,109
we would have three Boolean Variables.

10
00:00:42,109 --> 00:00:46,632
We could have dirt in location A,

11
00:00:46,633 --> 00:00:52,944
dirt in location B, and
vacuum in location A.

12
00:00:52,944 --> 00:00:55,550
And the vacuum has to be in either A or
B.

13
00:00:55,549 --> 00:00:57,750
So these three variables will do and

14
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:01,810
there'll be eight possible
states in that world.

15
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:06,230
But they can be succinctly represented
through the three variables.

16
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:11,719
And then a world state consists of
a complete assignment of true and

17
00:01:11,719 --> 00:01:14,400
false, through each of
the three variables.

18
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,670
And then a belief state, well,
just as in problem solving,

19
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:23,881
the belief state depends on what type
of environment you want to deal with.

20
00:01:23,881 --> 00:01:26,742
Now, in the core classical planning,

21
00:01:26,742 --> 00:01:31,772
the belief sate had to be a complete
assignment and that was useful for

22
00:01:31,772 --> 00:01:36,125
dealing with deterministic,
fully observable domains.

23
00:01:36,125 --> 00:01:39,311
But we can easily extend
classical planning and

24
00:01:39,311 --> 00:01:44,086
we can deal with belief states that
are partial assignments, that is,

25
00:01:44,085 --> 00:01:48,060
some of the variables have
values that others don't.

26
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:53,480
So we could have the belief state
consisting of vacuum in A is true and

27
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,730
the others are unknown and

28
00:01:55,730 --> 00:02:00,140
that small formula represents
four possible world states.

29
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:06,969
And we can even have a belief state
which is an arbitrary formula

30
00:02:06,969 --> 00:02:08,430
in Boolean logic.

31
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:11,050
And that can represent anything we want.

32
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:15,380
So that's what states look like, now we
have to figure out what actions look and

33
00:02:15,379 --> 00:02:18,189
what the results of those
actions looks like.

34
00:02:18,189 --> 00:02:21,009
And these are represented in classical

35
00:02:21,009 --> 00:02:24,884
planning by something
called an action schema.

36
00:02:24,884 --> 00:02:26,419
And it's called a schema,

37
00:02:26,419 --> 00:02:30,778
because it represents many possible
actions that are similar to each other.

38
00:02:30,778 --> 00:02:35,625
So, let's take an example of we want
to send cargo around the world and

39
00:02:35,625 --> 00:02:40,240
we've got a bunch of planes in
airports and we have cargo and so on.

40
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:44,430
And I'll show you the action for
having a plane fly

41
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:48,270
from one location to another
here's on possible representation.

42
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:53,840
We say, it's an action schema, so we
write the word action, and then we write

43
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,830
the action operator, and
it's arguments, so it's a fly of p,

44
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:06,850
from x to y, and
then we list the preconditions.

45
00:03:06,849 --> 00:03:11,120
What needs to be true in order to
be able to execute this action.

46
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,700
And we can say something like,
well, p better be a plane.

47
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:19,110
It's no good trying to fly a truck or
a submarine.

48
00:03:20,699 --> 00:03:28,179
And we'll use the and formula
from Boolean propositional logic.

49
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:30,930
And x better be an airport.

50
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:33,830
You don't want to try to
take off from my back yard.

51
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:36,638
And similarly, y better be an airport.

52
00:03:36,638 --> 00:03:38,762
And, most importantly,

53
00:03:38,762 --> 00:03:43,210
p better be at airport x in
order to take off from there.

54
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:47,914
And then we represent the effects
of the action by saying,

55
00:03:47,913 --> 00:03:50,729
well, what's going to happen?

56
00:03:50,729 --> 00:03:56,039
Well, once we fly from x to y
the plane is no longer at x.

57
00:03:57,159 --> 00:04:02,329
So we say not at p(x).

58
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:03,640
Plane's no longer at x.

59
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:08,699
And the plane is now at y.

60
00:04:08,699 --> 00:04:10,750
So this is called an action schema.

61
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:15,560
It represents a set of actions for
all possible planes, for all x, and for

62
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,800
all y.

63
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,040
Represents all those
actions in one schema.

64
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:24,710
It says, but we need to know,
in order to apply the action.

65
00:04:24,709 --> 00:04:29,389
And it says what will happen in terms
of the transition from state spaces.

66
00:04:29,389 --> 00:04:32,560
This variable will become false,
and this one will become true.

67
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:41,229
Now when we look at this formula this
looks like a term in first order logic.

68
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:45,550
But we're actually dealing with
a completely propositional world.

69
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:48,259
It just looks like that
because this is a schema.

70
00:04:48,259 --> 00:04:55,279
And we can apply this schema to specific
ground states, specific world states.

71
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:58,209
And then p and
x would have specific values.

72
00:04:58,209 --> 00:05:01,639
And you can just think of it as
concatenating their names all together.

73
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:04,579
And that's just the name
of one variable.

74
00:05:04,579 --> 00:05:08,209
The name just happens to have this
complex form with parentheses and

75
00:05:08,209 --> 00:05:09,199
commas in it.

76
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:11,670
To make it easier to write one schema

77
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:14,710
that covers all
the individual fly actions.
