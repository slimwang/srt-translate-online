1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,970
In this problem, we'll return the spaceship, so I'm very excited.

2
00:00:03,970 --> 00:00:09,080
Now, similar to what we saw in units 1 and 2, we want our spaceship in this case

3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:12,010
or it's actually a satellite to get into orbit.

4
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:16,400
However, this is a very special type of orbit. It's a geostationary orbit.

5
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:21,890
What this means is that once the satellite is in space at a certain distance away from the earth,

6
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:26,200
it will orbit the earth at exactly the same rate as that at which the earth rotates.

7
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:31,210
So the people on earth, it's going to look like this satellite isn't moving at all, which is pretty cool.

8
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:34,240
To show you how this happens, we have this lovely diagram right here,

9
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,930
which I warned you is not to scale.

10
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:41,090
In the center, we have the earth, and initially, the satellite is orbiting

11
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:44,820
at just 200 km away from the Earth's surface.

12
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:51,040
At a certain moment, in fact, at the moment when the rocket first crosses the x axis on this diagram,

13
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:57,040
the rocket is going to spit the satellite out, and this is going to repel the satellite away

14
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:02,970
from its original orbit and eventually out to the radius that needs to be at for geostationary orbit

15
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:08,550
so this red line right here then it's going to stay along this red path for as long as it needs to.

16
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:14,170
Now, the radius of geostationary orbit is 42,164 km.

17
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:18,560
Also, just an interesting tidbit, this transition orbit, this green curve right here,

18
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:26,410
is exactly half of an ellipse that is tangent to both of these circular orbits, the pink one and the red one.

19
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:31,290
Also, these orbits are both perfectly circular even though my drawing doesn't really show that.

20
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:34,710
So there are three tasks that we would like you to complete for this problem.

21
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:41,440
The first of these is to find out what the speed and radius of that initial smaller orbit is.

22
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:46,300
Remember, like I said, this is a circular orbit so that should make things a little bit simpler.

23
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:49,770
You probably have to use pencil and paper for this part of the problem.

24
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:53,090
Now, on the rocket and the satellite attached to it

25
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:56,110
cross the negative part of the x axis for the first time.

26
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:59,470
The rocket fires its engine to increase the speed of the satellite

27
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:02,160
by the amount given in the variable called boost.

28
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:05,570
This should remind you a lot at the last problem of unit 2.

29
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:09,630
So for your second task, we want you to figure out how to make this boost happen

30
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:12,510
and of course how to make it happen at the appropriate time.

31
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:15,700
Let's go back a bit in the code to get your last task.

32
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:18,780
This is going to be to figure out as you've done before.

33
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:22,120
What the correct magnitude of the boost velocity is?

34
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:25,350
We filled a dummy value of 42 just to sort out with,

35
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:28,210
and I've given you several different options to choose from.

36
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:30,470
One of these is the correct answer.

37
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:35,520
Once you completed the first two tasks, plug in each of these values for boost

38
00:02:35,520 --> 99:59:59,999
and compare the path to see which one helps the satellite and the geostationary orbit.
