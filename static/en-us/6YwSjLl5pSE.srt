1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:05,110
First, a common location for a network
intrusion detection system sensor

2
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:07,440
is just inside the external firewall.

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,580
This is true.

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:12,510
This is a very typical deployment
strategy of network IDS.

5
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:16,930
Second, a Honeypot can be a workstation
that a user uses for work.

6
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:22,390
This is false, because a Honeypot is not
a real system used by any real user.

7
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:26,070
Third, there's no benefit of
deploying a network IDS or

8
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:28,890
Honeypot outside of
the external firewall.

9
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:30,040
This is false.

10
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:34,840
Using a network IDS or Honeypot outside
of the external firewall will allow us

11
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:39,350
to see what attacks are coming from
Internet to the enterprise network.

12
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:43,670
In the case of Honeypot, because
attacks are trapped in the Honeypot,

13
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:48,370
it reduces the amount of traffic
that the firewall has to process.

14
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:52,060
In other words, the firewall does
not need to produce as many alerts.
