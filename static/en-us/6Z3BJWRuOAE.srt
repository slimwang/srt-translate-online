1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,787
The answer is less than 0.05. Here's how we know that. Remember, we did a 5%

2
00:00:04,787 --> 00:00:11,282
test. Alpha equals 0.05. That means that this area beyond here. Is 5% of the

3
00:00:11,282 --> 00:00:14,554
distribution. Remember, the critical value cuts off the lower 5% of the

4
00:00:14,554 --> 00:00:21,860
distribution. The p value is this area, right here, cut off by our value of t.

5
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:26,760
So remember, a p value is just a proportion of scores that fall beyond a score.

6
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:31,548
So in this case, the one-tailed p value has to smaller than 0.5, because this

7
00:00:31,548 --> 00:00:38,440
small chunk here is smaller than this chunk right here. So, p has to be less

8
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:42,315
than 0.5. Now again, when we're doing these by hand, we don't know the exact p

9
00:00:42,315 --> 00:00:45,829
value But we can use a calculator to look it up. I'll do that right now for

10
00:00:45,829 --> 00:00:53,144
you. The exact one tailed p value is 0.00985. You can clearly see that this is

11
00:00:53,144 --> 00:00:58,086
much less than 0.05. So p is less than 0.05. We would probably present this p

12
00:00:58,086 --> 00:01:03,700
value if we were writing this out in the result section. As p is equal to 0.01.

13
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:07,103
That's because we round to two decimal places.
