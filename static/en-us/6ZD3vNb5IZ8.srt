1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:05,370
Click on the View as button on
the bottom of the storyboard window.

2
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:09,009
This allows you to preview
your UI on different devices

3
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:11,070
as well as different orientations.

4
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:15,315
It also allows you to preview it when
the whole screen is not available

5
00:00:15,314 --> 00:00:18,384
because it's being shared
with another scene.

6
00:00:18,385 --> 00:00:20,865
This last part is a little
bit more advanced, so

7
00:00:20,864 --> 00:00:22,534
we won't bother with it right now.

8
00:00:22,535 --> 00:00:27,289
As you can see, the stack view remains
in the same corner of the screen.

9
00:00:27,289 --> 00:00:30,530
The size of the stack view
doesn't change, however.

10
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:32,679
That's because it doesn't have to.

11
00:00:32,679 --> 00:00:36,359
Now let's give the stack view
a little bit more work to do.

12
00:00:36,359 --> 00:00:39,280
Can you think of a way
to force it to take

13
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,549
all of the available width on
any device and orientation?

14
00:00:43,549 --> 00:00:44,649
Think about it.

15
00:00:44,649 --> 00:00:45,829
We'll do it in the next video.
