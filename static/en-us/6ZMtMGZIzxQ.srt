1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,759
So, it actually winds up being helpful
to think of this continuum from novice

2
00:00:04,759 --> 00:00:07,408
to expert as having
four distinct stages.

3
00:00:07,408 --> 00:00:11,150
And I'm going to be referring to these
four stages throughout the NIM degree,

4
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:14,730
so you know to what extent you should
be mastering the material we cover.

5
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:18,219
In order to talk about these stages,
let's give them names.

6
00:00:18,219 --> 00:00:22,464
On this end, I'm going to replace I
don't even know where to begin with

7
00:00:22,464 --> 00:00:25,610
a title and that word is ignorance.

8
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:29,096
Now, ignorance sounds harsh,
but it isn't meant that way.

9
00:00:29,096 --> 00:00:31,771
Ignorance about something just
means you just don't know yet

10
00:00:31,771 --> 00:00:34,703
it exists and this is how every
journey towards expertise begins and

11
00:00:34,703 --> 00:00:37,390
that's why we're calling it stage zero.

12
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:42,743
On the other end, let's replace why was
this ever hard with the word fluency.

13
00:00:42,743 --> 00:00:47,730
Because when you're really fluent in
something, you've truly mastered it.

14
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:50,751
In between these two extremes,
there are two important stages.

15
00:00:50,751 --> 00:00:55,589
First, comes awareness and
that is followed by ability.

16
00:00:55,589 --> 00:00:57,282
To better explain what
these stages mean,

17
00:00:57,282 --> 00:00:59,960
I'm going to share
a personal example with you.

18
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,568
As I do, try to connect
the stages I went through to

19
00:01:02,568 --> 00:01:05,066
the example you just came up with for
yourself.

20
00:01:05,066 --> 00:01:09,630
And the example I want to share is how
I learned to drive a stick shift car.

21
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:11,238
Because when I was a little kid,

22
00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:15,242
I actually didn't know that different
cars could be driven in different ways.

23
00:01:15,242 --> 00:01:16,790
I had no idea what stick shift was.

24
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:19,180
I was ignorant of its existence.

25
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:20,245
And then one day,

26
00:01:20,245 --> 00:01:24,151
I asked my dad why he kept moving
the shifter around when he drove.

27
00:01:24,151 --> 00:01:27,844
And he explained to me manual
transmissions and pretty quickly,

28
00:01:27,844 --> 00:01:31,010
I at least had an awareness
that stick shift was a thing.

29
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,172
And even though that seems small,

30
00:01:34,172 --> 00:01:38,399
this was an essential stage in my
journey towards becoming an expert.

31
00:01:38,399 --> 00:01:42,636
The transition to this next
stage began on my 16th birthday.

32
00:01:42,636 --> 00:01:45,573
I had gotten my driver's license and
I really wanted to drive.

33
00:01:45,573 --> 00:01:48,040
So, I needed to learn
how to drive stick.

34
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:51,738
My dad gave me some lessons and
within just one or two of these lessons,

35
00:01:51,738 --> 00:01:53,380
I could actually drive stick.

36
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:56,150
It was really hard, but
I was still driving.

37
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:59,235
I had to be very focused on what
I was doing with the clutch and

38
00:01:59,235 --> 00:02:02,523
the break and the shifter and
the gas, but I can make the car go.

39
00:02:02,523 --> 00:02:04,620
It was a big achievement.

40
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:07,428
And now, I've gotten to fluency.

41
00:02:07,428 --> 00:02:09,630
When I drive,
I forget what I'm even doing.

42
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:13,483
I don't even think about driving
a stick, it just comes natural and

43
00:02:13,483 --> 00:02:14,720
that's fine.

44
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:19,008
But let's talk about the most
empowering part of these stages.

45
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:23,315
To get from ignorance to awareness
took me a matter of minutes.

46
00:02:23,315 --> 00:02:27,047
All my dad had to do was explain
to me that this thing existed.

47
00:02:27,047 --> 00:02:31,895
Then to get from awareness to ability,
only took a matter of days.

48
00:02:31,895 --> 00:02:34,720
And even though I was far
from being an expert,

49
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,859
after those two days of instruction
practice, I was driving a car.

50
00:02:38,859 --> 00:02:39,810
It felt very cool.

51
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:46,267
Now getting from ability to fluency,
that required years of practice.

52
00:02:46,267 --> 00:02:49,517
And I was constantly getting
closer to fluency over that time,

53
00:02:49,517 --> 00:02:53,134
but it wasn't until a couple of years
of practice that I was actually at

54
00:02:53,134 --> 00:02:56,470
the stage where I wasn't thinking
at all about what I was doing.

55
00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:00,981
So think back to your example
of expertise that you have.

56
00:03:00,981 --> 00:03:03,880
How did you make these transitions?

57
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,387
How long did each take?

58
00:03:05,387 --> 00:03:08,923
If you'd like, feel free to share
your story on the discussion forum.

59
00:03:08,923 --> 00:03:11,970
In the next video, I'm going to
explain why these stages are so

60
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:15,940
relevant to the educational journey to
learn to code that you are on right now.
