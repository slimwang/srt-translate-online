So what I want you to do is add an assertion to the code that will give a

00:00:03,744 --> 00:00:08,003
failure when inputs are invalid in this way. And the syntax for assertions or

3
00:00:08,003 --> 00:00:12,005
you can do assert followed by any python expression if the value of the

4
00:00:12,005 --> 00:00:16,653
expression is false the assertion fails execution will stop with an exception.
