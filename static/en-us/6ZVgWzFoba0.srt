1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,210
So that was surprising to me,
that was not where I originally went.

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:06,656
I didn't see the two thirds popping out
because really like you said there's no

3
00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:07,689
where's the thirds.

4
00:00:07,689 --> 00:00:10,240
There's nothing in the set up of
the problem that had thirds in it.

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,250
>> Right and so the way that I come to
that answer is I think about counting.

6
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:17,880
So before when I said well if
I know there's only one and

7
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,270
you tell me that one.

8
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:21,911
The x is actually right, that's a one.

9
00:00:21,911 --> 00:00:25,844
It's like also telling me,
y is not it, and z is not it.

10
00:00:25,844 --> 00:00:31,456
And kind of the intuition here is that
if the probability of human correct

11
00:00:31,456 --> 00:00:36,793
is 0.8, it's almost like I'm
giving eight-tenths of a count.

12
00:00:36,793 --> 00:00:40,419
That's like saying that you
got eight tenths of an x,

13
00:00:40,419 --> 00:00:44,689
of a count going towards x and
then 0.2 for y and 0.2 for z,

14
00:00:44,689 --> 00:00:48,316
which you'll notice that
if you normalize that out,

15
00:00:48,316 --> 00:00:52,820
works out exactly to be two
thirds one sixth and one sixth.

16
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:56,720
>> Yeah so that counting thing
turns out to be very powerful and

17
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:59,420
we can derive a more
general version of this.

18
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:00,778
So this quiz is actually,

19
00:01:00,778 --> 00:01:03,938
both of the quiz I gave you were
actually designed to be easy.

20
00:01:03,938 --> 00:01:04,536
>> [LAUGH]
>> Yeah and

21
00:01:04,536 --> 00:01:05,600
do you know what makes them easy?

22
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,120
What makes them easy is that we
only had one, one piece of data.

23
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,700
You see you try to take
action x in state s and

24
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,860
you ended up being told that was good.

25
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:15,310
But what if you had done it ten or

26
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:19,970
twenty times and sometimes x was said
to be good, sometimes said to be bad,

27
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:22,730
sometimes y was said to be good,
sometimes said to be bad.

28
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:26,128
Then this kind of natural, this sort of
process you went through still works but

29
00:01:26,128 --> 00:01:28,003
you have to keep track
of a lot more things and

30
00:01:28,003 --> 00:01:29,793
this counting argument actually helps.

31
00:01:29,793 --> 00:01:33,873
And it comes from exactly
the crystal clear generative model

32
00:01:33,873 --> 00:01:36,760
that uses Bayes rule
that you came up with.

33
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,280
So I'm going to actually
write it down for

34
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,380
you and we can talk about it for
a little bit, okay.

35
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:41,950
>> Yeah no I'd like to
see the general form.
