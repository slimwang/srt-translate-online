1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
We've done turning our request IP into some coordinates--ta-da!

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
All right. The next step is to draw a map--actually, there are some in between steps.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Before we draw a map let's look at our code again. We actually have two to-do lists.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
We said we're going to look up the users coordinates from their IP.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Let's go ahead and do that here-- coords = get<u>coords(self.request.remote</u>addr).

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Okay. That should work.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Then we said if we have coordinates, add them to the art.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Right now our art object doesn't take any coordinates.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Let's add an extra property to our art--

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
coords = db.GeoPtProperty( ).

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Again, I found that this existed when I was reading the Google Data Store docs.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Since we're returning a Geo Point here, we can store it in a Geo Point Property.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Again, this is a Google-specific datatype for storing latitude and longitude, and it's super convenient.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Now, I'd like to say required = True, but we already have some art in our database

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
that doesn't have coordinates. We have a couple options here.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
We could either delete all that art and start over,

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
but being that ASCII Chan is a famous site on the internet, and everybody is using it,

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
we don't want it to just break. We'll just make this parameter not required.

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
We'll just have it for future ones.

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
This is something that comes up all the time when you're developing web applications.

21
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
It's kind of backwards compatibility, because you're often adding features,

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
tweaking your data model. This is one of the reasons things can get a little hairy.

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
But it's also one of the reasons why the web is really neat,

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
because you can kind of develop iteratively.

25
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
We're adding our coords to our art, and we're going to go down here and say,

26
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
if we have coordinates, add them to the art.

27
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
That's easy--if coords--basically, if get_coords doesn't return None--

28
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
p.coords = coords. Now we're good.

29
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Let's go ahead and try submitting some art in our browser and see if we get an exception.

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Reload this. Let's submit a new picture, call this one "cat," enter in a picture of a cat,

31
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
and we'll submit this. Okay, I didn't see any exceptions.

32
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Let' me show you something handy we can do in Google App Engine

33
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
to make sure this actually submitted properly.

34
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
You may notice that when you start up App Engine, it actually mentions in the console

35
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
that the admin console is available at this URL or at a URL like this.

36
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Let's go ahead and visit that and let me show you something we can do.

37
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
It defaults to the datastore viewer, and it selects all of the entity kinds we have.

38
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
We only have one in this drop down.

39
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
If I click list entries, I can see all of my entries,

40
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
and I can see here is camel and here is cat--my two entries.

41
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I can see that camel doesn't have any coordinates,

42
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
because we entered that before we added this feature,

43
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
and we can see our cat has map coordinates.

44
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
So our feature is working, and that's pretty cool.

45
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
There's all sorts of handy stuff in this tool here.

46
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
You can check out your indices and all sorts of cool stuff. It's neat to poke around in here.

47
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
But, working with the database, this is a particularly handy view.

48
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
So let's get out of here for now, and let's move on to the next feature,

49
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,968
which is actually drawing this map.
