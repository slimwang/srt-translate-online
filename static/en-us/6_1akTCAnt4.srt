00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,150
I want to talk about the two main ways to

2
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:07,590
measure a network. Those are called Latency and Bandwidth.

3
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:11,920
What they mean is very different. They're often confused.

4
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,780
Often people say bandwidth when they mean latency, or

5
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:17,180
say latency when they mean bandwidth. They're quite different

6
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:20,090
things. So let me explain what they are. So

7
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:22,230
latency is the time that it takes for a

8
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:25,570
message to get from the source to the destination.

9
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:31,030
And that's for the start of the message. So, we can measure latency by timing

10
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:32,810
when you start sending to the time

11
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:35,600
that the receiver starts receiving. So this is

12
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:41,690
the unit of time. It will be measured in something like seconds. For a fast

13
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:44,710
network today, it's more often measured in milliseconds

14
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:47,710
and there are 1000 milliseconds in one second.

15
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:53,590
So now, you understand about latency. And when I

16
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:57,860
go back to the Greek signaling network. So, suppose now

17
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:00,930
that Zeus, who is all powerful, wanted to send a

18
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:03,340
message from Rhodes to Sparta. And he thought that the

19
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:05,600
latency of the smoke signal network as it was

20
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,500
currently set up was too high, that it takes too

21
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:11,730
long for the message that he sends starting from Rhodes

22
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:15,390
to reach Sparta. So the question is, how could Zeus,

23
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:18,090
and remember that in ancient Greece, Zeus was all

24
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,200
powerful, reduce the latency between Rhodes and Sparta. So

25
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,750
here are the choices. It makes the signalling nodes

26
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:29,410
further apart. So instead of going from Rhodes to

27
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:33,400
Naxos to Millios to Sparta, maybe it would have

28
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,290
to go one hop. There would be a new

29
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:37,010
island in the middle here, and it could go

30
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:39,520
from Rhodes to the new island and then to Sparta.

31
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:43,750
He could threaten the soldiers at all the signalling points and

32
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:47,170
scare them into working harder, so they start the fires more quickly,

33
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:50,010
when they need to send a message. He could find a way

34
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:52,710
to make it so instead of just sending one color smoke, you

35
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:55,740
could send different colors smoke. That would mean that with the same

36
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:59,550
amount of smoke, you could send more different messages. Or he could

37
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:02,010
increase the speed of light. That would mean that the the soldiers

38
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:06,320
at each signaling point would see the previous smoke signal more quickly

39
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,050
than they do now.
