00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:01,859
Okay, now that we have seen an example of

2
00:00:01,859 --> 00:00:06,342
instruction scheduling, let's do an instruction scheduling quiz. Let's

3
00:00:06,342 --> 00:00:09,422
say that this is a sequence of instructions that

4
00:00:09,422 --> 00:00:12,430
we have to schedule. And let's say that load

5
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:15,472
word takes two cycles, add takes one cycle and

6
00:00:15,472 --> 00:00:18,910
store word takes one cycle. The question for you

7
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:22,190
is how many cycles does this take to execute

8
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:25,460
as is and after instruction scheduling in the compiler this

9
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:28,885
takes how many cycles? On a processor that can do only

10
00:00:28,885 --> 00:00:32,380
one instruction per cycle and it has to do instructions in order.
