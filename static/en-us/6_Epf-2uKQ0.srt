1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:04,200
Another way of looking at that whole concept is this schematic here.

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,540
Let's assume I can put a light source that actually has a shape of

3
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:09,140
a plus sign here.

4
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:12,230
I have an opening with an aperture which is much bigger here.

5
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:15,370
When light goes through here, basically what's going to happen as we've

6
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:18,750
discussed in the case of the tree, it's going to get a little blurry.

7
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:21,800
Similarly, if the hole is small, it'll be less blurry.

8
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,760
Another hole instance of this would be is when we actually have a point

9
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:25,570
light source.

10
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,020
This is not a point light source.

11
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:29,530
These were, you know, if have different shapes in it.

12
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,950
A point light source basically is, has no dimension.

13
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:33,950
It's just a very high intensity beam.

14
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:37,370
When it hits this point here, because if it's a very small one,

15
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:38,870
it's going to go through correctly, and

16
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:41,770
of course there will be no kind of diffraction patterns here.

17
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:46,710
But if I made it even so much smaller, related to the wave length of

18
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:50,000
this light source, it's going to start creating diffraction patterns.

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,700
So of course we'll have another whole artifact on this image.

20
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:56,770
In essence, what it comes down to is, we need to figure out how to

21
00:00:56,770 --> 00:01:02,560
control the various types of stains in this image, which basically suggests that

22
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:08,300
a larger pinhole, which is right here, creates geometric blur.

23
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:11,950
A smaller pinhole would create diffraction blur.

24
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:14,880
So this is geometric blur, a diffraction blur.

25
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,150
And a best pinhole, basically, would be an ideal in

26
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:23,220
creating other images that we want, but of course will let in a lot less light.

27
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,680
We haven't actually discussed the whole concept of amount of light, but

28
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,870
it should be obvious.

29
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:30,360
The smaller the hole, the less amount of light will pass through.

30
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:33,239
So again, let's look at the whole concept of pinhole size.

31
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:36,990
And let's try to study it with a little bit of math.

32
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:38,720
Let me get a few terms across.

33
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:45,210
First term is d, which is the diameter of the pinhole.

34
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:50,390
Again, we also refer to that as the aperture, the size of the opening.

35
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:52,750
because the amount of light goes through this one.

36
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:57,170
Another term we'll use is f, which is the focal length, which is the distance

37
00:01:57,170 --> 00:02:02,000
from the obstruction where the pinhole is, and to the screen of the sensor.

38
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,525
How far away should that be?

39
00:02:03,525 --> 00:02:07,180
because that's where everything is going to be focused and best produced.

40
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:11,728
Let's call that f, and it's also referred to as the focal length of a camera.

41
00:02:11,728 --> 00:02:16,300
Another parameter we'll use is pi, which is basically the wavelength of light.

42
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:22,380
So in essence this captures, is the you know,

43
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:24,730
the physical characteristic of the light itself.

44
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:28,060
Using this, we can come up with an equation which suggests that

45
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:32,950
the the size of the hole depends on the focal lamp.

46
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:36,610
How far I want the subject to be or the, the image to be captured.

47
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:38,930
They'll be of length in this form of a equation here.
