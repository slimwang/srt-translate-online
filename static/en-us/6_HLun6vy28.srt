1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,629
Now we've come to our first exercise.

2
00:00:02,629 --> 00:00:05,299
You're going to open the first
exercise for the toy app.

3
00:00:05,299 --> 00:00:06,790
You've hopefully placed our exercise and

4
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:10,940
solution code in an easy to find spot on
your development computer at this point.

5
00:00:10,939 --> 00:00:13,529
If you haven't yet,
please download the source code now.

6
00:00:14,669 --> 00:00:17,800
If you've synced with both repositories,
you should have separate directories for

7
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:20,570
both exercises and sunshine code.

8
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:26,175
Open up the first exercise in the first
lesson T1.1-exercise-createlayout.

9
00:00:26,175 --> 00:00:29,871
You want to do this instead of continue
with the project you just created since

10
00:00:29,871 --> 00:00:33,567
the code we provide contains valuable
to do items along with additional code

11
00:00:33,567 --> 00:00:37,437
that will help guide you through the
exercise, eliminate unnecessary work and

12
00:00:37,438 --> 00:00:39,659
prevent you from getting
too far off course.

13
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:41,353
Now it's your turn.

14
00:00:41,353 --> 00:00:46,160
Time to get your first, albeit,
slightly boring Android layout set up.
