00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:04,010
Again, any software can
have security holes,

2
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:07,910
therefore it is not surprising
that despite all the efforts

3
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:11,980
of security engineering,
iOS still has security holes.

4
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:17,400
What iOS security weaknesses were
exploited by researches in the 2015?

5
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:21,390
First, the malware was uploaded
to the Apple App store.

6
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:25,750
Second, the malware was able
to bypass Sandbox security.

7
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:29,660
Third, the malware was able to
hijack browser extensions and

8
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:31,100
collect passwords.

9
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:32,320
Fourth, all the above.
