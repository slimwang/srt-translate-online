1
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:04,050
We're going to theme Sunshine
with our updated material colors.

2
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:06,864
We'll start by creating constants for
primary_light,

3
00:00:06,864 --> 00:00:09,000
primary, primary_dark, and accent.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,698
And then we'll replace all occurrences
of sunshine_blue, sunshine_light_blue,

5
00:00:13,698 --> 00:00:15,880
and sunshine_dark_blue appropriately.

6
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:19,470
Remember that colorPrimaryLight is not
actually part of the material theme.
