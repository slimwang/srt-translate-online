1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:06,215
The 0 lies between 1.44 and 1.45. Now remember, we started out just knowing

2
00:00:06,215 --> 00:00:10,304
that the 0 was between 1 and 2. That's a pretty huge range, considering how

3
00:00:10,304 --> 00:00:14,364
precise, or how accurate, we've gotten now. So the more information we have,

4
00:00:14,364 --> 00:00:17,640
the better the intermediate value theorem can help us, come up with a really

5
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:21,523
close answer, or a really close approximation for x.
