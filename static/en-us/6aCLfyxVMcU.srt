1
00:00:00,205 --> 00:00:02,840
So,we made some changes in the browser itself.

2
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:05,870
>> But we can't share those changes.

3
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:07,160
>> Right or save them.

4
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:09,640
>> Right so to do that I guess we're going to have

5
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:12,500
to be a little more sophisticated than just working the browser. We're

6
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,930
going to need to get a code editor and we need to

7
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:17,040
get the code and how are we going to get the code?

8
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:20,840
>> So, the code is stored on GitHub so we will need GitHub accounts

9
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:25,370
and we'll need to actually figure out how to get the code from GitHub.

10
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:28,690
>> And you, depending on your background in programming you may already have a

11
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:31,800
code you may like, you may know nothing about GitHub or you may be

12
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:36,140
an expert, so answer this next question it'll sort of guide you, there might

13
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:39,860
be some videos that you can skip and we don't want to waste anyone's time.
