Thanks Greg! The three stages are what Selye referred to as the General

2
00:00:04,456 --> 00:00:09,902
Adaptation Syndrome. To recap, General Adaptation Syndrome consists of three

3
00:00:09,902 --> 00:00:14,659
stages. First is the alarm stage. This is when your body first reacts to the

4
00:00:14,659 --> 00:00:20,085
stressful or threatening situation. With activation of the sympathetic nervous

5
00:00:20,085 --> 00:00:25,665
system and the HPA Axis. The second stage is the resistance stage. This is when

6
00:00:25,665 --> 00:00:30,471
your body tries to adapt to the stress. Here, we have sustained release of

7
00:00:30,471 --> 00:00:34,247
cortisol, as our body attempts to maintain our level of arousal to combat the

8
00:00:34,247 --> 00:00:41,480
threat or the stressful situation. And finally we have the exhaustion stage.

9
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:45,323
This is when our body resources have been depleted in an attempt to deal with

10
00:00:45,323 --> 00:00:49,992
the threat or stressful situation. As a result of this depletion, our immune

11
00:00:49,992 --> 00:00:52,920
system is weakened, making it more likely that we experience illness and

12
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:57,576
infection. It's important to note however that this model doesn't account for

13
00:00:57,576 --> 00:01:02,706
all stress responses. In fact, new research has shown that different emotions

14
00:01:02,706 --> 00:01:06,418
can actually produce different activation patterns in a autonomic nervous

15
00:01:06,418 --> 00:01:11,286
system. Which call for some question of the validity of the general adoption

16
00:01:11,286 --> 00:01:14,998
syndrome never the less this model does serve as an overview of how are bodies

17
00:01:14,998 --> 00:01:18,550
might react with stressful event.
