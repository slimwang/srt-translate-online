1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
It turns out it doesn't really depend on whether the graph

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
is done through sparse that's captured in M.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Right. So if the M is dense that means it's sort of order in squared. If it's sparse, it's lower n.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
So what have we already captured in terms of n and M, so it's not that one.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
It depends on the degree or amount--it turns out we're going to have to do the same amount of work

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
if there's nodes that have very, very high degree or if there's nodes that have very, very low degree.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
We still end up having to do a certain amount of work for each edge.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
It doesn't matter how to clump the nodes--it matters how many they are total.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
It's this one--it depends on how "find shortest" is implemented.
