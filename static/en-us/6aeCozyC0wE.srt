00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,650
Let's look at the solution for
our Direct-Mapped Cache map access Quiz.

2
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:07,110
We have these four axises in this cache.

3
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:09,650
The cache block is 32 bytes.

4
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:11,831
And there are eight blocks in the cache.

5
00:00:11,831 --> 00:00:18,356
So the address break down will
be the offset bits will be 5.

6
00:00:18,356 --> 00:00:21,406
Because we need five bits to
tell us which of the 32 bytes we

7
00:00:21,406 --> 00:00:22,980
are talking about.

8
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:26,870
The index bits will be three,
because we need

9
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:31,340
three bits to tell us which of
the eight slots in the cache to use.

10
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:33,440
And the remaining bits
are going to be the tag.

11
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:38,170
Now let's consider which of
these map where in the cache.

12
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:43,150
As you can see, the least significant
eight bits are going to determine

13
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:46,100
where in the cache something goes.

14
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:52,560
So we can conveniently look at just
the least significant two hex digits.

15
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:56,350
1F 0001 1111.

16
00:00:56,350 --> 00:01:01,760
Five bits are the offset,
and 000 is the index.

17
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,510
So this goes here.

18
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:07,974
3F2F has 0010 here and

19
00:01:07,974 --> 00:01:12,890
then 11111 but it goes to index 1.

20
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:18,960
3F2E has two and then E,
it also maps here.

21
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:24,210
Because it is actually
the same block as this one.

22
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:29,050
They will both be in this slot here
because really the entire block

23
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:31,084
3F2 something is there.

24
00:01:31,084 --> 00:01:36,327
And finally 3E1F is
going to map to 001 F,

25
00:01:36,327 --> 00:01:41,166
so the index is zero,
and it's a different

26
00:01:41,166 --> 00:01:45,480
block from the one we had previously.

27
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,960
So this one will be replaced by this.

28
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:54,169
The final content of the cache
really is that the block

29
00:01:54,169 --> 00:01:59,390
3E1 something is here and
3F2 something is here.
