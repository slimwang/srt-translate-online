00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,870
So let's see if we can figure out what
the directory will be doing in a MOESI

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:08,109
protocol if we have 4 cores
numbered 0 through 3 and

3
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:12,840
if a directory slice for
location A is in slice 0.

4
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:17,379
If what happens is this, core 0 reads A,

5
00:00:17,379 --> 00:00:21,158
core 0 writes A, core 1 reads A.

6
00:00:21,158 --> 00:00:28,970
Core 2 reads A, core 3 reads A,
and then core 0 writes A again.

7
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:34,050
The question for you is in this
sequence of accesses, assuming

8
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:40,090
that A's not in any of the caches
at the beginning of this, how many

9
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:47,300
requests are sent by these caches to the
directory only counting the requests?

10
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:52,000
Then the directory forwards these
requests through how many messages?

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,160
Note that it need not be
the same number here.

12
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:59,350
As a result of sending these, the
directory gets how many responses and

13
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:00,820
replies?

14
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:05,720
And finally, how many responses
does the directory send itself?

15
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:09,510
Again, the protocol is MOESI for
this course, and

16
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:11,820
we have a directory
protocol with 4 cores.
