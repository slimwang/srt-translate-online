00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The next question I want to address is the one of resources.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Resources are things like this pile of nuts and bolts that are used somewhere in a plan.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Of course, resources could be handled just in the language of classical planning.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Here we have a description of a problem domain in classical planning language.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
The goal is to get an assembly inspected,

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
and in order to do that, we have the action of inspecting,

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
which looks at an assembly which has five nuts and bolts

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
which each have to be fastened to each other.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
If that precondition is satisfied, then the effect is that the assembly is inspected.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
We have an action of fastening a nut and bolt to the assembly,

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
which requires a nut and a bolt, and the result is that they're fastened

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
and that the nut and bolt are no longer available for use.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Initially we have four nuts and five bolts.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Now the question is with this description of this problem can we achieve the goal?

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Assuming that we have a depth-first tree search planner,

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
how many paths would that planner have to consider?

17
00:01:10,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Would it be 1, 4, 5, 4 +5, 4 * 5, 4! + 5!, or 4! * 5!?
