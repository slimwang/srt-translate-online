00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,469
In this lesson we took an in-depth look at the PThreads library.

2
00:00:03,469 --> 00:00:08,240
We talked about PThreads Creation, Mutexes, Condition Variables, and we compared

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,050
these constructs to the constructs that were proposed in Birrell's paper.

4
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:16,070
We spent some time talking about common practices when it comes to PThreads,

5
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:17,970
as well as some safety tips.

6
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:20,900
And then we looked at how to compile PThread programs.

7
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:23,080
And then walk through several programming examples.
