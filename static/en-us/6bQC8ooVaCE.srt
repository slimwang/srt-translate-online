Here are the four perfect squares. Great job if you got those correct. We know

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:07,260
we can use the perfect square pattern to figure out how to write each

3
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:10,988
expression. We can look at the last term and take the square root of it to

4
00:00:10,988 --> 00:00:15,572
figure out what should go inside the parentheses. Also, since our middle term

5
00:00:15,572 --> 00:00:18,920
here is positive, we note that the sign that we'll use over here will also be

6
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:23,200
positive. And these last two cases, the sign here for the middle term was

7
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:26,250
negative, which means that the sign on the b term would be negative and our

8
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:31,269
answer. If you're ever in doubt if you have a perfect square, simply multiply

9
00:00:31,269 --> 00:00:35,200
out this to see if you get this trinomial. It should work.
