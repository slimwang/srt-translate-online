1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,969
So basically what we're interested in is taking two images,

2
00:00:02,969 --> 00:00:07,890
these two images are perfectly the, aligned, they're the same size, and so

3
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:09,740
in essence this basically means that each and

4
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:15,020
every pixel in between these two images is the same, except one gets the hand,

5
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:17,950
the one that is basically getting from the camera itself.

6
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:21,440
And the other one gets all of the stuff that's on the screen.

7
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:26,296
Since they're exactly the same size, and same aspect ratio and aligned.

8
00:00:26,296 --> 00:00:26,980
What we basically, not,

9
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:32,470
need to do do is take the pixels from this one, and merge it with that one.

10
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:35,640
So this basically means is if I refer to this.

11
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,250
As image a, and this one as image b,

12
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:42,500
which basically means all pixels in this one would be referred to a and

13
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,690
therefore what basically means is I have a new function now which takes all

14
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:51,070
the elements of a and b and does various types of mathematical operations on it.

15
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:55,560
For example, it could be just a simple average, where I take a pixel from a,

16
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,910
take a pixel from b.

17
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:59,140
And divide it by 2, and give me a new value.

18
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:01,430
And this is what the output of that one would be.

19
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:03,910
So this one would be also where you basically kind of

20
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:05,690
see transparency artifacts.

21
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:07,030
That you already kind of know about.

22
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:11,320
Because in essence by doing this, you've kind of half the.

23
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:15,580
You know, creating half alpha, that is 0.5 alpha if we generate pixels from

24
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:20,750
this image, 0.5 of pixels from this image, added them together to generate this,

25
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:22,930
of course, that's why some things look transparent.

26
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:25,380
Here, of course, you see my hand is much lighter color, and

27
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:29,810
the, and the pen also looks a little lighter.

28
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:33,430
Of course, a normal form blend really would be just take the base layer,

29
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:37,000
b, and not actually part of anything from a.

30
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,430
But of course, you can now image this starts giving us lots of

31
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:41,940
additional tools how to do this.
