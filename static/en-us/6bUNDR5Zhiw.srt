1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:05,810
A major short coming of using pairwise
key exchange based on a shared secret,

2
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:07,970
is that it cannot scale.

3
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:13,160
That is, suppose we use a shared
master keys as a way to establish and

4
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:15,470
exchange a new session key.

5
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:17,570
This scheme does not scale easily.

6
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:21,410
That is Alice needs to share
a master key with Bob, and

7
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:25,540
then another master key with Carol,
and so on and so forth.

8
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:31,750
Using a Key Distribution Center, or KDC,
can solve this scalability problem.

9
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:37,500
Each party has his or
her own master key shared with the KDC.

10
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:42,630
That is, the KDC has many master keys,
one for each party.

11
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:47,730
But each party only keeps one
master key that is shared with KDC.

12
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:52,790
So, for example,
Alice has KA that is shared with KDC.

13
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:56,510
And Bob has KB that is shared with KDC.

14
00:00:56,510 --> 00:01:01,540
Now, suppose Alice and Bob wants to
have a secure session, therefore,

15
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:03,850
they need a session key KS.

16
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:08,610
First, Alice sends a request
to KDC saying that,

17
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:12,750
I need a key to talk to Bob
along with a nonce and 1.

18
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:14,760
A nonce is a random value.

19
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:19,850
Then, the KDC sends a message
back to Alice that's encrypted

20
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:25,190
using the master key KA that is
shared between Alice and KDC.

21
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:31,140
This message contains the session
key KS that the KDC just created for

22
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:32,780
Alice and Bob to share.

23
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:38,530
The message also contains the same
request that Alice sent to KDC

24
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:45,000
along with the same nonce value,
N1 and a message record ticket.

25
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,270
The ticket is encrypted
using the master key KP that

26
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:52,330
is shared between Bob and the KDC.

27
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:57,080
And it contains session key KS and
the ID of Alice.

28
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:59,410
When Alice gets back
the message from the KDC,

29
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:04,570
she can decrypt it because
she has the master key, KA.

30
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:08,288
And so,
she can extract the session key KS.

31
00:02:08,288 --> 00:02:13,120
And she knows that the message is from
the KDC, and it's fresh, that is,

32
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:19,160
it is not a replay, because only
the KDC can use KA to equip properly

33
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:24,400
a message that contains the original
request and the nonce that she just set.

34
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,370
Alice then sends the ticket to Bob.

35
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:32,090
Note that only Bob can decrypt
the ticket, because it is encrypted

36
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:37,200
using KB, the master key shared
between Bob and the KDC.

37
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:42,710
In fact, when Bob decrypts the ticket,
he knows that the ticket is created

38
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:48,380
by the KDC because only the KDC can
encrypt the ID of Alice properly.

39
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:50,930
And he knows that the session key,

40
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:56,140
KS was created by KDC and
is for communication with Alice.

41
00:02:56,140 --> 00:03:01,770
Then Bob sends a message that contains
a nonce N2, which is a random value,

42
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:07,390
and it's ID encrypted,
using the session key KS to Alice.

43
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:11,110
When Alice receives this message,
she knows that

44
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:15,740
she is communicating with Bob, because
only he can decrypt the ticket and

45
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:19,920
get a session key, Ks, and
encrypt the ID properly.

46
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:24,190
Alice then performs an agreed
upon transformation on N2.

47
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:27,060
Say, add 100 to N2 and

48
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:31,730
encrypt the result using KS,
and sends it back to Bob.

49
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:35,780
This proves to Bob that he
is communicating with Alice

50
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:38,500
because only she has the session key KS.
