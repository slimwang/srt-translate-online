1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:06,520
Well, MacOS and Windows are the
commercial systems that most of you use.

2
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:09,040
Neither one of them
actually support BLP.

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:14,060
These vendors choose not do that,
for business reasons, or whatever.

4
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:18,760
So security enhanced Linux or
SELinux actually does do that.

5
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:23,845
The NSA was of course keen on having
operating systems that supported

6
00:00:23,845 --> 00:00:28,720
BLP-like models because they have
information that is classified.

7
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,610
And if the vendors are not going to do,
they did support an open-source effort

8
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:35,920
to build security
enhanced Linux to include

9
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,380
the SELinux kernel module that actually
supports these kind of policies.

10
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:43,200
So, SELinux is out there now.

11
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,110
You can actually use it.

12
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:50,380
SCOMP is a system actually that
goes back to late 70s, early 80s.

13
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:53,860
This was an effort between Honeywell and

14
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:56,850
DOD and
the goal was to do sort of hardware.

15
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:01,060
So this is Secure Communications
Processor, that's what this stands for.

16
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:04,090
Was to build a system that
actually can get an A1.

17
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:09,900
So in a TCC criteria that we had,
the version a,

18
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:14,170
a1 it supports mandatory access control,
verified design, and things like that.

19
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:17,720
It's only the highest one, so that's
what this system aimed for, and so

20
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:21,080
it did obviously implement
mandatory access control and

21
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,560
in particular BLP-like models for it.
