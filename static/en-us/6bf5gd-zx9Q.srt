00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:05,170
You might know that there's an annual
contest to implement the fastest sort.

2
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:07,520
Visit sortbenchmark.org for details.

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:12,820
If you didn't before, you now have
the chops to enter and kick butt.

4
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:16,750
Now, that sorting competition
focuses on disk-to-disk sorting.

5
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:20,630
But if you go read about the basic
schemes that different teams have used

6
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:25,140
over time, they're basically variants of
the sampling or the bucketing schemes.

7
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:28,290
And now that you've finished this
lesson, you know what that means.

8
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,190
Well, more or less, hopefully more.

9
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:35,770
As of September 2014 the fastest system

10
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:39,420
managed to sort seven
terabytes in a minute.

11
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:41,380
Now compare that to the first
year of the competition,

12
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:45,198
1995, when a team sorted just
over 1 GB of data in a minute.

13
00:00:45,198 --> 00:00:49,788
That's a 7,000 fold improvement,

14
00:00:49,788 --> 00:00:53,333
over 20 years, 7,000!

15
00:00:53,333 --> 00:00:57,367
Think about that, that is [BLEEP] crazy!

16
00:00:57,367 --> 00:00:59,070
Crazy!

17
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:03,466
That means that the amount of data you
can sort in a minute has doubled roughly

18
00:01:03,466 --> 00:01:08,292
every 1.6 years which, curiously enough,
is right in line with Moore's law.
