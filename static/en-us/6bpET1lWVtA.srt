1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,410
The lack of deaths in the brewery is perhaps a less salient part of

2
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:06,720
John Snow's map, but it's certainly an interesting one.

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:11,050
As it turns out, the brewery gave an unlimited beer allowance to its workers,

4
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:14,310
and since the fermentation process killed the cholera bacteria,

5
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:16,230
none of the workers contracted the disease.

6
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,350
You can read more about the outbreak and

7
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:22,030
John Snow's discovery in the instructor notes.

8
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:25,730
His work in visualization with a start of modern epidemiology.

9
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:28,450
John Snow demonstrated how data visualization can be

10
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:30,870
used to trace the spread of disease.

11
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:35,220
In this case, a single pump carrying contaminated water throughout a community.

12
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:40,320
Here's a different interactive visualization that comes from The Guardian,

13
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,940
which encodes missing values in a slightly different way.

14
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:47,990
This visualization dis, displays the extent to which gay rights are protected by

15
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:50,600
law in each of the states as of May 2012.

16
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:54,150
States that have no laws or

17
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:57,710
that are unclear about the laws have this light grey coloring.

18
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:01,630
And states that prohibit or ban gay rights have the striped pattern.

19
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:05,530
For example, many states in the northeast have employment laws which

20
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:08,970
prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender.

21
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:13,200
While most states in the southeast and

22
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,350
many in the midwest lack such employment laws.

23
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:19,830
This is an interesting visualization because it makes use of texture or

24
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:23,510
pattern to represent different aspects about the states.

25
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:27,490
For example, this outer red ring displays many states that prohibit or

26
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:28,880
ban same sex marriage.

27
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:33,790
And this darker blue inner ring shows a few states that do

28
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:38,660
not permit adoption by a single person or joint adoption by same sex couples.

29
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:42,530
Between this visualization and John Snow's map we can see that

30
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:46,870
there are many ways to encode values of zero, missing values, or

31
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:51,160
perhaps other categorical values of data like in this visualization.

32
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,700
So now I'd like to turn it over to you.
