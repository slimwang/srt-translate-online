00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,100
For a quiz, I would like you
to take a look at a paper,

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:06,130
Distributed Shared Memory: Concepts and
Systems.

3
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:10,070
This was an older survey paper that
describes several implementations

4
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:12,860
of distributed shared memory systems,
and

5
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:17,700
compares them along multiple dimensions
that we will discuss in this lesson.

6
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:21,090
The specific question you need
to answer is the following.

7
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:24,110
According to the paper
Distributed Shared Memory: Concepts and

8
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:29,260
Systems, what is a common task
that's implemented in software,

9
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:33,830
in hybrid, hardware plus software,
DSH implementations?

10
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:37,660
The choices are prefetch pages,
address translation, or

11
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:39,560
triggering invalidations.

12
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:43,120
As a hint go straight to page 76 of

13
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:47,170
the original paper PDF that's linked
in the instructor's notes and

14
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:50,750
start reading at the hybrid
DSM implementations heading.

15
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:55,470
So you don't have to read the entire
paper, but I do encourage you to do so

16
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:59,610
if you have a chance or at least to look
at it in a little bit more detail than

17
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:02,580
just jumping to this hybrid
DSM implementation section.
