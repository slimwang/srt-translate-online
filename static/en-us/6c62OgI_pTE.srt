00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:04,400
Now, I'd like to talk about a different error. I've on purpose made that error

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,860
over here. So have a look at the code and tell me what you think is the

3
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:13,550
problem. Is the code so bad that it won't compile? Or will the code run with

4
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:17,460
some errors? Or is the code just inefficient? Maybe gas consumed should be an

5
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:21,740
instance variable? Or is it inefficient in a different way? Maybe miles driven

6
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:25,970
should be a local variable. Okay, have a look, and if you like you can try it

7
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:27,465
out in BlueJ.
