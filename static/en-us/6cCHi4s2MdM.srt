00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,010
Let's discuss the architecture of IPSec.

00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:07,650
Security policy specifies more
protection is needed at IP layer.

00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:11,500
The security mechanisms include
a key exchange protocol for

00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:16,250
negotiating protection parameters,
including cryptographic algorithms and

00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:19,740
keys, and
two types of protections, ESP and.
