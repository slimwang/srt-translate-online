00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,880
I'm Liz Keleher, I'm a program
manager and I work here at Udacity.

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:06,910
I was a classroom teacher for ten years.

3
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:11,070
And now, since leaving the classroom and
working for ed tech companies for

4
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:14,580
about the past five years and
been working side by side with

5
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:18,320
programmers in what you might
call tech adjacent roles.

6
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,610
And I still have had that
underlying lack of confidence and

7
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:25,360
I feel a little intimidated
to ask questions,

8
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:27,658
because I'm not sure if I'm
asking the right questions.

9
00:00:27,658 --> 00:00:30,960
And so I've just really felt that
maybe I'm being inefficient by not

10
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,990
understanding more about the world
of programming, so I really wanted

11
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:39,300
to jump in and try to learn, really,
to just be better at what I do.

12
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:43,270
And also, I'm a business owner, and
I own a couple of writing stores, and

13
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:47,130
we have a website that I've been able
to just jump in there and use some of

14
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:52,122
my new HTML and CSS skills to work
on it, and make it more appealing.

15
00:00:52,122 --> 00:00:56,010
The more you can find out about
the different career options

16
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:56,970
there are the better.

17
00:00:56,970 --> 00:01:00,280
We don't work in a world where you have
to pick one path and stick in it for

18
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:03,670
the rest of your life, in fact
a lot of things have blurred lines.

19
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:07,480
But you can also work in places where
you may be one thing on paper but

20
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,850
you're getting your hands into
a lot of other areas, too.
