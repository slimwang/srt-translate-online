Have you ever experienced a time that you think that you under performed or

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,494
optimally performed because of your arousal level. For example, have you ever

3
00:00:07,494 --> 00:00:10,140
given a speech that you knew by heart, but when you were on stage, and you were

4
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:12,786
really nervous and all the caffeine you drank, made you really shaky, so you

5
00:00:12,786 --> 00:00:17,940
messed up. Something like that ever happen to you? Try to think of something.

6
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:20,441
I'm sure there's been a time that you either did really well, or not so well

7
00:00:20,441 --> 00:00:23,024
because, I don't know, you didn't get enough sleep, or you were too anxious,

8
00:00:23,024 --> 00:00:27,145
things like that, and write it here. And this could also be a really good time

9
00:00:27,145 --> 00:00:29,760
for you to discuss this with your peers on the forums.
