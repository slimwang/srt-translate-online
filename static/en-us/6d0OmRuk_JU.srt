1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:04,090
A row class of 100% of the page width.

2
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:08,080
Well, this seems pretty necessary because we want each row of columns to take up

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,980
as much space as they can.

4
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:12,840
So we will check that off because we need it.

5
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:16,460
That means that we won't need a row of one twelfth of the page width

6
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:19,240
because we're going to cut up the row into columns.

7
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:22,920
Are we only going to need a column of one twelfth of the page width?

8
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:23,580
No.

9
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:26,950
In fact, we're going to need columns of everything between one twelfth and

10
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:28,890
12 over 12 page widths.

11
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:32,420
By defining columns for any size between 1 over 12 and

12
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:35,610
12 over 12 page widths, we'll be able to create content and

13
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:39,830
columns that takes up as much or as little of the grid as we'd like.

14
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:43,100
This means that of course this last answer can't be right because only

15
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:46,590
creating these three classes won't give us enough flexibility.

16
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:50,510
It's worth noting that the fraction 1 over 12 is equivalent to 8.33%,

17
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:55,650
2 over 12 is equal to 16.66% and so

18
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:58,800
on all the way up to 12 over 12 being equal to 100%.

19
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,070
You'll be using these numbers soon.
