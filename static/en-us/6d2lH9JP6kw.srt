1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So, for this one, we want to apply total probability.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
This thing over here is the same as probability of test 2 to be positive,

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
which I'm going to abbreviate with a +2 over here,

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
conditioned on test 1 being positive and me having cancer

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
times the probability of me having cancer given test 1 was positive plus

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
the probability of test 2 being positive conditioned on test 1 being positive

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
and me not having cancer times the probability of me not having cancer

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
given that test 1 is positive.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
That's the same as the theorem of total probability,

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
but now everything is conditioned on +1.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Take a moment to verify this.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Now, here I can plug in the numbers.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:57,000
You already calculated this one before, which is approximately 0.043,

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:05,000
and this one over here is 1 minus that, which is 0.957 approximately.

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
And this term over here now exploits conditional independence,

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
which is given that I know C, knowledge of the first test

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
gives me no more information about the second test.

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
It only gives me information if C was unknown, as was the case over here.

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
So, I can rewrite this thing over here as follows:

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
P of +2 given that I have cancer.

21
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I can drop the +1, and the same is true over here.

22
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
This is exploiting my conditional independence.

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I knew that P of +1 or +2 conditioned on C

24
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,000
is the same as P of +2 conditioned on C and +1.

25
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I can now read those off my table over here,

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:58,000
which is 0.9 times 0.043 plus 0.2,

27
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
which is 1 minus 0.8 over here times 0.957,

28
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,000
which gives me approximately 0.2301.

29
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
So, that says if my first test comes in positive,

30
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I expect my second test to be positive with probably 0.2301.

31
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
That's an increased probability to the default probability,

32
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
which we calculated before, which is the probability of any test,

33
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:38,000
test 2 come in as positive before was the normalizer of Bayes rule which was 0.207.

34
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
So, my first test has a 20% chance of coming in positive.

35
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
My second test, after seeing a positive test,

36
00:02:47,000 --> 99:59:59,999
has now an increased probability of about 23% of coming in positive.
