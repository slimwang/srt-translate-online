00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,767
What do we know about our line at this point? I'm not really interested in

2
00:00:03,767 --> 00:00:07,825
things that we can figure out. There are a lot of things that we can figure out.

3
00:00:07,825 --> 00:00:11,818
But just things that we know explicitly right now. Do we know its y intercept,

4
00:00:11,818 --> 00:00:15,795
its x intercept? Its slope? Or 1 point that lies on it? You can pick as many of

5
00:00:15,795 --> 00:00:17,873
these answers as you think are correct.
