00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
[Norvig] There's an old saying that there's a joker in every deck.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
In this exercise we're going to allow for jokers.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
In fact, we're going to have 2 kinds of jokers.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
There's going to be a black joker and a red joker.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
The idea is that if you have a joker as one of the cards in your hand

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
you can replace it with any other card of the same color.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
So if you get the black joker, you can replace it with any spade or club of any rank,

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
and the red joker, you can replace it with any heart or diamond of any rank.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
And what you're asked to do is write a function, best<u>wild</u>hand(hand),

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:39,000
that tries all possibilities for jokers and comes up with the best 5-card selection.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Like before, hand might be more than 5 cards--it could be 7 cards--

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
and you still have to come up with the best 5-card answer that substitutes in

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
one of the appropriate cards for any jokers that exist in the hand.

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Here are some tests.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
This test says here's a hand where we're doing pretty good.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
We already have a straight--6, 7, 8, 9, T--but we also have a wild card,

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,000
and we can use that wild card, that joker, and replace it with a jack rather than a 10,

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
and now we get a slightly higher straight.

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
We have a straight with a jack high rather than a 10 high.

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Here's an example where we have two 10s but we have 2 wild cards,

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:31,000
so we can add in 10s for both of them, and we end up with four 10s, four of a kind.

22
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
And here's an example where we show that even if there aren't any jokers

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
we still come up with the right answer.

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
And I should say that the hint still holds--that itertools is still your friend.
