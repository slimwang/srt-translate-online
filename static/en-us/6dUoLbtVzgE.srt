00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,260
Now it's time to put together the background

2
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:04,939
technology that I introduced to you, plus some

3
00:00:04,939 --> 00:00:08,870
more, and describe to you a particular distributor

4
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:11,970
file system called XFS which is also built at

5
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:16,645
UC Berkeley. XFS builds on the shoulders of

6
00:00:16,645 --> 00:00:19,670
periodic technologies. The first one, the log based

7
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:21,450
striping that I just mentioned to you from

8
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:25,374
the Zebra file system. And another technology called co-operative

9
00:00:25,374 --> 00:00:31,060
cashing which is also a prior UC Berkley project. And in addition to these two

10
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:38,330
technologies, XFS also has introduced several new nuances in order to make

11
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:41,450
the distributor file system truly scalable and

12
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:44,240
get towards what is called serverlessness, or

13
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,340
in other words, no reliance on a

14
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:50,640
central server. And those techniques include dynamic

15
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,640
management of data and metadata. Subsetting of

16
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,840
the storage servers, and we'll talk about

17
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:00,190
all of these techniques in much more detail in the rest of this lecture.
