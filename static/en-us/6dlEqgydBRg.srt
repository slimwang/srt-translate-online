1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,517
To find the roots we need to replace y with 0 and then we just isolate x. After

2
00:00:04,517 --> 00:00:08,919
a slight bit of arranging we've x squared equals negative 4. We can already

3
00:00:08,919 --> 00:00:13,126
recognize at this point that is going to need to be an imaginary number.

4
00:00:13,126 --> 00:00:17,797
Otherwise when we squared we wouldn't end up with negative. When we take the

5
00:00:17,797 --> 00:00:22,311
square root of both sides here, we need to make sure that 1 of the sides has a

6
00:00:22,311 --> 00:00:27,228
plus or minus before the radical sign. And simplifying the right side, gives us

7
00:00:27,228 --> 00:00:29,304
that x is equal to plus or minus 2i.
