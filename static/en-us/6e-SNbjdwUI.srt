1
00:00:00,002 --> 00:00:08,532
What will happen to
shopping list plus plus.

2
00:00:08,532 --> 00:00:10,960
What will happen to shopping list plus

3
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:22,660
plus.
>> Okay, that's the last of it.

4
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:31,360
I'm going to take this
box out to the curb now.

5
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:34,080
I got one more really hard thing to do.

6
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:39,558
>> Okay.

7
00:00:50,735 --> 00:00:51,520
>> Hey there.

8
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,220
So, I've done great at
our Internet connections.

9
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,610
The video is a bit spotty.

10
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:56,840
I'm switching to voice.

11
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:01,430
I've got some bad news.

12
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:03,349
Shopping list plus plus
is officially bankrupt.

13
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:06,760
You know we had a good run.

14
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:10,360
But after we hit more than 100,000
users, we just couldn't keep up.

15
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:12,410
Even with your rock
solid coding abilities.

16
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:17,750
This is one of the hardest
calls I've had to make.

17
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:19,850
But I'm afraid I'm going
to have to let you go.

18
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:21,910
Seeing a shopping list plus
plus isn't the company anymore.

19
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:26,790
I know, I know it's terrible.

20
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:28,470
And I am so, so sorry.

21
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:33,190
But since we've got enough capital
to have you on for another week or

22
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:36,340
so, maybe you could spend a little bit
of time going into the engineering

23
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:38,630
specifics of why this all
happened in the first place.

24
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:41,720
Let's go over the data
schema one last time.

25
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,480
As you probably remember.

26
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,810
We had that big data redesign.

27
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:50,490
Now, unfortunately I was more
involved on the Android app side.

28
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:55,080
And I wasn't closely following what our
data engineers did to our database.

29
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,530
But here's a bit of example code for

30
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:59,410
the redesigned that shows
the basic data structure.

31
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:02,110
Obviously the production code was
a lot bigger than the small data

32
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:04,090
sample that I'm going
to show you right now.

33
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:06,920
Basically what the data team did,
was they stored the shopping lists that

34
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:10,199
the user owned within
the users themselves.

35
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:13,020
So here, under Walter,
we can see all the lists that he owns.

36
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:16,590
And each list has all of
its details including

37
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:17,799
all of its shopping list items.

38
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:21,060
Everything seemed to be going fine.

39
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:25,920
But when we had our big surge of users
in August, things just slowed to a halt.

40
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,220
Reviews of the app especially
complained about the shared pages and

41
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:31,668
the main shopping list page being very,
very slow.

42
00:02:31,668 --> 00:02:35,480
So now ShoppingList++ is ruined.

43
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,675
Not to mention my personal finances.

44
00:02:37,675 --> 00:02:40,670
J.P. is also looking into
what exactly happened.

45
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:43,710
But until then,
maybe you can give me your thoughts.

46
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:47,130
Looking at this data structure,
tell me what do you think happened?

47
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:47,900
What did we do wrong?
