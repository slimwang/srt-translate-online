00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:04,652
So, what do you think the domain of f of g of x is? Well, you may be tempted to

2
00:00:04,652 --> 00:00:08,373
say all the real numbers since we found earlier that f composed of g equals

3
00:00:08,373 --> 00:00:13,185
negative x squared. But I'll tell you right now that all real numbers is not

4
00:00:13,185 --> 00:00:17,101
the Cartesian answer. Think about how we created f of g of x and you may come

5
00:00:17,101 --> 00:00:21,272
up with the answer. I'll give you a hint that you should probably consider the

6
00:00:21,272 --> 00:00:24,310
domain of the input and think about how that's going to affect the domain of

7
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:29,035
our composite function. This is definitely a challenge problem so if you don't

8
00:00:29,035 --> 00:00:30,529
get it, no big deal.
