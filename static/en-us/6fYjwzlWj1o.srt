00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:02,805
Well let's take a look at the dimensions of this table.

2
00:00:02,805 --> 00:00:06,974
Every node participates in every step, so each step takes order of N work,

3
00:00:06,974 --> 00:00:11,148
and we're doubling the hop count on each step, thus there's log of N steps,

4
00:00:11,148 --> 00:00:14,684
so it takes N log N work to construct the entire table.

5
00:00:14,684 --> 00:00:19,023
Note this is more expensive than the serial algorithm which takes linear work, order of N work.

6
00:00:19,023 --> 00:00:21,843
However, the serial algorithm also takes N steps,

7
00:00:21,843 --> 00:00:24,901
whereas, we're finishing N log N steps here.
