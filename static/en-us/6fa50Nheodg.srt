00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:03,670
That's right. Only files that can be statically served can

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:06,080
go in the CACHE section. If the file needs to

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,530
be interpreted by the server, say, a Python script, it

4
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:12,390
really can't go in the cache section. Now, if your

5
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:16,180
application is a collection of funny cat videos, of course,

6
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:18,700
you may have some of those in your application and

7
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:22,840
in the cache. But keep in mind that some implementations

8
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:26,040
have limits on the size of a single application cache.

9
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:28,340
Sometimes that limit is as small as five

10
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:31,150
megabytes. So, that might not do Fluffy justice.
