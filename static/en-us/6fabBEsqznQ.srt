1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,390
Now, let's imagine that this program needed an object that

2
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:06,640
bears a resemblance to this gold one that we already made.

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:10,420
To achieve this, perhaps we could start by building a new object and

4
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:14,100
giving it all the same values stored at all the same keys.

5
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:17,490
We'll make a new object called blue and we'll start making it

6
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:21,840
look exactly like the gold object by copying the properties over one at a time.

7
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,460
Incidentally, there are helper functions out there that can help you copy all of

8
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:27,730
the properties from one object onto another.

9
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:29,200
It doesn't come with the language, but

10
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:32,299
you could imagine doing the exact same thing with a simple foreloop.

11
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:35,170
This arrow represents the process of copying over each of

12
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:38,190
the properties from the gold object to the blue object.

13
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:41,270
Now, although the effect of this copy operation on

14
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:44,040
the blue object will last indefinitely.

15
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,880
It's important to remember that the copying happens just at

16
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,560
one moment during the program's execution.

17
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:52,230
It is not an ongoing copying back and

18
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:55,550
forth behavior that keeps the two objects in sync.

19
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:59,010
In this case, there's only one property in our gold object, so

20
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:01,050
the copying process is quite simple.

21
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:04,280
The copying process is now complete and won't be repeated.

22
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:08,790
So if our program later goes on to modify gold or blue, we'd probably only

23
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:12,870
expect them to have the a property in common after those modifications.
