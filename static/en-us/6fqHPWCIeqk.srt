1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:03,298
The first one is, there is no market
demand for such certification.

2
00:00:03,298 --> 00:00:07,428
Well, security has never been
more important than it is.

3
00:00:07,428 --> 00:00:09,008
So if you can sell someone,

4
00:00:09,008 --> 00:00:12,721
you can convince somebody that
you're selling more security or

5
00:00:12,721 --> 00:00:16,555
higher level of trustworthiness,
there will be demand for it.

6
00:00:16,555 --> 00:00:18,900
So I don't think the first
option is the right one.

7
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:22,750
The second one is cost/benefit
tradeoff is really the reason.

8
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:26,520
As you move up the certification chain,
of course, is you are to do more and

9
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:29,610
more things and
you have to do them in a better way.

10
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:34,632
And there's a cost for doing more and
doing extensive testing and

11
00:00:34,632 --> 00:00:37,960
verification and
whatever that is required and that cost.

12
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:40,830
And so that the benefit
that comes from that cost,

13
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:44,160
those tradeoffs are the reason
that people don't choose to go for

14
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,080
the highest possible certification.
