Classical raytracing gives us a lot of paths from the eye into the environment.

00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:07,498
However, there are various paths ignored by this basic algorithm. What paths

00:00:07,498 --> 00:00:11,960
are ignored? Paths from the eye to the background. Paths from a light to an

00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:16,718
object to a diffuse object. Paths from a light to a mirror to an object. Or

5
00:00:16,718 --> 00:00:19,919
paths from the eye to the light itself. Check all that apply.
