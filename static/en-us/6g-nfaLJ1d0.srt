1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The answer is the Counter mode would be faster.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The reason for this is with CBC mode, there's a data dependency.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Then we can't start doing this encryption until we know the value of the previous ciphertext block

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
so we can't run all these encryptions in parallel.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
That's one major drawback of CBC mode.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
With Counter mode, well, we can actually compute all these encryptions

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
before we even know the message.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
These values and the expensive operation here is not the EXORs,

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
EXORs are very cheap.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Encryption is expensive. So we could actually pre-compute,

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
for a given nonce, all these encrypted counters,

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
And then once we know the contents of the file,

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
we can do those EXORs, also in parallel,

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
but those are very quick. So all of these encrypted blocks could be

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
computed in parallel using many processors.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So that's a big advantage of Counter mode over CBC mode.
