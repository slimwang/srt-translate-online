00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:04,490
To complete the first step in this
activity I will re-factor the models dot

2
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:08,973
pi to accommodate for the credentials
I can obtain from google.

3
00:00:08,973 --> 00:00:12,940
Then in my views file I'll add
the o op provider in point.

4
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:16,930
Using the same codes from the previous
video I can exchange my off code for

5
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:20,389
an access token and use it to look
up a user or create a new one.

6
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:24,500
Finally, I'll create my own token and
send it off to the client.

00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:27,970
Solutions for this activity
are available in the instructor notes.
