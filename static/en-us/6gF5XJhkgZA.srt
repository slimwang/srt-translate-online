1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:03,490
So that was the pre-conditions and as is

2
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:07,520
usually the case the pre-conditions
are easier than the post-conditions.

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:12,460
So we want to next look at the what
it means, assuming that we've past

4
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:15,140
the pre-conditions,
to actually check something out.

5
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:18,390
What affect is that going to
have on our information system.

6
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:23,148
Okay, so take a minute and think what
you expect to happen when the item is

7
00:00:23,148 --> 00:00:25,657
checked out and list them in English.

8
00:00:25,657 --> 00:00:30,630
>> So I think my mom was
the obvious post condition is

9
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:33,672
now the book's checked out.

10
00:00:33,672 --> 00:00:38,135
So a way to say that or express that I
thought wouldn't go back to that item's

11
00:00:38,135 --> 00:00:42,184
currently checked out operation that
belongs to the patron class and

12
00:00:42,184 --> 00:00:46,512
say that the set that's returned from
that operation should contain this

13
00:00:46,512 --> 00:00:49,530
new loanable item that's
been checked out.

14
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:53,890
>> So, this raises
an interesting [COUGH] issue.

15
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:57,396
So we're specifying an operation.

16
00:00:57,396 --> 00:01:01,205
And we're specifying one operation
in terms of another operation.

17
00:01:01,205 --> 00:01:02,180
Okay?.

18
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:05,360
And we can do that, that's fine.

19
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:12,350
However, the real change of state here

20
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:16,419
has to do, so
the items currently checked out.

21
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:21,220
Is a query operation
that reflects the state.

22
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:25,800
We could more directly say what's
the change in the state, okay?

23
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:30,650
So what other post
condition do you have?

24
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:34,370
>> So the other condition I have I
think is more related to this, I guess,

25
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:40,120
is that a checked out, we have that, a
class represented on our email diagram.

26
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,050
There has to be an instance
of that now for

27
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:45,770
this particular operation
that has just occurred.

28
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:46,590
>> Okay.
So

29
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:49,620
we have the association
class checked out.

30
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:50,303
>> Yes.
>> And

31
00:01:50,303 --> 00:01:53,550
[COUGH] the effect of
checking out something new

32
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:56,540
would mean that there's another
link in that association class.

33
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:58,850
>> Yes.
>> Instance of that.

34
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:03,550
And, if there is another link there,
then, by implication,

35
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:07,780
the items currently checked
out will return that new item.

36
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:08,320
>> Correct.

37
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,430
>> So
we don't have to state both of those.

38
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:12,320
>> Okay.
>> We only have to say

39
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:15,570
that the association has one more thing
in it and we get the other one for free.

40
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:20,410
However, there's another post condition.

41
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:22,300
Recall the business about requests.

42
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:25,410
Okay, so
what would the post condition there be?

43
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:31,470
>> So, the request queue is now
one less than it was prior.

44
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:33,870
Someone has such it
popped off the queue,

45
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:37,020
because a checked out
operation has occurred.

46
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:40,390
>> Well, it had better be you,
because you're doing the checking out.

47
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:42,460
We can't just get rid
of an arbitrary person.

48
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:44,830
>> The implied patron
should be the one who's-

49
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:45,552
>> Right, okay.

50
00:02:45,552 --> 00:02:50,586
So, we already have
a precondition which says that

51
00:02:50,586 --> 00:02:55,622
this particular patron is
eligible because either

52
00:02:55,622 --> 00:03:02,350
there's no request in which case
there's nothing to pop off.

53
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:07,309
Or if there is a request out there, the
first one on the list had better be you.

54
00:03:07,309 --> 00:03:14,925
So in that latter contingency we do want
to pop off your name, okay from there.

55
00:03:14,925 --> 00:03:18,048
So we're going to state the post
condition but it's going to be a little

56
00:03:18,048 --> 00:03:21,380
tricky to state because it's only in
the case where you were on the list.

57
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:24,240
>> Right, and it sounds like
an implication because we just had like

58
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,638
another only if the case of
it's a child this happens.

59
00:03:26,638 --> 00:03:30,888
So only if the case that you were
the patron on the checkout request list.

60
00:03:30,888 --> 00:03:31,863
>> Bingo.

61
00:03:31,863 --> 00:03:33,540
>> Okay, cool.
