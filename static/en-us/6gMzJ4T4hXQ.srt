00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:02,148
Lucky you, it's quiz time again.

2
00:00:02,148 --> 00:00:06,240
Suppose you want to do a matrix matrix
multiply on a machine with a two level

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,450
memory hierarchy.

4
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:10,910
Let's say the matrices are all
square end-by-end objects.

5
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:13,490
Now if you ignore
the possibility of a strassen or

6
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:18,160
faster algorithm, than the work of
the matrix multiply is O n cubed.

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,260
My question, surprise, surprise, is
what is the minimum number of transfers?

8
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:24,760
I'm looking for
an asymptotic lower bound.

9
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:28,780
Your lower bound need not be too tight
but, do try to make a reasonable guess.
