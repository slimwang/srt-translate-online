00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,760
Now let's do a quiz.

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:04,760
Mark each statement as true or false.

3
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:07,570
Use T for true and F for false.

4
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:11,900
First, the challenge values used
in an authentication protocol

5
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:14,930
can be repeatedly used
in multiple sessions.

6
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:18,460
Second, the authentication
messages can be captured and

7
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:20,710
replayed by an adversary.

8
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:23,490
Third, authentication can be one-way,
for

9
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:26,330
