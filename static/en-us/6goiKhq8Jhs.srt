1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,484
Let's, let's contrast and compare a little bit here. What I find interesting is

2
00:00:03,484 --> 00:00:07,189
that there's the game industry where we we see that a lot, because the games

3
00:00:07,189 --> 00:00:11,467
out there. and there's sort of computer aided design, which is sort of a

4
00:00:11,467 --> 00:00:14,616
different kind of a graphics, different kind of a 3D computer graphics way of

5
00:00:14,616 --> 00:00:19,141
doing things. So, well for starters, what, what, what would you say is the

6
00:00:19,141 --> 00:00:22,609
biggest difference between sort of games programming and computer-aided design

7
00:00:22,609 --> 00:00:24,294
programming?

8
00:00:24,294 --> 00:00:29,105
>> I think the end result is, is the big difference. In that, if you were playing

9
00:00:29,105 --> 00:00:31,940
a game and something happened with the visuals, you know, a frame or two goes

10
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:35,220
off. The worse that happens is your avatar dies.

11
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:39,456
>> If you mess up in a computer aided design package, people can die. It's[LAUGH],

12
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:43,173
it's just that there's, there's much more, I think I have much more invested

13
00:00:43,173 --> 00:00:48,118
in, in Autocad, because of the importance of the work that it does.

14
00:00:48,118 --> 00:00:50,575
>> Well with game design, it's, it's kind of a a limited field, in a sense, in

15
00:00:50,575 --> 00:00:52,954
that, they're in total control over the product, and there's a whole team

16
00:00:52,954 --> 00:00:54,935
working on that.

17
00:00:54,935 --> 00:00:57,973
>> Your product is different in the sense that you're selling it to people and

18
00:00:57,973 --> 00:01:02,700
they're using it for who knows what. Can you tell us some of the differences

19
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:02,744
there?

20
00:01:02,744 --> 00:01:07,457
>> Well, like I say, in games, the world and the behavior is fairly static. The

21
00:01:07,457 --> 00:01:11,115
things happen and things can move around and change, but in general, like I

22
00:01:11,115 --> 00:01:14,596
said, there's a lot of control that The, the game designers and the game

23
00:01:14,596 --> 00:01:20,819
programmers have over what's going on in the game. Whereas with the CAD system,

24
00:01:20,819 --> 00:01:25,219
our users can do pretty much anything. And an interesting this is that CAD

25
00:01:25,219 --> 00:01:30,140
systems, you can view it as a way of creating content. So people can actually

26
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:33,980
write games using a CAD system to design the assests for the game And then play

27
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:39,752
the game. So, they can, they can almost interact with each other that way. But

28
00:01:39,752 --> 00:01:43,580
you need a lot more flexibility within, your, the CAD package or what, whatever

29
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:48,554
package you're using to design the assets for the game. Once you get into the

30
00:01:48,554 --> 00:01:51,626
game they're a lot of tricks that programmers play and artists in order to, to

31
00:01:51,626 --> 00:01:56,810
fake things out and for, get whatever you need done. Again, you can also deal

32
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:59,900
with the fact that if you're a little bit off one frame, it won't hap, won't

33
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:02,225
really matter because the action is moving quickly enough that you'll get right

34
00:02:02,225 --> 00:02:04,289
past it.

35
00:02:04,289 --> 00:02:07,300
>> Right. I mean, just the fact that there's a reality to, you know, whatever

36
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:10,515
you're, whatever you're building, makes sense that there's, you know, Autocad

37
00:02:10,515 --> 00:02:15,273
and so on. It really has sort of different kinds of constraints. well with

38
00:02:15,273 --> 00:02:16,925
that, for example, I mean

39
00:02:16,925 --> 00:02:21,700
>> Are their constraints as far as precision or elements like that.

40
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:24,346
>> Well, definitely we, we have to deal with things like, we have this one model

41
00:02:24,346 --> 00:02:27,466
that we use internally for a lot of testing which is the model of the solar

42
00:02:27,466 --> 00:02:35,276
system. So we have to have auto cad be able to go all the way from the, looking

43
00:02:35,276 --> 00:02:41,396
at the entire solar system down to looking at a plaque on the moon that was

44
00:02:41,396 --> 00:02:47,113
left by Neil Armstrong.

45
00:02:47,113 --> 00:02:49,900
>> [LAUGH]

46
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:52,426
>> And we need to be able to read the lettering on that plaque. So just the range

47
00:02:52,426 --> 00:02:53,970
of precision that we have to deal with can, can really blow away a lot of the

48
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:53,779
graphics hardware, so again, there're some tricks that you have to play in

49
00:02:53,779 --> 00:02:54,483
order to be able to handle the all that different resolution with only single

50
00:02:54,483 --> 00:02:55,500
precision floating point.

51
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,325
>> Can't break it.

52
00:02:56,325 --> 00:02:58,957
>> The nice thing is, that we're dealing with soft, we had our software

53
00:02:58,957 --> 00:03:02,800
implementation. Of course we had double precision, we could deal with it much

54
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,300
better but, when you, when your end result really requires single precision.

55
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,790
That's where it gets tricky.
