If we multiply each term by 2x, we'll get 4 minus 3x equals 7. Nice algebraic

2
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:11,178
thinking if you got that one correct. To get the answer, we simply simplify the

3
00:00:11,178 --> 00:00:16,074
factors in the numerator and denominator. For this first term, the x's would

4
00:00:16,074 --> 00:00:20,676
cancel to equal 1. This would leave us with 2 times 2, which equals 4. For the

5
00:00:20,676 --> 00:00:25,312
second term, the factors of 2 would cancel it to leave us with negative 3x,

6
00:00:25,312 --> 00:00:29,116
here. And for our last fraction or term, we would simply have 7.
