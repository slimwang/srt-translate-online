1
00:00:00,102 --> 00:00:03,375
The general methods of estimating shape from some queue,

2
00:00:03,375 --> 00:00:05,723
shading, texture, focus, et cetera.

3
00:00:05,723 --> 00:00:08,170
For a long time, that was a big deal in computer vision.

4
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:10,269
It was called Shape from X.

5
00:00:10,269 --> 00:00:12,249
Sort of very popular in the late 70s,

6
00:00:12,249 --> 00:00:15,621
early 80s, which I know is prehistoric history for most of you.

7
00:00:15,621 --> 00:00:20,210
But the fundamental idea was that from an image and from some assumption about

8
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:24,105
the nature of the world, like that those houses are all the same.

9
00:00:24,105 --> 00:00:26,486
And therefore, they're probably getting further away.

10
00:00:26,486 --> 00:00:28,726
The brain could compute depth and

11
00:00:28,726 --> 00:00:32,569
we wanted to build machines that could do that, as well.

12
00:00:32,569 --> 00:00:40,869
But we, and a lot of other creatures have two eyes, so that recalls stereo.

13
00:00:40,869 --> 00:00:44,289
And in stereo, the key is that the image from one eye is

14
00:00:44,289 --> 00:00:48,253
just a little bit different than the image from the other eye.

15
00:00:48,253 --> 00:00:50,378
Here I see the right side of Megan's nose and

16
00:00:50,378 --> 00:00:52,797
I here, I see the straight part of Megan's nose.

17
00:00:52,797 --> 00:00:54,561
Megan's, Megan's nose is pretty straight.

18
00:00:54,561 --> 00:00:55,259
Mine's crooked.

19
00:00:55,259 --> 00:00:59,162
Anyway, so you can think of stereo as recovering the shape from

20
00:00:59,162 --> 00:01:02,488
the motion that's between the two different views.

21
00:01:02,488 --> 00:01:06,086
And the idea is to infer that 3D shape.

22
00:01:06,086 --> 00:01:10,208
Before talking about exactly how to do that, people have been looking at

23
00:01:10,208 --> 00:01:13,462
this ability of the human brain to do this for a long time.

24
00:01:13,462 --> 00:01:14,111
And in fact,

25
00:01:14,111 --> 00:01:17,652
one of the things, cool things that showed up was stereo photography.

26
00:01:17,652 --> 00:01:23,156
So Charles Wheatstone back in the early 1800s invented the first stereo viewer.

27
00:01:23,156 --> 00:01:26,087
All right. Where you would take two pictures and then put

28
00:01:26,087 --> 00:01:30,132
them through the lenses so that each eye saw a slightly different picture.

29
00:01:30,132 --> 00:01:30,794
All right.

30
00:01:30,794 --> 00:01:34,497
So what you've got here is this wooden thing that prevents the image in

31
00:01:34,497 --> 00:01:36,711
the left eye from being seen by the right.

32
00:01:36,711 --> 00:01:40,088
And likewise, the image in the right eye from being seen by left.

33
00:01:40,088 --> 00:01:43,195
And there are these lenses here that essentially train the eye right on

34
00:01:43,195 --> 00:01:45,047
the image that's right in front of them.

35
00:01:45,047 --> 00:01:46,670
People were fascinated by this.

36
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:50,688
So here's a picture of Abraham Lincoln taken in 3D.

37
00:01:50,688 --> 00:01:54,530
So, we went from 1838 to 1860.

38
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:56,061
So just 20 some odd years and

39
00:01:56,061 --> 00:01:59,994
already you're doing 3D portraits of the President of the United States.

40
00:01:59,994 --> 00:02:02,856
So it became a really compelling thing for people to see,

41
00:02:02,856 --> 00:02:06,568
because you take this flat thing and all of a sudden, you would see depth.

42
00:02:06,568 --> 00:02:09,386
Here's a stereo pair of Thomas Edison, most invent,

43
00:02:09,386 --> 00:02:12,093
famous inventor of his age it says, probably true.

44
00:02:12,093 --> 00:02:15,069
And you can view that through a stereo viewer or you could do

45
00:02:15,069 --> 00:02:18,850
something really cool, you could make what was called anaglyph stereo.

46
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:24,469
An anaglyph stereo put down sort of red and blue imagery.

47
00:02:24,469 --> 00:02:28,539
And what that did was imagine if you're looking at a white piece of

48
00:02:28,539 --> 00:02:30,395
paper through a blue filter.

49
00:02:30,395 --> 00:02:32,041
Well, everything's blue.

50
00:02:32,041 --> 00:02:34,652
It throws away all the light except the blue and

51
00:02:34,652 --> 00:02:36,674
the white, white light has blue in it.

52
00:02:36,674 --> 00:02:39,600
So if you put blue stuff on there, it doesn't change anything.

53
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,678
So it basically, becomes invisible.

54
00:02:41,678 --> 00:02:44,882
Whereas you put a red filter in it, the blue looks very dark.

55
00:02:44,882 --> 00:02:50,374
Likewise, the you put the red image it becomes invisible to the red filter.

56
00:02:50,374 --> 00:02:52,391
And so anaglyph stereo became popular for

57
00:02:52,391 --> 00:02:54,989
a little while in cheap three-dimensional movies.

58
00:02:54,989 --> 00:03:00,613
There's a picture of those stereo viewers and this is a great picture,

59
00:03:00,613 --> 00:03:06,154
because it's a stereo image of kids looking at stereo pairs in the library and

60
00:03:06,154 --> 00:03:08,816
this is in the early 1920s.

61
00:03:08,816 --> 00:03:12,322
And the thing to realize is it gave you a certain sense of realism.

62
00:03:12,322 --> 00:03:15,646
So people used to use it to experience far away places and

63
00:03:15,646 --> 00:03:17,635
things that they couldn't see.

64
00:03:17,635 --> 00:03:18,610
Otherwise, with a,

65
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:21,867
in, with a reality that they don't get when they just look at an image.

66
00:03:21,867 --> 00:03:25,024
So for example, here's this picture of this bridge in India.

67
00:03:25,024 --> 00:03:28,129
So all of a sudden, you could feel like you were in India,

68
00:03:28,129 --> 00:03:31,642
which was different than just looking at a static picture.

69
00:03:31,642 --> 00:03:35,786
And when I grew up, a lots of us had these View Master discs.

70
00:03:35,786 --> 00:03:36,398
Okay?

71
00:03:36,398 --> 00:03:38,911
Where, where you would put the discs into the little viewer and

72
00:03:38,911 --> 00:03:41,578
you would slide it down and you would see the two different things.

73
00:03:41,578 --> 00:03:44,922
And, you know, you, you, you've got educational stuff.

74
00:03:44,922 --> 00:03:47,341
So when I was a kid, they landed on the moon and

75
00:03:47,341 --> 00:03:51,185
they made stereo photographs of men on the moon, which is really cool.

76
00:03:51,185 --> 00:03:52,840
Talk about some place you couldn't go.

77
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:56,230
Or much more importantly, you could get Spider-Man, which is really good.

78
00:03:56,230 --> 00:04:00,291
And of course, if we had the internet then, we would have known that you

79
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:04,841
could have ordered stereo porn, but we didn't know that at the time.

80
00:04:04,841 --> 00:04:08,835
Now you guys, you guys, you get three-dimensional television.

81
00:04:08,835 --> 00:04:11,796
So for you, this is hardly new and compelling at all.

82
00:04:11,796 --> 00:04:14,941
But it's basically the same principle of making sure that two

83
00:04:14,941 --> 00:04:17,370
different images are shown to each of the eyes.
