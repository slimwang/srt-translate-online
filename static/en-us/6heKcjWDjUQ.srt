1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:02,450
So let's discuss the solution to our Amdahl's

2
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:06,140
Law quiz. The program has 50 billion instructions.

3
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:09,143
This is how many instructions according to the

4
00:00:09,143 --> 00:00:13,224
instruction count: our integer 40%, branches are 1 5th

5
00:00:13,224 --> 00:00:16,227
of our instructions, stores are 10% and so

6
00:00:16,227 --> 00:00:18,922
on, and this is the original CPI, and the

7
00:00:18,922 --> 00:00:21,848
improvement we have is that the branches have

8
00:00:21,848 --> 00:00:25,175
improved from 4 to 2 CPI. If we try

9
00:00:25,175 --> 00:00:30,050
to use Amdahl's law, we might do something like this, this overall speed up

10
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:34,951
is 1 over 1 minus fraction enhanced. The fraction has its

11
00:00:34,951 --> 00:00:39,998
20% so it will be 0.80 is 1 minus that plus 0.2 is

12
00:00:39,998 --> 00:00:45,251
the fraction enhanced divided by this speed up is 2, so this

13
00:00:45,251 --> 00:00:50,350
will be 1 over 0,9 which will be 1.111. And if you did

14
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:56,650
this, you will be horribly, horribly wrong. The reason this is wrong is that

15
00:00:56,650 --> 00:01:02,990
the fraction enhanced is not as a percentage of the overall execution time

16
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:05,790
before the improvement. We said this is

17
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:09,680
how many instructions are enhanced. So branches

18
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:16,016
are 20% of the instruction count, but we don't know what percentage of execution

19
00:01:16,016 --> 00:01:19,360
time was spent on branches and execution time

20
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,950
is what we are interested here. So that

21
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:25,510
one of the possible correct solutions here is

22
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:28,130
simply to do the following. Using the iron

23
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:33,740
law, we can compute that for 40% of our instructions we were getting a CPI of

24
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:37,395
1, for 20% of the instructions we're getting

25
00:01:37,395 --> 00:01:41,332
a CPI of 4. For 30% of the instructions

26
00:01:41,332 --> 00:01:47,588
we're getting a CPI of 1 and for 10% of our instructions we are getting a CPI of

27
00:01:47,588 --> 00:01:53,752
3 multiply that by a 50 billion and multiply that by 1 over 2 billion which is

28
00:01:53,752 --> 00:01:57,353
the 2GHz. So this would be the execution time

29
00:01:57,353 --> 00:02:01,682
before the enhancement. After the enhancement, we will be

30
00:02:01,682 --> 00:02:04,266
having the same thing, except there will be a

31
00:02:04,266 --> 00:02:06,510
2 here, and if you do that, the answer

32
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:12,912
will be 1.24. In order to be able to use Amdahl's law, what we have to figure

33
00:02:12,912 --> 00:02:17,356
out is, of this execution time, what fraction were

34
00:02:17,356 --> 00:02:20,610
the branches? And if we did that, we would

35
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:22,240
be able to plug that number here and

36
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,370
here as the fraction enhanced and get the correct

37
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:28,180
answer here. So again, do not use something other

38
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:31,910
than the fraction of execution time as your fraction

39
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:34,380
enhanced, because you will not get the correct answer.
