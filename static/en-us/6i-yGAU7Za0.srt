1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:04,760
So far, we've reminded ourselves of
the basics of linear programming

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:07,330
by examining it in just two dimensions.

3
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:09,110
Then we built up some vocabulary and

4
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:13,370
notation that allows us to extend
these notions to n dimensions.

5
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:15,760
Now we're ready for
the culmination of all this work

6
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:18,290
in the fundamental theorem
of linear programming.

7
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:22,040
Which captures the idea that optimal
solutions should be at the corners,

8
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:25,200
also called extreme points
of the feasible region.

9
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,850
And that tells us that we need only
consider basic feasible solutions.

10
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:35,940
Precisely, the theorem states that given
a linear program in this standard form,

11
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:39,100
where A is an m x n matrix of rank m.

12
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:44,190
Then if there's a feasible solution,
there is a basic feasible solution.

13
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:46,569
And if there is an optimal
feasible solution,

14
00:00:46,569 --> 00:00:49,620
there is an optimal
basic feasible solution.

15
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:51,760
We'll start by proving the first point.

16
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:57,210
Let x be a feasible solution, and we'll
consider only the positive entries.

17
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:01,030
Without loss of generality,
let's assume that those are the first p.

18
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:04,580
Then it must be the case
that this linear combination

19
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:09,560
of the columns a1 through
ap is equal to b.

20
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:13,160
That is after all,
part of what it means to be feasible.

21
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,490
There are two cases.

22
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:20,490
First, suppose that the columns a1
through ap are linearly independent.

23
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:23,480
Then it's not possible that
p should be greater than m,

24
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:27,040
recall that these vectors
are only m elements long.

25
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,220
If p is equal to m, well then x
is basic already and we're done.

26
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:36,270
P could be less than m,
that would mean that x is degenerate.

27
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:40,840
But then we can just add columns to
form a linearly independent basis and

28
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,190
we would be all right.

29
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:46,680
So that then covers the case where
these columns are linearly independent.

30
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:50,400
Next, suppose that those
columns are linearly dependent.

31
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:54,850
Well, that means they
are coefficients y1 through yp.

32
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:59,710
Such that this linear combination of
the columns is equal to 0 with at

33
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:04,570
least one of the coefficients,
yi positive.

34
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:08,288
Then we're going to choose this
parameter epsilon in a very clever way.

35
00:02:08,288 --> 00:02:11,495
So that it's the minimum
of these ratios,

36
00:02:11,495 --> 00:02:17,730
xi/yi among all these i's
such that yi is positive.

37
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:21,160
Then multiplying this
equation by this epsilon, and

38
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:26,490
subtracting it from this one,
we end up with this equation here.

39
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:31,380
These coefficients must represent
another feasible solution.

40
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:33,230
But by our choice of epsilon,

41
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:37,080
we've set at least one of
these coefficients to zero.

42
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,520
All of the others have
remained positive.

43
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:42,880
So we've reduced the number
of positive entries in x.

44
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:47,340
And we can repeat this over and
over until case 1 is reached,

45
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:51,510
where a1 through ap
are linearly independent.

46
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:55,922
Now onto part two of the theorem, this
will feel similar to the first part.

47
00:02:55,922 --> 00:02:59,060
We want to show that if there
is an optimal feasible solution,

48
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:01,880
there is an optimal
basic feasible solution.

49
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:08,490
We let x be an optimal feasible solution
with non-zero entries x1 through xp.

50
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:09,510
Well it's feasible,

51
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:14,160
so this linear combination of the
columns of a then must be equal to b.

52
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,530
And because it's optimal,
it's objective value,

53
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:23,670
c transpose x must be the maximum
over all possible feasible x.

54
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:28,846
Again, we first consider the case
where the columns a1 through ap

55
00:03:28,846 --> 00:03:34,218
are linearly independent, and
the situation is the same as before.

56
00:03:34,218 --> 00:03:39,280
P being greater than m is impossible,
equal means that it's a basic solution,

57
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,771
and less just means that
it's a degenerate solution.

58
00:03:42,771 --> 00:03:44,610
This case is simple.

59
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:46,880
If these columns are linearly dependent,

60
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:51,320
then there exists a set of
coefficients y1 through yP.

61
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:54,740
Such that the linear
combination of the columns

62
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:59,920
is equal to 0 with at least
one of the y's being positive.

63
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:04,190
Note however, for epsilon sufficiently
close to zero in both the positive and

64
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:05,940
the negative direction.

65
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:08,720
X minus epsilon y is still feasible.

66
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:13,910
Multiply epsilon times this equation,
and add it to this equation, and

67
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:18,505
we end up still with a set
of coefficients equal to b.

68
00:04:18,505 --> 00:04:21,945
Thus, c transpose y
has to be equal to 0.

69
00:04:21,945 --> 00:04:26,935
If it weren't, then c transpose
x would be strictly less than

70
00:04:26,935 --> 00:04:31,015
c transpose times x minus epsilon y.

71
00:04:31,015 --> 00:04:36,870
We can choose the right sign on epsilon,
so that this inequality holds.

72
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:40,800
But this is impossible
because x is optimal.

73
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,750
We conclude that c transpose
y is equal to 0 and

74
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:49,370
then we can choose epsilon to be
the same thing we chose it before.

75
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:52,250
It'll still give us
an optimal feasible solution,

76
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:55,020
only this time it will
have smaller support.

77
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:59,260
Because we're able to choose it
to set one of the coefficients of

78
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:02,140
this vector here to zero,
that wasn't zero before.

79
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:08,280
And we can repeat playing this game over
and over until we've reached the case

80
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:11,150
where a1 through ap
are linearly independent.

81
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:15,170
We've just seen how the fundamental
theorem of linear programming

82
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:17,770
tells us that we can always
achieve an optimal value for

83
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:19,700
the program with a basic solution.

84
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:23,690
Moreover, basic solutions come
from the choice of m linearly

85
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:25,860
independent columns for the bases.

86
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,350
Remember this key point going forward.
