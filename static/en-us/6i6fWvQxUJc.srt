1
00:00:02,474 --> 00:00:05,290
You now have everything you need
to make the rest of the test pass.

2
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:07,939
Remember that this workflow may not seem
the most intuitive or easy at first,

3
00:00:07,939 --> 00:00:10,340
but it'll make sure your code works.

4
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:13,570
Now that you have everything that you
need, work through each test one by one

5
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:15,756
and until they pass,
refactor your code afterwards.

6
00:00:15,756 --> 00:00:19,451
Best of luck [SOUND]
