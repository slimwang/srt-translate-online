00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:04,303
In this lesson, you learned about estimating population parameters with

2
00:00:04,303 --> 00:00:08,857
confidence intervals and then analyzing whether or not a search and treatment

3
00:00:08,857 --> 00:00:13,125
may have had an effect. So the examples we've used so far are the Bieber

4
00:00:13,125 --> 00:00:17,923
tweeter, we wanted to see it's influence on klout scores. And then the other

5
00:00:17,923 --> 00:00:22,620
treatment was the song about hypothesis testing for lesson nine, which I

6
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:27,090
seriously might do. After all this talk about it, I'm really curious about

7
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:30,768
whether or not this will work. I guess we'll just have to wait and see the

8
00:00:30,768 --> 00:00:35,180
results of the poll where you rated your engagement and learning. Speaking of

9
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:40,045
which, that's the dependent variable. In the next lesson you'll learn how to

10
00:00:40,045 --> 00:00:44,620
formalize the procedure of deciding whether or not the sample receiving

11
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:47,653
treatment had likely or unlikely statistics.
