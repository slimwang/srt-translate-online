00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:05,000
Here is a somewhat more formal definition from the definers of

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,870
the unified software process. I'm not going to recite it for you, but

3
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:14,830
I will mention several key elements. One is architecture is all about decisions,

4
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:20,030
choices that the architect makes about how which, which components are there,

5
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:24,100
how they interact, and how the non-functional requirements are being dealt with.

6
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:29,040
As far as the components are concerned, these are structural elements, and

7
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:33,230
they're interfaces, that is what they provide to the rest of the world, and

8
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:38,580
what they require from the rest of the world. Components interact, they,

9
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:43,300
they engage in collaboration with other components, and it is the composition of

10
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:47,470
these structural and behavioral elements into larger, and

11
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:52,730
larger subsystems that form the overall architecture. This structuring, this,

12
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:58,910
this composing may be guided by architectural styles, that provide guidance

13
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:05,500
as to or bring in experience that others have had with building similar systems.

14
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:10,130
The decisions about software architecture, concern not only the structure and

15
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:12,780
behavior but other important elements,

16
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:17,760
such as usage, performance, comprehensibility, understandability,

17
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:22,260
economics, technology constraints and trade-offs and aesthetic concerns.
