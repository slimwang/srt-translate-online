1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Let's assume we have a fair coin and a loaded coin

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
and the loaded coin has a probability of heads of 0.9.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Let's assume that we know that the probability of actually having a loaded coin is zero.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:24,000
In which of these cases is the probability of being fair given the flips <0.5.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Check all that apply. Note that 4 H 0 T means four head and zero tails.
