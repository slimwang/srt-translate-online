00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,090
The first answer is ide.udacity.com. And again, that

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:05,870
makes sense for the same reason as, as

3
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:08,520
before. If the domains match, it's a simple

4
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:11,910
case. Of course this domain can set this cookie.

5
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:16,820
The second answer, other.ide.udacity.com. This basically means if

6
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:20,250
other can set a cookie for its parents.

7
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:21,939
Which works fine. What, what is not a

8
00:00:21,939 --> 00:00:25,189
correct answer is udacity.com. Other.ide can't set a cookie

9
00:00:25,189 --> 00:00:28,517
for udacity which would set to, you know, any sub-domain of

10
00:00:28,517 --> 00:00:31,725
udacity. And it can't set a cookie for, you know, a sibling.

11
00:00:31,725 --> 00:00:35,870
Other.udacity.com can't set this cookie. Only these two domains can set

12
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:38,850
this cookie. I want you to be aware that the domain you're

13
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:41,480
setting a cookie for is very important. And, you know, of

14
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:43,750
course, when you are developing software you can just experiment and see

15
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:47,148
which ones work. But these are the general rules. You know, just,

16
00:00:47,148 --> 00:00:50,720
just look for, you know, either a direct match or the server.

17
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:52,053
Or the cookie should be a subset of the

18
00:00:52,053 --> 00:00:54,670
server. And you're in and you're in good shape.
