1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:01,827
So let's turn this into a quiz.

2
00:00:01,827 --> 00:00:08,600
If we draw this line too far to the left, then we'll suffer from poor peak performance or load imbalance.

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:14,886
And if we draw it too far to the right, will we again get poor peak performance, or load imbalance?
