1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
And the most obvious answer is what's called the empirical frequency

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
where the word empirical means the same as observations, what you actually saw.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So we have 4 of the 5 coin flips gives us heads. So the obvious answer is 0.8.
