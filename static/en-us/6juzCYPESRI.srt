00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Let me illustrate this again. For any sample, you know how to compute a confidence interval.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
If the null hypothesis is inside the confidence interval of the observed sample,

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
everything is okay and you believe null hypothesis.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Conversely, if the null hypothesis falls outside, you don't believe null hypothesis

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
and you accept the alternate hypothesis.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
So simple is the hypothesis testing and you use confidence intervals instead of,

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
for example, the binomial distribution and that's really the common case.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Let me just briefly summarize what we're doing.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Given the sample of data, you compute the mean, you compute the variance,

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
you get the t-value at some desired error probability p

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
and you have to make sure you pick the correct one if it's one-sided,

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
and pick a different one for the two-sided.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Then the plus/minus term in the confidence interval is simply this number over here

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:15,000
times the square root of the empirical variance for N.

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Then I would have to be really cryptic but I've just given it to you,

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
but by now, it should make a lot of sense and because we practiced every element of it.

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The mean, the empirical variance, getting a number from a table,

18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
and then compute the size of the confidence interval which we then put into the plus/minus terms.

19
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,000
So µ minus this is the lower bound µ plus is the upper bound of the confidence interval

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
according to the confidence level specified for the error probability p.

21
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Let's put this into action--a dance club operator advertised the fact

22
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:58,000
that the average age of its client is 26.

23
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:07,000
You walk in and encounter the following people--four people are 21,

24
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:14,000
six people are 24, seven people are 26, 11 people are 29,

25
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:24,000
and two people are actually 40 years old for a total of N=30.

26
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Now, compute for mean whether you know to trust the statement that the average was 26.

27
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:37,000
And let's do so. Obviously, the fact that there is two 40-year-olds is a little bit disturbing.

28
00:02:37,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Let's do so in stages and I want to guide you through this. First, let's calculate the mean.
