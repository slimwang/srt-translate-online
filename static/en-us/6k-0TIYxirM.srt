1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The answer is, of course, all of the above.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
All of these would be good ways to test a GUI application

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
because a GUI interface, similar to an operating system interface,

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
usually represents a trust boundary.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
And what I mean here is just the fact that it's usually the case

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
that the GUI can't rely on a user to always present valid inputs.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Therefore, a GUI application needs to be ready for basically anything.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
And it turns out that when my children were younger,

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
one of them was really good at crashing Windows machines.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
You would just set him down at a Windows machine,

11
00:00:29,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and he could make it unusable within a couple of minutes of just pounding on the keyboard.
