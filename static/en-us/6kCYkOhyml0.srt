1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,051
Here's the answer.

2
00:00:01,051 --> 00:00:04,184
The only place where you have
consecutive heads is at the end of

3
00:00:04,184 --> 00:00:04,734
the list.

4
00:00:04,734 --> 00:00:08,443
The only tricky bit to remember is
that you have to run the test for

5
00:00:08,443 --> 00:00:11,822
double heads at every node in
the vertex simultaneously.

6
00:00:11,822 --> 00:00:15,382
So, both 5 and
6 will detect double heads.

7
00:00:15,382 --> 00:00:19,426
Therefore, both 5 and
6 will flip to tails.

8
00:00:19,426 --> 00:00:22,329
That leaves just three nodes with heads.

9
00:00:22,329 --> 00:00:25,539
Hence, the answer of 1, 4 and 8.
