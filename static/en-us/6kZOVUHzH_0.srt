00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,511
We talked about earthquakes earlier on in the course. And now we are going to

2
00:00:03,511 --> 00:00:07,691
talk about that something that's measured in a very similar way. Surprisingly

3
00:00:07,691 --> 00:00:13,219
this is sound. Sound is also measured on a logarithmic scale. And we can use

4
00:00:13,219 --> 00:00:18,507
this equation to help us out. This says L1 equals 10 times log base 10 of P

5
00:00:18,507 --> 00:00:25,494
over B. Now here, B is some reference volume. it's just a constant that we're

6
00:00:25,494 --> 00:00:28,134
going to eliminate eventually, so we don't need to worry about what it's

7
00:00:28,134 --> 00:00:34,276
actually equal to. The two variables we have are important, though. P is what

8
00:00:34,276 --> 00:00:38,288
is known as the power of the sound, and L here, or I'm calling it L1 in this

9
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:45,282
case, is a measure of the sound level. This is basically comparing the sound

10
00:00:45,282 --> 00:00:49,485
power P to B. Now, you may have heard about different sounds being dangerous to

11
00:00:49,485 --> 00:00:55,138
our hearing. And this equation can actually help us quantify that. L here, is

12
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:59,660
measured in decibels or dB. And looking at the decibels ratings of different

13
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:05,080
sounds it seems like a pretty small increase in the number of decibels.

14
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:10,810
Actually amounts to a pretty big increase in potential damage. So why is this?

15
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:13,719
Well, let's look at a few other questions to figure this out. So if the

16
00:01:13,719 --> 00:01:17,605
original sound power that we're talking about is p, as written in this

17
00:01:17,605 --> 00:01:21,625
equation, what will we need to use in its place if we wanted to talk about a

18
00:01:21,625 --> 00:01:25,756
sound with double that power
