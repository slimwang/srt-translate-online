1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,549
Since z equals the original value minus the mean, divided by standard deviation.

2
00:00:05,549 --> 00:00:10,675
In other words, the number of standard deviations that the original value is

3
00:00:10,675 --> 00:00:15,883
from the mean. Then a negative z score means that, the mean is greater than x.

4
00:00:15,883 --> 00:00:20,894
That must mean that x is somewhere down here. So that doesn't necessarily mean

5
00:00:20,894 --> 00:00:25,825
that the original value is negative, though it could be. It does mean that the

6
00:00:25,825 --> 00:00:31,057
original value is less than the mean. The original value is less than zero, it

7
00:00:31,057 --> 00:00:36,327
basically says the same thing as this first one, that the original value is

8
00:00:36,327 --> 00:00:41,585
negative. In this one, the original value x minus the mean is negative, must

9
00:00:41,585 --> 00:00:47,048
also be true. Because for the z score to be negative, then this is going to be

10
00:00:47,048 --> 00:00:52,741
negative, because the standard deviation is always positive. Just to review,

11
00:00:52,741 --> 00:00:58,430
remember when we calculated standard deviation, we squared all the deviations.

12
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:03,944
So all the deviations are then positive, because if you square anything negative

13
00:01:03,944 --> 00:01:08,861
or positive, you get a positive number. And then we just took the average

14
00:01:08,861 --> 00:01:14,126
squared deviation, which is still positive, and then we took the square root,

15
00:01:14,126 --> 00:01:19,396
which is still positive. So remember that this standard deviation will always be

16
00:01:19,396 --> 00:01:24,511
positive. Which means that if the z score is negative, then this numerator must

17
00:01:24,511 --> 00:01:27,981
be negative. And that must mean that x is less than mu.
