1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:04,715
We mentioned logs before, so let's actually use them now. Just like exponents

2
00:00:04,715 --> 00:00:09,340
have a base, so do logs. If, for example, like in this function we have here,

3
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:14,505
our exponent has a base of 2, then so does the log that is its inverse. Let's

4
00:00:14,505 --> 00:00:18,790
plug a number in and try something out. We know that for this function, f of 3

5
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:25,246
is equal to 2 to the 3rd, or just 8. Using logs, this means that log base 2 of

6
00:00:25,246 --> 00:00:29,576
8 Equals 3. I know this is all very new, so if this sounds confusing or

7
00:00:29,576 --> 00:00:34,389
unfamiliar, that's not a big deal at all. Don't worry. We'll keep working with

8
00:00:34,389 --> 00:00:38,220
these, and you'll come to understand them very well in a short period of time.

9
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:42,300
Now, we can see more clearly what's going on here if we rewrite this 8. We can

10
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:46,760
instead put 2 to the 3rd there, and this shows what's really happening. We know

11
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:50,665
that log base 2 is the inverse of what's happening here. And we can see here

12
00:00:50,665 --> 00:00:55,795
that it really is undoing what happened to the original 3, that input. With a

13
00:00:55,795 --> 00:01:00,800
function f, we input 3 and it output 8. When we input that number, the output,

14
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,831
into the log function, in other words, when we took log base 2 of 8, the output

15
00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:10,630
was the original input. This inverse function, this log function, undid to the

16
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:15,480
3, what f did to it in the first place. Let's look at this in a different way.

17
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:21,002
When we input 3 into our exponential function, it spits out 2 to the 3rd. Then

18
00:01:21,002 --> 00:01:24,656
when we use 2 to the 3rd as the input for the logarithmic function, that's the

19
00:01:24,656 --> 00:01:30,048
inverse of the exponential one The output is three again. Similarly if we use

20
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:34,206
three as the input for a logarithmic function the exponential function undoes

21
00:01:34,206 --> 00:01:41,176
what the log does. In other words two to the power of log base two of three. Is

22
00:01:41,176 --> 00:01:45,170
equal to 3. This is just confirmed, that these two inverse functions behave

23
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:50,357
just like other inverse functions. F of F inverse of X, gives us X and F

24
00:01:50,357 --> 00:01:57,230
inverse of F of X, gives us X. So, here's a couple for you to try, on your own.

25
00:01:57,230 --> 00:02:02,982
What is Log base 2 of 16? And what is log base two of 64. Giving you a little

26
00:02:02,982 --> 00:02:08,000
hint for how to think about these, try to rewrite 16 as two, two some power.

27
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
What power belongs here? And how does that effect what number goes over here?

28
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,659
Maybe you can think about this one in the same way.
