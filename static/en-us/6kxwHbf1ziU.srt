1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:02,140
No, it will not.

2
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:03,800
It will not compile it,

3
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:07,560
because the type of the two
closures is slightly different.

4
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:13,122
Sum takes an integer and another
integer, and returns another integer.

5
00:00:13,122 --> 00:00:17,700
While sumf takes two floats and
returns a float.

6
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:21,260
That's different enough for the
compiler, so this code will not compile.
