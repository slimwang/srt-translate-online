00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:02,680
Here's another challenge for you.

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:04,650
Implement an array of nicknames for

3
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:08,850
your cat and use a control flow structure to display them all.

4
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:13,424
Control flow structures in Knockout are ways of doing things programmatically in

5
00:00:13,424 --> 00:00:14,094
your view.

6
00:00:14,094 --> 00:00:20,730
They're similar to if statements and loops, but in your bindings in the HTML.

7
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:23,580
For example, what if you could have a bunch of nicknames and

8
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:25,410
you want to put each one in its own div?

9
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,880
In my example here, I've put all of my nicknames in their own li element.

10
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,890
Now, if you wanted to do that, you could use the foreach binding to

11
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:37,480
render each one of them in that particular way.

12
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:41,270
Now also, as with anything new,

13
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:44,810
the phrases that Knockout uses can be intimidating.

14
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:47,610
Control flow sounds a little bit scary.

15
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:51,870
It's just a fancy word for things that are non-linear, like loops and

16
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:53,390
conditionals like if statements.

17
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:55,690
Now, this time,

18
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:59,080
I'm going to ask you to figure out how to actually implement this.

19
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:03,370
Open up the Knockout documentation and click on that page right there.

20
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:06,900
Read the page that talks about the foreach binding and have at it.

21
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,210
Now, actually before you have at it,

22
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:12,010
remember to commit your code in a repository at each step so

23
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:14,740
you can always reset if you code yourself into a corner.

24
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:19,570
And if you do get stuck or, for example, aren't sure how to get

25
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:25,320
the actual array item into the bindings, read the documentation more thoroughly.

26
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:28,030
All the answers you need should be there waiting for you.
