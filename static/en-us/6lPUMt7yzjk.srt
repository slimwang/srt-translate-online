00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,376
Though when we zoom in and look at graphs, we're really only seeing part of the

2
00:00:03,376 --> 00:00:07,808
entire representation of the function. We're just zooming in on this little

3
00:00:07,808 --> 00:00:11,662
tiny portion of the domain. If we zoom out even just a bit though, we can see

4
00:00:11,662 --> 00:00:16,420
that all these changes that are happening in the middle of the graph. Are

5
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:19,720
really just tiny details the overall behavior of the function is determined by

6
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:22,820
what's happening at either end of the graph on the right side and on the left

7
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:27,130
side. We've already learned a lot about the general shape of polynomial

8
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:31,245
functions so let's see if you can apply what you've learned. To work out how

9
00:00:31,245 --> 00:00:35,222
each of these graphs will look. For each function I've listed here please tell

10
00:00:35,222 --> 00:00:39,292
me what the behavior on the left side of the graph is going to look like. In

11
00:00:39,292 --> 00:00:43,330
other words, what direction the graph is coming from? And then also tell me

12
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:46,930
what's happening on the right side of the graph. What direction is the graph

13
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:48,439
pointing in as we move over to the right hand side?
