1
00:00:00,107 --> 00:00:03,041
What about the specular or the mirror component?

2
00:00:03,041 --> 00:00:06,442
Now of course in a real mirror, you all learned this in high school physics.

3
00:00:06,442 --> 00:00:07,208
Right?

4
00:00:07,208 --> 00:00:10,919
There's only a reflection at the perfect mirror angle.

5
00:00:10,919 --> 00:00:12,517
Remember, angle in equals angle out?

6
00:00:12,517 --> 00:00:15,722
I'm sure you learned that somewhere in your, in your physics class.

7
00:00:15,722 --> 00:00:20,719
Well, so using our, our diagramming again, what this says is

8
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:26,207
that all the incident light is reflected only in a single direction.

9
00:00:26,207 --> 00:00:26,897
Okay.

10
00:00:26,897 --> 00:00:30,676
And I'm going to call that direction m for the mirror direction.

11
00:00:30,676 --> 00:00:33,404
And here, we have v for the viewing direction.

12
00:00:33,404 --> 00:00:34,510
Okay?

13
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:39,880
And so that light is only going to be visible when v equals m.

14
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:43,187
All right. So I have to be in the exact, so if I've got a point coming

15
00:00:43,187 --> 00:00:46,589
from right here, I'm going to see it right there at that, that point.

16
00:00:46,589 --> 00:00:48,722
And everywhere else, it's not reflecting.

17
00:00:48,722 --> 00:00:50,881
Or I might see it at a different point, but

18
00:00:50,881 --> 00:00:53,990
all the light is being reflected along the particular ray.

19
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:54,964
All right.

20
00:00:54,964 --> 00:01:01,033
And so the BRDF is just a, what's called a double-delta function.

21
00:01:01,033 --> 00:01:03,971
If I'm, if I'm thinking about this on my surface, right?

22
00:01:03,971 --> 00:01:10,110
This angle down and the angle out has to be equal, but this is drawn difficult.

23
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:11,683
It's, it's in 2D.

24
00:01:11,683 --> 00:01:14,843
Not only do they have to be sort of at the, the same tilt, but

25
00:01:14,843 --> 00:01:16,249
they have to be in a plane.

26
00:01:16,249 --> 00:01:19,922
Right? All over to this and this have to be in the same plane,

27
00:01:19,922 --> 00:01:22,924
because if I were to rotate it this way, all right?

28
00:01:22,924 --> 00:01:25,962
Then it would now be bouncing off in another direction and

29
00:01:25,962 --> 00:01:28,061
so, that's why there's two angles.

30
00:01:28,061 --> 00:01:32,572
This is the tilt angle and this is the rotation around angle that says,

31
00:01:32,572 --> 00:01:35,565
basically one has to be pi opposite the other.

32
00:01:35,565 --> 00:01:40,012
So we take this BRDF and we stick it into our radiance equation.

33
00:01:40,012 --> 00:01:44,379
And what it says is that the radiance, essentially the brightness that

34
00:01:44,379 --> 00:01:48,255
we're going to see out is the magnitude of the source intensity.

35
00:01:48,255 --> 00:01:50,957
The row sub s is the specular reflection.

36
00:01:50,957 --> 00:01:54,588
So for example, it might be a darkened glass that filters out some light, so

37
00:01:54,588 --> 00:01:55,858
it still acts as a mirror.

38
00:01:55,858 --> 00:01:59,595
But only reflects some percentage of it, that's what the row would do.

39
00:01:59,595 --> 00:02:03,090
And then we have these two delta functions, okay?

40
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:07,295
And these delta functions say that basically the angle in terms of

41
00:02:07,295 --> 00:02:11,347
the tilt has to be the same and also the rotation around have to be

42
00:02:11,347 --> 00:02:15,110
exactly pie different that's what those two things say.

43
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:19,100
Now remember, the delta function is a function where if the argument is zero,

44
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:19,775
it's a one.

45
00:02:19,775 --> 00:02:23,250
Otherwise, it's, it's zero and that's why it's written as a delta function.

46
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:27,266
So I want to abuse the notation just a little bit and I'm going to say,

47
00:02:27,266 --> 00:02:32,524
well, I can also write this as saying that the radiance in this particular case,

48
00:02:32,524 --> 00:02:33,562
same as before.

49
00:02:33,562 --> 00:02:37,704
But now I'm using, I guess what I'm calling a vector delta function.

50
00:02:37,704 --> 00:02:38,504
Right?

51
00:02:38,504 --> 00:02:42,187
So what we said before is that I only see a reflection if

52
00:02:42,187 --> 00:02:45,733
the viewing angle is exactly the mirror angle, right?

53
00:02:45,733 --> 00:02:49,597
So essentially these two things would have to be the same, so

54
00:02:49,597 --> 00:02:52,282
that I'm lined up in exactly the right spot.

55
00:02:52,282 --> 00:02:56,611
Another way of writing that is that the half angle is the same as

56
00:02:56,611 --> 00:02:58,120
the normal, right?

57
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:01,491
So another way of saying that is if the vector

58
00:03:01,491 --> 00:03:05,136
that's exactly halfway between the sensor and

59
00:03:05,136 --> 00:03:10,530
the light is the same as the normal, then you get a mirror reflection.

60
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:14,240
And that would be for a sort of a, you know, a single perfect point.

61
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,720
So that's the Mirror BRDF.
