00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:03,340
So, what's a good representation for
everyday life?

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:05,460
David, can you think of an example?

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:08,320
>> So a good example that comes to mind
pretty quickly for me is the example of

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,590
the nutritional information on the side
of a food or beverage container.

5
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:14,450
It lists slots for
each different kind of nutrient, and

6
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:16,910
also lists the quantity
that's present in that food.

7
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:19,480
So it seems like it's a pretty good
representation of what's actually going

8
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:20,540
on inside the food container.

9
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:22,310
>> What do you think?

10
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:23,860
Do you think David is right?
