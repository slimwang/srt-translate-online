1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,790
Alice is working for a global telecommunications company

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:06,480
that owns a telecommunications network around the world.

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,450
So the network of her company looks something like this.

4
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:12,730
And, of course, this is just to give you an idea; in reality the network is much larger.

5
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:17,050
But they basically have telecommunications centers that are spread out around the world.

6
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:20,920
And these communication centers are connected through cables, something like this.

7
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:24,780
And again, there's many more communication centers, and many more cables here, of course.

8
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:28,650
But this is just to illustrate the problem to you that she is working on.

9
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:33,180
So you see, not every communications center is connected to every other communications center,

10
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:37,340
but they're selectively connected through these blue cables here.

11
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:40,330
Now, of course, for the company that Alice is working for,

12
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:43,890
it's very important to check the integrity of the whole network,

13
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:48,350
which basically means that you have to check if every single cable here is working.

14
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:51,830
Now, to do this, her company can install monitoring devices,

15
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:55,400
which I'm going to draw with a green circle like this here.

16
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:58,350
So the company could, for example, install a monitoring device here.

17
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:03,410
And what that monitoring device does is, it checks the integrity of all cables

18
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:07,900
that are connected to that communications center where you install the device.

19
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:10,590
So it looks something like this.

20
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:13,860
So installing a device here would allow you to monitor all these 5 cables

21
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:17,320
that are drawn green here, and of course in order to monitor the whole network,

22
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,320
you would need more than 1 device.

23
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:23,800
But you would not need to install a device at every single communications center.

24
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:29,140
So for example, if you install another device here, which monitors these cables here,

25
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:34,130
and another device here, then this communications center right here does not need an additional device,

26
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:36,410
because all the cables that are attached to it

27
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:39,410
are already monitored by the other communications centers.

28
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:43,740
Now, installing 1 of these devices is, of course, quite expensive.

29
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:49,180
And that is why Alice has been asked by her employer, the telecommunications company,

30
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:54,130
to figure out a way to monitor the whole network by installing as few devices as possible.

31
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:57,380
And, as I said, the whole network is, of course, much more complex than this.

32
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:02,070
So it contains about 500 communications centers, say, so she cannot do it manually.

33
00:02:02,070 --> 99:59:59,999
She definitely needs to write an algorithm to help her with this.
