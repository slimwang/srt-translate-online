1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:03,430
The later that a software development problem is detected,

2
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:05,440
the more expensive it is to fix it.

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:08,880
Hence, we want to find problems as early as possible in the process.

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,340
Reviews are a cost effective way to find problems in all kinds of artifacts,

5
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:15,020
including design documents.

6
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:18,830
Going further, we want to detect deep problems if we can.

7
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:22,640
And reviews run the risk of revealing shallow problems with a document self or

8
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,780
with superficial aspects of the design.

9
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:28,190
To reveal deep problems requires exposure of the design to

10
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:31,270
experienced designers who are among the most highly paid and

11
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:33,470
time stressed people in the development process.

12
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:36,815
Therefore it makes sense to have the design review be as focused and

13
00:00:36,815 --> 00:00:38,290
well-run as possible.

14
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:41,260
To do this reviews should be institutionalized.

15
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:44,350
By that I mean, they should be a formally defined process element and

16
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:45,920
part of the corporate culture.

17
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,750
By doing so, the short-term costs involved in conducting reviews will be

18
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:53,060
more than offset by the eventual saving on reduced maintenance and

19
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:54,720
increased customer satisfaction.
