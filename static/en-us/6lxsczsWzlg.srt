00:00:00,006 --> 00:00:05,596
The LCD would be x squared times x plus 2. Remember we want the highest power of

2
00:00:05,596 --> 00:00:10,472
any factor that appears in a denominator. So we know x is already a factor of x

3
00:00:10,472 --> 00:00:17,180
squared, so we should use x squared. And X plus two for our LCD. Another way to

4
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:21,590
think about this, is to use our factor tree method to find the LCD of X squared

5
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:26,861
and X plus two. We use X squared here, since we know X is already a factor of X

6
00:00:26,861 --> 00:00:32,215
squared. Now don't make the mistake of putting X as the common factor here. X

7
00:00:32,215 --> 00:00:37,986
plus two is one factor. Wgereas X squared has the factors of X and X. The only

8
00:00:37,986 --> 00:00:44,168
common factor for X squared and the quantity X plus two is one. This also makes

9
00:00:44,168 --> 00:00:50,385
sense because this X is a term inside this factor. So our LCD is X squared times

10
00:00:50,385 --> 00:00:53,653
one times the quantity X plus two.
