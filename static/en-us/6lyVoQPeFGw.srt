1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,576
So let's look at the solution
to our 4-level page table quiz.

2
00:00:03,576 --> 00:00:08,381
We have 2 to the 64th
bytes of address space.

3
00:00:08,381 --> 00:00:13,160
We have 2 to the 16th
bytes in each page.

4
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:18,680
We get that there are 2 to the 48th
pages in our address space.

5
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:22,800
For our flat page table, the page
table has 2 to the 48th entries,

6
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:28,040
times the size of each entry,
is 2 to the 3rd.

7
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:32,650
So the overall size is
2 to the 51st bytes.

8
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:35,630
So the answer is here, 51.

9
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:40,830
This is an enormous page table,
many, many terabytes of page table.

10
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:43,900
Now let's see what the four
level page table looks like.

11
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:49,400
The page number in this page table
is split across four levels.

12
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:53,570
So the page number is split
into four pieces of 12 bits.

13
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:58,100
The easiest way to figure out how
large the overall page table is,

14
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:01,000
is to figure out how many
innermost page tables we have.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,500
4 GB worth of memory is
2 to the 32nd bytes,

16
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:10,180
which is 2 to the 16th
pages of this size.

17
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:13,090
So we have 2 to the 16th pages.

18
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:17,527
One innermost page table has
2 to the 12th entries, so

19
00:01:17,527 --> 00:01:20,510
it covers 2 to the 12th pages.

20
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:23,606
To cover 2 to the 16th
consecutive pages,

21
00:01:23,606 --> 00:01:27,670
we need 2 to the 4th of these
inner most page tables.

22
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:32,700
So, now we know that we have
16 innermost page tables.

23
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:37,000
How many page tables at the next
level we need to point to them?

24
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,061
Well, each table at that entry can
also have 2 to the 12th entries, and

25
00:01:41,061 --> 00:01:42,810
this is only 2 to the 4th.

26
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:44,430
So, we need only one.

27
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:47,490
So this is the page
table situation we have.

28
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:55,020
The outermost page table has 2
to the 12th, or 4,960 entries.

29
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:58,380
But only one of them, the first one,

30
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:02,040
actually has a page
table at the next level.

31
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:06,880
That page table at the next level
also has 2 to the 12th entries.

32
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:11,930
But only one of them, the first one,
points to the next level of page table.

33
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:15,760
That next level page
table has 16 entries

34
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,470
that point to innermost page tables.

35
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:24,020
So overall the number of these
page tables is 1 here, 1 here,

36
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:28,964
1 here, and 16 of these,
for a total of 19 of them.

37
00:02:28,964 --> 00:02:35,519
The size of each of these small page
tables is the number of entries,

38
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:41,860
2 to the 12th times the size
of an entry, 2 to the 3rd.

39
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:46,000
So the size of each one of
these is 2 to the 15th bytes,

40
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,950
which corresponds to 32 kilobytes.

41
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:53,150
So overall we have 19 page
tables at various levels,

42
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:55,760
each of which is 32 kilobytes.

43
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,410
So the solution here is 19 x 32.

44
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:03,030
So the final answer is 608 kilobytes.

45
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:07,100
As you can see, this is only 608
kilobytes, less than a megabyte.

46
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:10,400
Compare that to many many
terabytes of page table for

47
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,670
a flat page table organization.

48
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:16,670
This is why all 64 bit X86 processors,

49
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:21,400
nowadays, use multi-level page
tables of at least three levels.
