00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:04,560
So of course, traditionally, photographers used the aperture, shutter, and

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:09,820
focal length values of the camera to extensively be able to define how

3
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:12,940
they want to be able to take, and what kind of pictures they want to take.

4
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:15,520
I'm just going to show you a few examples that I found just to kind of

5
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:17,090
show the value of this kind of stuff.

6
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:22,010
Here, shallow depth of field is shown by how the pictures are taken,

7
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:24,510
things are right there are perfectly in focus.

8
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:28,560
These are not that far behind, but they seem to be a little bit out of focus.

9
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,870
So this is the concept of shallow depth of field.

10
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:32,560
Motion blur, here you can see, for

11
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:37,220
example, the birds are showing motion because of shutter speed changes.

12
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:41,580
You can see that the wings are blurred.

13
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:44,790
Here you can see the hand is blurred but the text is not.

14
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:48,100
And of course traditional effects of light streaking at nights and

15
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,670
stuff like are again because shutter is kept open a little longer.

16
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:54,200
And of course when the cars move have this impact.

17
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,580
And, of course, there's a whole tradition of people doing light art.

18
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:00,350
I found this beautiful site that I point here that actually if you want you

19
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:01,110
can look at on your own.

20
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:04,650
It shows a lot of fun things that you can do with just how you can control and

21
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:05,940
how you can play around with light.
