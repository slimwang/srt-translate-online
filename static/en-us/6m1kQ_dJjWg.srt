Let's say I wanted to build a calendar app, kind of like Google Calendar.

2
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:07,080
Which of these parts of the application do you think would be considered part

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:08,280
of the model?

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:10,910
The array of calendar events in the application?

5
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:13,470
The buttons for Day, Week, and Month?

6
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:15,490
Or the render function for the calendar area?
