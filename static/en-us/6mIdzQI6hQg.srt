1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:06,410
In, in specifying the signature we have given explicit names to

2
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:11,450
the variables Y and X. And we do this because we'd like to be able to refer to

3
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:16,000
them in the pre and post conditions by, by some, some name.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,750
Clearly this is simple, similar to what you would do in,

5
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:23,210
in writing a stub in a programming language like Java. Where you can give

6
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:27,070
whatever names you'd like to the arguments as long as you consistently use them.

7
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:33,210
The other thing to note about this is that, we could apply our SORT program

8
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:38,040
to things other than integers if they ha, satisfy one particular condition,

9
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:43,020
which is that the basic elements have to be suitable as

10
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:47,550
arguments to some kind of ordering operation. So greater than, less than,

11
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:51,519
and so on, are ordering operations. So we can sort ints, we can sort reals,

12
00:00:51,519 --> 00:00:55,390
we can sort, strings and lexical graphic order if that's what we needed to do.
