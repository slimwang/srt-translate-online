1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:01,930
Now that we know a little
bit about networking,

2
00:00:01,930 --> 00:00:03,570
it's time to start
writing some real code.

3
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:06,220
In lesson two,
we'll build the flick finder app.

4
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:09,110
For this app, we'll make use of
the flicker API again but this time,

5
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:13,020
we'll retrieve and display images based
on a search string or a location.

6
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:16,149
For example, I just got back
from a ski trip in Tahoe, so

7
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:18,720
I'd like to search
an image on snow skiing.

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:19,450
So, let's search that.

9
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:22,600
And there we go.
There's some people skiing right there.

10
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,050
Let's build it.
