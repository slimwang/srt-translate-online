1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:06,670
That pseudo code asked us to let i go from zero to the length over 2 minus 1.

2
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:09,550
That minus one is always a little inelegant, I prefer to use the less than sign

3
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:15,498
here. Inside the loop, we were supposed to swap the position i and i plus

4
00:00:15,498 --> 00:00:20,987
length over 2. Let's copy and paste the swap code. Here it is, but now j, of

5
00:00:20,987 --> 00:00:30,090
course, is supposed to be this. Now I fixed up the code. And I'm ready to run.

6
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:34,850
Here you see the result, the array before and after swapping. And you can see

7
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:38,260
these numbers are now where they're supposed to be, as well as for the other

8
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:44,160
half. I want to briefly talk about the code that produced this printout here.

9
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,984
When you look over here, we call system.out.println and we can't directly print

10
00:00:48,984 --> 00:00:54,200
elements. As I said, arrays are more primitive then array lists, and an array

11
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:59,380
will not print out its value. This method here takes an array and turns it into

12
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:04,102
a string that lists all of the values inside. Though when you want to print out

13
00:01:04,102 --> 00:01:07,606
an array list, you can directly pass it out to System.out.printIn. When you

14
00:01:07,606 --> 00:01:11,728
have an array, you have to use this helper method. Of course you could also use

15
00:01:11,728 --> 00:01:15,686
a direct loop, but the helper method is more convenient. Now remember what the

16
00:01:15,686 --> 00:01:19,049
point of all of this was, the point was not how to implement the swapping

17
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:22,583
algorithm in Javam the exciting thing was how we discovered it in the first

18
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:26,288
place, we discovered it by playing around with stuff and not by worrying about

19
00:01:26,288 --> 00:01:29,765
exactly how the index values were or whether we needed a For loop or a While

20
00:01:29,765 --> 00:01:33,014
loop and I hope that's the lesson that stays with you, if you need to do

21
00:01:33,014 --> 00:01:36,776
something that's off the beaten track, that's different from what you've seen

22
00:01:36,776 --> 00:01:45,910
before. Get out some Lego bricks, some coins, some candies, whatever, and

23
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:51,530
figure out what the operation would be with those. And that'll give you the

24
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:55,118
intuition that you need in order to be a successful programmer. Programming is

25
00:01:55,118 --> 00:01:58,484
all about having the right ideas and the right intuition, not about pushing the

26
00:01:58,484 --> 00:02:01,600
symbols of the programming language around.
