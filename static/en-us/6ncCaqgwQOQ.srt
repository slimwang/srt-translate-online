1
00:00:00,598 --> 00:00:05,436
Android TV gives you the tools to easily
extend your existing app or game, or

2
00:00:05,436 --> 00:00:08,016
create new ones just for the big screen.

3
00:00:08,016 --> 00:00:11,368
The most important thing to
remember here is that it's android.

4
00:00:11,368 --> 00:00:14,509
It's the same platform you already
used to build your phone apps.

5
00:00:14,509 --> 00:00:18,352
In fact, most of that code can
be used for the TV app as well.

6
00:00:18,352 --> 00:00:20,873
It can even be in the same APK.

7
00:00:20,873 --> 00:00:22,665
Here are the differences.

8
00:00:22,665 --> 00:00:25,233
First, you've got to
declare the activity that's

9
00:00:25,233 --> 00:00:26,522
intended to run on the TV.

10
00:00:26,522 --> 00:00:28,355
This is done on the manifest.

11
00:00:28,355 --> 00:00:32,598
Second, you want to update your UI
to use the Leanback Support Library.

12
00:00:32,598 --> 00:00:36,352
It is not strictly required, and if you
like making things hard on yourself,

13
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:37,345
then don't use it.

14
00:00:37,345 --> 00:00:41,679
For the rest of us, interface
widgets such as BrowseFragment,

15
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:47,235
DetailsFragment, and SearchFragment make
building a great TV UI fast and easy.

16
00:00:47,235 --> 00:00:52,181
The third and final step is to make your
app and content available to the user.

17
00:00:52,181 --> 00:00:55,209
In the first step, you will have
declared the Leanback launcher

18
00:00:55,209 --> 00:00:58,759
intent-filter so that your app shows
up in the apps row on the home screen.

19
00:00:58,759 --> 00:01:01,392
To have it show up in
the games row instead,

20
00:01:01,392 --> 00:01:04,549
you just need to set is game
to true in the manifest.

21
00:01:04,549 --> 00:01:06,400
There's also the opportunity for

22
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,177
your content to appear in the
recommendations row or through search.

23
00:01:10,177 --> 00:01:13,646
The recommendations row is an essential
feature of the home screen.

24
00:01:13,646 --> 00:01:17,568
It gives users quick access to
dynamic and relevant content.

25
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:21,832
It's essentially a bunch of cards that
represent a system or App Action,

26
00:01:21,832 --> 00:01:24,599
notification, activity,
or piece of media.

27
00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:28,267
We'll show you a little later how
to get your content shown here.

28
00:01:28,267 --> 00:01:32,809
Search is important too, because users
often have specific content in mind and

29
00:01:32,809 --> 00:01:37,308
browsing for that content is usually not
the fastest or easiest way to find it.

30
00:01:37,308 --> 00:01:42,186
However, you can add a search action
in your app, which you should do, but

31
00:01:42,186 --> 00:01:43,277
why stop there?

32
00:01:43,277 --> 00:01:47,842
We'll also show you how to get your
content in Android TV's global search

33
00:01:47,842 --> 00:01:48,439
as well.

34
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:52,339
That's it, three major steps to
getting the great experience for

35
00:01:52,339 --> 00:01:54,019
your content on Android TV.

36
00:01:54,019 --> 00:01:58,621
Declare your activity, use the Leanback
library to make everything look and

37
00:01:58,621 --> 00:02:02,938
feel as it should on the TV, and
then integrate with recommendations and

38
00:02:02,938 --> 00:02:03,530
search.
