00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,276
To figure out what each of the terms should become inside the parentheses, we

2
00:00:03,276 --> 00:00:08,000
just need to divide each of them by x, since we've written our factor up here.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,368
Now our function reads f of x equals x times the quantity 2x cubed minus 13x

4
00:00:13,368 --> 00:00:17,162
squared plus 32x minus 13.
