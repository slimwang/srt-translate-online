1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,580
So indeed these big price drops
were caused by stock splits,

2
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:07,520
why do stocks split?

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,970
The most common reason and
as far as I know,

4
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:13,340
the only reason,
is that the price is too high.

5
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:17,170
Why is a high price a problem?

6
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:23,090
Well, consider for a moment that stock
may be above say $500 per share.

7
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:26,850
People like to buy
stocks in groups of 100.

8
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:31,335
So that means, for instance,
it would be $50,000 to buy or

9
00:00:31,335 --> 00:00:34,710
sell a block of 100
shares of a $500 stock.

10
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:37,180
Now, of course,
you can buy it in smaller blocks.

11
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:38,400
That's fine.

12
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:43,400
But another aspect is that
options when they're traded on

13
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:47,890
stocks are usually traded
with regard to 100 shares.

14
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,450
So options covering 100
shares of $500 stocks,

15
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:57,420
becomes suddenly very expensive and
less liquid.

16
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:00,310
So from the point of view of options,
and

17
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:04,739
also individual stock shares,
very high prices are a problem.

18
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:07,950
Even in the case where you want to
buy just one share of the stock,

19
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:12,700
let's suppose you're setting
your kid up with an account, and

20
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:15,720
you want to buy one share of Apple.

21
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:18,660
Earlier this year that
would have cost you $600.

22
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:23,910
So even buying one share of a very
expensive stock can be a problem.

23
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:28,465
Finally, one other issue here is if
you're building a portfolio and you

24
00:01:28,465 --> 00:01:33,460
want to have a finely tuned proportion
of each stock in your portfolio.

25
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:37,560
If some of the stock
prices are very high,

26
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,390
it becomes difficult to get that
fine resolution that you want.

27
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:47,459
So, when the prices get very, very high,
what the companies do is they say, look,

28
00:01:47,459 --> 00:01:53,740
let's take that 1 share that's price at
$300 and break it into 4 shares at 75.

29
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:57,290
So that's called a 4 of a 1 split.

30
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:01,250
In this case, we had a 2 for 1 split.

31
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:03,690
So that's why splits happen.

32
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:05,550
Now let's look at this data.

33
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:09,229
Suppose you read this data
into your computer and

34
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:12,780
you were going to analyze it and
look for trading opportunities.

35
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:15,040
Well, your algorithm might discover,
hey,

36
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,510
look, here's a great
shorting opportunity.

37
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:23,530
Whenever this condition occurs, whatever
that was, you want to short the stock,

38
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:30,070
and then you'll see a 75% drop, and
you'll reap a significant reward.

39
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:30,750
And also here,

40
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:34,520
you might identify this time as
a good opportunity to short as well.

41
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:39,710
Well, of course, that's wrong
because what's happening underneath,

42
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:42,700
is that the value of the company
isn't really decreasing.

43
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:44,500
You just have more shares.

44
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:49,480
So if you want to trade using this

45
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:54,570
actual closed data, you have to
account for all these splits.

46
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:55,710
And that becomes cumbersome.

47
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,160
So someone came up with a great
solution to this problem.

48
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,510
Mainly, adjusted close.

49
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:04,300
Or adjusted prices.

50
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:10,310
And the idea is to create a timeline of
prices that are adjusted to account for

51
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:11,870
these changes.

52
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:15,810
Such that you can look
back over adjusted close.

53
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:18,340
Simulate buying at a particular time.

54
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:21,240
And seeing how the value
increases over time

55
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:24,590
accurately without having to account for
these splits.

56
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:26,070
Here's how it works.

57
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:30,980
The first thing to point out is that
at the very last day, in other words,

58
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:36,620
today, adjusted close and
actual close are always the same.

59
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:39,860
Now we track back in time and
adjusted close and

60
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:42,120
actual close are exactly the same.

61
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:45,360
But then, on this day,
when we see this 2 to 1 split.

62
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:51,100
What we do is we go back over
all the historical data, and

63
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:53,650
we divide it all by 2.

64
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:56,790
So the first day before the split,

65
00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:01,270
we get about a $125 price
instead of that 250.

66
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:06,514
Then when we get to this 4
to 1 split we divide by 2,

67
00:04:06,514 --> 00:04:11,879
and then by 4, so
that on this 1 day before that split

68
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:16,890
our price is in
the neighborhood of about $70,

69
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:21,130
and that continues back in time.

70
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:24,530
As we go back we adjust for
each of the splits in history.

71
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,560
So now we have a nice smooth price
timeline without these big jumps.

72
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:35,270
And for instance, if you consider that
you bought the stock on this day and

73
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:41,710
held it until this day, the accumulation
in value that you see there is accurate.

74
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:47,020
That reflects all those splits and
you would have a lot more shares here,

75
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:50,180
but this would also correctly
represent the increase in value.
