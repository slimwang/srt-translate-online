00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:07,010
I chose to use the CSS selector header.navbar-static-top,

2
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:14,210
which selects the header tag with class navbar-static-top due to its simplicity.

3
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:17,410
But there are a few other CSS selectors that will

4
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:19,860
correctly select the navbar element.

5
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:25,390
And again, any selector that properly selects the navbar is fine, but

6
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:29,250
often you want to look for the simplest and most concise.
