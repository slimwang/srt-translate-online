00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:05,500
Here is a plot showing infection rate of the Code One Version Two Worm which

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:10,280
ultimately infected 350,000 vulnerable hosts. Note the shape

3
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:13,610
of this curve. The worm is effectively dormant

4
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:16,620
or spreading extremely slowly for quite a

5
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:18,700
period of time. And then there's a inflection

6
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:21,750
point at which point the infection rate becomes

7
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:25,920
exponential At some point then, infections slow and

8
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,430
the infection rate ultimate plateaus, presumably after

9
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:32,009
all of the infected hosts have been found.

10
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:34,190
We can actually model the spread of these

11
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:37,680
worms using the random constant spread model. If

12
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,440
Kis the initial compromised rate, N is the

13
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,040
number of vulnerable hosts, and a is the

14
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,530
fraction of hosts already compromised, we can now

15
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:51,170
express the number of hosts infected at a

16
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:55,670
particular time increment in terms of the machines already

17
00:00:55,670 --> 00:01:00,660
infected, and the rate at which uninfected machines become compromised. So

18
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:05,950
if Nda. Is the number of newly infected machines

19
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:11,310
in DT, we can express that in terms of the number of machines

20
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:16,290
already infected. Which is, N times a. So these are the

21
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:23,550
host already capable of doing more scanning. And now K times 1 minus a

22
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:27,160
is the rate at which uninfected machines

23
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:30,570
become compromised, in a particular time interval

24
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:36,440
dt. If we solve for a the fraction of hosts compromised, which is effectively

25
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:41,650
the y-axis of this graph and we get the following. You get an exponential curve

26
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:44,740
that is exponential where the growth rate depends

27
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:48,250
only on K, or the initial compromise rate.

28
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:49,990
This is very interesting because it tells us

29
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:52,000
that if we want to design a very fast

30
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,580
spreading worm, then we should design a worm

31
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:57,640
such that the initial compromise rate is as high

32
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:00,400
as possible. So how do we increase K.

33
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,280
Or how do we increase that initial compromise rate?
