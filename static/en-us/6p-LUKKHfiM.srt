1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:01,960
Okay Michael do you have an answer?

2
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:04,290
>> I have an answer indeed.

3
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:05,130
>> Okay, what's the answer?

4
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:06,880
>> Okay, maybe I don't have an answer indeed.

5
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:09,300
But I have I have the ability to compute one.

6
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:09,800
>> Okay.

7
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,130
>> I'm, I'm doing some math.

8
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:12,730
>> So why don't you walk me through the math you're doing.

9
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:15,333
>> I got .32776.

10
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:18,065
>> That is correct Michael.

11
00:00:18,065 --> 00:00:22,630
>> Woo-hoo. That was trickier than I thought.

12
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:24,770
>> Okay well, show me what you did.

13
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:25,640
>> Alright, so the

14
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,370
first thing I did is I said, okay, well this

15
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:31,740
is not so hard, because, from the start-state, if I

16
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,810
execute up, up, right, right, right. Each of those things

17
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:38,785
works the way it's supposed to do independently with probability .8.

18
00:00:38,785 --> 00:00:43,710
>> Yep. And so, .8 raised to the 5th power, gives

19
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,800
me the probability that that entire sequence will work as intended.

20
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,030
>> Exactly. And what is .8 to the 5th? Do you know?

21
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:52,010
>> 32,768. with a decimal point in front

22
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:54,120
of it, because you know, powers of 2.

23
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:58,080
>> Wow. That is correct. But I notice that 32768

24
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:02,030
is not 32776. No they differ by a little smidge.

25
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:02,780
>> Mm-hm.

26
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:05,360
>> So this is what occured to me next is,

27
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,260
is there anyway that you could have ended up falling into

28
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:11,510
the goal from that sequence of, of commands not following the

29
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:16,090
intended path. So since actions can have unintended consequences, as they

30
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:16,740
often do.

31
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:17,700
>> Mm-hm.

32
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:20,510
>> I was going to ask okay, so if I go up in the

33
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:23,960
first step, there's a probably .1 that I'll actually go to the right.

34
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,580
>> Yep. From there, if I go up, there's

35
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:28,820
a 10% probability that I'll actually go to the right.

36
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:29,960
>> Mm-hm.

37
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,410
>> From there, the next thing I do is take the

38
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:36,709
right action, but that can actually go up with some probability, .1.

39
00:01:36,709 --> 00:01:37,495
>> Mm-hm, yep.

40
00:01:37,495 --> 00:01:41,280
>> And then another .1 to get to for

41
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,000
the next right action to actually cause an up to happen.

42
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,750
>> Mm-hm. And then finally, that last right might

43
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:49,760
actually execute correctly and bring me into the goal. So

44
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:53,270
I could go underneath the barrier, instead of around the

45
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:55,610
barrier with that same sequence. It just isn't very likely.

46
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:57,230
>> Okay. Well how unlikely is it?

47
00:01:57,230 --> 00:02:02,008
>> Alright. So I did .1 times .1 times .1 times .1

48
00:02:02,008 --> 00:02:06,760
times .8. huh, so the .1 to the 4 times .8 and

49
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:12,480
that's right so this is the probability that the, 4 of the sequences, 4 of

50
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:18,600
these go wrong. In fact exactly the first 4 go wrong. And the last one goes

51
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:22,270
right. Right. And that's equal to, some

52
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:23,930
very, very small number. And when you add

53
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:32,050
it up. You end up with .32776. In fact that's equal to 0.00008. And that's how

54
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:36,330
you get that number and that's correct. And you'll

55
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:39,890
notice that this this sequence happens to work out to

56
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:44,460
be the second sequence that, we had options for. Yeah,

57
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:45,780
the other thing that took us to the goal, right.

58
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:45,900
>> Yeah.

59
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,890
>> Was exactly the probability of executing that action

60
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:53,230
executing that sequence of transitions given the first command.

61
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:55,990
>> Yeah, and I think it would work the other way, too. No,

62
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:58,700
it wouldn't quite work the other way. If you had done the sequence

63
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:01,350
right, right, what is it? Right, right. Up, up right?

64
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:02,220
>> Yeah.

65
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:05,210
>> In order for that one to work out, you'd add .8 to the

66
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:09,660
5 and working. And, for it to work out wrong but work out right, the

67
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:13,750
right would have to send you up and then the ups would have to send

68
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,900
you right, and then, yeah, so it would actually work out to be the same.

69
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:16,240
>> Yeah.

70
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,910
>> So no matter which of the two sequences you came

71
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:20,710
up with, they would have the same probability of succeeding. Neat.

72
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:23,620
>> Nice. That's actually kind of cool. So, good

73
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,020
job, Michael. Very good job on the quiz. A

74
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:29,150
lot of people forget this part. And, in fact, if

75
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:32,160
you forgot that part, and got, just this part

76
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:35,080
right, we actually let you pass. But it was wrong.

77
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,750
>> I was kind of expecting you to get

78
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,660
it wrong, but I'm glad you got it right too.

79
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:40,810
>> Thank you Michael, I appreciate your faith in me.

80
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:42,527
>> [LAUGH]

81
00:03:42,527 --> 00:03:45,060
>> I wrote the quiz. Actually, I stole this from a book,

82
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:47,350
>> Oh. which, whose little words are now showing

83
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:48,640
up in front of you, exactly where you can

84
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,760
go through the details of this quiz. Okay, alright, Michael. So you

85
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,300
might ask yourself why I brought this up, and the reason I brought

86
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,770
this up is because, what we did in the first case where we

87
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:59,900
just came up with the sequence up up right right right, is we

88
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:02,130
sort of planned out what we would do in a world where

89
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:06,150
nothing could go wrong. But once we introduced this notion of uncertainty, this,

90
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:10,500
this randomness, this stochasticity, we have to do something other than work out

91
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,750
in advance what the right answer is, and then just go. We have

92
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:16,320
to do something a little bit more complicated. Either we have

93
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,300
to try to execute these, and then every once in a

94
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:23,360
while, see if we've drifted away. And then re-x, re-plan, come

95
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,310
up with a new sequence wherever it is we happen to end

96
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:27,760
up, or we have to come up with some way to

97
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:32,860
incorporate all of these uncertainties and probabilities. So that, we never

98
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:36,230
really have to think, rethink what to do in case something

99
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:39,070
goes wrong. So, what I'm going to do next is I'm going to introduce

100
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:42,290
the framework, that's very common, that people use as a

101
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:46,560
way of capturing this stuff, capturing these uncertainties directly. Okay?

102
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,550
>> Hm.

103
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:48,110
>> You ready?

104
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:48,970
>> Yeah.

105
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:49,510
>> Excellent.
