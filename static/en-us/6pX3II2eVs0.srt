1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:01,710
Let's talk about thresholding, and

2
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:06,040
this is an example, I think this might
be taken also from Linda Shapiro.

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:09,740
So the idea is that you're
imaging these cherries, okay, and

4
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:12,870
the idea is that the background
here is very dark.

5
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:13,530
Okay?

6
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:17,040
And a healthy cherry is kind of bright,
all right?

7
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:19,350
But a bruised part is medium dark.

8
00:00:20,388 --> 00:00:23,520
And what you'd like to
do is be able to say,

9
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:26,070
do I have a bunch of bruised pixels.

10
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:28,870
So in this particular one, they've
removed all the black things, but

11
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:31,450
you see these are the grey scale values,
right?

12
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:36,960
And you and I look at this, and we say
yep, you know what, here's my threshold,

13
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,030
and this is the number of
pixels that are bruised, and

14
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:42,800
this is the number of,
of pixels that are good.

15
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:47,590
And the idea finding a threshold like
that automatically is not trivial.

16
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:49,100
Generally what you do when you look for

17
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:54,460
thresholds is you take a histogram
of the intensities, right?

18
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:57,990
So, this might be, you know,
go from zero to 255,

19
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:02,540
and this is the number of pixels
that you have in the image.

20
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:05,400
And the question is, you know,
what are your distributions?

21
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,560
Unlike this one, which had this nice,

22
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:11,920
clean dis, separation there, this one,
it's a lot more complicated.

23
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,980
Are there two, or are there three?

24
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:16,789
I think, you know, from my,
from my take, I'd say, oh,

25
00:01:16,789 --> 00:01:18,780
there's three lobes there, all right?

26
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:21,576
And there's different ways
of trying to do that.

27
00:01:21,576 --> 00:01:25,352
A simple method, this is again,
a long time Otsu's method, it's,

28
00:01:25,352 --> 00:01:27,225
it's a binary visionary method.

29
00:01:27,225 --> 00:01:32,208
It basically says find,
assume that your system is bimodal, and

30
00:01:32,208 --> 00:01:36,750
find the cut off that minimizes
the within group variance.

31
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:39,214
Okay?
So you're only allowed to draw one line,

32
00:01:39,214 --> 00:01:43,230
and so, and it's weighted by
essentially this, these, these values.

33
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:44,880
And when you do that,

34
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:49,740
what's kind of cool about it is you can
do that when it's certainly bi-modal.

35
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:54,670
When it's actually tri-modal, let's say,
you'll typically pick one of the modes,

36
00:01:54,670 --> 00:02:00,030
all right, and then, you can, look,
do it again, and, you'll cut it again,

37
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:04,930
and what's kind of nice is when you
slice a mode that shouldn't be sliced,

38
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:07,770
you'll get a reduction in the variance,
but not very much.

39
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:09,639
And you can track how much that is.

40
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:13,860
And it, and the method can be adapted
to do a pretty good job of thresholding

41
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:20,410
a continuous grayscale into either
a binary or a three valued system.
