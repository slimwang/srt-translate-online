1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:05,080
Next, in MainActivity,
define a method to load the container.

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:07,990
We're going to call
that loadGTMContainer.

3
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:11,860
It needs to get the TagManager
instance and load the container

4
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:16,490
using loadCondtainerPreferFresh and
pass in the ID You pass in

5
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:21,420
the TagManager account ID and the
default container that you downloaded.

6
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:23,620
And then you set the result callback.

7
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:29,480
And you do that using setResultCallback
on the result that was

8
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:34,400
returned by loadContainerPreferFresh,
and it takes a containerHolder.

9
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:39,170
And this callback is called when
the loading is finished, and it needs to

10
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:43,210
refresh the holder to make sure we
really have the latest container, and

11
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:45,820
save the holder, and
you would save it using

12
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:50,390
the setContainerHolder method you
defined on your application class.

13
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:54,300
Then we actually have to make sure
that loadGTMContainer gets called, so

14
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,765
call it in onCreate in MainActivity.

15
00:00:57,940 --> 00:00:59,550
And check the boxes when you're done.
