1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,070
So take a look at this diagram.

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:03,010
>> Okay.

3
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:04,510
>> Can you tell me what this is?

4
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:06,100
>> Yeah, Amie, it's an ear.

5
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:08,029
>> Okay, it is and can you tell me what

6
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:11,570
happens when a sound wave comes and enters our ear?

7
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:16,200
>> Well, I'm guessing it's collected by this tube thing here right?

8
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,800
>> Exactly, and that tube thing is called the

9
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:20,520
ear canal. And then what do you think happens?

10
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,590
>> Then, it gets to this thing here.

11
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:25,470
>> That's right. And this thing is called the eardrum, and it's

12
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:27,510
a tight membrane that vibrates at the

13
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:29,740
same frequency as this incoming sound wave.

14
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:32,680
>> That's really cool Andy, but then, what

15
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,280
are these things that's connected to the eardrum?

16
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:38,060
>> These are three tiny bones. So. The

17
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:41,730
vibrations in the eardrum cause these bones to vibrate.

18
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:44,010
>> Alright, well then, what happens when

19
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:46,540
the vibrations get to this curly thing here?

20
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:50,470
>> Right, this curly snake like looking thing is

21
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:55,350
called the cochlea. And the cochlea is filled with fluid. So, when the bones

22
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:59,450
here vibrate, they actually cause the fluid in the cochlea to vibrate as well.

23
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:03,170
>> Okay, so we have vibrating air, which goes in to vibrate

24
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:07,950
the eardrum, which vibrates the bones, which vibrates the fluid in the cochlea?

25
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:12,470
>> Exactly, and lining the inside of this cochlea are

26
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:15,960
thousands of tiny little hairs. And when these hairs vibrate,

27
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:19,940
they cause neurons to fire. The signal gets sent off to part of the

28
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:22,060
brain called the temporal lobe, which is

29
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:24,300
where it's interpreted as sound. Something else that's

30
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:26,310
amazing is that the different frequencies who

31
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:28,940
actually cause different hairs in the cochlea

32
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:32,060
to vibrate. Which is part of how we're able to hear so many different sounds.
