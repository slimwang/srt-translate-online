00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,200
It's important to note, that touch is starting

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:04,810
to show up in many desktops and laptops, like

3
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:07,790
my Chromebook Pixel and many Windows eight machines.

4
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:09,590
So ,don't make the mistake of thinking that touch

5
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:12,130
is only for mobile devices. In fact, this

6
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:14,410
is a critical point. Touch and mouse are not

7
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:16,990
mutually exclusive. The user may use them both

8
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:19,260
on the same device, even at the same time.
