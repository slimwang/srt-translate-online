1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,590
We created the today layout 
so why doesn't it show up?

2
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:06,110
The reason is because we're
using a simple CursorAdapter.

3
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:10,070
Remember that it creates a list item 
for every row in the cursor,

4
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:12,050
but it only supports one item view type.

5
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:15,510
That means that all list items 
must use the same layout.

6
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:17,880
If we want today's forecast 
to look differently

7
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,730
we're going to need to create 
a custom CursorAdapter.

8
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:23,284
That way we can have 
multiple item view types.

9
00:00:23,284 --> 00:00:26,173
Then we can have different 
list item layouts based on what row

10
00:00:26,173 --> 00:00:27,856
of the cursor we're looking at.

11
00:00:27,856 --> 00:00:31,630
Note that the concept of item view types 
applies to adapters in general,

12
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:33,370
not just the CursorAdapter.

13
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:36,150
If you open up the documentation
for CursorAdapter,

14
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:38,080
you'll see that it's an abstract class.

15
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:41,216
It contains two abstract methods 
that you'll need to override,

16
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:45,052
the bindView method
as well as the newView method.

17
00:00:45,052 --> 00:00:47,580
The newView method knows 
how to return a new list item layout

18
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:49,330
but doesn't contain data yet.

19
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:52,020
The bindView method knows 
how to take an existing layout

20
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,990
and update it with the data 
pointed to by the cursor.
