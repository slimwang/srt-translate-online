1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,530
Let's look at other 2D
image transformations.

2
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:05,500
Again, let's look at this simple
equation that we're looking at.

3
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:08,340
Let's say I create
the simple equation here,

4
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:13,962
which basically takes a scale in x and
y directions, Sx and Sy.

5
00:00:13,962 --> 00:00:18,062
And basically what that means is
that this image now would be scaled.

6
00:00:18,062 --> 00:00:20,325
But the parameters Sx and Sy and

7
00:00:20,325 --> 00:00:25,318
they would of course be scaled around
the origin point of the image, 0 and 0.

8
00:00:25,318 --> 00:00:27,810
I mean, there would be a linear
scaling in that direction.

9
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:31,350
Here is an interesting transformation,
M matrix.

10
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:33,430
What would happen when I applied this?

11
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:35,830
If you think about it,
basically what it's going to do,

12
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:38,590
it's going to flip
the image in one direction.

13
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:42,090
So basically, what it's going to do is,
when I have the y-axis going this way,

14
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:44,940
it's going to flip all of
the values on the, this side.

15
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:48,100
That is the right side of the image,
to the left and

16
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:49,370
all the left ones to the right.

17
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:52,100
So basically,
that'll be a mirror operation.

18
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:56,760
If I put minus 1 on both of them, that
would be a mirror over the origin, so

19
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:59,910
basically it will flip both an x,
axis and

20
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:03,050
the y-axis to generate
a mirror flipped image.

21
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:06,550
Here is another interesting one which
basically now I put the terms on the two

22
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:09,794
off diagonal terms, and
we would refer to this as shear, so

23
00:01:09,794 --> 00:01:14,010
shear in x and shear in y would give
us and image that would be sheared.

24
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:16,910
That basically would kind of have
the impact of kind of having top row of

25
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,660
the image,
kind of move towards the left.

26
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:21,920
And, I'm sorry, top part of the image
moving towards to the right and

27
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,990
bottom moving to the left.

28
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:24,480
We'll show examples of that in a bit,
too.
