1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:02,510
Don't worry if this doesn't
feel fast to you at first.

2
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:05,020
Learning to navigate your computer
from the command line takes time

3
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:06,500
and practice.

4
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:08,130
When I first learned to drive a car,

5
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:10,650
sitting in the driver's
seat was terrifying.

6
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:12,510
I remember stressing over
having to change lanes,

7
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:14,480
trying to keep track of all the steps.

8
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,140
Check ahead of you,
check the rear-view mirror,

9
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:18,090
check your shoulder, turn on the signal.

10
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:20,830
Gradually move into the new lane,
turn off the signal.

11
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:22,000
Whoo, it was a lot!

12
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:26,150
After some practice though,
driving became second nature.

13
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:28,980
I no longer have to think about
the steps needed to change lanes.

14
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:31,510
I just do it without consciously
thinking about each individual step.

15
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:35,460
The same idea applies to learning
how to use the command line.

16
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:37,280
At first you'll struggle to
remember which commands to

17
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,950
use in a given situation.

18
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:41,560
And then once you decide on a command,
it might feel clunky or

19
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:43,270
slow to type it out.

20
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:46,270
With enough practice, however,
it'll become second nature.

21
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:48,820
You won't have to stop and think about
which command you'll need to use.

22
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:49,320
You'll just know.
