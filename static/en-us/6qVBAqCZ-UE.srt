1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:05,090
One type of network IDS configuration,
is inline sensors.

2
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:08,930
The primary motivation for
using inline sensors

3
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:13,620
is to enable them to block an attack,
when an attack is detected.

4
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:15,600
That is, in such a case,

5
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:21,280
an inline sensor performs both intrusion
detection and intrusion prevention.

6
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:24,590
And of course, for
an inline sensor to be effective,

7
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:29,570
it must be placed at a network point
where traffic must pass through it.

8
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:34,610
We can deploy an inline sensor as
a combination of network ideas and

9
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:37,620
a firewall,
in a single piece of hardware.

10
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:42,870
Or, we can deploy the inline sensor
as a stand alone, inline network IDS.
