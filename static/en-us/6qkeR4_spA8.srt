1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:02,600
But wait, I don't understand. Let's take the

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:05,220
girl with the heart condition. Neither one of her

3
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:07,680
parents have the same condition. So how can they

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,680
be responsible if they don't share the same trait?

5
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:13,050
>> Well, one of the big discoveries that I picked up on is that

6
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:15,200
living organisms have 2 copies of every

7
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,470
gene. And though these copies can be different

8
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:21,860
from each other. Only one manifests itself as a trait in a certain generation.

9
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:26,130
Let's use our deck of playing cards as an example. Let's imagine that each pair

10
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:28,730
has 2 playing cards each. A six of

11
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:31,970
hearts which correlates with a normal functioning heart, and

12
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:35,940
an ace which can cause the abnormal heart condition.

13
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:38,930
Even though one of the copies in the pair

14
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:42,370
causes the heart condition It's hidden, as long

15
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:45,030
as the other copy has normal function. So the

16
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:48,070
parent appears to have normal heart function, even though

17
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:51,730
they have one normal copy, and one abnormal copy.

18
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:55,390
When the parents have a child, each parent randomly

19
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:58,640
passes on one of the cards. As long as

20
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,050
the child ends up with at least one number

21
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:04,550
card She'll have normal heart function, but if she

22
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:07,880
ends up with two aces she'll suffer from that

23
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:10,710
abnormal heart condition. So see if you can figure

24
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:14,150
out how many total possible combinations there are if

25
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:17,100
these two parents have a child. And how many combinations

26
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:18,720
would result in the heart condition.
