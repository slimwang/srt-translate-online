00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,250
Every type of content that can be
transmitted on the Internet has a two

2
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:07,669
part identifier that describes it,
and that's called a media type.

3
00:00:08,699 --> 00:00:13,329
You might see the more archaic name
sometimes, MIME type, which stands for

4
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:15,554
multipurpose Internet mail extensions.

5
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:22,020
When they were initially defined for
RFC 2046, media types

6
00:00:22,019 --> 00:00:26,565
allowed you to have multi-part emails
with different types of attachments.

7
00:00:26,565 --> 00:00:31,160
Media types are a reason why someone
can send a single email with images,

8
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:34,789
video, and
other file types as attachments, and

9
00:00:34,789 --> 00:00:37,899
your email client knows exactly
how to interpret each file.

10
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:44,420
A media type string consists of a type,
a subtype, and optional parameters.

11
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:47,550
Here's an example media type that
describes most of the web pages on

12
00:00:47,549 --> 00:00:48,739
the Internet.

13
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:52,920
The type of data is text,
specifically HTML text, and

14
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,719
it has a character set
encoding of UTF-8.

15
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,479
Here are a couple other
examples of plain text,

16
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:05,090
formatted RTF text,
and a PNG image file.

17
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:07,018
Here are a couple other examples.

18
00:01:07,018 --> 00:01:10,920
Whenever you want to share data between
apps, you'll have to specify it's media

19
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:15,320
type so that Android can determine how
and if it can fulfill the request.
