1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:04,316
Or attacks can be considered a result
of violation of security policies,

2
00:00:04,316 --> 00:00:06,730
therefore, as a prevention mechanism,

3
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:11,100
a firewall should be designed
to enforce security policies.

4
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:12,510
So what is a policy?

5
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:16,470
At a high level a security policy
specifies whats allowed and

6
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:20,150
whatever is not specified
is by default not allowed.

7
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:23,320
In other words,
what is allowed means what is good or

8
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:25,500
acceptable to the organization.

9
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,810
Obviously, policy is
organization specific, and

10
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:31,000
we will come back to this point later.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,640
So specific to firewalls,

12
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,600
a firewall is designed to enforce
security policies on network traffic.

13
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,820
That is, all traffic, inbound and
outbound, meaning, from internal network

14
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:45,720
to the internet or vice versa,
must pass through the firewall.

15
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:49,340
And the firewall will
enforce policy on a traffic.

16
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:52,940
In other words, only traffic
authorized by the security policies

17
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:55,640
is allowed to pass through the firewall.

18
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:58,830
In addition to gravity enforcing
the security policies,

19
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:02,050
a firewall also must be dependable.

20
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:05,420
This means that the firewall
must not be easily to crash or

21
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:07,260
disabled by an attack.

22
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:11,420
The reason is obvious, because if
the firewall is disabled by an attack,

23
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:13,980
then all subsequent attacks
can get into our network.
