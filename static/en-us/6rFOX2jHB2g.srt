1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:01,556
Okay, here's our first technique.

2
00:00:01,556 --> 00:00:04,109
It's called Eliminate,
and it works as follows.

3
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:08,550
Let's start with a simple board, and
let's say we have one box filled in.

4
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:11,170
For example,
this box is filled in with a seven.

5
00:00:11,169 --> 00:00:12,849
So what do we know?

6
00:00:12,849 --> 00:00:14,849
Well, we know that every row, column,

7
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:17,478
or three-by-three square must
contain exactly one seven.

8
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:22,730
So in particular, any box in
the same row can't contain a 7,

9
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:25,899
any box in the same column
also can't contain a 7.

10
00:00:25,899 --> 00:00:30,901
And finally, any box in the same
3x3 square can't contain a 7.

11
00:00:30,902 --> 00:00:35,049
So we've gathered some information on
the board just by looking at one box.

12
00:00:35,049 --> 00:00:38,811
So let's see how to apply this in real
life, let's look at this Sudoku and

13
00:00:38,811 --> 00:00:40,109
this highlighted box here.

14
00:00:41,109 --> 00:00:44,729
And let's look at all the possibilities
for the values of this box.

15
00:00:44,729 --> 00:00:48,109
We'll highlight in blue the boxes
in the same units as it.

16
00:00:48,109 --> 00:00:51,460
First, we can see that the value
of this box cannot be a 1,

17
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:54,990
since there's a 1 in the same 3x3 box.

18
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:58,279
Same thing with 2,
since there's a 2 in the same column.

19
00:00:58,279 --> 00:01:03,117
We continue this process for

20
00:01:03,116 --> 00:01:08,566
3, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.

21
00:01:08,566 --> 00:01:12,540
And we conclude that the only
available value for this box is 4.

22
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:16,410
Thus we assign the value 4 to this box.

23
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:18,310
This is called
the elimination technique.

24
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:19,549
You'll have the chance to code it below.
