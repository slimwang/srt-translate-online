00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:05,266
Lets look at the solution with our storage comparison quiz. The total access

2
00:00:05,266 --> 00:00:10,606
time with the disk will be when we play a game, we will read two gigabytes

3
00:00:10,606 --> 00:00:15,679
at 100 megabytes a second, so we will spend 20 seconds reading

4
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:20,247
these two gigabytes. And we will also spend ten

5
00:00:20,247 --> 00:00:25,392
seconds writing to the ten megabytes. So we will spend 30 seconds

6
00:00:25,392 --> 00:00:27,655
here and then a sequential read of the

7
00:00:27,655 --> 00:00:31,290
one gigabyte here will be another ten seconds.

8
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:33,407
So over the four hours we spent 40

9
00:00:33,407 --> 00:00:36,692
seconds reading and writing you, using the disk, we

10
00:00:36,692 --> 00:00:39,862
repeat that four times. And we get 40

11
00:00:39,862 --> 00:00:44,630
seconds times four, equals 160 seconds. With flash, we

12
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:47,420
get one gigabyte per second so we will

13
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:51,920
get two seconds and change and another one second.

14
00:00:51,920 --> 00:01:00,370
So we will get 3.01 seconds times 4. We get 12.04 seconds. Which is way better

15
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:06,220
than the disk. But if all we have is flash, we have to buy a lot of flash,

16
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:09,680
and we probably paid thousands of dollars. So,

17
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,910
now let's say what happens with the disk and

18
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:14,300
the four gigabytes of flash. The first time

19
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:17,120
we read these two gigabytes and another ten megabytes,

20
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:21,200
we will read them in 30 seconds, because we are accessing our disk, but then we

21
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,835
move them to the flash. The next read is going to be the one gigabyte again in

22
00:01:25,835 --> 00:01:31,618
ten seconds but we move them to the flash. So we spend 40 seconds accessing

23
00:01:31,618 --> 00:01:37,228
the disk in the first round of this, and we spend 3.01 seconds

24
00:01:37,228 --> 00:01:42,473
copying this data to the flash. After that, we're having

25
00:01:42,473 --> 00:01:47,953
the flash access time. So all together we have 40 seconds of disk access

26
00:01:47,953 --> 00:01:53,686
time, plus 1 4th of this for copying to the flash, and 3 4ths of this for

27
00:01:53,686 --> 00:01:56,871
actually reading off the flash the same as

28
00:01:56,871 --> 00:02:00,840
here, for a total of 52.04 seconds. So

29
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:04,150
although it's slower than pure flash, it's still

30
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:08,160
much faster than pure disk. And this is

31
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,919
about as costly as a single disk, because four

32
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:13,310
gigabytes of flash are not going to cost us that much.
