00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:01,900
When using shared memory,

2
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:05,820
the operating system doesn't restrict
you how the memory will be used.

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:10,910
However, the choice of the API or
the specific mechanisms that will be

4
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:15,310
used for synchronization are not the
only decisions that you need to make.

5
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:19,030
Remember, with shared memory,
the operating system.

6
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:23,350
Provides the shared memory area and
then it's out of the way, all of

7
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:27,570
the data passing and synchronization
protocols are up to the programmer.

8
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:31,990
So in the upcoming more we will mention
a few things that you can consider to

00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:33,460
assist with your design process
