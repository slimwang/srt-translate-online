1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:00,770
Quiz two.

2
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:03,730
Two, my finger's a little slow, two.

3
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:11,540
Suppose I told you that the transform from image A to image B is affine.

4
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:13,630
'Kay, now you have to go back through a few slides,

5
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:14,850
remember what affine is, go ahead.

6
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:18,080
Okay.

7
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,960
How many pairs of corresponding points would you need to compute,

8
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,000
the affine transformation.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,690
Same set of answers, a 3, b 1, c 2, d 4.

10
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:33,000
How many pairs of corresponding points to do the affine?
