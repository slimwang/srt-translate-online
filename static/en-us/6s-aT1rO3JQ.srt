00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,440
So the question is, if the only rule that we have for making words is this

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:04,900
one, the one I should you before, where

3
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:07,390
we have the non-terminal word, and that can be

4
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:12,030
replaced by counter followed by another word, then the question is, how many

5
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:16,079
words can we make starting from the non-terminal word? And the possible answers

6
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:24,851
are none, one, two, or infinitely many.
