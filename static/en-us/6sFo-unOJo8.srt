00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,841
The last model of motivation that we're going to discuss was developed by

2
00:00:03,841 --> 00:00:09,321
Abraham Maslow. Maslow developed the model of motivation in which he termed the

3
00:00:09,321 --> 00:00:14,244
Hierarchy of needs. This Hierarchy of needs states that we progress or move

4
00:00:14,244 --> 00:00:19,300
onto higher needs once the more basic needs are relatively well satisfied.

5
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:23,854
Otherwise, we stay concerned with the more basic level needs. Here. Look at

6
00:00:23,854 --> 00:00:27,892
this model. For example, if we're dying of hunger, we're not concerned with

7
00:00:27,892 --> 00:00:33,834
beauty or aesthetics. But only with getting food. At the most basic level of

8
00:00:33,834 --> 00:00:38,944
needs, we need to fill our physiological needs. These are the things such as

9
00:00:38,944 --> 00:00:43,575
the need for food, water, oxygen. Or even an adequate body temperature. These

10
00:00:43,575 --> 00:00:47,044
are our basic needs in order to survive. And once we have our physiological

11
00:00:47,044 --> 00:00:50,516
needs met we can move on to the next level of the pyramid and that's a need for

12
00:00:50,516 --> 00:00:55,403
safety and security. Safety needs are things such as having security,

13
00:00:55,403 --> 00:00:59,289
protection, stability and also not being exposed to things such as terrorism or

14
00:00:59,289 --> 00:01:06,366
fighting. On the third level. Is our need for love and belongingness. According

15
00:01:06,366 --> 00:01:09,822
to Maslow, the third level includes things such as our desire to belong to our

16
00:01:09,822 --> 00:01:15,018
family or belong to our social groups. We'll discuss the need for belonging in

17
00:01:15,018 --> 00:01:19,050
more detail a little later on in the lesson. The next level is our self-esteem

18
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:24,459
needs. And this is the need to appreciate ourselves and our worth. Here, we

19
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:28,770
want to be appreciated and respected by others. Finally, at the top of the

20
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:32,610
Hierarchy of needs is self-actualization, or the inherent drive to realize

21
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:38,298
one's full potential or one's abilities in life. But because this is at the top

22
00:01:38,298 --> 00:01:41,353
of the hierarchy, it's harder to achieve because all of our other needs need to

23
00:01:41,353 --> 00:01:43,390
be satisfies first.
