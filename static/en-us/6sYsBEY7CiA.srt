If you chose the circle, great work. I know I have 1 part of the circle shaded

2
00:00:04,393 --> 00:00:09,089
out of 5 equal parts. So, that's definitely 1/5. The second one isn't 1/4. I do

3
00:00:09,101 --> 00:00:13,357
have 5 parts but they're not all equal. I have 1 of them shaded but remember,

4
00:00:13,457 --> 00:00:17,788
the parts need to be equal. This one is also correct. I have 1 out of 5 pieces

5
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:22,245
and all the pieces are equally shaped. This triangle is also not correct. I do

6
00:00:22,257 --> 00:00:26,916
have 1 piece shaded, but I have 1 of 4. So this one is really 1/4. This one is

7
00:00:26,928 --> 00:00:31,601
also correct. I have 5 pieces of my entire rectangle and I have one of them

8
00:00:31,613 --> 00:00:36,670
shaded, so 1/5. This one is also not correct. I have 5 pieces, but they're not

9
00:00:36,682 --> 00:00:41,756
equally shaped. The area hasn't been divided into 5 equal pieces, so this can't

10
00:00:41,768 --> 00:00:42,971
be 1/5 of the area
