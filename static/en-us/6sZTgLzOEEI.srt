00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,476
We've just seen that if we have negative 2 is less than 2x is less than 10, you

2
00:00:04,476 --> 00:00:09,100
can divide everything by two. And we'll end up with negative 1 is less than x is

3
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:13,607
less than 5. Let's look further into how we can solve inequalities. But this

4
00:00:13,607 --> 00:00:18,202
time we'll just start by dealing with single inequalities. Let's say I have 3x

5
00:00:18,202 --> 00:00:23,148
is greater than or equal to 12. Can you write an inequality in this box just for

6
00:00:23,148 --> 00:00:27,823
x. So I'd like you to isolate x on one side of the inequality and then have just

7
00:00:27,823 --> 00:00:29,458
a number on the other side.
