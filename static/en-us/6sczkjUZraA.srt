00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,400
Suppose you apply the Euler Tour
technique to the post order

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:04,160
numbering problem.

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:07,260
And lets further suppose
that the list scan or

4
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:10,410
list prefix sum that you
use is work optimal.

5
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:14,050
Under that assumption, it turns out that
the overall work of an Euler Tour is

6
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:16,800
linear, but what about the span?

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,960
If you just look at step three,
its span is logarithm make an end.

8
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,850
But does that mean the overall
Euler tour approach will

9
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:25,940
also have logarithmic span?

10
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:29,320
Or do you think the span should somehow
depend on the shape of the tree?

11
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:35,720
Consider the claim that the overall span
or depth of this algorithm is log n.

12
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:36,810
True or false?
