00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,961
There's one x intercept whose x coordinate is negative 3, and there's one whose

2
00:00:03,961 --> 00:00:07,580
coordinate is 5. We can see this from the equation as well based on these

3
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:13,296
factors. We know that at the x intercepts the value of this function is 0. So

4
00:00:13,296 --> 00:00:16,175
these are the two x values that make either of these factors 0, which then

5
00:00:16,175 --> 00:00:20,708
makes the entire expression equal to what would be on the left hand side, 0.
