00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,452
Well, this x intercept is three units to the left of 0, so that's negative 3 for

2
00:00:05,452 --> 00:00:10,642
the x coordinate. And I don't move vertically up or down, so the y coordinate

3
00:00:10,642 --> 00:00:15,697
must be 0. For the y intercept, we don't move left and we don't move right, so

4
00:00:15,697 --> 00:00:20,241
the x coordinate is 0. Then, I move two units up, so positive 2 in the y

5
00:00:20,241 --> 00:00:21,067
direction.
