1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:03,510
So let me give you a little bit of a course overview.

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:08,490
To do that, let me explain sort of how the course is thought of, at least by me,

3
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:11,070
and Arpin thought this was really good, and Arpin's really smart, so

4
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:13,030
if he thought this was really good, maybe it's, it's good.

5
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:16,329
You can think of computer vision as being a relationship between sort of

6
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:19,320
three ways of thinking about what goes on.

7
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,490
At the top of the triangle is the computational model.

8
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:24,470
Often that's the math.

9
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:27,220
The, and I'll use an example from stereo.

10
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:31,780
So here we're showing you sort of the, the mathematics geometry behind, if you

11
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:35,880
have multiple views looking at a point out there, how you could reason about it,

12
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:40,810
and how what the math would be behind trying to find its actual depth, right?

13
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:43,470
The idea, you know, here's its center of one camera,

14
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:46,170
the center of another camera, here is some point, possibly here, here,

15
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:50,470
here, and by matching, we're going to be able to figure out what the depth is.

16
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:51,710
Once we have the math,

17
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:56,420
we can develop an algorithm, so here's an example of doing stereo by

18
00:00:56,420 --> 00:01:00,670
what's called just correlating two patches along an epipolar line.

19
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:02,850
Don't worry, you're going to learn what these things are.

20
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:05,239
And computing say, the sum of square differences.

21
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:08,080
Just how well they match and you would measure that, and

22
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,630
the point at the minimum,

23
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:13,700
that's what this bottom point here is, that would be the right match.

24
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:16,470
And by knowing that match, I would know what the depth is.

25
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:17,910
So that's the algorithm.

26
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:21,430
And then the algorithm when we describe it to you in class or

27
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:24,360
in lecture, the algorithm always works.

28
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:28,170
But of course, the last point of the triangle are real images.

29
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:32,440
And when you apply these algorithms to real images, you're going to find that,

30
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:35,515
oh, you know, Professor Bobic, he just lied.

31
00:01:35,515 --> 00:01:37,050
[LAUGH] Okay.

32
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:39,990
In particular, what you're going to find is that to make these things

33
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:42,950
work requires some reasonable amount of experimentation.

34
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:46,000
So we'll give you images in stereo, actually, we'll give you some scenes for

35
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,720
which there exists ground truth.

36
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,870
That is, you actually know what the right answer is.

37
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:54,030
And the question will be, how close is your result to the right answer?

38
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:56,475
The answer's going to be not really close.

39
00:01:56,475 --> 00:01:59,841
[LAUGH] Because you're going to be implementing a relatively straightforward

40
00:01:59,841 --> 00:02:00,980
stereo algorithm.

41
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:04,290
And the reason there are more complicated stereo algorithms out there is because

42
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:07,430
the straightforward one doesn't handle all the little issues that

43
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:08,310
show up in a real image.

44
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:12,052
This triangle of three ways of thinking about computer vision,

45
00:02:12,052 --> 00:02:13,980
computational models, algorithm, and

46
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:18,010
real imagery, that's really, that triangle is how the course is structured.

47
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:20,510
What we'll do is, we'll develop the theory,

48
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:24,550
which will explain to you why it's possible to compute these things, and then,

49
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:27,550
we'll show some algorithms that implement that theory by

50
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:32,030
making certain assumptions or certain ways of going about handling the images.

51
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:34,290
And then, you'll actually apply them to real images,

52
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:37,210
which have all of their own mysterious properties.

53
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:39,640
That's going to be, will talk more about, in a minute about the problem sets.

54
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:42,690
The idea of the problem sets is to get you to understand sort of

55
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:45,750
the interplay between the theory, the algorithm, and the images.
