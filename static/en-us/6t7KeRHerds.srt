all of our career development
events take place.

Like we mentioned before, developing
your technically skills is of course

4
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:11,780
very important, but if you don't
know how to show case these skills,

00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:13,640
no one else in the world
will know what you can do.

00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:16,870
We'll help you learn how to market
yourself as a professional, so

11
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:30,930
it's important for you to watch ones
that recorded in the past as well.
