00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,558
So, we said earlier that Grant spends the
same amount of money every month, which

2
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:09,192
means that the total amount of money that
he spent will increase incrementally as

3
00:00:09,204 --> 00:00:13,586
each month goes by. We know then at the
total amount of money spent can't just be

4
00:00:13,598 --> 00:00:17,965
equal to the money spent each month Our
answer down here has to involve time too.

5
00:00:18,057 --> 00:00:21,855
For example, after one year Grant will
have spent way more money than he had

6
00:00:21,867 --> 00:00:26,130
after just one month of being in business.
So that means that this first answer right

7
00:00:26,142 --> 00:00:30,215
here can't be right, because it doesn't
involve time. However since we know that

8
00:00:30,227 --> 00:00:34,449
the same amount of money is spent each
month, the second trace rate one here is

9
00:00:34,461 --> 00:00:38,755
the correct one. It says that the total
amount of money spent after a certain

10
00:00:38,767 --> 00:00:43,458
amount of time is equal to the money spent
each month times the number of months that

11
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:48,099
have gone by. These 2 bottom answers don't
involve the amount of money that Grant is

12
00:00:48,111 --> 00:00:52,616
spending, so we can just eliminate them
also for good measure. Great job on this

13
00:00:52,628 --> 00:00:52,889
quiz.
