00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Congratulations. We should be happy we've made it all the way through.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Now let's try to summarize what it is that we've covered in this unit.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
To a large extent, this unit was about tools--

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
how to build useful tools, how to recognize what they are and put them together,

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
and how to apply them to components of a domain.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
In particular, one of the important tools we looked at is language--

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
being able to define the language that you want to deal with

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
rather than the language that Python happens to give you.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
We talked about grammars that describe a language,

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
interpreters that interpret them, and compilers that do the same thing only faster.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
The other main lesson in this unit was functions.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Functions, too, are a very powerful tool

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
They're powerful in a way that statements are not.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
With statements, although in the end we need our statements to write our programs,

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
they have this flaw in that they're not as composable as functions are.

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
If you want to reuse a statement somewhere else, the only you have to do is copy and paste.

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
That's an issue. That can be a problem.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
because then you've copy multiple copies and you update one but you don't update the other.

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
With functions you compose them rather than copy and paste them,

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
and so that means there's one function that's an object,

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
and that gets reused automatically.

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
When you change it, it gets changed everywhere, because there's one object,

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
not multiple copies with copy and paste.

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
That's the advantages of functions.

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
We talked about decorators as functions.

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
We showed how to use functions as objects,

27
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
and we showed some patterns for how they fit together

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
and allow us to define tools.

29
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I hope you found this all useful,

30
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
and I think you'll see in the homework assignments that we have for this unit

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
that the difficulty has been stepped up a bit, but you should be able to handle them

32
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
with the tools that we've covered.
