Now, there are two distinct processes that control behavior. It's reinforcement

2
00:00:04,375 --> 00:00:08,730
and punishment. A reinforcement always results in an increase in the future

3
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:14,822
likelihood a behavior will occur under similar circumstances. Meaning, if Saki

4
00:00:14,822 --> 00:00:18,592
is always reinforced with fish or praise after giving a kiss, it's likely that

5
00:00:18,592 --> 00:00:22,014
next time she is asked to give a kiss during a demonstration, that she's

6
00:00:22,014 --> 00:00:27,840
going to do it. On the other hand, a punishment always results in the decreased

7
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:33,072
likelihood of a behavior occurring. So, for example, if Sake was punished every

8
00:00:33,072 --> 00:00:37,914
time she gave a kiss, she would be less likely to do that behavior again. Now

00:00:37,914 --> 00:00:40,639
let's go to an interview with Dr. Zeligs.
