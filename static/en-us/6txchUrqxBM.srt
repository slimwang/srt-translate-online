2
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:09,380
inexpensive measurement devices,
and mobile computing devices,

3
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:13,420
are empowering patients to become
a participant in the healthcare team.

00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:18,970
However, for the most part, we've had a

00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:24,950
How can physicians manage their entire
patient population effectively and

6
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:26,480
efficiently?

7
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,424
That's the topic of Lesson 8.
