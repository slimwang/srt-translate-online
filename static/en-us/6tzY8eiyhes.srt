00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,744
When we first look at the composition of two function, we first evaluated a

2
00:00:03,744 --> 00:00:08,774
function, add a number. And then we took that output and plugged it back into a

3
00:00:08,774 --> 00:00:14,080
new function to get a new output. But we wouldn't want to do this every single

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,050
time for every single different number. Wouldn't it be nice if we just had one

5
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:23,092
function that could do the composition for us? This is what we're going to find

6
00:00:23,092 --> 00:00:29,550
right now. F of g in terms of x. To find f of g of x, we're simply going to

7
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:37,766
take the entire function, g of x and plug it in for the variable x. We'll plug

8
00:00:37,766 --> 00:00:43,752
this function into the other function as an input. So anywhere that we see x in

9
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:49,475
our function for f, we're going to replace it with x plus 5. So notice that I

10
00:00:49,475 --> 00:00:56,540
have 3x here. So instead of 3x, I'll have 3 times, x plus 5, my new input.

11
00:00:56,540 --> 00:01:01,155
Notice how I took the entire function of g of x. And I put it inside as the

12
00:01:01,155 --> 00:01:07,396
input for f of x. Distributing this positive 3 will get the function 3x plus

13
00:01:07,396 --> 00:01:12,400
15. This is the composite function f of g of x.
