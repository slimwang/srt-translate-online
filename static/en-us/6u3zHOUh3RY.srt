00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,550
To start the new width goes here.

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:04,390
The new height goes right here.

00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:07,380
And I type the device
pixel ratio in right here.

4
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:11,230
For the user agent string I simply
pasted into the box right here.

5
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:14,110
And then I got this message
that I needed to reload.

6
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:16,940
