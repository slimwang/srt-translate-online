1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Now, just one more thing.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I can't help but describe what is probably the most famous probability problem of all.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
It's called the Monty Hall Problem after the game show host.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
And the idea is that you're on a game show, and there's 3 doors:

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
door #1, door #2, and door #3.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
And behind each door is a prize, and you know that one of the doors

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
contains an expensive sports car, which you would find desirable,

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
and the other 2 doors contain a goat, which you would find less desirable.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Now, say you're given a choice, and let's say you choose door #1.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
But according to the conventions of the game, the host, Monty Hall,

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
will now open one of the doors, knowing that the door that he opens

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
contains a goat, and he shows you door #3.

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
And he now gives you the opportunity to stick with your choice

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
or to switch to the other door.

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
What I want you to tell me is, what is your probability of winning

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
if you stick to door #1, and what is the probability of winning

17
00:01:15,000 --> 99:59:59,999
if you switched to door #2?
