00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,775
There are a few different ways for
command to output its results.

2
00:00:03,775 --> 00:00:06,350
Commands typically put there
output to the terminal.

3
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:10,320
For example, the uptime command prints
out a single line of information.

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,010
This single line of output
always has the same format.

5
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:17,280
First comes the current time, then comes
the computer's uptime in terms of days,

6
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,340
minutes, and hours,
next is how many users are logged in.

7
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:24,400
And the last item on the line is
the computer's current load average.

8
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,900
In this case, it looks like the computer
is running about 0.01 processes

9
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:31,210
at a time on average, so
it's not very busy right now.

10
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:34,360
Every time you run uptime,
you'll get output in this format.

11
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:37,420
Other programs can be a bit more
dynamic in their output, though.

12
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:40,245
The amount of information they
print depends on various factors.

13
00:00:40,245 --> 00:00:43,159
For example,
the host command prints out one line for

14
00:00:43,159 --> 00:00:46,000
each entry in a domain's DNS record.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,970
System administrators can specify
lots of different things in their DNS

16
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:51,430
records, so the host command
needs to be flexible and

17
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:54,000
print out however much
information is available.

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,610
Here we see that Linux weekly news
has a simpler DNS configuration,

19
00:00:57,610 --> 00:00:59,570
it only has two entries.

20
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:01,652
LS is another command
that works this way.

21
00:01:01,652 --> 00:01:04,117
It prints the name of every
file in the current directory.

22
00:01:04,117 --> 00:01:06,742
That means that LS will sometimes
output a lot of text, and

23
00:01:06,742 --> 00:01:08,380
sometimes none at all.

24
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:10,630
Let's run LS again and see the result.

25
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:13,340
When we ran LS earlier,
there was no output.

26
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:16,065
Now we see there's one file, stuff.zip.

27
00:01:16,065 --> 00:01:18,890
This kind of dynamically sized
output is pretty common.

28
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:20,532
A lot of commands work this way.

29
00:01:20,532 --> 00:01:24,084
It can be disconcerting to run a command
and get no output or very little output,

30
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:25,400
but don't panic.

31
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,600
When using the shell,
no news is usually good news.

32
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:31,040
Now it's your turn to
interpret LS' output.

33
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,560
Let's switch to another terminal
running on another computer.

34
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,220
How many items are in this directory?
