00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:02,740
The visitor count for a small doctor's office today would

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:05,380
be relatively small. So, we can probably get away with

3
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:08,690
an int, and we would write that as 123. The

4
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:11,390
number of gallons used could be pretty much anything. We

5
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:13,540
don't know what it's being used for, so it could

6
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:16,230
be two or 2 million. It probably doesn't have to

7
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:19,530
be an integer. You could have 2.5 gallons of water.

8
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:25,590
So, this should be a double, and we could write it

9
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:27,830
as 123 point or 1.23E2. Either one of these would

10
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:31,680
work for initializing this variable. PageViews, or the number of pages

11
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:34,030
of a website viewed by users this quarter, could be a

12
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:37,920
very large number. Think about how many YouTube videos get watched.

13
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,780
But it has to be an integer number because it's a

14
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:43,360
count. So I would use a long. And when you initialize

15
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:48,590
a long, you would use something like 123L. Half-life, a measure

16
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,900
of how long it takes a signal from a radioactive oxygen

17
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:55,430
isotope to decrease by half is another double. There's nothing to guarantee

18
00:00:55,430 --> 00:01:00,018
that this would be another integer value. We could initialize this again

19
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:05,209
using 123 point or 1.23E2. And for this case, and also the

20
00:01:05,209 --> 00:01:08,920
gallons case, we could have just written 123. That would work as well.
