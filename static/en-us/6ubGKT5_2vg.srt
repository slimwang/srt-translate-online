00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,649
We've been talking a lot about equations that are in the form, y equals mx plus

2
00:00:04,661 --> 00:00:09,348
b. And we've talked about how m here represents the slope of this line, and b is

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:13,988
the y-coordinate of the y-intercept, the place where the graph intersects the

4
00:00:14,091 --> 00:00:18,423
y-axis. When we write an equation in this form, we say that it is written in

5
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:23,133
slope-intercept form. Since, as we've seen, this lets us just read off the

6
00:00:23,145 --> 00:00:27,771
values of the slope and the y-intercept. Understanding the rule that each of

7
00:00:27,783 --> 00:00:32,165
these constants play in this equation and its graph, can help us get to the

8
00:00:32,177 --> 00:00:36,904
stage of graphing a lot quicker. Let's see if we can figure out how to graph the

9
00:00:36,916 --> 00:00:41,335
equation y equals negative 2x plus 10 without creating an xy table first. Let's

10
00:00:41,347 --> 00:00:46,034
just move straight to the graph. Of course, we have to start by setting up our x

11
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:49,948
and y axes. Notice here that the scale on either axis is different.

12
00:00:50,051 --> 00:00:54,208
Horizontally, we're counting by ones with each grid but vertically, we're

13
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:58,527
counting by fours. I just want to make sure we have enough room to show as much

14
00:00:58,539 --> 00:01:02,687
of this line as I want to. One pretty easy way for us to start out would be by

15
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:06,711
filling in a point that we can find out super easily. So, please begin by

16
00:01:06,723 --> 00:01:11,051
telling me where the y-intercept of this equation is. Please don't forget that

17
00:01:11,063 --> 00:01:15,380
the y-intercept is actually a point, a set of coordinates, not just one number.
