1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,510
And, the correct answer is something like this line over here.

2
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:04,390
I'm not entirely sure it's the correct line,

3
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:07,340
but there's a correlation between x and y.

4
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:07,880
And, you can see,

5
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:11,930
the more you go to the right side, the more these, these numbers increase.

6
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:13,200
And, that gives me,

7
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,830
as the main axis of variation, kind of the spectrum over here
