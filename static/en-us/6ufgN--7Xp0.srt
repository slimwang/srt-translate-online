00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:06,760
Recall that in any modern operating system, each process is in it's own

2
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:10,190
protection domain. And usually, a separate hardware

3
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:14,420
address space. And the operating system maintains

4
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:19,120
a page table on behalf of each of these processes. The page table

5
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:22,210
is the operating system's data structure that

6
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:25,510
holds the mapping between the virtual page

7
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:29,330
numbers and the physical pages where those

8
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:32,810
virtual pages are contained in the main memory

9
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:34,922
of the hardware. The physical memory of

10
00:00:34,922 --> 00:00:37,660
course is contiguous starting from zero to whatever

11
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:41,050
is the maximum limit of the hardware

12
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:45,010
capabilities are. But the virtual address pace of

13
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:47,660
a given processor course is not contiguous

14
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:51,120
in physical memory, but it is scattered all

15
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,570
over the physical memory. And that's in some sense the advantage that

16
00:00:55,570 --> 00:01:01,060
you get with page based memory management. That a process notion of

17
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:04,830
which virtual address being contiguous is

18
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:07,420
not necessarily reflected in the physical

19
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:13,540
mapping of those virtual pages to the physical pages in the main memory.
