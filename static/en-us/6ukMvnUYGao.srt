1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:02,969
Finally, you're ready
to launch your cluster.

2
00:00:02,969 --> 00:00:05,040
On the name node,
format the file system.

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:05,890
Then star hdfs.

4
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:10,520
Since the name known as connecting
to the data node for the first time,

5
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:13,590
it might ask you if you
want to continue connecting.

6
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:14,500
Say yes.

7
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:17,206
Sometimes it might hang
without another prompt.

8
00:00:17,206 --> 00:00:19,851
Just type in yes again, and get going.

9
00:00:19,851 --> 00:00:22,718
You can check that your node are running
by going to the named nodes web

10
00:00:22,718 --> 00:00:24,600
interface in a browser.

11
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,300
You can get there with the name node
public host name on port five zero zero

12
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:29,720
seven zero.

13
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:31,220
Okay, this is what I see.

14
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:33,640
And here,
we see we have three live nodes.

15
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:34,400
These are the data nodes.

16
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:37,348
Now Start yarn.

17
00:00:37,348 --> 00:00:40,518
And finally, start the jobbers.

18
00:00:40,518 --> 00:00:45,034
And finally,
start the job history server.

19
00:00:45,034 --> 00:00:47,219
Now you can see the daemons running.

20
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:50,670
On the name node enter JPS.

21
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:54,500
Here you see the JobHistoryServer
SecondaryNameNode NameNode and

22
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:55,690
a ResourceManager.

23
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:58,370
These are all daemone that are running
on the name node computer.

24
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:05,209
And on the data node, you see
a NodeManager and the DataNode daemone.
