00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,370
Here are a few different
kinds of elements and

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:04,620
you've seen most of these before.

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:08,260
I've added background color so
each one stands out.

4
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:12,430
Also notice that by default
each one is a different size.

5
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:16,239
Elements have to defaults styles which
are called User-Agent styles and

6
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:19,580
they often include the default
properties for box models.

7
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:24,209
For example, by default, headers have
a larger font size and font weight.

8
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:28,210
Plus margin on the top and bottom,
but they don't have padding.

9
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:34,390
And figures like the one you see here
have margin added to every side.

10
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:37,700
So how do you change their sizes?

11
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:38,720
Let's do a few demonstrations.

12
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:41,330
I've pulled back everything
from the previous example,

13
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:44,660
and just left the div with
some content inside it.

14
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:47,949
By default, the div is just tall
enough to fit the content and

15
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:50,610
takes up the full width of the page.

16
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:54,120
This time the extra white space
that you see around the div

17
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:59,700
is actually margin from the parent
element, which in this case is the body.

18
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:00,810
So, let's size it.

19
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:02,840
Notice how it changed with new values?

20
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:07,800
The div is now taller because I
set the height to 250 pixels,

21
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:11,220
and thinner because I set
the width to 200 pixels.

22
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:15,120
But what if I get rid of the height and
width and remove the content?

23
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,765
Check it out, it disappears.

24
00:01:16,765 --> 00:01:21,250
Okay, so from this let's draw
some conclusions about divs and

25
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:23,320
block elements in general.

26
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:27,380
First, block elements take up
as much width as possible.

27
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:30,520
Remember, there's always the body,
which can be styled.

28
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:33,300
In this case, the body has a margin.

29
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:36,390
Elements are always going to be
constrained to the space given to them

30
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:37,640
by their parents.

31
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:42,630
So the fact that this div takes up as
much space as it can inside its parent

32
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:45,940
means that the width of block
elements are constraint-based.

33
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:48,530
By default they will be
as wide as possible.

34
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:53,000
Block elements also take up
as little height as possible.

35
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,720
See how the div ends at the top and
bottom of the text?

36
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:00,800
You can say the height of block
elements are content based, so

37
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,590
they are as short as possible.

38
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:07,580
Finally, if there is no content then
the block element has no height.

39
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:11,560
Inline elements follow different rules,
but we'll cover that in just a moment.

40
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,160
First, how about a quiz?
