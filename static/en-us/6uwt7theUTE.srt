1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:04,059
Here's another slightly different
version of the same implementation

2
00:00:04,059 --> 00:00:06,120
that avoids the go to statement.

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:09,370
As long as the lock is busy,
the thread will keep spinning,

4
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:11,740
it will remain in this while loop.

5
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:15,550
At some point, when the log becomes
free, the thread will exit from this

6
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:20,170
while loop, and it will set the lock
value to busy, so as to acquire it.

7
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:23,120
Now answer the same question
as in the previous quiz.

8
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:27,920
Is this implementation of a spinlock
correct in terms of its ability to

9
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:32,000
guarantee mutual exclusion, and also,
is this an efficient implementation?
