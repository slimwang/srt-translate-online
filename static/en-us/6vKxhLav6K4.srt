1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:02,220
When defining your market segment,

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:05,210
you want to make sure you don't
define segments that are too narrow.

3
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:09,140
Ask yourself, is my offering really
different from one segment to another?

4
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:11,270
Could be different by price or
by features.

5
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:14,360
And if you realize that you offer
the same to two different segments,

6
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:16,350
maybe you should define
them as one bigger segment.

7
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:19,860
For startups,
it's crucial to measure not only

8
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:22,990
the quantity of the potential segment,
but its quality.

9
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:25,960
A quality segment will
help engage users quickly.

10
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:28,480
Learn from them and
iterate over your products.

11
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,730
Make sure you choose a segment that is
accessible for you, your university,

12
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:34,030
your group of friends,
or your neighborhood.

13
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:37,000
If relevant, choose a segment
with the shortest sales cycle, so

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,770
you don't wait too long between the time
your customer is exposed to the product

15
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:42,560
until you can show value.

16
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:45,240
You could do that by choosing the
segment that will consume a more simple

17
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:49,110
product, or the segment that will
be willing to pay maybe less but

18
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:50,310
buy your product more quickly.

19
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:54,610
If you have a bit of a product, you
better start with the smaller companies

20
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:57,960
as your customers and
reach out directly to the decision maker

21
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,890
rather than going through a lengthy
process of a big company.

22
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:03,740
In addition, try to find
a segment that is less crowded, so

23
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:05,650
you have no or few competitors.

24
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:09,178
For example, the messaging company
Slack found great opportunity in

25
00:01:09,178 --> 00:01:12,121
the enterprise segment,
with very little competition.

26
00:01:12,121 --> 00:01:15,380
They realized their value was to
focus specifically on tech teams and

27
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:16,225
small companies and

28
00:01:16,225 --> 00:01:19,620
start-ups that work quickly and
needed to communicate quickly.

29
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:22,080
With tech features
integrated in their product.

30
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,486
Had they wanted to focus on consumers
rather than enterprise, they would have

31
00:01:25,486 --> 00:01:28,650
been faced with a great deal of good
competition like Whatsapp and WeChat
