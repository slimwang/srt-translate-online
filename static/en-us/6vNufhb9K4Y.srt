00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:06,170
We import person in car in simulation. We import car nowhere, because it's only

2
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:11,918
used by simulation. And simulation and car are in the same package already. We

3
00:00:11,918 --> 00:00:16,944
import simulation in the CarShareApp. Here's what that looks like in BlueJ. In

4
00:00:16,944 --> 00:00:23,038
the car class, we'll import com.udacity.person. In the simulation class, we'll

5
00:00:23,038 --> 00:00:26,112
also import com udacity person, and in the CarShareApp, we'll import

6
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:31,190
com.udacity.carshare.Simulation. Now when I go back and compile the

7
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:38,162
CarShareApp, it'll work the way it did before. But now the code is organized

8
00:00:38,162 --> 00:00:41,013
into the correct packages.
