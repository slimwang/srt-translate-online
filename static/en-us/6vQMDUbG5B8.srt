1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:02,290
All right, so let's start with case #1.

2
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:05,380
We asked about a group texting
app that opens up a video player.

3
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:07,660
Since the core part of
our app is about texting,

4
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:11,300
we probably won't be focused on
creating a world class video player.

5
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:13,770
It would probably be better
to leave it to another app

6
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:17,260
which has more expertise in the video
playback, such as the YouTube app.

7
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:20,550
We could send an implicit intent with
information on which video to play,

8
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:24,096
because it can be handled by any video
player app of the user's choice.

9
00:00:24,096 --> 00:00:27,940
In case #2, we should use an explicit
intent, because we want to move from

10
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:31,260
the order activity to the order
summary activity within our app.

11
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:35,080
In this case, it's very clear which
activity to which we want to move next

12
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:36,840
in response to a user action.

13
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,820
In our last case, we again have a
general action, sending a text message.

14
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:43,960
We should use an implicit intent
to send the request to another app

15
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,690
that can handle sending a text message.
