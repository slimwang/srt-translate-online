00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The next piece is who are your key partners and suppliers.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Partnerships are kind of interesting is we need to ask ourselves before what's the deal

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
is what exactly are we acquiring from partners, and also

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
what activities are they going to perform and when.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
And this is where a start up sometimes make a mistake of thinking while large companies

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
do partnerships, I guess I need those two on day 1.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Change all the types of partnerships you need in year 1 are certainly not the ones

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
you're going to need in year 3 or 5 or 10, and the types of partnerships could be strategic alliances,

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
joint ventures, just regular suppliers and buyers, and you need to be thinking through

10
00:00:40,000 --> 99:59:59,999
who they are and after your getting out of the building and tested them.
