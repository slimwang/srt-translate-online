00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:03,050
Awesome work configuring
the Java plugin.

2
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:06,740
Answering this question took some
real documentation hunting skills.

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:11,130
We need to hit the attributes method
of the manifest of the JAR task.

4
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:13,620
Let's check out how to find
that in the documentation.

5
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:17,480
We start at the Java plugin chapter of
the Gradle user guide, and a search for

6
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:21,600
JAR brings us this helpful
link to the DSL reference.

7
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,610
Here in the DSL reference of
the JAR task type, if we search for

8
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:29,820
manifest, we find that the JAR
task type has a method

9
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,400
called manifest that accepts
a configuration closure.

10
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:36,100
We also get a link to
the Gradle Java doc.

11
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:40,410
Finally, in the Gradle java
docs on the manifest interface,

12
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:43,240
we see that there's a method called
attributes that allows us to

13
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:46,690
add content to the attributes of
the manifest by passing a map.

14
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:47,210
Awesome!

15
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:48,220
That's what we were looking for.
