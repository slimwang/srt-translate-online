00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
To try to understand the relationship between edges and nodes in a planar graph

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
we're going to use a result due to Euler--same Euler as before.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
To do that we're going to need another concept about planar graphs.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Here's a planar graph on five nodes.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Again, we have a notion of nodes. We have a notion of edges.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
We're also going to now talk about a notion of regions in a planar graph.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Regions are kind of areas that are boxed off in the graph,

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
plus the region outside of the graph.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Turns out that's a really useful thing to be able to talk about.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
This particular graph has three regions.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
We'll right it's got 5 nodes, 6 edges, and 3 regions.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Now, our good friend Euler discovered a fascinating relationship between these values.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
For any planar graph, n - m + or is equal to 2. Really?

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Does that work in this case?

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Let's check this formula with the values for this particular graph.

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,000
We've got n - m, 5 -6 is -1, plus 3 is indeed 2. Interesting.

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
We're going to figure out why that is in just a moment,

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
but let's let you practice first understanding what these regions are.
