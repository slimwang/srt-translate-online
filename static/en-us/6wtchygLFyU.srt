1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:03,000
Okay, so if you're like me you've already glanced

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,360
at the duration of this video and are thinking this

3
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:07,930
is way too long. Don't worry. You don't have to

4
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:10,030
watch the entire thing. What we are going to do

5
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:15,190
in this video is work together to download Python. Now, downloading

6
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:19,820
a computer language can sometimes be a frustrating process. So what I'm going to

7
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:25,510
do is Go slow, and identify all of the steps in detail. By the

8
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:28,230
way, if you already have Python, feel free to skip this

9
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:30,780
video and move on to the next lesson. Also if you

10
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:33,970
prefer to read the instructions on how to download Python. There

11
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:37,660
are a few helpful documents in the Instruction Notes section. Those

12
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:40,700
documents will walk you through the exact same process that we

13
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:43,760
are following in this video. Okay, now I'm going to start

14
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,320
the download process on a Windows machine. If you're on a

15
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,730
Mac, click here to jump ahead in the video. Okay, so here

16
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:53,050
I am on a Windows machine where I will

17
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:57,390
google download Python. The first result looks good to me.

18
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:00,450
You will notice that Python has two main versions.

19
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:03,490
We will use Version 2.7 in this course. By the

20
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:06,100
way, the link to this page is also available

21
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:10,210
in the instructor notes. Now, this page may look slightly

22
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:13,110
different than the one you have open on your computer.

23
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:15,730
That's okay, I want you to find the features that

24
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:18,170
are similar between this page and the one that you

25
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:21,200
may have open on your computer. If you scroll down on

26
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,480
this page, you will notice that there are a bunch

27
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:26,920
of links. Now, the first link here will help us download

28
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,960
Python on Windows. Notice that depending on your internet speed,

29
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,590
this download may take a while. One the file has downloaded

30
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:37,340
I can click to run it. This will launch a

31
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:40,820
wizard which I will go through. I will choose the default

32
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:45,050
python directory under the C drive and then I will continue to hit next a few

33
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:48,910
times. And boom, very quickly the installation will

34
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:52,560
be done. Now to test if Python installed

35
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,220
correctly I can go to the Start Menu,

36
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:58,700
hit All Programs, find Python 2.7, which is

37
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:03,410
what we just installed and launch Idle. Idle

38
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:06,230
is the place where we can write Python programs.

39
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:13,020
So let's write a few programs in Idle like 2 plus 2 That seemed to work. And

40
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:17,850
print yay python. All right, congratulations. You can skip

41
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:19,680
the rest of this video and move on to

42
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:25,320
the next lesson now. Okay, so here I'm on a Mac. Now, the first thing I will do

43
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,860
is figure out the version of my Mac. It

44
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:32,500
seems mine is 10.7, yours may be different. Next

45
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:36,230
I will Google download Python. The first result here

46
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:39,260
seems good to me. You will notice that Python

47
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:41,970
has two main versions. We will use version 2.7

48
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:45,310
in this course. By the way The link to

49
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:48,580
this page is also available in the instructor notes.

50
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:51,970
Now this page may look slightly different than the

51
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:55,370
one you have open on your computer. That's okay,

52
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:57,650
I want you to find features that are similar

53
00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:01,920
between this page and the one you may have open on your computer. Now if you

54
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:06,230
scroll down on this page you will notice a bunch of links. The first few

55
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:11,460
download links are for windows. So we can safely ignore them. The next two links

56
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:17,390
are for mac. The first of those links is for mac 10.6 or later. Now

57
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:22,730
since my mac was 10.7 this is the right link for me. If you have

58
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:24,740
a version of Mac that came before 10.6 you

59
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:27,890
should use the other link. So, I will click

60
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:31,200
to download python. Note, that depending on your internet

61
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,550
speed, this download may take a while. Once Python

62
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:38,170
has downloaded, I will run the downloaded file. I

63
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:41,080
will click on this Python file while holding down

64
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:44,530
the Ctrl key and then click Open. This will

65
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:47,790
start the wizard. Here, I can hit Continue a few

66
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:51,820
times to install Python. And boom, the installation

67
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:54,270
is done. Now, to test if Python was

68
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:57,180
installed correctly, I will go Spotlight and then

69
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:59,720
type idle. Idle is the place where we

70
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:03,030
can write Python programs. Here I will hit

71
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:05,560
enter to get the python prompt and then

72
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,570
write a few really quick programs like 2

73
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:13,050
plus 2 that seemed to work and print yay

74
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:18,100
python alright congratulations you are now ready to move on to the next lesson.
