1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:05,850
We are now at the point to choose the features we want to include in our model,

2
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:08,890
to identify the cars by their driving pattern.

3
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:13,100
Remember we have the choice of selecting different distances.

4
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:15,750
We also cleaned the data.

5
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:21,030
Now we are going to select features using distances sampled over time.

6
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:24,640
As we know from previous examples, this can be broken down

7
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:30,430
again into several iterations investigating what works best.

8
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:34,350
We will go through only a few steps to ensure we

9
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:38,910
are selecting features that can give us reasonable results.

10
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:42,160
Let's now head back to our iPython Notebook again.

11
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,700
And, see how we can identify our features.

12
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:48,240
Take a look at the code in this block.

13
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:53,330
Here, the get_sampling_intervals method takes the intervals of

14
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:56,830
time at which we are collecting the data.

15
00:00:56,830 --> 00:01:01,640
We also divide the seconds by 60 to get our answers in minutes.

16
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:05,840
The method returns an array named sampling intervals.

17
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,420
Let's run this part of the code.

18
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:13,960
This part does not give you any output, since this merely defines the method.

19
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:17,700
In this part of the code, we are simply going to see

20
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:23,460
how many different unique driver ID's there are in our data.

21
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:26,080
Let's run this part of the code again.

22
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,940
You see we get an output of seven.

23
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:35,000
We have seven different unique drivers driving around in a given patterns.

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,870
Our goal is to look at these patterns and

25
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:42,080
see if we can distinguish between each driver.

26
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,750
Before we do so.

27
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:46,260
We want to make sure we have enough data for

28
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:50,840
the sampling intervals that we have in the data.

29
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:54,640
In the next line of code we make an array for

30
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,820
all the sampling intervals for all the people.

31
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:03,060
Next we want to make a scatter-plot of all the sampling intervals.

32
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:08,250
Let's first make the plot and then we will see what the plot is showing us.

33
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:12,280
Again, use the play button to run that piece of code.

34
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,200
If everything goes well.

35
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:17,990
You would get a plot that looks like this.

36
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:23,040
Let's take some time to investigate what this plot is showing us.

37
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:30,010
In the x axis we actually have the index of all the data points in our array.

38
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:37,750
In the y axis we are plotting the inter-sampling time now calculated in minutes.

39
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:43,155
So what this means is there are some data points that have

40
00:02:43,155 --> 00:02:47,410
inter-sampling times that are quite high in time.

41
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,310
In this case 750 minutes.

42
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:54,590
In this case around 800 minutes.

43
00:02:54,590 --> 00:03:01,210
However, notice most of the points have very short intersampling times.

44
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:05,030
In fact if we take about 60 minutes as our

45
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:09,530
intersampling time we will capture most of the data.

46
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:13,850
When building your features it is important to make sure

47
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:19,860
that after selecting the features, you have enough data to do your analysis.

48
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:24,568
So, by looking at the data, we concluded that a 60 minute or

49
00:03:24,568 --> 00:03:29,320
one hour inter-sampling time will leave us with enough data.

50
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,750
This is an important point.

51
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:35,130
Whenever we have a time series data.

52
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:41,260
It is important to know at what intervals we are making these measurements.

53
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:43,840
Now we come to another question.

54
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,970
How many points or features should we select?

55
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:49,630
We have actually 24 choices.

56
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:53,100
If we take one hour inter-sampling times.

57
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:56,780
The 24 choices being location at the first hour of the day.

58
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:58,040
Second hour of the day.

59
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,240
Third hour of the day.

60
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,460
And so on and so forth.

61
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:03,070
Up to the 24th hour of the day.

62
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:05,920
Let's say we select four features.

63
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:11,220
That means we will collect the location of a person at four different

64
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:16,149
hours of the day, and use each of these locations as a feature.

65
00:04:16,149 --> 00:04:18,089
Now, another question rises.

66
00:04:18,089 --> 00:04:21,930
Will we have enough data for the chosen features?
