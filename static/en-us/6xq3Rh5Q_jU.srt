1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,920
So in this code example, I just want to
show you how we can do transformation f,

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:06,720
a specific form that is rotation.

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,700
First two lines, basically, are just
loading in computer vision and numpy,

4
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:14,800
then basically just load in
the image figure out the height and

5
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:17,390
width of the image,
of course show the original image.

6
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:21,090
Here we want to actually showcase
a rotation around the origin at zero and

7
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:24,870
zero, that is the point of
the image right at the top corner.

8
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:28,900
And of course, what we do is we
apply a rotation of 45 degrees.

9
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:32,229
So using that, of course, we have
now computed the rotation matrix.

10
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:35,080
We can print the rotation matrix here.

11
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:36,240
And that's shown here.

12
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:41,430
And of course, then we can apply
the transformation by this function cv

13
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:43,320
2 warpAffine.

14
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,970
Again, rotation matrix.

15
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:46,380
The image itself.

16
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:50,200
And that way we now can show the image
here with this line of code.

17
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:53,950
In this part of the code here, basically
now we apply the same transformation

18
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:57,830
except now that we are applying
at the center of the image.

19
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:02,240
Of course to achieve this we have
to transform the point to the half

20
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:05,610
the width and half the height of the
image, and again we are rotating this in

21
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:09,430
the other direction, minus 45 degrees,
and here one is still the scale.

22
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:10,514
We don't want to change the scale.

23
00:01:10,514 --> 00:01:15,487
[SOUND] So, again, now we print out the
rotation matrix and apply it with new

24
00:01:15,487 --> 00:01:20,336
new images transformation using the same
function above and display the image.

25
00:01:20,336 --> 00:01:22,580
Let's see what this looks
like when we run it.

26
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:26,270
This is the rotation matrix when
we have the image at the origin.

27
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:28,239
That is the point top here,
of the image.

28
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,210
And the next one here is after
we've actually figured out

29
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:33,100
the center of the image.

30
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:37,990
That is we've basically moved to the
width half and half height of the image.

31
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:42,900
And then applied the same transformation
of basically rotating by 45 degrees.

32
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:45,470
Notice again this is minus 45 degrees.

33
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:49,650
This is plus 45 degrees and
therefore the signs are different.

34
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:51,250
This is our original image.

35
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:54,590
This is the image rotated
around the origin point.

36
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:59,580
And again as earlier stated I rotated
this image by 45 degrees, so of course,

37
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:02,260
now it's truncated or
cut at this top here, but

38
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:05,170
you can see that the image has
been rotated by 45 degrees.

39
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:07,780
This is the final one where again

40
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:11,900
this time around I've done the 45 degree
rotation at the center of the image.

41
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,460
That's why we actually
have put in this for

42
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:15,720
different terms in
the transformation matrix.

43
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,740
So actually our rotation
would be at this point.

44
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:18,770
And here you notice, of course,

45
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:22,820
the tech sign now has been
rotated this way 45 degrees and

46
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:27,680
shows a transformation of rotation by
45 degrees at the center of the image.
