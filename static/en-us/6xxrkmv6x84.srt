1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:04,610
Let's now dive into some
characteristics of fonts a bit.

2
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:07,870
Think of this as a crash
course on the anatomy of type,

3
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:11,170
a super fast primer on basic typography.

4
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:15,810
Now, as we mentioned earlier, Roboto
is a standard font included in Android.

5
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:17,980
It is a Sans-serif font.

6
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:21,210
Sans-serif means without serifs.

7
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:24,990
Serifs are the little wings
attached to the strokes of a letter

8
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:27,970
like these here that
hang off the letter r.

9
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:31,270
Serif fonts are common in
printed works like books and

10
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:34,950
are generally considered more
comfortable for long form reading.

11
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:39,040
On the other hand, Sans-serif fonts
are more common on the web and

12
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:43,480
can be well suited to short bursts
of texts like in user interfaces.

13
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:46,690
There's also generally a safer choice
when you're dealing with a range of

14
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:48,320
screen densities.

15
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,350
A Serif font can be a great compliment
with Roboto if used sparingly for

16
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:55,390
things like title headings and
large type.

17
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:59,290
Now, due to issues like anti aliasing
which would make small Serifs appear

18
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:00,300
kind of blurry.

19
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:05,180
It wouldn't be advisable to use a Serif
font for really, really small text.

20
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:08,180
Let's also briefly talk
about font metrics.

21
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:10,690
We're only going to talk about
the English alphabet for now.

22
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:15,230
When trying to describe the anatomy of
text, you can easily go down a long,

23
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:17,820
long, long rabbit hole.

24
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:20,820
Anyway, let's first
start with the baseline.

25
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:23,930
The baseline is essentially
the optical bottom point

26
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:28,800
of all text that doesn't extend below,
like the lowercase y here.

27
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:33,860
Next is the x-height which refers to the
height of the lowercase x in the font.

28
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:37,820
Basically the height of most lowercase
letters, like the letter e here.

29
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:41,810
Fonts with the relatively large
x-height tend to be more legible and

30
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:43,290
better suited for body text.

31
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:47,450
After that is the cap height
which is the height of most

32
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:50,220
uppercase letters like
the capital T here.

33
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:54,310
And next you have ascenders and
their cousin descenders.

34
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:59,550
These are part of the lowercase letters
that extend way above the cap height or

35
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:01,380
below the baseline.

36
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:05,730
So the h has an ascender here and
the y has a descender.

37
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:08,250
And finally, you have the leading.

38
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:11,750
That's the spacing between
vertical lines of text.

39
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:15,860
On Android, you can control the leading
by providing a line spacing multiplier

40
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:18,780
or line spacing extra for a text view.

41
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:22,040
Now, there's a lot more to
font anatomy than just this.

42
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:25,180
Like I said, we just talked
about the English alphabet.

43
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:28,270
Check the instructor's notes for
links where you can learn more about

44
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:31,861
font anatomy and
other cool font typography type stuff.
