>> I think we can say with confidence that this average is misleading. That's

2
00:00:04,775 --> 00:00:09,549
because, if you look at the data, all of these guys are less than 123,098, in

3
00:00:09,549 --> 00:00:14,767
fact, significantly less. The average can be misleading when we have outliers.

4
00:00:14,767 --> 00:00:20,076
Values that are unexpectedly different from the other observed values. Outliers

5
00:00:20,076 --> 00:00:25,021
create skewed distributions by pulling the mean toward the outlier. This makes

6
00:00:25,021 --> 00:00:28,780
the mean a lot less representative of the middle of the data.
