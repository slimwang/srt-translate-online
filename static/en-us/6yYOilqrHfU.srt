1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
[Thrun] The initial probability for rain is 0

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
because we are just encountering 1 initial day and it's sunny.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
The maximum likelihood estimate is therefore 0.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
We transition 8 times out of a sunny state--1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8--

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
twice into a rainy state, and therefore 6 times we remain in a sunny state,

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
so the probability of sun to sun is ¾,

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
whereas sun to rain is ¼.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
From a rainy state we have 2 outbound transitioning,

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
1 to a sunny state and 1 to a rainy state.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The last R over here has no outbound transition,

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
so it doesn't really count in our statistic.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 99:59:59,999
The maximum likelihood therefore is 0.5 or ½ for each of those.
