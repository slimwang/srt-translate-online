1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,550
To evaluate how accessible any app is,

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:05,530
you can step through the
Accessibility Testing Checklist.

3
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:08,580
Some of those steps will involve
changing the accessibility settings

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:09,850
in the setting's app.

5
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:12,360
The user will be able to choose
from these options.

6
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:17,370
We have TalkBack, Captions, Magnification,
increased font size, and more.

7
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:21,540
I want to point out one item
in particular, TalkBack service.

8
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:24,940
Blind and low vision users 
can turn on the TalkBack service.

9
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:27,146
It allows them to navigate
around the device

10
00:00:27,146 --> 00:00:28,792
with spoken feedback
as they interact

11
00:00:28,792 --> 00:00:30,830
with each UI element on the screen.

12
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:32,445
There are slightly different gestures

13
00:00:32,445 --> 00:00:34,752
for example to select,
or to focus on an item.

14
00:00:34,752 --> 00:00:37,650
If it's the first time you turn it on, 
there will be a tutorial

15
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:39,220
that you can step through.

16
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:41,490
When the user navigates 
to these elements

17
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:44,590
TalkBack service will read aloud 
the context description provided.

18
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:48,480
Every UI component that doesn't have
any visible text has a content description.

19
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,313
Using TalkBack or another
accessibility tool from the checklist,

20
00:00:51,313 --> 00:00:52,556
open the Sunshine app,

21
00:00:52,556 --> 00:00:55,880
find and fix at least one 
accessibility issue in the app.

22
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:58,670
Then please share what you did 
in the class discussion forum.
