1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,030
The answer to the first question
is the TMDBAuthViewController.

2
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:07,900
We're going to cover how this class
handles step 2a of the authentication

3
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:10,970
flow in more detail
later in this lesson.

4
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:15,090
Next the only view class that
we have is the bordered button.

5
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:20,030
The next question should have introduced
you to the TMDBConstants.swift file.

6
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:23,240
This file contains stokes and
constants related to the movie database.

7
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:28,320
And the last answer is actually
derived from the TMDConstants file.

8
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,780
If you look at the method stroke,

9
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:32,378
there are a total of nine
methods that this app will use.

10
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,290
Hopefully these questions force
you to look at a few files.

11
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:37,410
But, if you haven't all ready,

12
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:40,370
I would recommend taking a quick look
through the project before moving on.
