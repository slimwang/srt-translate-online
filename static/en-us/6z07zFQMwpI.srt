00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,000
So the objectives of this lesson are for you to learn about Gaussian and

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,040
Laplacian pyramids.

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,640
I'll introduce what those concepts are.

4
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:10,990
Then I'm going to showcase how we can use these pyramid representations to

5
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:13,160
help us encode the frequency domain.

6
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:18,170
We will learn how to compute the Laplacian pyramid from a Gaussian pyramid.

7
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:22,040
And finally, we will learn how to use the Laplacians and

8
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:25,500
the Gaussians to help us blend two images together.

9
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:29,940
That, in essence, actually encode the frequency information in both the images
