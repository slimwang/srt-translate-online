1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
This is a robot that points in the x direction, because θ equals zero.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
We have a coordinate system over here where this is 24.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
That's 18 in the y direction, and it moves forward for a while.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
In fact we have 1 second, and it moves at 5 units per second, so this is 5.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Then it turns its heading into this direction over here, and this is π/8.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Again, the real robot would take a curve,

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
but in our approximation we assume it goes in a straight line

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and then finally does a very discrete turn, which is an approximation,

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
but that's the question I have asked you here.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
When you plug these values in, you'll find that the x extends by 5,

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
which is 29. Y doesn't change.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 99:59:59,999
The final turn is π/8, which is about 0.3927.
