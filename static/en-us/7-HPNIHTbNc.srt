00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,925
>> We cannot write the equation of a vertical line in point slope form. Here,

2
00:00:03,925 --> 00:00:07,573
the slope is going to be an issue again. We still can't plug in a single

3
00:00:07,573 --> 00:00:11,754
numerical value for the slope in this form of the equation, so we can't use it.

4
00:00:11,754 --> 00:00:16,170
But yes, we can write the equation for a vertical line in general form. This is

5
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:20,733
one of the major powerful aspects of the general form of linear equations.

6
00:00:20,733 --> 00:00:24,834
Looking back at general form, or the general form of the general form, all we

7
00:00:24,834 --> 00:00:28,928
would need to do would be to set B equal to 0. That would make this entire term

8
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:32,904
with a y in it equal to 0. And we would just have Ax equal C, which very easily

9
00:00:32,904 --> 00:00:36,969
could be become an equation for a vertical line like many we've seen before.
