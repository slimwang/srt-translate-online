00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,576
Here's the answer. What we need to do is have three parameters in addition to

2
00:00:03,576 --> 00:00:07,772
the self object. So we have the name parameter already. We need owner and chef.

3
00:00:07,773 --> 00:00:14,744
And now we're just going to initialize attributes to those values. And the names

4
00:00:14,744 --> 00:00:21,452
happen to match here. There's no reason they need to. That's just for[INAUDIBLE]

5
00:00:21,452 --> 00:00:25,547
and probably it's actually a better idea to make them not match sometimes I use

6
00:00:25,547 --> 00:00:29,390
the convention of using p in front of the name to indicate that, that's the

7
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:33,996
parameter. So then we would have the p here for those names, distinguishing them

8
00:00:33,996 --> 00:00:39,000
from the attribute names that are part of the object. As long as you pick names

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,240
that are clear, they can be whatever you want.[SOUND] Now when we initialize a

10
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:51,576
restaurant we need to pass in three values,[SOUND] and we can see that all those

11
00:00:51,576 --> 00:00:54,653
attributes are defined in the object.
