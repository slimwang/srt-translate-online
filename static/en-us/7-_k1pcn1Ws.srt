00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:04,596
You again have to modify the x and y values computed. By multiplying the

2
00:00:04,596 --> 00:00:09,018
original point by the radius, this expands or contracts these points around the

3
00:00:09,018 --> 00:00:13,266
origin. After that, you add the location to move the whole polygon elsewhere,

4
00:00:13,266 --> 00:00:17,333
same as before. This gives you a little taste of the unit on transforms, where

5
00:00:17,333 --> 00:00:20,553
we will be talking about these sorts of operations in depth.
