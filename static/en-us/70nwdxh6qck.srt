>> Awesome. We have a solution. Actually, we have two solutions. We have two

2
00:00:03,466 --> 00:00:07,027
different values of x, either of which would make this equation true. At any

3
00:00:07,027 --> 00:00:10,547
given time, we don't use both of them. As always when we're substituting in

4
00:00:10,547 --> 00:00:14,145
values for variables, we're consistent about what we plug in. If we're going

5
00:00:14,145 --> 00:00:17,655
with x equals negative 30, we put that in every spot where x is. Let's just

6
00:00:17,655 --> 00:00:21,014
double-check to make sure that this is what we want to have happen. The

7
00:00:21,014 --> 00:00:25,750
left-hand side of the equation, if we plug in x equals negative 30, will end up

8
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:30,357
being 0 times negative 35. Even though this factor over here is not 0, anything

9
00:00:30,357 --> 00:00:34,426
times 0 is 0. Something very similar happens if we plug in x equals 5, but I'll

10
00:00:34,426 --> 00:00:38,455
leave that up to you. And the question is, considering what x stands for,

11
00:00:38,455 --> 00:00:42,877
remember, it's the length that we're adding to each side of Grant's booth, only

12
00:00:42,877 --> 00:00:47,436
one of these two answers really mean makes sense. Thinking about what x stands

13
00:00:47,436 --> 00:00:52,311
for in our original equation, remember it's the length that Grant wants to add

14
00:00:52,311 --> 00:00:56,811
in feet to each side of his display booth at the expo, only one of these two

15
00:00:56,811 --> 00:01:01,612
answers really makes sense. So, pick one of them, and tell me how much longer

16
00:01:01,612 --> 00:01:03,715
each side of the booth should be.
