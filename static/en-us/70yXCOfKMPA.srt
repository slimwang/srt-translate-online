1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,360
And the answer is that breadth first
search always considers the shortest

2
00:00:03,359 --> 00:00:04,589
path first.

3
00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:07,560
And this case there's
two path of length 1.

4
00:00:07,559 --> 00:00:11,399
The path from Arad to Zerind and
Arad to Timisoara.

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,839
So those would be the two paths
that would be considered.

6
00:00:14,839 --> 00:00:18,019
Now, let supposed that
the tight broken someway and

7
00:00:18,019 --> 00:00:21,660
we choose this path from Arad to Zerind.

8
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:26,920
Now, we want to expand that node and
remove it from the frontier and

9
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:31,740
put it in the explored list and now we
say, what paths are we going to add?

10
00:00:31,739 --> 00:00:36,519
So, check off the ends of the paths,
the cities that we're going to add.
