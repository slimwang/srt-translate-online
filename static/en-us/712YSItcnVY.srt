1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:07,810
When we go through the steps of long division, we end up with x squared minus x

2
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:11,489
plus 1 as our answer. Again, this matches a rule that we learned earlier when

3
00:00:11,489 --> 00:00:13,721
we were factoring. We learned that x cube plus 1 is equal to x plus 1 times x

4
00:00:13,721 --> 00:00:18,229
squared minus x plus 1. And that's exactly what you found here. All we're doing

5
00:00:18,229 --> 00:00:22,440
this time is dividing both sides of this equation by x plus 1. That's pretty

6
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:22,423
cool.
