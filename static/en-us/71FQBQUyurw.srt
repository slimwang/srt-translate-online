1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,969
Now let's look at how an attacker
can defeat the IDS so

2
00:00:03,969 --> 00:00:06,670
that his attack can go undetected.

3
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:10,090
We call that an IDS performs
passive monitoring.

4
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:14,000
That is, a network IDS takes
a copy of the network traffic and

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,670
analyzes it while the traffic
is reaching the end host.

6
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:23,040
Therefore, in order for the IDS to
detect the intrusion that's happening at

7
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:27,760
the end host, he must see
the same traffic as the end host.

8
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,830
However, this is not always the case.

9
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:34,450
An attacker can exploit this
in order to evade the IDS.

10
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:36,010
The reason that the IDS and

11
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:40,850
the end host are seeing different
traffic is because they're using

12
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:44,365
two different operating systems that
process traffic in different ways.

13
00:00:44,365 --> 00:00:50,160
In particular, TCP/IP protocol
specifications have ambiguities

14
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,190
that lead to different implementations
in different operating systems.

15
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:59,820
As a result, if the IDS runs on Unix and
the end host runs on Windows,

16
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:03,820
they may not process certain
packets exactly the same way.

17
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:07,300
For example,
options such as time to live or

18
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:10,070
error conditions associated
with fragments and

19
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:14,030
checksums are handled in different
ways in different operating systems.

20
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:16,060
By exploiting these evidences,

21
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:20,390
the attacker hopes that the IDS would
not see the attack traffic, yet the end

22
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:24,270
host will be affected by the attack
traffic as intended by the attacker.
