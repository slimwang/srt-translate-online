1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,930
And that's it, no extra magic required.

2
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:04,415
Now you might say to yourself,

3
00:00:04,415 --> 00:00:06,990
hard-coded URL templates
right in the app?

4
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:08,490
What are we doing?

5
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:09,380
And you're right.

6
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:11,400
Ideally, we'd have an external server or

7
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,620
service that allows us to dynamically
load the list of icon packs.

8
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:18,420
But the logic behind there
isn't necessarily user visible.

9
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:21,070
We can still make a great
experience with what we've got, and

10
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:24,680
then iterate from there if and
when we find icon packs are a huge hit.
