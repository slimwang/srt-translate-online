1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,752
To find all these potential zeroes, we know that, for each one, we're going to

2
00:00:03,752 --> 00:00:08,444
take a factor of negative 13, and divide it by a factor of 2. Then we need to

3
00:00:08,444 --> 00:00:12,568
the positive and negative versions of each of these ratios. So we could have 1

4
00:00:12,568 --> 00:00:17,401
over 1, which is 1. Or the negative version of that, negative 1. 13 over 1,

5
00:00:17,401 --> 00:00:21,822
which is just 13. And negative 13, as well. In the end, we come up with eight

6
00:00:21,822 --> 00:00:25,849
roots, so the rational of zero theorem tells us this function might have.
