The easiest way to find documentation is to search for it.

2
00:00:07,723 --> 00:00:11,575
Looking through the CSS for Bootstrap, we can find documentation around

3
00:00:11,575 --> 00:00:15,170
containers, the grid system, which you'll be using later.

4
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:17,880
Different media queries that Bootstrap uses to ensure that

5
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,850
your site looks good on whatever size screen it's opened on.

6
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:23,960
And it even gives you different options for types of columns.

7
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:26,600
Let's take a look at these pre-defined classes.

8
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:30,520
I want you to check out the documentation for the predefined classes.

9
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:33,380
When you're done, you should be able to answer the following questions, and

10
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:36,040
apply the correct classes to your HTML.

11
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:40,640
Which classes should you use to wrap the first row of portfolio items?

12
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,380
The first row would be like this,

13
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:45,930
following the blue box around appify and sunflower.

14
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:49,660
And, which class would you use to wrap one featured portfolio item?

15
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:51,610
Like simply just Appify.

16
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:52,980
