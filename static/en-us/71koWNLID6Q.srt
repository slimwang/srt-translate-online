00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:01,320
So far, so good.

2
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:04,589
I'm liking the app better already now
that we've reduced the message length to

3
00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:06,419
140 characters.

4
00:00:06,419 --> 00:00:09,349
If I decide that I want to tweak
that number of characters,

5
00:00:09,349 --> 00:00:11,980
I can easily return to
the Firebase console and

6
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:14,919
try different lengths until
I find one that works.

7
00:00:14,919 --> 00:00:17,940
For now, I'll wait a few days and
check out analytics again to see if

8
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:22,120
my changes will increase the number
of users or my user engagement.

9
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:25,878
If you'd like to learn how to run a true
AB test using remote configuration and

10
00:00:25,878 --> 00:00:29,850
Firebase analytics, I've provided a link
in the resources to get you started.
