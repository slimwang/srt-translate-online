1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:04,670
So what did you put for client ID here? What we want is a client ID of the

2
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:08,590
application that wanted to us the backend API. And

3
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:10,570
the app that wants to use the backend API

4
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:16,110
is dev-desserts and its client ID is 123devdes. So

5
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:18,530
hopefully that's what you put. The main thing I

6
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:22,110
want to get across is that in this course,

7
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:25,370
our client, web UI and our backend API are

8
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:29,260
all in the same application. But they don't have to be. But

9
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:34,230
you do have to always authorize the client to use the backend API.
