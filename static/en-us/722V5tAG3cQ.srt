Here's an example of a study that Dr Laraway did. He looked at the relationship

2
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:10,860
between religiosity and self-esteem, as the two predictor variables, with the

3
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:14,350
number of days in the last month that college students reported drinking

4
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:19,870
alcohol. Just for some definitions, religiosity refers to a person's overall

5
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:24,710
level of religious feelings, practices and attitudes. Self esteem refers to

6
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:29,175
what extent a person feels that he or she if valuable, good or worthy. Higher

7
00:00:29,175 --> 00:00:35,145
scores for these two predictor variables indicate higher levels of these

8
00:00:35,145 --> 00:00:41,399
characteristics. His sample included 203 participants. When doctor Laraway did

9
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:47,830
the regression, he got that the y intercept was 2.763. This tells us the

10
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:52,520
predicted number of days that the participants used alcohol in the last month,

11
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:57,440
when their self esteem and religiosity were both zero. Here are the regression

12
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:02,620
coefficients that he got. Based on these, fill in the blanks. Each of these

13
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:06,920
blanks are numbers multiplied by the variable.
