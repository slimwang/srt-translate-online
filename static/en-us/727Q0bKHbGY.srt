00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:04,680
So, let us do another exercise together. This time I have picked a different

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:09,520
choice, choice 2 here. So now, we can build a representation for

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:13,840
A is to B like earlier, and here is a representation of C is to 2.

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:18,200
I would like you to fill out these boxes for the labels on the links here.

5
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:21,410
And then answer whether or not two is the right answer for this problem.
