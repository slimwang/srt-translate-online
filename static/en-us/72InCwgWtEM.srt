00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,875
Egocentric thinking is the inability to look at the world through somebody

2
00:00:03,875 --> 00:00:07,814
else's perspective. Piaget came up with a very clever test to measure this,

3
00:00:07,814 --> 00:00:12,316
called the Three Mountain Test. Here, he would have a child sit and look at

4
00:00:12,316 --> 00:00:15,610
these three mountains and tell him from direction of left to right what he

5
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:20,796
says. So, from your perspective the child would see a blue top mountain, a

6
00:00:20,796 --> 00:00:25,680
plane mountain and a red top mountain. Next, you would ask a child what

7
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,664
somebody in my position would see. Inevitably the child would say, I would see

8
00:00:30,664 --> 00:00:33,958
the same thing, meaning a blue top mountain, a plain mountain and a red top

9
00:00:33,958 --> 00:00:39,310
mountain. However, as you can see my perspective, I actually would see a red

10
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:45,292
top mountain, a plain mountain and a blue top mountain. Again, egocentric

11
00:00:45,292 --> 00:00:48,568
thinking is an inability of the child to take himself out of his own skin, and

12
00:00:48,568 --> 00:00:52,270
look at the world from somebody else's perspective.
