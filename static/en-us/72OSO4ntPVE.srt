1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,450
By putting together all of these pieces,
you should be able to create

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:06,530
a presentation about your prototype for
any audience.

3
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:08,020
It's important to remember
though that you'll be

4
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:11,500
making a lot of these presentations if
you want to become an entrepreneur.

5
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:15,780
Persistence will be key moving forward,
both in improving your prototype and

6
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:17,880
in improving your presentation.

7
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:21,130
The important thing to remember is that
nobody gets everything they need to run

8
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:23,200
a business off of their first demo.

9
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:26,380
And that every time you make a prototype
that gets poor feedback from users or

10
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:28,610
a presentation that
doesn't wow your audience,

11
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:31,460
you're learning more about the task,
and more about how to move forward.
