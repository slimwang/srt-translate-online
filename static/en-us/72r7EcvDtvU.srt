1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:02,850
Okay, so let's drill down into the name compartment.

2
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:07,460
Obviously, the most important piece is the name, and that should be a noun.

3
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:12,620
After all, it describes a class of instances. For example,

4
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:18,090
you saw that Window was in italics. That's one way in which you can express

5
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:23,460
in UML that this particular class is an abstract class. Abstract classes,

6
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:27,480
if you're familiar with object oriented programming, are contracts which

7
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:33,370
describe the properties of sub-classes, and can never have instances themselves.

8
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:38,790
Besides using italics, you can also specify that a class is abstract using a tag

9
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:42,990
with the word abstract in it. Why might you want to use an abstract class?

10
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:49,110
Well, for one if you have some related sub-classes that have common features,

11
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:51,980
you can factor those features up into the abstract class.

12
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:59,500
Inside the name compartment, you can also have some other affordances.

13
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:04,790
You can for example have a stereotype. Stereotypes are a way

14
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:10,350
in UML of extending the base UML modeling language. You can also express some

15
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:14,940
optional properties inside of curly braces. For example abstract is one of

16
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:19,250
those key words you can use to give properties to the particular class.
