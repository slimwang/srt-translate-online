00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,780
Let's try using our knowledge of completing the square to solve this quadratic

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:07,915
equation. Now, we want the left-hand side of the equation to contain a square

3
00:00:07,915 --> 00:00:12,382
so that we can take the square root of both sides. In other words, our goal is

4
00:00:12,382 --> 00:00:16,024
to make the left side look like a perfect square. And the right side to be some

5
00:00:16,024 --> 00:00:18,982
sort of number. Then, we could use our square root method that we learned

6
00:00:18,982 --> 00:00:22,998
before to continue solving. First, let's move this positive seven to the other

7
00:00:22,998 --> 00:00:26,772
side of the equation. We do this so we can start working towards getting a

8
00:00:26,772 --> 00:00:32,148
perfect square trinomial on the left. And a number on the right. Now that we're

9
00:00:32,148 --> 00:00:36,262
here, we want to add some amount to both sides of our equation. Remember, we

10
00:00:36,262 --> 00:00:39,664
can only perform the same operation to the left hand side of the equation and

11
00:00:39,664 --> 00:00:42,850
the right hand side of the equation, in order for our equation to remain

12
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:48,645
balanced. So, what amount will we have to add here to complete the square? And

13
00:00:48,645 --> 00:00:51,945
since we add this amount here, remember, we'll add the same amount on the

14
00:00:51,945 --> 00:00:53,130
right.
