1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,910
Sometimes it might not be clear to what exactly does this

2
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:06,390
particular verb correspond to. So consider,

3
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:10,360
Susan comforted Jing. Well, what exactly did Susan do to comfort Jing?

4
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:15,158
It's not at all clear. Not clear what the primitive action should be.

5
00:00:15,158 --> 00:00:19,230
Although if you may not understand what exactly is the primitive action here.

6
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:22,990
We want agents nevertheless to do common sense reasoning.

7
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:27,380
Their interpretation might be incomplete, this interpretation might be partial.

8
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:31,850
Nevertheless, you and I, as humans understand something about Susan and

9
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:37,560
Jing here, that Susan for example, did something that made Jing happier.

10
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:41,546
We want the agent to do the same kind of reasoning, without knowing what exactly

11
00:00:41,546 --> 00:00:46,380
is the comforting action here. So we may have a generic primitive action of do.

12
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:50,440
This generic primitive action will use it, whenever we are unable to decide,

13
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:54,010
whenever the agent is unable to decide, what exactly is the primitive action

14
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:57,430
that should be pulled out. So the agent will simply say, well, Susan did

15
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:02,760
something that made Jing's mood happy and this is as much interpretation that

16
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,940
the agent might be able to the sentence, which is a pretty good interpretation.
