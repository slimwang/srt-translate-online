Before you get started becoming
a machine learning engineer, I'd like to

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,670
briefly handed over to Merriam, our
director of student services, to provide

3
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:09,950
some critical information about how
your nano-degree program will work.

4
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:11,210
This should only take
a couple minutes and

5
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:12,820
they will get started with
the real machine learning.
