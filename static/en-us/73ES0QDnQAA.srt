00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Our newfound mastery of environments puts us in a perfect place

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
to write interpreter code for declaring and calling functions.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
However, there's a lot more to functions than just environments.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
For example, someone could be a little mean and give us a procedure like this

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
to try to interpret.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Mean of x immediately returns x, but then after that it has written print

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
"one thousand and one nights".

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
We should never actually print out "one thousand and one nights"

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
from this function definition.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
We should return first.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
That's a shame because One Thousand and One Nights is perhaps the best-known example

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
of Arabic literature, a collection of Middle Eastern and South Asian stories.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
One of my particular favorite parts are the stories involving Sindbad the Sailor.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Unfortunately, his luck fluctuates wildly.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
More on Sindbad perhaps later on.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
The meaning of this is we need a way to return without doing any more work.

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Let's get a better feel for this with a bit of a puzzle.

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Here I've written a bit of Python code, and I have 4 assignment statements involving x.

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
What I'd like you to do is imagine that these assignment statements are not there.

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
But you get to add one of them in, and your goal is to try to add in a statement

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
that will prevent us from printing out "sindbad".

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
So again, assume these statements aren't there,

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
but which ones could you move in to prevent "sindbad" from being printed?

24
00:01:25,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Multiple multiple choice. Check all that apply.
