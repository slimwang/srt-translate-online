00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:05,986
The y intercepts would be 0 comma 3 and 0 comma negative 3. Great work if you

2
00:00:05,986 --> 00:00:11,806
got those two correct. We know for y intercepts we need to let x equal 0. So we

3
00:00:11,806 --> 00:00:17,395
set the value for x equal to 0, and then we solve for y. 0 squared is simply 0,

4
00:00:17,395 --> 00:00:23,655
so this fraction with the 0 in the numerator simplifies to 0. Then we'll just

5
00:00:23,655 --> 00:00:28,926
have the rest of our equation. Y squared divided 9 equals 1. We'll multiply

6
00:00:28,926 --> 00:00:33,714
both sides of the equation by 9 to get y squared equals 9. And then we'll take

7
00:00:33,714 --> 00:00:37,554
the square root of both sides using plus or minus to get 1 y is equal to plus

8
00:00:37,554 --> 00:00:42,914
or minus 3. Notice that we had a y squared term. This led us to have two

9
00:00:42,914 --> 00:00:50,053
solutions for y. We'll have positive 3 and negative 3. We use positive 3 for

10
00:00:50,053 --> 00:00:54,731
one of the y-coordinates, and negative 3 for the other y-coordinate. The

11
00:00:54,731 --> 00:00:57,218
x-coordinates are both 0.
