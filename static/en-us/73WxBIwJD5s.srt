1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:04,130
So we took our original equation and we completed the square. We added 32 to

2
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:07,970
complete the square, which mean we needed to subtract 32 from the same side of

3
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:11,690
the equation, so that way our equation remained unchanged, or it remained

4
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:17,540
balanced. Now remember our goal is to take this equation and to write it in

5
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:23,018
vertex form. Something that we can identify. So, what I want you to do, is to

6
00:00:23,018 --> 00:00:28,575
take this equation, and write it in vertex form here. I've already put y

7
00:00:28,575 --> 00:00:33,237
equals, so I want you to fill in the rest. Once you've written the equation, in

8
00:00:33,237 --> 00:00:36,150
vertex form, type in the vertex here.
