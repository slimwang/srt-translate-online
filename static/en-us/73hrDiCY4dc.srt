1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,560
Not every trait fits neatly into one category

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:06,670
or another. For example, height is something that

3
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:10,800
we can pretty easily identify as being physical,

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,580
but something like intelligence is something that's a

5
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:16,800
little more harder to categorize. Intelligence might be

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,990
something that you describe as behavioral and not

7
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:22,560
physical, unless you define it by the number

8
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,640
or pattern of neuroconnections in the brain In

9
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:28,630
which case that might seem more physical. It could also

10
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:31,650
be visible or hidden, depending on whether you look at

11
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:35,380
the product of intelligence or the abstract nature of it.

12
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:39,070
It is also still debated how much intelligence may be learned,

13
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:41,720
or how much of it may be innate. Can you

14
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:44,600
think of another trait that is hard to define in these

15
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,090
categories? Try to use a one word answer and remember,

16
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:50,680
there's no right or wrong response here. Just want to get

17
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:53,230
you to think about which traits could be hard to catagorize.
