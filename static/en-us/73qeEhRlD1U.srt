1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,652
The great thing about modules is, not only do they allow us to organize our own

2
00:00:03,652 --> 00:00:07,104
code better, then allows us to share code with other people. And sharing is a

3
00:00:07,104 --> 00:00:10,496
great thing, it allows us to write much more interesting programs, much more

4
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:14,176
quickly than if we had to write everything ourselves. One very useful module

5
00:00:14,176 --> 00:00:18,336
that we could have used for the search engine, if we were using modules instead

6
00:00:18,336 --> 00:00:22,560
of learning by writing all the code ourselves, is this great Python library for

7
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:27,014
processing web pages, known as Beautiful Soup. And you can see the Beautiful

8
00:00:27,014 --> 00:00:30,525
Soup page here. There's a link to it in the instructor comments as well. And to

9
00:00:30,525 --> 00:00:34,852
use it, first you need to download it. As long as you've got that Python Package

10
00:00:34,852 --> 00:00:38,297
Manager already set up, which most of you probably do, if you've installed the

11
00:00:38,297 --> 00:00:42,984
standard version of Python. You can do it just using this command. Unlike other

12
00:00:42,984 --> 00:00:45,844
modules that we've imported so far, Beautiful Soup is not part of the standard

13
00:00:45,844 --> 00:00:49,596
Python library. So to use it, you have to install it first. If you have pip

14
00:00:49,596 --> 00:00:54,250
installed this is really easy. Pip is a Python Package installer. All we would

15
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:57,536
need to do is this, it would know how to download it and install it, and set it

16
00:00:57,536 --> 00:01:01,492
up to work on your machine. If you don't have pip installed already, there are

17
00:01:01,492 --> 00:01:05,676
directions for how to set up pip, in the instructor comments. It's very useful

18
00:01:05,676 --> 00:01:09,126
to set this up, makes it much easier to install packages after that. Now that

19
00:01:09,126 --> 00:01:12,943
we've installed Beautiful Soup, we can import it into our search engine code.

20
00:01:12,943 --> 00:01:16,719
And instead of all the code that we wrote for extracting links, we can use what

21
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:18,443
Beautiful Soup already provides.
