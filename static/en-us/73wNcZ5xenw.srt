00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Let's talk about percentile. Percentile is kind of the same thing.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,000
The kth percentile is so to speak k% through the data.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
There's many ways to split.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
The one I'd adopt is, let's say, for the 10th percentile--this is 10% and this is 90%.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
The kth we applied on one side could be applied on both sides.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:31,000
For our age example, we removed the upper 20 percentile, we removed or exit data items here.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Check the ones that we removed.
