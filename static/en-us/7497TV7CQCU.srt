00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,405
Remember that variables are so great and useful because they can take on

2
00:00:04,417 --> 00:00:09,701
different values. We could substitute in a whole bunch of things for n right

3
00:00:09,713 --> 00:00:14,521
here, but only one of those numbers would make this entire side of the equation,

4
00:00:14,626 --> 00:00:19,015
n plus 1 equal to 2. If we pick n equals 7, for example, we'll end up with 7

5
00:00:19,027 --> 00:00:24,219
plus 1 equals 2. Or, if we simplify, 8 equals 2. But that definetely can't be

6
00:00:24,231 --> 00:00:28,647
right. Either way, the answer to this question is, the value of n.
