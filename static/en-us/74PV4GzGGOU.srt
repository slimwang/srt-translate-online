00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:06,240
In this blank space, cell A26, we'll type equals sum

2
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:13,250
A2 colon A24. And we get that the total snowfall

3
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:17,950
was 122 inches in season one. For season two, we want the

4
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:22,840
sum from cell B2 all the way to cell B27. If

5
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:27,930
we type in this command and press Enter, we

6
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:33,330
get 173. Finally, in cell C28, I'll find the total

7
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:36,670
precipitation from season three. Which is from C2

8
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:42,480
to cell C26, and we get 129. So

9
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,200
it looks like it snowed the most in

10
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:47,760
season two. Great job. If this was tricky, don't

11
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,100
worry. You'll get better and better with using

12
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,520
Google Spreadsheets during this class, and by the

13
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,780
end, you'll be a pro. If you still

14
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:58,570
have questions, post in the forums. Your amazing peers

15
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:01,360
are always really quick to answer. But if this

16
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:04,250
was confusing, play around with Google Spreadsheets a little bit

17
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:07,570
more. It's important that you're comfortable with learning them,

18
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:10,080
because then you'll have a better experience throughout this course.
