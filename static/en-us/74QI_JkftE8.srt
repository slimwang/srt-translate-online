1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,950
The program in the previous
exercise produced this output.

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,580
But now you're on your own,
there's no boilerplate code.

3
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:09,839
Using what you learn in
the previous exercise,

4
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:13,519
try to generate the following output,
Hello, world.

5
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:16,839
As you write your program,
press test run to see its output.

6
00:00:16,839 --> 00:00:19,759
Once you think you're
getting the correct output,

7
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,260
press the submit answer
button to see feedback.
