1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,900
To make the notation actually come
out relatively cleanly [LAUGH],

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:07,310
to minimize the number of subscripts
that I am going to mess up, we're

3
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:12,020
going to introduce a notation called
operator notation, functional notation.

4
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:15,520
And we're going to introduce
a particular, a Bellman operator.

5
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:19,780
So Bellman operator is
going to be a mapping,

6
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:22,790
a transformation,
from value functions to value functions.

7
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:26,860
You give me a Q function, the Bellman
operator will give you back, possibly,

8
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,030
a different Q function.

9
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:28,620
>> Okay.
>> So

10
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:31,070
it's a function from Q
functions to Q functions.

11
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:34,850
>> Does this operator have to have any
particularly interesting properties?

12
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:36,434
>> We're going to prove that
it has some properties, but

13
00:00:36,434 --> 00:00:37,412
first let's define what it is.

14
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:38,039
>> Okay.

15
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:38,735
>> Boom!

16
00:00:38,735 --> 00:00:39,570
>> Oh, okay.

17
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:41,634
>> So here's how we're going to
define this Bellman operator B.

18
00:00:41,634 --> 00:00:45,828
We're going to give it a Q function,
and the new thing that we get out,

19
00:00:45,828 --> 00:00:50,405
this B applied to Q, has the property
that at state action pair (S,a).

20
00:00:50,405 --> 00:00:54,683
It's equal to the immediate reward
plus the discounted expected value of

21
00:00:54,683 --> 00:00:59,030
the next state, where we look up the
value of the next state using whichever

22
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:02,500
Q function we were given
as input to the operator.

23
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:05,430
So, Q goes in, BQ comes out.

24
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:08,030
BQ is a new value function,
a new Q function.

25
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:09,540
Do you think you get that?

26
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:10,410
>> I think I do.

27
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:12,889
I guess, I don't know why
we're going through this yet.

28
00:01:12,889 --> 00:01:15,151
>> Oh, I'm going to tell
you that quite yet, but

29
00:01:15,151 --> 00:01:17,918
I just want to make sure that
you get it by quizzing you.

30
00:01:17,918 --> 00:01:18,418
>> No!
