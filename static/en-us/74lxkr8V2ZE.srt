As we've talked about many times before, domain just means allowable inputs.

2
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:07,874
It's a set of values that you can plug in for the independent variable into

3
00:00:07,874 --> 00:00:12,292
your function. For example, with these functions we've been dealing with

4
00:00:12,292 --> 00:00:17,166
recently, the domain of f of x is all the real numbers. We can plug in any real

5
00:00:17,166 --> 00:00:22,262
number for x. And get a real number out from the function. Now, can you tell me

6
00:00:22,262 --> 00:00:25,796
what the domain of g of x, where g of x equals the square root of 4 minus x

7
00:00:25,796 --> 00:00:30,466
squared is? Please write this in interval notation.
