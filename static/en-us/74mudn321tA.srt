1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,115
This one is true, the mode can be used to describe any type of data, numerical

2
00:00:05,115 --> 00:00:10,524
or categorical. You saw in the last quiz that male versus female is categorical

3
00:00:10,524 --> 00:00:15,465
and the mode was male, however, all scores in the data set don't affect the

4
00:00:15,465 --> 00:00:20,942
mode, necessarily. Take this data set. The mode is 22 because it occurs 3 times

5
00:00:20,942 --> 00:00:26,401
and the rest of them occur once. However, if we take away the value 14, the mode

6
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:31,647
will still be 22. Now, let's say we add an extreme value like 1 million, the

7
00:00:31,647 --> 00:00:36,705
mode will still be 22. So, we cannot say that all scores in the data set will

8
00:00:36,705 --> 00:00:41,484
impact the mode, this one is also false, if we take a bunch of samples from a

9
00:00:41,484 --> 00:00:46,830
population the mode is likely to change from sample to sample, lets illustrate

10
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:52,630
this idea with this applet, its really cool. Tthis is a histogram distribution,

11
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:58,210
this is called the bell shape curve and lets pick a random 5 sample that this

12
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:04,497
software will generate for us So just look at these top two. You see that the

13
00:01:04,497 --> 00:01:12,996
mode is here, which is kind of at the left of this distribution. Let's do it

14
00:01:12,996 --> 00:01:21,840
again. Now the mode's here at the right of the distribution. If we do it again,

15
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:30,472
the modes again, at the kind of far left of the distribution. Now here, there's

16
00:01:30,472 --> 00:01:35,814
not even a mode. So you can see that if we take samples, the mode is somewhat

17
00:01:35,814 --> 00:01:40,754
arbitrary and it won't necessarily be similar to other modes and it also won't

18
00:01:40,754 --> 00:01:45,897
necessarily represent the population. Another thing about the mode is that it

19
00:01:45,897 --> 00:01:51,666
changes as you change the bin size. So, if we make the bin size smaller, looks

20
00:01:51,666 --> 00:01:58,708
like the mode is going to the left. Here it's at about 470. Here it looks like

21
00:01:58,708 --> 00:02:06,049
it starts at about 450. And the mode changes as we change the bin size. If we

22
00:02:06,049 --> 00:02:13,969
make the bin size really big, then the mode occurs in this interval, between 346

23
00:02:13,969 --> 00:02:18,961
and 514 point 74. So the mode really depends on how you present the data.

24
00:02:18,961 --> 00:02:23,319
Because this third point is false, we can't really use the mode to learn about

25
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:28,076
our population. And this is our goal in this course, inferential statistics. But

26
00:02:28,076 --> 00:02:32,509
still, the mode is important to take into account when describing a data set.

27
00:02:32,509 --> 00:02:37,442
And finally, this last one is false. While there's a procedure to find the mode,

28
00:02:37,442 --> 00:02:42,242
where you look at all the data values, you see which one occurs the most, or you

29
00:02:42,242 --> 00:02:47,117
look at the histogram and you see which bin has the highest frequency, we can't

30
00:02:47,117 --> 00:02:51,767
describe the mode with an equation, and this is why we often use the mean, or

31
00:02:51,767 --> 00:02:52,777
the average.
