1
00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:01,077
Hi Michael.

2
00:00:01,077 --> 00:00:02,078
>> Hi Charles, how are you?

3
00:00:02,078 --> 00:00:04,310
>> I'm doing fine, thanks for
asking, how are you doing?

4
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:07,980
>> I'm doing well, I'm exciting to be
kind of pulling the course together and

5
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:12,200
wrapping it up and putting it in a box
and sending it out into the world.

6
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,720
>> Yes, me too,
it's actually been fun so far.

7
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:17,600
As we tape this we
are about halfway through,

8
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,087
I would say,
of the first iteration of the course.

9
00:00:21,087 --> 00:00:26,730
And Michael kindly agreed to come
down Atlanta to talk to me again.

10
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:31,047
So that we could mention a few other
things that we didn't get a chance to

11
00:00:31,047 --> 00:00:35,180
cover in the class, because we
basically just didn't have time.

12
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:38,090
It's not that they weren't interesting,
but because this was a survey kind of

13
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:40,990
course, we wanted to make
certain that you had the basics.

14
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:43,120
And that from there you could go off and
learn things and

15
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,040
really understand why
they're interesting.

16
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:48,500
So, what we're going to do is just very
quickly, talk about some of the things

17
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:53,450
that are either new and interesting now,
or perhaps old that we just didn't have

18
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:57,452
time to cover, although,
may still show up on the final exam.

19
00:00:57,452 --> 00:00:58,075
>> [LAUGH] And plus,

20
00:00:58,075 --> 00:01:00,300
I believe that everyone now has
a really good background for

21
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:01,826
being able to appreciate those things.

22
00:01:01,826 --> 00:01:03,659
>> Right, I believe that's important.

23
00:01:03,659 --> 00:01:06,780
The main goal of the course was to
give people enough of a breadth, and

24
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:07,910
just enough depth.

25
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:11,296
So that they can go out into the world
and understand why something like

26
00:01:11,296 --> 00:01:14,040
deep neural networks are interesting or
different, or

27
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,440
the same, as the way we've been thinking
about these problems for years.

28
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,102
So maybe that's a good
one to start with.

29
00:01:19,102 --> 00:01:22,020
So, maybe we can just talk about
some of the things we didn't cover.

30
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:26,320
So, there are two big things
that are popular right now.

31
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,720
Or that a lot of people
would have heard of.

32
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,020
>> Buzz words.

33
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:30,345
>> Buzz words but in a good way.

34
00:01:30,345 --> 00:01:33,620
>> [LAUGH]
>> As opposed to just made up stuff.

35
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:34,435
Deep neural networks.

36
00:01:34,435 --> 00:01:35,480
>> Okay. Sure. >> Or deep learning,

37
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,580
which I think is how most
people talk about it.

38
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:38,205
>> Deep learning.

39
00:01:38,205 --> 00:01:38,990
Sure.

40
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:39,928
>> And big data.

41
00:01:39,928 --> 00:01:43,280
So, those are two kind of
things that are out there

42
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,860
in 2014 that people talk about.

43
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:46,870
We didn't really get
a chance to mention,

44
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:48,090
how would you describe
them in 15 seconds?

45
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,300
>> So, big data is the issues that
come up when you actually have

46
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:54,220
a tremendous amount of data.

47
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:58,480
So more and more now it's possible
to attach sensors to the world and

48
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:02,190
get tremendous amount of information,
either web pages or biological data.

49
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:04,570
I've got a little thing that
measures my steps every day.

50
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:07,570
You start to pull this data off over
enough people, there's a tremendous

51
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:11,160
resource, but also challenges in
extracting good information from it.

52
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,100
>> Right.
And a lot of those challenges

53
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:12,630
are algorithmic.

54
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:16,285
We talk about things like
the curse of dimensionality and

55
00:02:16,285 --> 00:02:18,040
now we deal with exponentially.

56
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:22,540
Well, when you have big enough data,
the truth is even linear can be slow.

57
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:23,810
Quadratic is unacceptable.

58
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:24,950
>> Linear in the amount of data.

59
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:25,910
>> Yeah, linear in the amount of data,

60
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:28,010
because you've got so
much data coming in.

61
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:29,960
And, by the way, you're never
going to be able to look at it again.

62
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,760
Because, by the time you look at
the first set of data, another day has

63
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:36,640
passed, and you've got another several
petabytes of data that are coming in.

64
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,810
What's really nice about big data,
which is worth mentioning,

65
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:40,480
I think,
without going into too much detail.

66
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,730
>> Yeah, it's only been 15 seconds.

67
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:42,764
So that's it.
>> Only been 15 seconds?

68
00:02:42,764 --> 00:02:43,850
>> Yeah.
>> We got another 3 or 4,

69
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:47,740
is that [LAUGH] the data,
because we have access to all this data,

70
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:50,470
it's fundamentally changed
the way science works.

71
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:53,500
So it used to be people talked
about experiments and theory and

72
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,103
I'm sure there was something else,
about how science was done.

73
00:02:56,103 --> 00:02:57,706
>> [LAUGH] Something else.

74
00:02:57,706 --> 00:02:59,305
Like scientific method.

75
00:02:59,305 --> 00:03:01,570
>> But
now one of the new pillars of science,

76
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:04,270
which is finally agreed upon by
the scientific community is Computation.

77
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:07,790
The ability to do simulation
the ability to look at the data in

78
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:12,310
order to validate models in a way
we couldn't do even 15 years ago.

79
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:15,080
And that's really amazing,
it's one of the reasons why my guess is

80
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,760
most of the people who are looking at
this first heard about machine learning.

81
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,280
It's one of the reasons why it's so

82
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:24,280
popular because it's applicable to these
big science problems that we care about.

83
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,550
Okay, what about deep learning?

84
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:27,690
>> Yeah, so Deep Learning or
Deep Neural Nets.

85
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:31,590
I think in some ways it's a reboot.

86
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:32,840
Is that a word that we use now?

87
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,390
>> Reboot is a world.

88
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:34,650
>> A prequel.

89
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:35,390
No, it's a reboot.

90
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:36,405
I'm going to go with reboot.

91
00:03:36,405 --> 00:03:37,000
>> Okay.
Let's go with reboot.

92
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,240
>> Of neural nets, so back in the 80s,
there was this idea that you could

93
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,940
train up neural nets with
things like back prop.

94
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:44,920
But it was not so
clear that you could do better with

95
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,900
multiple layers than you could
with just a single layer.

96
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:50,645
Even though we know that brains are
organized into lots and lots of layers.

97
00:03:50,645 --> 00:03:51,900
>> Right.

98
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:57,240
>> So it kind of fell out of favor for
while, but it's back.

99
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:02,270
And I think part of it is there's a new
set of techniques that can be used to

100
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:04,830
organize the computation in a way
that you can actually get valuable

101
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:05,330
information.

102
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:08,058
Signal, coming through at each of the
different layers of the Deep Neural Net.

103
00:04:08,058 --> 00:04:09,190
>> Right.
Does it hold onto a clever

104
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:12,270
representational trick or
is there more to it than that?

105
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:13,830
>> I think there's a bunch
of different tricks.

106
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:15,440
And one of the reasons we
didn't talk about them,

107
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,630
is we don't really know them.

108
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:18,779
>> Yeah, and it would take too long.

109
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:19,279
And.
>> Yes, sorry.

110
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,200
It would take too long for

111
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:20,938
us to learn them.

112
00:04:20,938 --> 00:04:21,470
>> Right.
>> Teach them.

113
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:21,990
>> Yeah to teach them.

114
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:25,727
It certainly would take too long,
because we understand them completely.

115
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:27,540
Okay.
>> We have deep neural nets.

116
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:29,280
>> We do.
Well, maybe we think we do.

117
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,915
I guess we got things to do.

118
00:04:30,915 --> 00:04:32,042
Is that what we actually think we do?

119
00:04:32,042 --> 00:04:33,200
Isn't there a biological plausibility.

120
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,500
I can't remember.

121
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,510
>> Sure.
>> Yeah, let's go with that.

122
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:37,440
Okay, so let's see.

123
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,880
What else haven't we covered that would
be, how about semi-supervised learning?

124
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,540
This is something that I really wish
we could have gotten into the class and

125
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:46,970
maybe in a later iteration of
this we'll find a way to work.

126
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:49,500
>> We can put it half way between
supervised and unsupervised.

127
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,150
>> Or we could stick it
in unsupervised learning,

128
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:52,890
like we did randomized optimization.

129
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:54,750
>> Yeah,
it kind of fleshes it out a little bit.

130
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:57,230
But anyway, the idea of semi-supervised
learning is really cool.

131
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:58,974
Like it's a slightly different problem.

132
00:04:58,974 --> 00:05:01,410
It has elements of both supervised and
unsupervised.

133
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:02,310
>> Like what?

134
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:06,360
>> So, imagine for
example, that you've got

135
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:10,930
tons of web pages that have on
them information about cities.

136
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:12,870
>> Okay.
>> And

137
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:16,610
you label them, you say this webpage
has information about this city.

138
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:18,830
And this webpage has
information about this city.

139
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:22,430
And you eventually you get tired
of doing that because labeling is

140
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:23,105
human expensive.

141
00:05:23,105 --> 00:05:25,800
>> Yes.
>> So if you've got a billion web pages

142
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:29,490
and you've only have time
to label a million of them,

143
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:32,560
then there's still
a factor of a thousand.

144
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,050
>> Sure let's go with that.

145
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:36,781
>> Yeah, of pages that you
have information on them but

146
00:05:36,781 --> 00:05:38,540
there's no labels.

147
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:41,710
And so I think in the early days people
thought since we don't have labels,

148
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:43,630
there's no really valuable
information there.

149
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:47,030
The idea of semi supervised learning
is that you can actually extract using

150
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:50,280
unsupervised methods,
enough structure from the unlabeled data

151
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,870
that when combined with
the labelled data, its like

152
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:56,180
having the power of a lot more label
data than you actually started with.

153
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:58,340
>> Yeah, that was a big deal in
the late 80s, early 90s in particular.
