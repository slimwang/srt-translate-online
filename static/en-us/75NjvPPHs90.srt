1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:01,850
In thinking about this example,

2
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:05,400
it's pretty clear that we made some poor
choices for picking the augmenting path.

3
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:08,760
But how can we be sure
to pick better ones?

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:11,880
One idea is to prefer heavier paths,

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,920
push flow along paths that
have larger bottlenecks.

6
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,215
Another idea is to prefer shorter paths,

7
00:00:18,215 --> 00:00:23,520
note that we were choosing longer
paths here to create this bad case.

8
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:27,240
We'll explore both of these ideas and
some refinements to the Ford-Fulkerson

9
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,570
algorithm that will give
us better running times.
