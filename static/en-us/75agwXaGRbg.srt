1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:03,300
Clearly there's a lot going on here.

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:05,850
But for the sake of simplicity what I want to do

3
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:09,880
is I want to categorize these ideas into a few buckets.

4
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:12,930
For instance, ideas like how to add buttons and

5
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:16,600
how to add text, they're all a very visible part of the app.

6
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,570
Let's call this category, View.

7
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:23,100
When we are going to build that app, we will also need to save some data.

8
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:28,520
This, for us, will be audio file that we can play back.

9
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:32,920
Let's put that in another category and call that category Data or Model.

10
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:38,960
And finally, we will write some code to control the View and the Model.

11
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,510
Here we will need the change the speed of the recorded audio.

12
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:46,530
And we will also need to learn how to transition between different screens.

13
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:48,580
We can call this category controller.

14
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:53,060
Now a good analogy here would be from the word of theater.

15
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:57,390
You can think of a View as actors.

16
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:59,140
Actors are the most visible part of a play.

17
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:06,490
A Controller is like a director who manages or controls things on a set.

18
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:10,400
And finally, you can think of the Model as the backstage area,

19
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,240
where they store props that are needed for the play.

20
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,600
So, what you're seeing here,

21
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:19,570
is the beginning of a design pattern called Model, View, and Controller.

22
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:20,740
Or MVC for

23
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:25,050
short, that Apple wants programmers to follow when they are making apps.

24
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:29,510
In fact, most apps in the app store, follow this sort of a design, and

25
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:30,765
so will we.

26
00:01:30,765 --> 00:01:34,490
You will begin to see this design pattern as soon as we make our app.

27
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:35,430
So let's do that next.
