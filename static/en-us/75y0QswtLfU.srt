1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,730
>> Alright, so that was helpful with the HTML. Can you do

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:06,530
something similar and tell me how you think about reading a CSS file?

3
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:08,588
>> Alright, sure. Let's go look at it. Alright, so we've

4
00:00:08,588 --> 00:00:12,570
got the CSS file. So CSS stands for cascading style sheets.

5
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:16,550
>> Okay. The cascading part is, sort of, you can define things in multiple

6
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:20,620
different ways, and it will always be the last definition that, that gets used.

7
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:22,228
>> Okay. What's going on, like, with these sorts

8
00:00:22,228 --> 00:00:25,610
of things? Yeah, so, so we've got HTML and body.

9
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:28,930
So, all of these rules will be applied to any element

10
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:33,160
that starts with HTML or body. And then this rule will

11
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:35,710
apply just to the ones with body, and you'll notice it's

12
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:39,990
one of the same attributes between the two of them so.

13
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:42,600
>> So, this margin is going to supersede that one?

14
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:43,940
>> Yeah. Yeah, it'll over ride it.

15
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:46,470
>> Okay, cool. Okay, so and this could say

16
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:50,080
Div for example? This could be just any HTML thing.

17
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,300
>> Yeah. So, you could define

18
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,420
styles for all Divs. That would be kind of weird

19
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:56,220
because there are so many Divs that it would just

20
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:58,590
be kind of, kind of strange. But, so here we've

21
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:01,040
got inputs. Those are like boxes that you type stuff in.

22
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,129
>> Now this is different. This is green.

23
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:07,735
>> Yeah. So, so this guy is talking about a class.

24
00:01:07,735 --> 00:01:10,910
>> Okay. So, these other ones, where they don't have dots

25
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:14,135
in front of them, those are the main, the element themselves.

26
00:01:14,135 --> 00:01:16,952
>> Mm-hm. So the thing right after the open

27
00:01:16,952 --> 00:01:18,922
angle bracket.

28
00:01:18,922 --> 00:01:19,900
>> Mm-hm.

29
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:22,360
>> When its got a dot, it's talking about the, the part

30
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:26,715
that says class equals. So, this one is referring to this particular class.

31
00:01:26,715 --> 00:01:27,162
>> Heading class, okay.

32
00:01:27,162 --> 00:01:27,715
>> Mm-hm.

33
00:01:27,715 --> 00:01:28,520
>> Cool.

34
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:32,800
>> And then, here, we've got an element dot class name,

35
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:36,580
so it's only that kind of element's class names. So if.

36
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:37,040
>> Okay.

37
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,690
>> If we'd had a Div with a, with

38
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:41,810
a class title, this rule wouldn't be applied to it.

39
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:41,990
>> Okay

40
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:43,650
>> It's only going to be applied to heading once.

41
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:46,116
>> So, what about these? So, what's going on with

42
00:01:46,116 --> 00:01:50,250
these like, at dash webkit dash keyframes? What is this?

43
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:51,790
>> This looks like it's probably some kind

44
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:55,980
of animation or like, maybe a hover over, something.

45
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:58,980
>> Okay. What do webkit and moz, what do those things mean?

46
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:03,040
>> Yeah, so this is, this is clearly referring to different kinds of browsers.

47
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,050
So it's probably like different ways of

48
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:07,140
doing things based on which browser you're in.

49
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:10,120
>> Oh, so is this, so when our front end engineers are all complaining

50
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,530
about, you know, lack of browser specification,

51
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:14,520
they're complaining about having to write these things?

52
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,990
>> Yeah, or, or probably more like this sort of

53
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:20,050
thing. Okay. I can, I can see why that'd be annoying.

54
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:21,059
>> Yeah.

55
00:02:21,059 --> 00:02:21,930
>> Alright. It gets super annoying.

56
00:02:23,545 --> 00:02:24,740
>> And is that about it? I mean,

57
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:27,560
there's elements. We've got classes. We've got this

58
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,770
blue stuff, which is just the rules you're

59
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:32,540
applying, the font size, the height. Is that about

60
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:33,390
all that's going on?

61
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:37,762
>> Yeah, pretty much. I mean you, you can do more complicated stuff in

62
00:02:37,762 --> 00:02:42,733
CSS, but it's sort of preferable not to. [LAUGH] You mostly want the CSS file

63
00:02:42,733 --> 00:02:48,627
to be as simple as possible. And just, sort of, give the basic positioning and

64
00:02:48,627 --> 00:02:51,005
like coloring and all of that, and

65
00:02:51,005 --> 00:02:54,970
then have the JavaScript deal with everything else.

66
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:58,011
>> Okay. Alright. well, I'm going to actually

67
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:01,720
try and do that thing that you said I shouldn't do. I going to try and change

68
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,320
the, some of the styling of all the

69
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,980
Divs and see if that does anything interesting.

70
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:05,490
>> Alright.

71
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:05,630
>> Okay.
