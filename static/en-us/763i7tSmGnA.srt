00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:04,420
Now let's go back to something a little bit more familiar, quadratic functions.

2
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:07,958
By looking at the coefficient over here, of our x squared term, either 1 or

3
00:00:07,958 --> 00:00:11,322
negative 1, can you tell me which of these graphs matches each of these

4
00:00:11,322 --> 00:00:13,739
equations?
