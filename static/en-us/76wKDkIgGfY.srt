00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:02,009
Welcome back.

2
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:04,370
In lesson one,
we made single screen apps, but

3
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:07,040
most apps have more than
one screen of information.

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,850
In this lesson, we're going to focus
on view presentation and segways.

5
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:12,560
What are our options in iOS for

6
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:15,420
presenting a UI with
multiple pages of content?

7
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:18,580
How do new pages of content
make their way onto the screen?

8
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:21,790
We're going to talk about two
stock ways that Apple provides.

9
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:24,460
The first is through implementing
a navigation structure

10
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:26,420
as exemplified here in the messages app.

11
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,660
Notice that when I click on
a specific message stream,

12
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,510
the message details slides
in from right to left.

13
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:36,840
If I want to return to the previous
view, the main messages table in this

14
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,160
case, I can use the Back
button in the top left corner.

15
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,500
That Back button is always
there in iOS navigation.

16
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,090
A second way to bring a view onto
the screen is modal presentation,

17
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:50,530
like you see here when I press
the Compose button in Messages.

18
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:54,020
Modally presented views slide up
from the bottom of the screen.

19
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:57,330
Modal presentation is often used for
Alert views.

20
00:00:57,330 --> 00:01:00,580
If I click on the camera for
a photo attachment,

21
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:04,650
an alert modal slides onto the screen,
giving me photo attachment options.

22
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:08,060
You can see that this alert view
also slides up from the bottom.

23
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:11,210
You'll be using a modally presented
image picker like this one

24
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:12,509
when you build MiMi
