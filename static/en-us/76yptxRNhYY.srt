00:00:00,005 --> 00:00:05,151
We know we can plug any number for x into an exponential function, like 10 to

2
00:00:05,151 --> 00:00:10,296
the x. So that means that the domain of f is negative infinity to infinity or

3
00:00:10,296 --> 00:00:15,748
all the real numbers. This also, then, is the range of g. We know that no

4
00:00:15,748 --> 00:00:20,095
matter what number we plug in for x, in 10 to the x, this function cannot reach

5
00:00:20,095 --> 00:00:26,362
0, and also can't drop below 0. So the range of f, goes from 0 to infinity,

6
00:00:26,362 --> 00:00:31,608
none inclusive. This is also the domain of g. This brings up something really

7
00:00:31,608 --> 00:00:37,748
important to know about logs. The input to a log must be greater than 0. It is

8
00:00:37,748 --> 00:00:41,727
not possible to find the log of a negative number. This is a super important

9
00:00:41,727 --> 00:00:44,688
point and we definitely need to keep it in mind as we keep working with logs in

10
00:00:44,688 --> 00:00:46,280
the future.
