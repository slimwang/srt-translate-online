1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,780
Here's my approach of adding a spout to the topology.

2
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:06,330
In part one of the command line, we navigate to lesson 1 stage 2.

3
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:14,560
I can do that by cd dot dot, or cd space doe dot, ls, and cd stage2.

4
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:15,180
In part 2,

5
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:21,120
in stage 2, we navigate to the new ReporterExclamationTopology.java file.

6
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:27,070
Therefore in lesson one, stage two we go to source JVM udacity, storm and

7
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:29,420
the reporter exclamation topology.

8
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:32,450
Notice again, that this is the entire solution to stage 1,

9
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:34,650
if you ever run into problems.

10
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:39,290
In part 3 we see the added spout under the spout folder.

11
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:45,280
Random sentence spout, which is here in storm spout and random sentence spout.

12
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,260
We then enter the import statement,

13
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:52,190
with the package structure using package udacity dot storm as a hint.

14
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:56,310
Scrolling down to the begin stage two exercise part one of two

15
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:58,870
we import our random sentence spout.

16
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:04,519
And that's simply, udacity.storm.spout.RandomSentenceSpout, which

17
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:09,880
corresponds to the structure udacity storm spout RandomSentenceSpout.

18
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:12,360
You'll find throughout this course that I like to test often,

19
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:16,410
so, run mvn package, just to get in the habit.

20
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:20,850
Back at your command line, type mvn package in lesson one, stage two,

21
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:23,370
and we see a, we have a build success,

22
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:27,080
which means we imported our random sentence outcome correctly.

23
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:29,830
After our build success in Part Four,

24
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:35,060
we update the topology builder to first, ignore the TestWordSpout.

25
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:41,070
Back in our ReporterExclamationTopology, we scroll down to our TopologyBuilder,

26
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:45,660
and we want to ignore the TestWordSpout, which we can do by simply commenting.

27
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:51,520
In part B, we add the RandomSentenceSpout with an id rand-sentence,

28
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,630
using a parallelism of ten.

29
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:56,610
I'll use the test word spout as an example.

30
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:58,230
And I can copy and paste.

31
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:01,390
We want an ID of ran sentence.

32
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,760
And instead of a new test word spout, we want a new random sentence spout and

33
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,600
finally we leave the parallelism at ten.

34
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:15,070
In part C, we connect the exclaim one bolt to the random sentence spout

35
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:18,330
using the ID rand-sentence.

36
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:22,580
Back in our topology builder, you could either update the shuffle grouping

37
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:28,290
connection from word to rand-sentence, or you can simply common tab

38
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:35,590
that section, copy and paste and use the syntax of word, to link rand-sentence.

39
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:39,420
In this way we've connected our spout of rand-sentence to

40
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:44,780
the bolt exclaim1 using a shuffle grouping connection.

41
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:46,990
Next we see the bolt exclaim2,

42
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:51,050
is connected to exclaim1 using another shuffle grouping.

43
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:53,170
and in this way we can build up a topology.

44
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:56,510
Next, we package our program, using MVN package.

45
00:02:56,510 --> 00:03:01,300
Next you can use the tree method, t-r-e-e, to see your file structure and

46
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:04,680
next we submit our program using storm jar target.

47
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:10,780
Remember you can use tab, Udacity, space jar with dependencies,

48
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:15,840
and the structure Udacity.storm ReporterExclamationTopology.

49
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,020
And hopefully with a built success and submitting your Storm program,

50
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:22,780
you are able to enjoy your visualization with random sentences and

51
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:25,150
exclamations appended at the end.

52
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:26,940
Preach on modifying your first topology.
