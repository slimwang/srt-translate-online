00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:04,540
So some of the most common things we
do with files are to move them around,

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:08,910
copy them, change their names,
things like that.

3
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:11,510
Let's see how to do some of
those things in the shell.

4
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:16,770
So the shell command to move files
is MV, which is short for move.

5
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:21,350
The simplest way to use it is to just
give it one file that you want to move

6
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:23,440
and the directory you
want to move it to.

7
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:27,010
You could also use it to rename files,
to move a file to a different name in

8
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:31,140
the same directory, or
to move several files into a directory.

9
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,410
Copying files is very similar.

10
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:35,814
The command is cp for copy.

11
00:00:35,814 --> 00:00:40,019
As with mv, you give it the name of
the file that you want to copy and

12
00:00:40,019 --> 00:00:41,867
where you want to copy it to.

13
00:00:41,867 --> 00:00:44,623
And that can be a different file
name in the same directory, or

14
00:00:44,623 --> 00:00:47,010
a file name in a different directory.

15
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:50,830
Or it could just be a directory that
you want to put the new copy in.

16
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:53,630
Both of these commands
support a lot of options.

17
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:55,410
You should read the manual pages for
both of them.

18
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:59,295
But here's something else
you might be wondering.

19
00:00:59,295 --> 00:01:04,459
Mv, cp, rm, why do you think these
commands have such short names?

20
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:09,450
Put your answer here, and then we'll
share our thoughts on the matter.
