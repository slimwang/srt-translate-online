1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,250
Okay Mike, are you ready for a quiz?

2
00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:05,070
>> Uh-huh. Okay, so, here, let me, let me set up the, the situation for

3
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:09,760
you. So a man goes to see his doctor, okay, because his back hurts or something.

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:09,950
>> Aww.

5
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:13,380
>> And she gives him a, I know, it's really sad. It's his, the left side

6
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:14,800
of his lower back, he's been playing too

7
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,490
much racquetball. Anyway, so a man goes to

8
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:19,870
see a doctor, and she gives him a lab test. Now this test is pretty good,

9
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:22,830
okay? It returns a correct positive. That is,

10
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:25,370
if you have the thing that this lab test

11
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:30,500
is testing for, it will say you have it 98 percent of the time, okay? So it only

12
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,130
gives you a false positive two percent of the

13
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:34,160
time. And at the same time, it will return

14
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,750
a correct negative, that is if you don't have

15
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:38,590
what the lab test is testing for, it will

16
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:41,320
say you don't have it. 97% of the time,

17
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,263
so it has a false negative rate of only 3%.

18
00:00:43,263 --> 00:00:45,280
>> Wait, hang on. So, just, what's his problem?

19
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,750
>> Oh, that's the question. So, the test

20
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:50,100
looks for a disease. So, give me a disease.

21
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:51,800
>> Spleen?

22
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:55,000
>> Okay, I like that. So the test looks for

23
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,050
spleentitis. Now spleentitis is such a rare disease that nobody's ever

24
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:04,410
heard of it, And it turns out that it's so rare that

25
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:09,310
only about this fraction of the population has it. Okay?

26
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:10,823
>> Mm-hm.

27
00:01:10,823 --> 00:01:13,710
>> That make sense? So we're looking for spleentitis. It's a

28
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:17,040
very rare disease, but this test is really good at determining

29
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,000
whether you have it or determining whether you don't have it

30
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,120
>> Can I tell you that, its,

31
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:23,350
spleentitis appeared zero times in google. [LAUGH] So

32
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,350
it really is quite rare.

33
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:26,978
>> It really is quite rare. But what does

34
00:01:26,978 --> 00:01:29,941
google know? OK, so you got it all Michael?

35
00:01:29,941 --> 00:01:32,100
>> Yeah. So its a really rare disease

36
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,050
and we have a very accurate test for it.

37
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:37,710
>> Good. Man goes to see the doctor. She gives him a lab test. Its a

38
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:40,400
pretty good lab test. Its checking for spleentitis,

39
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,480
relatively rare disease and the test comes back positive.

40
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,340
>> Oh.

41
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:49,650
>> Yes. So, test is positive. So, here is the quiz question.

42
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:50,480
>> Should we be

43
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,200
net, notifying his next of kin?

44
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,720
>> Yes. Does he have spleentitis?

45
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,000
>> You said, just said he had spleentitis.

46
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,030
>> No, I said the test says he had spleentitis. Or the

47
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:03,390
test looks for spleentitis, and the test came back positive. So, does

48
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:06,810
he have spleentitis? Yes or no? Alright, before I try to answer

49
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:09,310
that can I just, ask for clarification, can I get a clarification?

50
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:09,740
>> Please.

51
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:11,990
>> So the 98 is a percentage and the

52
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:14,640
97 is a percentage, is .008 also a percentage?

53
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,790
>> No it's not.

54
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:19,825
So if I wanted to convert it to a percentage it would be .8%.

55
00:02:19,825 --> 00:02:23,390
>> Got it. Alright, now I think I have, what I need.

56
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:27,040
>> Okay, alright, so, you think about it. Go.
