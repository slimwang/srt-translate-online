>> Now we want to solve for x. We learned last lesson that when two things were

2
00:00:04,987 --> 00:00:10,382
multiplied together to equal zero, one of them needs to equal zero. So either we

3
00:00:10,382 --> 00:00:15,466
need to have a value of x that will make this binomial equal to zero or we need

4
00:00:15,466 --> 00:00:20,646
to have a value of x that will make this binomial equal zero. Which two values

5
00:00:20,646 --> 00:00:22,925
of x then, satisfy this equation?
