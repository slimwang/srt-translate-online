1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So clearly in our example,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
whether or not you're in a hospital

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
correlated with whether or not you died,

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
but the truth is, the example omitted

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
and important variable,

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
the sickness, the disease itself.

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
And in fact, the sickness did cause you to die,

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
and also effected your decision of whether you go to a hospital or not.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
So if you draw acts of causation,

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
you find sickness causes death,

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
and sickness causes you to go to the hospital,

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and if anything at all,

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
once you knew you were sick,

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
being in the hospital negatively correlated

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
with you dying;

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
that is, being in a hospital made it less likely

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
for you to pass away

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
given that you were sick.

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
In statistics, we call this a confounding variable.

20
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
It's very tempting to just omit this from your data,

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
and if you do, you might find correlations;

22
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
in this case, a positive correlation between the hospital and death,

23
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
that have nothing to do with the way things are being caused,

24
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
and as a result, those correlations don't relate at all

25
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
to what you should do.

26
00:01:09,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So let's study another example.
