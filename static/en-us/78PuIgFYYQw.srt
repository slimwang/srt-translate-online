00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,240
For the last, part of the lesson, I want to talk about a much more

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:09,090
modern approach to using these Hough transform, displacement vectors.

3
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:12,090
In fact it was proposed as recently as 2004,

4
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:16,410
and subsequently, as a way of, locating a particular object.

5
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:21,290
What we're going to do now is, instead of using edges or

6
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:25,410
the idea of high, high value gradients as a, as a feature that you can find.

7
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:29,200
What we're going to use are little feature patches, all right?

8
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:34,110
And feature patches are just little chunks of an image that, for some reason,

9
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:35,170
for, for one reason or

10
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:39,170
another, you've decided, these are useful things to try to go find.

11
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:41,399
So, if you have those, this is the way that would work.

12
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:44,130
So we have a training image here, and

13
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:48,400
I'm going to assume for now that our feature patch is tire, and I'll tell you in

14
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:52,920
a minute about how we go about finding those feature patches, all right?

15
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:58,320
And so here I've located the tire in two different places, and so

16
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,230
in the same way as with the gradient, so when I first find it here,

17
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:05,390
I say, okay, there's a displacement vector to the right like that.

18
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:10,070
And I'll put that in a table that's indexed by the feature patch.

19
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:15,120
And then I find that, oop, I found it again, it's over here, and it's index, and

20
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:18,230
it, it has a displacement vector to the left, like that.

21
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:20,450
So I put that in a, in the same table, and

22
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:23,560
in fact it's indexed by the same feature type.

23
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:27,480
So, these features are referred to as visual codewords, which I'll describe in

24
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:31,340
just a minute, and the idea that I would have a table based upon the codewords.

25
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:35,780
And associated with each codeword is the set of displacement vectors that I

26
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:40,180
have to vote with every time I find that feature anywhere in the image.
