00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,367
Let's talk a bit more generally then about all these different problems we've

2
00:00:04,367 --> 00:00:08,590
discussed and their roots. So reflecting on the huge number of quadratic

3
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:13,214
equations we've worked with, how many solutions are there to any given quadratic

4
00:00:13,214 --> 00:00:17,659
equation? Please count repeated roots twice, and also remember that complex

5
00:00:17,659 --> 00:00:22,308
numbers and imaginary numbers, are in fact numbers. So answers that contain them

6
00:00:22,308 --> 00:00:23,963
do still count as solutions.
