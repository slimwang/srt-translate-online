00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,231
So far, the matrix class hasn't done all that much for us. I've shown you how to

2
00:00:04,231 --> 00:00:08,326
do exactly what you already knew how to do, translate and rotate around the x, y

3
00:00:08,326 --> 00:00:12,565
or z-axis. Here's a transform that isn't built in to the object 3D class, axis

4
00:00:12,565 --> 00:00:16,782
angle rotation. And for that, you really do need to use a separate matrix. Say I

5
00:00:16,782 --> 00:00:20,560
want to make a little star shaped ornament out of four cylinders. Or if you're

6
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,940
feeling more dramatic, I want to make some carbon fiber caltrops to trip up the

7
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:27,372
robo-minotaurs about to launch a final assault on our base on[UNKNOWN] Prime,

8
00:00:27,372 --> 00:00:32,500
it's really our only last hope. I'm better now. Well anyway, I want to align the

9
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:37,158
four cylinders with the four diagonals of a cube. The hard part is figuring out

10
00:00:37,158 --> 00:00:41,388
the rotation matrix I want to use. If I'm stuck using Euler angles, do I rotate

11
00:00:41,388 --> 00:00:45,985
in y, and then in x, or z and then in y, or something else? With the axis/angle

12
00:00:45,985 --> 00:00:50,710
function, I need to figure out what axis I want to rotate around, and how much

13
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:54,690
to rotate. We're going to use cylinders to make our object. Here's a cut-away

14
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:58,650
view of the cube, showing the original position of the cylinder and its desired

15
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:02,718
location in the wire frame along one of the diagonals. Every cylinder starts

16
00:01:02,718 --> 00:01:07,883
pointing up along y-axis. Step one is to figure out around which axis to rotate

17
00:01:07,883 --> 00:01:13,020
this vertical cylinder. I want to rotate the cylinder to the point x y z all

18
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:17,600
equal to 1. The question to you is which axis do I want to rotate around in

19
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:22,534
order to get this cylinder into its final position? Your choices are axis one,

20
00:01:22,534 --> 00:01:28,238
which is along the y-axis, axis two, which goes along negative x and z, axis

21
00:01:28,238 --> 00:01:34,402
three, which goes along this xyz-axis itself, and your last choice is axis four,

22
00:01:34,402 --> 00:01:39,498
which goes along the z-axis. Mark each that is correct, if any. If you get

23
00:01:39,498 --> 00:01:43,971
stuck, you might want to go back to the answer for how we formed a disc-shaped

24
00:01:43,971 --> 00:01:47,673
object out of the swept clock hands, as that might help you out.
