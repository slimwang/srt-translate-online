1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,300
If you play around with this a little bit further, you can figure out a general rule here,

2
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:15,300
and the general rule is that if you have n vertices then the number of different paths from A to B

3
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:21,340
is two to the power of n half minus one.

4
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:26,260
And the way you can see that this formula is correct is you can plug in the four here

5
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:31,360
so it's four over two which is two minus one and 2ยน that is two.

6
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:37,090
And in the quiz, we just saw that each time we add two vertices here, we have to multiply by 2,

7
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:40,270
and this is exactly what happens here because if we add two vertices here

8
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:43,370
then the exponent here will increase by one.

9
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:48,270
And in this way, you can work your way up to larger and larger networks of this structure.

10
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:53,090
So what you can see here is that the number of ways to get from A to B

11
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:57,360
grows exponentially as these graphs here get more and more vertices.

12
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:03,370
And I'm now going to ask in algorithmic question, and the algorithmic question is a very simple one

13
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:10,470
and that is what is the fastest way to get from A to B or the shortest way to get from A to B.

14
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:15,140
And if you have had an algorithm's class, you might know that this is a problem

15
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:17,530
that can be solved in polynomial time.

16
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:23,270
So there are many algorithms actually that can figure out in polynomial time.

17
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:26,560
What the shortest way is to get from A to B?

18
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:31,000
But this means that having many possible solutions cannot mean intractability

19
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,630
because here's the case where we do have many possible solutions.

20
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:38,360
There are exponentially many ways to get from A to B,

21
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:42,240
but if we ask an algorithm to figure out the shortest one for us,

22
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,480
it does obviously not have to consider an exponential number of solutions

23
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:51,320
to come up with the answer because, otherwise, there would be no polynomial time algorithm

24
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:54,370
to figure out shortest paths between two points A and B.

25
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:58,360
And so for vertex cover, clique, and independent set, this means that

26
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:02,410
if we want to show these problems to be intractable, it's not enough to point out

27
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:05,480
that there's an exponential number of solutions because that does not mean

28
00:02:05,480 --> 99:59:59,999
that there can't be no polynomial time algorithm.
