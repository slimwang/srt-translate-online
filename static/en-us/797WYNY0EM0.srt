1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,569
The first option is correct.

2
00:00:01,569 --> 00:00:05,560
If a page is not present, it will be
the hardware MMU that will fall, and

3
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:08,410
it will pass control to
the hypervisor regardless of

4
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:10,150
the virtualization approach.

5
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:14,800
For the second option, update to a page
table entry, this is not always true.

6
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:19,410
It really depends on whether
the OS has write permissions for

7
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:22,220
the page tables that it uses or not.

8
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:24,510
We'll see in the next videos
how this can be handle.
