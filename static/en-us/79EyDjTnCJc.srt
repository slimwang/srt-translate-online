00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,009
In the previous video,

2
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:06,180
we introduced Hoeffding's inequality, which puts a probability bound on

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:10,640
the amount by which our estimate of beta will deviate from the actual value.

4
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:13,540
We saw that this bound is actually a function of

5
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:15,370
the number of data points that we have.

6
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:17,950
So, let's try to apply that to our own problem, and

7
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:21,510
try to find a confidence bound for our beta parameter.

8
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:24,518
Recall that the beta value that came out of our exponential fit

9
00:00:24,518 --> 00:00:28,720
was 1451.5 seconds.

10
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:31,900
Let's used Hoeffding's inequality to put a 95% confidence

11
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:33,540
interval around this value.

12
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:38,795
So, first let's recall the number of data points we have is approximately 3200.

13
00:00:38,795 --> 00:00:46,722
So, what we want is for the right side of this expression to equal 5% or 0.05.

14
00:00:46,722 --> 00:00:51,081
So specifically, if you solve this expression here for

15
00:00:51,081 --> 00:00:54,988
Absalom, you get a value of about 0.0240.

16
00:00:54,988 --> 00:00:57,020
Now, what does this mean exactly?

17
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:58,128
That means,

18
00:00:58,128 --> 00:01:04,340
this interval traps the true value of data with a probability of 95%.

19
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:08,350
So, if we're going to use this exponential to predict the amount of

20
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:11,110
time to wait until this person Tweets next,

21
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:15,120
the best that we can say is that it lies somewhere within this interval
