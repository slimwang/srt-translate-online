1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:05,180
So the first, second and
fifth of these are probably true.

2
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:08,080
Unless you work at google your
computer is probably not directly on

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,280
their network.

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,640
And just because computers is up and

5
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:13,250
running doesn't mean that it
has a web server running on it.

6
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:16,450
For instance the machine that
you're using to watch this course

7
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:18,150
has an IP address.

8
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:21,400
But it only has a web server
if you've started one on it.

9
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:22,670
But it's on some network, and

10
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:25,560
that network is somehow
connected through to Google's.

11
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,668
The reason that we know this is that
ping sent some traffic to this address,

12
00:00:28,668 --> 00:00:31,930
8.8.8.8, and it got responses back.

13
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:35,010
So that means not only that we're on
a network and that they're on a network,

14
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:37,220
but that we're on a network
that can talk to theirs.
