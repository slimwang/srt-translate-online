00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,580
There are many possible solutions here,
but none of them follow a red edge.

2
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:07,711
I chose this path here.

3
00:00:07,711 --> 00:00:11,247
We have to follow a blue edge to
get in and out of the center, and

4
00:00:11,247 --> 00:00:15,010
we follow blue edges all
around the outside as well.

5
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:16,950
Thus, we obtain a cost of just six.
