00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,352
So we've been focusing on even functions for the last few quizzes, and I think

2
00:00:04,352 --> 00:00:08,610
it's time that we pay attention to the odd ones for a little bit. So let's ask

3
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:13,065
the same question of odd functions. Which of these choices apply in their case?

4
00:00:13,065 --> 00:00:17,113
Do they have symmetry across the x axis or the y axis? And do either of these

5
00:00:17,113 --> 00:00:19,500
rules about points on the functions apply?
