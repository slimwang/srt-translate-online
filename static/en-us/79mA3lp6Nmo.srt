1
00:00:05,363 --> 00:00:08,330
>> Lets start with index.html.

2
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:10,760
Don't worry HTML is pretty simple.

3
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:13,868
It describes the content and lay out of elements on a web page.

4
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:19,250
We'll be comparing what we see here to the website.

5
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:22,980
In this top section, we see the page's head tag defined.

6
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:26,730
We'll often find CSS in JavaScript links, like these here.

7
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:32,490
Inside the body of the text, we can see that we've got content that says,

8
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:33,130
Hello world.

9
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:37,820
And when we flip over to Chrome, there it is.

10
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:41,212
If you want to learn more about HTML,

11
00:00:41,212 --> 00:00:43,694
check out the link in the instructor's notes.

12
00:00:43,694 --> 00:00:49,598
Looking through the HTML for our resume, there are a few elements worth noting.

13
00:00:49,598 --> 00:00:53,280
Like this one, div id equals main.

14
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,810
I can see that it says, Hello world here, but showed up on the website.

15
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:00,340
Div represents different elements on the page,

16
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:03,860
you can think of them as starting like empty all purpose boxes.

17
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:07,890
In this case, we've given this div a unique id of main,

18
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:09,810
which our JavaScript will be referencing later.

19
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:12,840
Do you see anything else, James?

20
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,840
>> It doesn't look like a resume at all right now,

21
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,220
but I do see some structure for one.

22
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:22,530
It looks like there are sections for education, work and projects.

23
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:25,970
What do you think about filling these in with our resume data?

24
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:27,110
>> Yeah.

25
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:30,920
You know, web developers have options for building great web pages.

26
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,720
And I think there are two obvious strategies.

27
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:37,260
They can either hard code the information by writing HTML that

28
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:40,690
explicitly defines the content users should see.

29
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:42,530
Or they can use an HTML template and

30
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:46,340
fill it in with data programmatically when a user requests a page.

31
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:48,886
In this case, we can see the two work experience sections.

32
00:01:48,886 --> 00:01:52,426
In the hard coded version, we can see all of Phillip J.

33
00:01:52,426 --> 00:01:54,765
Fry's data listed here.

34
00:01:54,765 --> 00:01:57,549
While on the template side, we see the work experience section.

35
00:01:57,549 --> 00:01:58,940
But right now, it's empty.

36
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:03,900
>> The hard coded route is good to start, but it isn't a solution for

37
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,040
the long term.

38
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,120
Anytime we want to make a change to the page,

39
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:12,120
we have to open up the HTML, make the changes by hand, which can be a big pain.

40
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,960
For the resume project, we'll be using the template strategy.

41
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,440
What do you think?

42
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,700
>> Yeah, that works for me.

43
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:21,168
besides, if we weren't then this class would be about HTML.

44
00:02:21,168 --> 00:02:23,890
Which it isn't.

45
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:27,670
>> Yeah, there are other great introductions to HTML online.

46
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:30,060
See the instructor's notes for a few links.

47
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:35,098
At the top of the HTML, there's a link to jQuery.js, the jQuery library.

48
00:02:35,098 --> 00:02:38,320
There's also helper.js,

49
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:42,690
which contains some simple helper JavaScript we've prepared for your project.

50
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:45,300
We'll be coming back to it in a few minutes.

51
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:48,790
>> We've got two more script tags at the bottom of the HTML.

52
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:53,150
This tag for resumeBuilder.js, tells the browser to download and

53
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:55,030
execute some JavaScript.

54
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:59,760
We'll be using this script to add HTML content to the main section of the HTML.

55
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,430
>> The browser will render this page just saying, Hello world.

56
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:07,980
To give you a better overview of what's going on here,

57
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:11,340
we've zoomed out the page so you can see everything all at once.

58
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:16,700
We have Hello world here, some empty resume sections and then some JavaScript.

59
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:17,690
And over on this side,

60
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:21,770
we can see a general representation of how it would look in a browser.

61
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:23,823
We're printing the Hello world and

62
00:03:23,823 --> 00:03:27,528
then after the Hello world, we have all of the resume sections.

63
00:03:27,528 --> 00:03:31,713
And when we hit the JavaScript section that includes resume builder down here,

64
00:03:31,713 --> 00:03:34,000
the browser will run the script.

65
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,350
Which will change the HTML in these experience sections and

66
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:40,590
the page will now show our resume.

67
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:41,780
>> But wait.

68
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:45,260
You may ask yourself, what about all of these experience sections.

69
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:46,570
It looks like they're in the resume, but

70
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:48,500
they aren't showing up on the page right now.

71
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,130
That's because of these scripts at the bottom of our resume.

72
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:54,070
Using JavaScript, we're checking to see if any of

73
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:56,250
these sections contain any content.

74
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:58,130
And if not, we hide them.

75
00:03:58,130 --> 00:04:00,600
We'll get a chance to break down these JavaScript sections later
