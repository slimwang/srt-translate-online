00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:05,490
We can't prove that the null hypothesis is true. We can only obtain evidence to

2
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:10,718
reject the null hypothesis. Let's take a simple example. Let's say, our null

3
00:00:10,718 --> 00:00:16,810
hypothesis is that most dogs have four legs. And we define most as more than

4
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:21,356
50% of dogs. This 50% is analogous to our alpha level where we set our

5
00:00:21,356 --> 00:00:26,820
criterion for making a decision. Our alternative hypothesis is that most dogs

6
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:32,115
have less than four legs. Note that this is like a one tailed test. Where we're

7
00:00:32,115 --> 00:00:36,870
not guessing that most dogs have a different amount than four legs. We're

8
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:41,255
guessing most dogs have less, so there's a direction. Now let's say we sample

9
00:00:41,255 --> 00:00:46,301
10 dogs and find that all of them have four legs. Did we prove that the null

10
00:00:46,301 --> 00:00:49,723
hypothesis is true, that most dogs have four legs?
