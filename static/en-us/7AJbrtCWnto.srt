00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:03,690
For the past few questions, we've looked at equations that we can treat as

2
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:08,810
linear equations, up to a certain point, of course. But we spent a bunch of

3
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:13,080
time in this course, also talking about quadratic equations. And in fact, we're

4
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:17,480
going to need to use those techniques as well for certain equations that use

5
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:22,720
exponents. Let's look at example of one of those right now. Here we have e to

6
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:28,690
the 2x minus 5e to the x plus 6 equals 0. Now, it might not look like it right

7
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:33,960
away, but this is actually a quadratic equation in e to the x. To see this more

8
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:39,470
clearly, let's make a little substitution. Let's let u equal e to the x. How

9
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:44,100
then, would you rewrite the first 2 terms of our equation in terms of u? Please

00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:48,143
fill in these pink spots with the proper numbers, variables, or expressions.
