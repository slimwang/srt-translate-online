1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:01,960
Now we're getting somewhere.

2
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:04,750
We've got data from the Internet
showing up in Sunshine, but

3
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:06,870
let's make it a bit easier to test.

4
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:10,564
We'll add a menu that allows for us to
refresh the view with new weather data.

5
00:00:10,564 --> 00:00:14,137
This is especially cool if you're
using the random weather server.

6
00:00:14,137 --> 00:00:19,120
Open S02-02-Exercise Menus.

7
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,390
Look at your to dos.

8
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:23,620
This is going to look a lot like what
you did to add that menu to the get up

9
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:25,160
query app earlier.

10
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:28,750
First, add a Refresh string
called action_refresh.

11
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:32,530
Then, create a new menu
resource called forecast.

12
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:36,270
We then inflate our new menu
in onCreateOptionsMenu and

13
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:39,780
we handle the menu actions
in onOptionItemSelected.

14
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:42,789
A good idea to make it clear that
things are working is to clear

15
00:00:42,789 --> 00:00:46,500
the weatherTextView immediately and
call loadWeatherData.

16
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,320
You can do this by setting
the text view to empty text.
