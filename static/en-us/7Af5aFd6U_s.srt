00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:02,930
As we discussed, content-based filters are easy

2
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:05,130
for attackers to evade because they can

3
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:07,300
very easily change the content, of the

4
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:10,870
message that is carrying the spam that they

5
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:12,920
wish to deliver. They can embed their

6
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:16,440
message in things like images, mp3's, Excel

7
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,020
spreadsheets and so forth, making it relatively

8
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:21,470
difficult for the filter maintainers to keep up.
