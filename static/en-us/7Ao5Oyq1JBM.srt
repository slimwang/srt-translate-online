1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The answer is 0.00002,

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
and the reason for that is the sum of all the probabilities of all the events

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
in the probability space must be 1.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
We're certain that we get 1 of these events everytime we draw from the probability space.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I'm not going to try flipping the coin enough times to see if I can actually make it

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
land on its edge.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 99:59:59,999
The actual probability of landing on the edge is probably much lower than that.
