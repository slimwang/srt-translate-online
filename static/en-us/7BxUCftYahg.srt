00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,612
>> And so here's that code in practice, the first thing we do is loop through

2
00:00:03,612 --> 00:00:07,770
each of the tileSets images, checking the firstgid against the tileIndex. Once

3
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:11,989
we find the correct one, we'll break out knowing that i is the proper index.

4
00:00:11,989 --> 00:00:16,539
Once we find this, we can set the pkt.img value to equal the image of the atlas,

5
00:00:16,539 --> 00:00:20,870
and then we go through and do a little bit of math to determine what the tile

6
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:25,625
offset is. Now, recall that the tile index is actually added to the firstgid for

7
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:30,215
this array. So, 167 as a tile index, is actually atlas with gid1. Tile 166. We

8
00:00:30,215 --> 00:00:34,704
remedy this by actually subtracting the tileIndex from the firstgid, giving us

9
00:00:34,704 --> 00:00:39,328
localIdx. From there, we can do a little simple math, given the localIdx and the

10
00:00:39,328 --> 00:00:43,900
numXTiles horizontally for this atlas to give us to give us our x and y indexes.

11
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:48,386
Once we have the indexes, we can multiply them by the tileSize to give us our px

12
00:00:48,386 --> 00:00:51,309
and py. Finally, return pkt, and we're good to go.
