00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,447
Throughout this course, we're going to be sharing a lot of data that we collect

2
00:00:03,459 --> 00:00:06,875
with you. We're going to be sharing a lot of data with you. Some of it will be

3
00:00:06,887 --> 00:00:10,228
data that we collect, maybe from you guys, and some of it might be data that we

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,652
find. Either way we're going to try to make it really fun and interesting and

5
00:00:13,664 --> 00:00:17,101
you'll learn a lot in the process. We think that the easiest way to share this

6
00:00:17,113 --> 00:00:19,461
data with you is with a Google account. Count.

7
00:00:19,466 --> 00:00:24,078
If you haven't already, pause this video now, and create your Google account so

8
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:28,460
we can share this data with you. This'll be really important throughout the

9
00:00:28,472 --> 00:00:29,278
entire course.
