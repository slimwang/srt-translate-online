They call their first technique data layout transformation.

2
00:00:03,305 --> 00:00:06,910
So, by now, you're very familiar with the concept of global memory coalescing,

3
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:11,686
where we achieve the best bandwidth to memory when adjacent threads access adjacent locations in memory.

4
00:00:11,686 --> 00:00:15,718
As a quick review, global memory coalescing is important

5
00:00:15,718 --> 00:00:20,398
because modern DRAM systems transfer large chunks of data per transaction,

6
00:00:20,398 --> 00:00:25,601
because modern DRAM systems transfer data in many small chunks, one per thread request,

7
00:00:25,601 --> 00:00:29,895
or because modern GPUs have no on-chip caches in which to prefetch data,

8
00:00:29,895 --> 00:00:34,673
meaning to hold data likely to be used by a thread but not yet actually requested by it?
