00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:04,140
Let's take a quick quiz on packet switching versus circuit switching. Which of

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:07,110
the following are characteristics of packet switching

3
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:10,830
and circuit switching: variable delay, busy signals,

4
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:13,410
sharing of network resources like an end-to-end

5
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:17,680
path among multiple recipients, and dedicated resources

6
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,000
between the sender and receiver? Each of

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,570
these options, only has one correct answer.
