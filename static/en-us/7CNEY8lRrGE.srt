00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
[Narrator] The next question I wouldn't need to dwell on in the class,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
but I think it's important.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
When it comes to scaling in the number of dimensions of the state space,

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
the amount of storage we have to assign.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I give you 2 answers.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
It could be quadratic or exponential.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
So, we have quadratic exponential--quadratic exponential--and

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I understand I didn't really discuss this,

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
but go back in your memory to how grids are represented

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and how Gaussian's are represented,

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
and I promise you 1 of those answers is correct for either of the 2 filters here.
