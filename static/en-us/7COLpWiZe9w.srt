00:00:00,005 --> 00:00:03,461
To find the x-coordinates of the x-intercepts of this rational function, we

2
00:00:03,461 --> 00:00:08,029
need to set the numerator equal to 0. Since if that equals 0, then the whole

3
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:12,990
fraction equals 0, which means that f of x equals 0. And that's exactly what's

4
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:17,614
happening at an x-intercept. When we solve for x, we get x equals plus or minus

5
00:00:17,614 --> 00:00:23,696
1 over the square root of 8, or 1 over 2 root 2. This is approximately equal to

6
00:00:23,696 --> 00:00:28,934
plus or minus 0.354 point. Now for our y-intercepts, all we need to do is plug

7
00:00:28,934 --> 00:00:36,479
in zero for x. This gives us a y value of 1 9th. So, there we go. We have two

8
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:39,003
x-intercepts and one y-intercept.
