00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:04,930
So to quickly summarize in this lecture,
I just wanted to get you started

2
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:09,280
thinking about what is video and
what are the representations, videos,

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:13,550
building off the concept that we have
studied extensively, that is images.

4
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:17,320
The concept of persistence of vision
plays an important role in this one for

5
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:21,570
both capturing and then, of course,
visualizing and playing videos back.

6
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:25,770
We talked about how we can basically
take the same concepts of filtering and

7
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:29,060
processing images, everything we
learned, except now we will do it

8
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:33,380
in three dimensions,
not just X and Y, but X, Y, and T.

9
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:34,400
And then we talked about,

10
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,890
we can actually apply some of
the point the detection feature,

11
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:42,130
detection methods, and use that to track
interesting information across videos.

12
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:45,060
Of course same kinds of techniques
are used to do people tracking and

13
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:46,000
stuff like that.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,100
Again, we won't get into this kind
of stuff in this class, but for

15
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:51,550
those of you who are taking
the computer vision class some time,

16
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:52,850
will learn a lot more about it.

17
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:57,790
Please find additional information
both in the Rick Szeliski book, but

18
00:00:57,790 --> 00:00:59,260
also just look at my website.

19
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:01,280
There's a lot of fun
stuff about on videos.

20
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,599
My group, as I said, works extensively
in the area of videos, and we have loads

21
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:08,020
of examples and I'm going to be showing
you a whole lot of them in this class.
