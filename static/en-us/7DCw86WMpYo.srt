00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:04,790
You can add a new empty table to your
database with the create table command.

2
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:09,960
When you create a table, you'll give
the name of the table, and the names and

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,930
the types of each column.

4
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:16,710
You can also set constraints on each
column, and on the row as a whole.

5
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:20,370
We'll talk about constraints shortly,
but for now let's focus on types.

6
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:23,270
Here's the simplest form of the create
table command that doesn't have any

7
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:26,380
constraints, only columns with their
types and gives the table a name.

8
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:30,990
Now we've dealt with text and
integer types previously.

9
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:33,870
And back in lesson two,
I gave you a big long list of lots and

10
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:36,440
lots of types that SQL supports.

11
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:40,750
The exact set of types that you can use
will vary from system to system though.

12
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:43,930
If you're working with a database system
that doesn't natively support the type

13
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:47,128
you need,
there's usually a way to work around it.

14
00:00:47,128 --> 00:00:51,430
For instance, PostgreSQL has
a specific type for IP addresses, but

15
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:52,400
MySQL does not.

16
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:58,670
MySQL programmers usually use an integer
or a text string to store IP addresses.

17
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:02,525
Of the databases we've used in this
course PostgreSQL has a proper type for

18
00:01:02,525 --> 00:01:03,885
dates and times.

19
00:01:03,885 --> 00:01:06,925
But SQLite actually just
stores dates as strings.
