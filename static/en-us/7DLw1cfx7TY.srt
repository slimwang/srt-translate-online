1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
We have 8 elements--one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:14,000
So, each quartile, since we have four of them has exactly two elements.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 99:59:59,999
We go two over here, here, and here are the quartile boundaries.
