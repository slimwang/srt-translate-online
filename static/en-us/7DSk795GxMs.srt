1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
We know from computer science theory from people like Alan Turing

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
that languages like Python and JavaScript are equally powerful.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
You've seen half of that here when we wrote an interpreter for JavaScript in Python.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
We might wonder are natural languages equal?

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Spanish, Portuguese, Japanese, Mandarin, Hindi--are these languages all equal in every way?

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
This idea is actually not universally accepted.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Does every French utterance have an equivalent Japanese utterance?

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The Sapir Whorf hypothesis--or linguistic relativity hypothesis--in linguistics

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
holds that the structure of a language influences the ways in which speakers reason

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
about the way world.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
This is still hotly debated. Language is generally held to influence thought.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
For a chilling fictionalization, I encourage you back again to George Orwell's 1984.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
However, in computing in unnatural languages like Python and JavaScript,

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
we can have definitive answers based on mathematical proofs.

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
There is a very strong sense in which Python, JavaScript, C, C++, C-Sharp, and Java

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
can all do exactly the same range of computations--

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
those that can be done on what's known as a "Turing machine,"

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
a mathematical model of computation.

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
However we won't talk about Turing machines in detail in this class.

20
00:01:20,000 --> 99:59:59,999
