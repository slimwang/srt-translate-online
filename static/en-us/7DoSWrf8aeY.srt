1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:03,520
We're ready to start
building Flick Finder.

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:05,060
Here, I have the starter code project,

3
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:07,880
which you can download from
the link in the instructor notes.

4
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:09,800
Let's run it to see what we have.

5
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:14,410
The UI's fairly simple, we have a title,
a place where our image will go here

6
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:17,825
in the middle, and then we have UI to
support the different text search,

7
00:00:17,825 --> 00:00:20,680
and a latitude and longitude search.

8
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:23,330
There's also some space left
below the text fields so

9
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:26,780
we can display the image's title or
error information.

10
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:30,938
If we open up the ViewController.swift
file, we can see that actions have

11
00:00:30,938 --> 00:00:34,043
already been connected for
both of our search buttons.

12
00:00:34,043 --> 00:00:38,130
We have the searchByPhrase action and
the searchByLatLon action.

13
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:43,700
We also have this method called
displayImageFromFlickrBySearch

14
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:45,810
that takes a dictionary of parameters,
and

15
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:48,110
this is where we'll make our
search request to Flickr.

16
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:53,310
We left some comments in the search
actions that say we need

17
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:58,020
to add the necessary parameters for
the methodParameters dictionary.

18
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:00,548
So there's one there and one here.

19
00:01:00,548 --> 00:01:03,820
And this is similar to the approach
we took in Sleeping In The Library,

20
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:06,760
where we're going to build our
methodParameters dictionary and

21
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:09,880
then we'll pass it to
displayImageFromFlickrBySearch.

22
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:12,860
And there we'll construct our URL and
make our request.

23
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:18,630
Now the rest of the code in this view
controller is primarily for the showing

24
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:23,500
and hiding of the keyboards that come up
when we have our text field selected.

25
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:24,990
And also it has some code for

26
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:29,050
the checking of, did we enter
a valid latitude or longitude?

27
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:32,010
Is the string empty when
we're trying to search for?

28
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:34,060
I'm sorry.
Is the text empty when we're trying to

29
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:34,979
do the text search?

30
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:36,550
And all those little edge cases.

31
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:42,104
But there is one more method that I
want to show that we provided for

32
00:01:42,104 --> 00:01:43,043
your convenience.

33
00:01:43,043 --> 00:01:46,490
It's called flickerURLFromParameters.

34
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:49,000
This method uses the classes
we just discussed.

35
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,054
NSURLComponents and NSURLQueryItem.

36
00:01:52,054 --> 00:01:56,448
And what this method does is it takes
in parameters that you pass it, and

37
00:01:56,448 --> 00:01:59,466
then it constructs a URL for
the Flickr request.

38
00:01:59,466 --> 00:02:01,900
So, no more escapeParameters method.

39
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:06,150
Just pass this method, a dictionary of
the name value parameter pairs, and

40
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:08,229
it'll construct a URL for
the Flickr API.

41
00:02:10,008 --> 00:02:13,390
Now let's take a peek at
the constant.swift file.

42
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:15,600
Here, like before in
the Sleeping In The Library app,

43
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,320
we've defined some useful
constants that you can use as

44
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,200
you're writing the networking code for
this app.

45
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:23,710
Okay, now to the exercise.

46
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:26,360
What I want you to do is
correctly add the parameters for

47
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:30,570
the methodParameters dictionary so that
it contains all the arguments needed to

48
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:34,420
perform a text search using
the flicker.photos.search method.

49
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:36,830
Now remember, at your disposal,

50
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:40,071
you have the constants that we've
defined in constants.swift,

51
00:02:40,071 --> 00:02:43,640
and you'll also need to adjust your
API key, make sure you do that.

52
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,520
And then the only other odd ball
parameter is that you'll need to

53
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:49,070
include the text that's
provided by the user.

54
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:49,610
And then,

55
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:55,190
when displayImageFromFlickrBySearch is
called, print the URL that's constructed

56
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:58,830
by our flickrURLFromParameters
method into the debug area.

57
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:03,310
And if you do everything correctly you
should end up with a URL that looks

58
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:04,220
like this one,

59
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:09,640
assuming of course that the user inputs
the text oranges in their search.

60
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:13,280
And you'll also want to have your
api_key and not this little placeholder.

61
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,803
So take some time to code this up.

62
00:03:14,803 --> 00:03:16,370
And when you're done, check this box.
