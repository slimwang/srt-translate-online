1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:04,914
So this basic idea of finding corners in, in thinking about it this way.

2
00:00:04,914 --> 00:00:07,127
I don't know if I would say that it was first introduced.

3
00:00:07,127 --> 00:00:12,224
But I'll say that it was most well known introduced way back in 1988.

4
00:00:12,224 --> 00:00:14,760
I know some of you guys were, like, in diapers.

5
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:17,570
And some of you were, a dream in your parents' eyes.

6
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:20,306
And some of you were a nightmare in your, no, whatever.

7
00:00:20,306 --> 00:00:23,050
It's a long time ago, all right?

8
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:26,490
And, the picture here down below is just showing you sort of a mess of corners.

9
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:27,700
And they don't all look like corners, but

10
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:29,940
they, they're places where the gradient varies.

11
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:33,240
And it was created, this paper, the Alvey Vision Conference is what later I

12
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,640
believe became the British Machine Vision Conference.

13
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,960
And it was done by this, by Harris and Stephens.

14
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,160
Now.

15
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:42,590
If you ask anybody, about the corner detector I'm about to tell you about,

16
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:45,540
they'll you that they're Harris corners.

17
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:47,360
Because that's what everybody remembers.

18
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:52,590
I know an awful lot of people in Computer Vision, I don't know who Stephens is.

19
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:53,670
So this tells you something.

20
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:57,150
That if you're doing a paper with somebody, try to get your name first.

21
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:59,040
Unless of course it's your advisor and he's paying, he or

22
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,720
she's paying for your education in which case then you know.

23
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:06,080
But, anyway, so I'm it's, it's actually Harris and Stephens and you can impress

24
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:10,600
somebody by saying, Harris and Stephens corners but it's, it's Harris corners.

25
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,940
All right. So let's learn about Harris corners.

26
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:15,380
So, Harris corners are.

27
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:20,260
Based on a approximation, model and an error model.

28
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:21,880
And here's how we do.

29
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:26,870
Let's assume, that we've got an image L and right here, right and

30
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:28,520
I is the intensity image.

31
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:32,903
And what we're going to do is we're going to say, if I shift that I by

32
00:01:32,903 --> 00:01:37,974
a little bit, by a u and a v and I were to sum up the square over some window.

33
00:01:37,974 --> 00:01:40,597
How much error, would i get?

34
00:01:40,597 --> 00:01:43,190
K thats thats thats the game we're going to play.

35
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:46,690
So stepping through that, I is our image intensity, so

36
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:49,400
I of x y is just the orignal image.

37
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,530
The u and the v is some small shift, so

38
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:55,490
if I were to pick up my window and move it over a little bit,

39
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:59,140
I would now get some different image just shifted by a little bit.

40
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:00,020
I subtract them and

41
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:04,220
square them, and then I, going to, I'm going to sum them up over some window.

42
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:07,940
Okay? So the window is going to be some area, around some point.

43
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:10,720
So that's written here as w of xy.

44
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,520
The total value here, E, is sort of for error.

45
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:18,260
You really could think of it as sum of the change where E for error or energy.

46
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:20,290
But the idea is that we're going to sum it up.

47
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:21,030
Around that window.

48
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:24,060
Now of course your window can typically be a square window,

49
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:27,810
like in my house, or if you want to actually work a little bit, or, on a,

50
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:30,080
on a slow computer you make it be a square window.

51
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,000
But if you actually want to weight the pixels near the point you're thinking

52
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,160
about, more then the pixels that are far away, you would use a window that

53
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:42,910
falls off in intensity, intensity So like a Gaussian window would be an example.

54
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:43,670
So.

55
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:47,340
Typically your windows can be square, if you need to be really fast, or

56
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,390
smooth, if you need to be really good.

57
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:50,460
So, are you fast, or you good?
