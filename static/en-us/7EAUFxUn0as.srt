00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,200
The main thing to remember about operant conditioning is that reinforcement

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:08,007
always increases the future likelihood of a behavior occurring, and punishment

3
00:00:08,007 --> 00:00:13,350
always decreases the likelihood of behavior occurring. Let's take a look at

4
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:18,150
this two by two table of operant consequences. Notice we have a plus and a

5
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:22,355
minus. You should think of this as adding something to the environment or

6
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:28,384
taking something away. Do not think of the plus and minus as good or bad. But

7
00:00:28,384 --> 00:00:32,526
rather just a mathematical operation. So we have our operation. Are we adding

8
00:00:32,526 --> 00:00:36,732
something or subtracting something? On the consequence side, we're going to

9
00:00:36,732 --> 00:00:42,910
either add a reinforcer or remove a reinforcer. Let's think of our example with

10
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:47,950
Callie, when Dr Zelegg gave a piece of fish to Callie, she was using that fish

11
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:56,012
as a reinforcer, and it was an impetative stimulus something that we enjoy. We

12
00:00:56,012 --> 00:01:01,626
can also increase behavior by removing something aversive. For example, you

13
00:01:01,626 --> 00:01:06,176
wake up and your alarm clock is blaring loud, that's very aversive. You turn

14
00:01:06,176 --> 00:01:09,952
your alarm clock off, you remove that aversivness from your environment and

15
00:01:09,952 --> 00:01:15,555
you're likely to engage in that behavior again in the future. Reinforcer is

16
00:01:15,555 --> 00:01:21,710
always increasing behavior. Let's look at punishers. In this box we would call

17
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:26,500
this positive reinforcement, because we're adding something to the enviornment.

18
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:29,750
In this box we call it negative reinforcement because we're taking something

19
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:35,294
away. We can also use these operations for punishment. For punisher, if we add

20
00:01:35,294 --> 00:01:38,878
something aversive after a behavior occurs, we're going to see a decrease in

21
00:01:38,878 --> 00:01:44,080
the likelihood of that behavior occurring in the future. We can also remove

22
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:49,207
something positive or appetitive and also see a decrease. So, for example, if

23
00:01:49,207 --> 00:01:52,684
you touch a light switch with a wet hand and you get shocked, you're adding

24
00:01:52,684 --> 00:01:58,180
pain to your environment and you probably won't do that again in the future.

25
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:02,149
Here, you're playing with your video games and you hit your brother and your

26
00:02:02,149 --> 00:02:07,151
mum takes away your video games. You're losing something that you enjoy and

27
00:02:07,151 --> 00:02:11,952
you're less likely to engage in that behavior again in the future. So in this

28
00:02:11,952 --> 00:02:18,220
example, this would be positive punishment because you're adding a punisher.

29
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:21,559
And in this box, it would be negative punishment because you're taking away

30
00:02:21,559 --> 00:02:24,686
something that is appetitive or something that we like and we also see a

31
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:30,781
decrease in behavior. Reinforcement increase, punishment decrease.
