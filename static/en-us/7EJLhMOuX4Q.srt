00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,830
Now that we have compared and contrasted interrupts and

2
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:06,460
signals, let's see how we can visualize these concepts.

3
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:09,250
We'll use again an illustration within a toy shop,

4
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:12,670
where we will try to make an analogy between an interrupt and

5
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:18,460
a snowstorm warning, and a signal and a battery is low warning.

6
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:23,280
The reason for these two choices is to make it a little bit more similar with

7
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:27,790
the interrupt being generated by an event that's external to the CPU.

8
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:31,220
So, an event that's external to the toy shop.

9
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:34,730
Whereas the signal is more generated from within, so

10
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:39,770
the battery is low is directly caused by the toy shop worker fixing a toy.

11
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:44,390
First, each of these types of warnings need to be handled in specific ways.

12
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:46,460
Second, both of them can be ignored.

13
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:51,030
And last, we can think about both of them as being expected or unexpected.

14
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:53,990
In a toy shop, handling these types of events may be

15
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:57,750
specified via safety protocols or certain hazard plans.

16
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,280
This is not uncommon.

17
00:00:59,280 --> 00:00:59,860
There may be,

18
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:04,340
however, situations in which it's appropriate to just continue working.

19
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:09,090
And finally, situations like the fact that the battery died are pretty frequent.

20
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:11,910
They happen regularly, so they're expected.

21
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:13,710
Whether or not it is expected for

22
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:19,370
a snowstorm to occur, that will really depend on where the toy shop actually is.

23
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:23,500
If we think about interrupts or signals, well, both of them are handled in

24
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:27,280
a specific way and that's defined by the signal handler.

25
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,170
Next, both interrupts and signals can be masked, as we said.

26
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:33,380
And in that way, we can ignore them.

27
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:35,230
And finally, as we previously discussed,

28
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:39,290
these types of events can appear synchronously or asynchronously.

29
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:42,130
So we have some analogy between these two contexts again.
