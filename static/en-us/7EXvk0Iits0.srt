00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,368
For the first inequality, we are basically looking for y-values along the pink

2
00:00:04,368 --> 00:00:08,460
curve that are greater than the y-value of the purple curve, since the pink

3
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:12,816
corresponds with the left side of the equation and the purple corresponds with

4
00:00:12,816 --> 00:00:17,254
the right side of the equation, I mean, when the left to be greater than right.

5
00:00:17,254 --> 00:00:21,274
So, the line y equals x squared minus 16 is above the line y equals 0, well,

6
00:00:21,274 --> 00:00:25,594
above the purple line. That means that the x -value of any point, on the pink

7
00:00:25,594 --> 00:00:30,245
line that's above the purple line, should satisfy this inequality. Lets check

8
00:00:30,245 --> 00:00:34,782
one just to be sure. Well these end points, these points of the intersection,

9
00:00:34,782 --> 00:00:39,383
are the points negative 4, 0 and 4, 0. So, that means that the x-values in this

10
00:00:39,383 --> 00:00:43,604
region above the purple line, x is less than negative 4 in this portion of the

11
00:00:43,604 --> 00:00:47,864
curve, and x is greater than 4 over here. And remember, that was the solution

12
00:00:47,864 --> 00:00:52,088
set we found for this inequality so that's perfect. Almost exactly the same

13
00:00:52,088 --> 00:00:56,806
thing happens in graph b. Again, solutions are found above the purple line since

14
00:00:56,806 --> 00:01:01,303
we want x squared to be greater than 16 and y equals 16 is the purple line. The

15
00:01:01,303 --> 00:01:06,838
points of intersection, in this case, are negative 4, 16 and 4, 16. Even though

16
00:01:06,838 --> 00:01:11,875
the y-values of those points are different, the x-values are exactly the same.

17
00:01:11,875 --> 00:01:16,660
In fact, this graph is simply the same as a, just shifted upward 16. To be

18
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:21,223
clear, each inequality that we're looking at only has one variable in it. We

19
00:01:21,223 --> 00:01:25,594
only care about x-values. What these graphs help us do is portion out the

20
00:01:25,594 --> 00:01:30,659
coordinate planes that we can see which x-values do satisfy these equations. So,

21
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:35,139
over here in graph a, any points in either the region to the left or this region

22
00:01:35,139 --> 00:01:39,493
to the right, we'll have x-values that satisfy this equation. The areas that

23
00:01:39,493 --> 00:01:43,321
aren't shaded in are areas where we can't guarantee whether or not the x-values

24
00:01:43,321 --> 00:01:47,193
will satisfy this, and we have a similar thing happening in graph b. I know that

25
00:01:47,193 --> 00:01:51,079
connecting graphs to inequalities in this way might seem a little bit confusing

26
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:54,511
at first, but hopefully you at least thought that it was interesting.
