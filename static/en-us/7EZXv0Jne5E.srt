00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,575
These are the correct answers. Great algebra solving if you got them. We start

2
00:00:04,575 --> 00:00:08,830
by taking the square root of both sides of our equation. So, 3r minus 2 will

3
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:13,721
equal positive or negative root of 27. I'm going to go ahead and simplify the

4
00:00:13,721 --> 00:00:18,488
square root of 27 to be 3 root 3. Next we add 2 to both sides of our equation

5
00:00:18,488 --> 00:00:23,526
to get 3r is equal to 2 plus or minus 3 root 3. We divide both sides by the

6
00:00:23,526 --> 00:00:28,100
coefficient of 3 to get our final result. And if you prefer, you can write your

7
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:34,218
answer as two fractions. 2 3rds plus or minus 3 root 3 divided by 3.
