1
00:00:00,016 --> 00:00:04,040
So, the multi-level page table
still looks at the virtual address

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:07,939
in terms of page offset and
page number, but

3
00:00:07,939 --> 00:00:13,510
instead of using the entire page number
to access one huge table, it partitions

4
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:19,230
the page number into the so-called inner
page number, and the outer page number.

5
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:22,910
The outer page number
tells us which part

6
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:25,520
of the larger page table
we would be using.

7
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:30,400
The inner part tells us, which specific
entry in that large page table we

8
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,780
would be using,
instead of having the large page table,

9
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:38,890
the outer page number is now used
to index into the outer page table.

10
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:44,100
And each entry in the outer page table,
tells us where to find the so

11
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,020
called inner page table.

12
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:48,180
Once we find the inner page table.

13
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:53,745
We take the inner page number, and use
it to index into the inner page table.

14
00:00:53,745 --> 00:00:58,370
And what we find there,
is the actual frame number to access.

15
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:00,890
Another entry in the outer page table

16
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:04,510
will point to a different
inner page table.

17
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:08,060
So pretty much what we have
is the outer page table

18
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:12,100
tells us which of the small
inner page tables to use.

19
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:16,790
And the inner page table tells us
in where each of the page tables we

20
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:18,150
need to look at.

21
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:22,040
So it seems like this is just a more
complicated way to access the page

22
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:25,630
table, but still for
every possible page number,

23
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:30,340
we will have a frame number in
one of the inner page tables.

24
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:33,080
The total size of the inner page tables,

25
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:36,850
will be the size of
the original flat page table.

26
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:41,630
And we still have added the outer page
table, which we didn't have before.

27
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:46,170
So, pretty much, we still have
the same number of entries total here.

28
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:47,380
And we have added something.

29
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:48,790
So, where are the savings?
