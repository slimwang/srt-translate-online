1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
With this assignment, we want you to write a function create_tour

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
that takes as input a list of nodes and outputs a graph

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
as a list of tuples representing edges between nodes

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
that have an Eulerian tour.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
For example, if nodes was 1, 2, 3,

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
one possible solution is a graph that has an edge between 1 and 3,

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
and edge between 1 and 2, and an edge between 2 and 3.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
We've also provided some simple testing code,

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
which you can use to see if you're function is working properly.
