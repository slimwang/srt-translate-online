00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,419
First things first, let's discuss the
essence of what the cover letter is, and

2
00:00:04,419 --> 00:00:07,750
why it's worth your time to write
a custom letter for each application.

3
00:00:08,779 --> 00:00:12,429
Employers like cover letters because
they provide information about you that

4
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:14,459
other materials can't convey.

5
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:17,660
My interests vary, and
I use a cover letter to weave

6
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:20,309
a narrative between my
different work experiences.

7
00:00:20,309 --> 00:00:23,919
Which on the surface normally don't
relate to the job I'm pursuing.

8
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,810
The story I tell in my cover letter
usually begins with stating why I'm

9
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:29,309
excited and passionate about this job.

10
00:00:29,309 --> 00:00:33,006
I've then connect how my seemingly
unrelated work experiences actually

11
00:00:33,006 --> 00:00:37,230
are very relevant for the job duties and
why this prepares me for the job.

12
00:00:37,229 --> 00:00:41,109
I also let the employer know I don't
want this job just to have a job, but

13
00:00:41,109 --> 00:00:43,269
because I want to build my career.

14
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:46,099
I let them know what I'm most
interested in about the job and

15
00:00:46,098 --> 00:00:48,984
how this will help me become
a better employee in future, and

16
00:00:48,984 --> 00:00:51,609
to fulfill my short and
long term professional goals.

17
00:00:51,609 --> 00:00:54,313
When you submit a general letter,
or a letter written for

18
00:00:54,313 --> 00:00:58,330
another company to another employer it
doesn't portray these important nuances.

19
00:00:58,329 --> 00:01:00,429
If you don't submit a targeted letter,

20
00:01:00,429 --> 00:01:04,079
then you are submitting
an ineffective job application.

21
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:07,289
Give yourself the best chance you
have at getting an interview and

22
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:08,930
think critically about your application.
