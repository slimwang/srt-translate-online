00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,870
Here's a short quiz for you.

2
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:06,450
Imagine that you've had an association between classes for

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:09,040
students and classes for courses.

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,150
The association was called Take and

5
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:15,093
the implication was that a student is taking a particular course.

6
00:00:15,093 --> 00:00:18,631
I have four options for you in how to implement this association, and

7
00:00:18,631 --> 00:00:22,230
I'd like you to give me a reason for each one which might be thought of as

8
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:25,250
a disadvantage of that particular approach.

9
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:28,580
The first approach would be a reference in each Student

10
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:31,190
object to a Course the student is taking.

11
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:35,680
Second option is a vector of references to students in each course.

12
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,510
Third is to do a, an association class containing two attributes, one for

13
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:41,380
a Student and the other for a Course.

14
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:45,120
And the fourth possibility is symmetric vectors in Student and, and

15
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,330
Courses pointing back to the other class.
