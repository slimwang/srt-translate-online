00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:01,780
Let's begin with an exercise.

2
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:04,530
We'll use a code example instead of a design example, but

3
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:06,510
the principles of reviewing are the same.

4
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:08,840
The following code is written in Java.

5
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:10,360
It computes the sin function for

6
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:14,070
argument x to accuracy e using a Maclaurin series expansion.

7
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:16,910
In the example, line numbers appear in parentheses at the beginning of

8
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:17,570
each line.

9
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:21,080
They are not part of the program but are there so we can refer to the lines.
