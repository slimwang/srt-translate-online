1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,350
So let's look at the code that we added.

2
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:04,670
Let's look at the OrderDinnerActivity.

3
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:07,200
See I added the inputs for
the View class.

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,439
I added variables for
the selected Dinner and the DinnerId.

5
00:00:10,439 --> 00:00:14,953
I updated onStart() to store
the selected dinner and

6
00:00:14,953 --> 00:00:17,316
the selected dinner's Id.

7
00:00:17,316 --> 00:00:21,424
I wrote a to-do note for myself,
to re-factor sendViewProductHit,

8
00:00:21,424 --> 00:00:25,900
since it can now get the dinner and
dinner Id out of class fields.

9
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:29,860
I leave you to do that if you like,
it won't change the functionality.

10
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:32,189
It will just make your
code a bit cleaner.

11
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:34,980
Here's the definition for
addDinnerToCart.

12
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:39,000
It takes a single argument of the view
which is passed automatically

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,310
when the user clicks a view
that activates the method.

14
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:44,820
And I just pop up Toast
as a placeholder code for

15
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,250
actually putting the dinner in the cart.

16
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:50,890
And then the method calls
the sendAddToCartHit

17
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:52,850
to send the hit to Analytics.

18
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:57,740
This new method SendAddToCartHit, is
very similar to the sendViewProductHit

19
00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:59,620
method we already defined.

20
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:04,050
So we get the dinner and the dinner Id
from the relevant global variables.

21
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:07,520
Make sure you fix this code if you copy
and paste it from the other method.

22
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:11,670
So here I create the product action,
which is ACTION_ADD.

23
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:12,650
And again, if you copy and

24
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:15,875
paste it from the other method,
make sure you change this.

25
00:01:15,875 --> 00:01:17,319
Then we get the tracker.

26
00:01:17,319 --> 00:01:20,202
We use EventBuilder to build the hit.

27
00:01:20,202 --> 00:01:21,940
We set the category to Shopping steps.

28
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:26,730
We set the action, we set the label to
the selected Dinner, and we build and

29
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:28,280
send the hit.

30
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:33,360
Let's take a quick look at
the layout file, order_dinner.xml,

31
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,530
to make sure the Add to cart button
calls the addDinnerToCart method.

32
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:42,120
So this is the button, and yes it does,
addDinnerToCart, excellent.
