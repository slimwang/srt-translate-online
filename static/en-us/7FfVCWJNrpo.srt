The answers are, when generating a report, probably a

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,520
task queue makes sense. Because that sounds like it

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:09,680
could take awhile. When registering a new user, the

4
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:12,190
user probably immediately want to see that the operation was

5
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:16,160
successful. So the http thread makes sense. When checking

6
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,030
out a shopping cart, probably the http thread as

7
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:22,850
well. Doing photo face recognition, a task queue. That

8
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:25,250
may take a long time to do. And the user

9
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:27,400
probably, doesn't need to see the result immediately.
