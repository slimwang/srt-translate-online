1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,640
I don't think there is a single
process for finding investors.

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:07,965
I like to recommend to entrepreneurs
to stand in luck's way.

3
00:00:07,965 --> 00:00:10,280
They're standing in harm's way,
but standing in luck's way.

4
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:13,800
That means you do things where
good things might happen to you.

5
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:17,080
So perhaps going to a meet up
group around where you live

6
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:20,469
where investors are in a panel or
speaking or someone that's

7
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:25,780
speak about a topic that's interesting
to you because of your domain.

8
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:29,790
So going to those locations, trying to
find them, trying to connect to them,

9
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:33,080
I think that's really
a really good way to do it.

10
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:36,040
Another way is, at least I've
seen other entrepreneurs do it,

11
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,650
is going to alma mater.

12
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:42,370
Maybe finding angel investors or
venture capitalists that share

13
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:45,710
something common with you and one thing
can be they went to the same college.

14
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:48,090
Trying to find ways to
reaching out to them.

15
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:52,960
I think the key is, though, also
finding a warm introduction to them.

16
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,250
The last thing you want to do is
emailing them with no context and

17
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:02,650
with no person that can vouch for
you and or your business.

18
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:05,560
And that is something that you
have to find even before you

19
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:08,240
find the actual investor
that you reach out to.
