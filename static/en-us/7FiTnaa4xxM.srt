00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,240
This first question requires a bit of explanation,

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:05,750
so bare with me here. The goal of

3
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:08,000
this question is to find an app on

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,560
a Play Store that has low ratings. Then, we're

5
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:16,309
going to estimate how much of that low rating

6
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:19,830
came from violated constraints. So the way we're going to

7
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:22,170
do this is by going to the Google

8
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:25,750
Play store. And we're going to find an app with

9
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:28,770
a relatively low review. Let's say below three and

10
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:32,340
half stars. So I just clicked on this app. Looks

11
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:33,800
like it has a review of about three and

12
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,500
a half stars. And notice if I scroll down, I

13
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,520
can see what the actual average rating is. But

14
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:43,754
I can also see were that rating came from. 720

15
00:00:43,754 --> 00:00:47,780
five star reviews, 310 one star, and so on. But

16
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:50,970
beyond that I can also click into the individual reviews.

17
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:53,700
From this page I can look at reviews

18
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:57,640
by Newest, Helpfulness or Rating, which will be especially

19
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:00,520
helpful for this exercise. And then I can

20
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:05,700
read individual reviews. Apparently this person's upset that this

21
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,280
app requires camera and microphone permission. In this

22
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,700
question you're actually going to read a lot of

23
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:13,950
reviews with different star ratings of an app that

24
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:17,200
has an overall pretty low rating. And as you

25
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,920
read you're going to pay attention to how many

26
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:25,250
of these reviews reference violated mobile constraints, as a reason

27
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:27,350
for the low rating. As you read these reviews,

28
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:29,880
you're going to be filling out this table. So the

29
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:33,960
rows represent the number of stars, and this column

30
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:37,590
is the total number of reviews with this star rating.

31
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:39,390
This column is where you'll keep track of the

32
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:42,990
total number of reviews you read with that star rating.

33
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:45,500
So, let's say you had looked at five one

34
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:50,140
star reviews and three those had violated mobile constraints. You're

35
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:52,640
going to go through this table, fill out all of

36
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,350
these fifteen boxes, and at the end when you hit

37
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:58,950
submit, over on the right side here where you

38
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:02,110
get your feed back the apps current rating will be

39
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:04,680
calculated. You should already know that but his will

40
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,310
be a sanity check. It's predicted rating, if no mobile

41
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:10,800
constraints had been violated, will be calculated as

42
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,100
well. Now this prediction is of course a prediction,

43
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:17,250
it's an estimate, and it comes from the assumption

44
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:21,410
that one, the reviews you read were somehow representative

45
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:23,890
of people who gave one star reviews or two

46
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:27,850
star reviews. But, also there are some assumptions baked

47
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:30,280
in about, well, if you'd given it a one

48
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,650
star review and said there was a violated constraint.

49
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,710
You probably would of given it a three or four star review, had

50
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:38,900
there been no constraint violated. You can

51
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,320
read more about those assumptions in the

52
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:44,000
instructor notes, and if you have any questions, I understand this is a

53
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,940
bit of a confusing question, feel free to post them in the discussion forum.
