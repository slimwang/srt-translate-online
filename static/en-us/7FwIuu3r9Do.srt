1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:03,990
It's time for you to start
working on your own weather app.

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:06,120
We've given you a bit
of a head start and

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:11,500
created the basic app shell, styles,
and initial JavaScript for you.

4
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:15,620
See the instructor notes below for
information on how to download and

5
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:18,130
get your development environment set up.

6
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:21,250
Because we'll be working with
a service worker in a bit and

7
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:24,780
service workers do not work when
served from the file system.

8
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:27,935
Make sure that you're working
from a local web server

9
00:00:27,935 --> 00:00:29,920
in your development environment.

10
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,810
See the instructor notes for
some more ways to do this.

11
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:37,820
Service workers must
be served over HTTPS.

12
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:39,531
But to make development easier,

13
00:00:39,531 --> 00:00:42,960
that requirement is waived when
they're served from local host.

14
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:46,010
When you've got everything
setup properly,

15
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:48,030
your app should look like this.

16
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:52,240
Be sure to compare your app in
the link to the instructor notes below

17
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,670
to make sure everything
works exactly the same.
