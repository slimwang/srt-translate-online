1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:04,770
The answers are, people using
merch to promote your game, and,

2
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:07,960
merchandise creates a way to
make money outside your game.

3
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:10,171
I'll also except the first answer,

4
00:00:10,171 --> 00:00:14,505
because the best games often have
fans who want to buy merchandise.

5
00:00:14,505 --> 00:00:17,350
Say someone buys a stuffed
animal of your game and

6
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:20,280
when they walk around with it
other people will see the item.

7
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:24,060
So, it's a good way to get your
app noticed and promote your game.

8
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:26,830
And like we already mentioned,
it creates a way to make money

9
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:30,020
outside of in-app purchases and
ads that are inside the game.
