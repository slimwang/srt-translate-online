Here is a problem that may look slightly more complicated than what we've done

2
00:00:04,262 --> 00:00:08,515
before. But you know everything you need to know to solve it. And I'm even going

3
00:00:08,527 --> 00:00:12,555
to give you the first step that I'd like you to do. I want us to start out by

4
00:00:12,567 --> 00:00:16,835
dividing each side by 3. If you do this first step, then what do you end up with

5
00:00:16,847 --> 00:00:18,485
on either side of the equation?
