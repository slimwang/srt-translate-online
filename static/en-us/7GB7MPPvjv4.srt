1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,648
The only function of these three that has an inverse is this first one. F of x

2
00:00:04,648 --> 00:00:09,292
equals two x to the fifth. Neither this porabala nor this absolute value

3
00:00:09,292 --> 00:00:14,024
function pass the horizontal line test. So neither of them has an inverse. This

4
00:00:14,024 --> 00:00:15,609
function does, however.
