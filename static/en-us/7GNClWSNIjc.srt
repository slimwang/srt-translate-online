1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
To compute this, recall that b equals the sum of the product

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
of the difference of the x's from the mean and the y's from the mean

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
divided by the square difference between x and the mean

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:25,000
So, the mean of the x's is 104, and the mean of the y's is 100.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Now let's write out deviations for each term.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Now for the differences of the y's.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
If we add up the product of these, we get a fairly large number--896,000.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
The denominator is equal to 892,100.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Taking the ratio of these two things gives us our answer of 1.004.

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
This is interesting, because it suggests when we have data like this

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
but add one single point all the way over here,

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:07,000
our best fit line goes from being this to being this.

13
00:01:07,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Now, note this isn't quite to scale. This point would really be all the way over here.
