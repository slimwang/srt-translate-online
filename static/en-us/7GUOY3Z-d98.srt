1
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:04,120
So, I just talked about
the organization of concepts and

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:06,280
the relationship of
concepts with each other.

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:09,330
We only come across this when we were
talking about background knowledge in

4
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:12,130
the previous lesson on
incremental concept learning.

5
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:14,330
So we had a brick and a wedge.

6
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:16,940
They were both subclasses of a block.

7
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:21,060
In general, the organization of
concepts can be much more complex.

8
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:24,190
So here is a set of concepts that
you're probably all familiar with.

9
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:27,467
We have different kind of animals,
vertebrates, intervertebrates.

10
00:00:27,467 --> 00:00:30,666
Vertebrates themselves, can be of
different kinds, reptiles, birds,

11
00:00:30,666 --> 00:00:32,009
mammals, and so on.

12
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:35,350
And here are birds, which can be of
different kinds, eagles, bluebirds,

13
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:38,650
and penguins,
like we saw in the previous slide.

14
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:39,365
And generally,

15
00:00:39,365 --> 00:00:42,690
organization of these concepts
can be a little more complicated.

16
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:47,390
So this is a conceptual hierarchy
that I expect all of your family with

17
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:51,302
the animals of various kinds, water
breeds and in water breeds, for example.

18
00:00:51,302 --> 00:00:54,650
And vertebrates themselves can be
a different reptiles, but mammals and

19
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:58,330
birds can be a different kinds, for
example, eagles, bluebirds and penguins.

20
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:02,000
So these are classes, and
these are sub-classes and super classes.

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,006
Now the advantage of this kind of
conceptual organization is that

22
00:01:07,006 --> 00:01:13,580
I can start going in a top down way
establishing and refining each category.

23
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:16,310
So you see an animal and
you're trying to decide

24
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:19,360
whether the animal is a bluebird or
an eagle or a penguin.

25
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,620
And you may start, initially,
by saying well, is it a vertebrate?

26
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:23,530
Then, is it a bird?

27
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:27,050
And if it is a bird, then is it a eagle,
a bluebird, or penguin?

28
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:30,113
When you and I do processing of
this kind, it might happen so

29
00:01:30,113 --> 00:01:32,350
fast that we might not be aware of it.

30
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:36,410
But, when we try to put an air-agent,
we have to make that processing very,

31
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:37,780
very explicit.

32
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:39,570
Even among humans, imagine for example,

33
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:43,740
what happens when the scientist
discovers new kind of species.

34
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:47,320
Then the scientist can begin from the
top and say, well, is it a vertebrate?

35
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,920
Where exactly in this tree
should I put this species?

36
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,030
Is it a bird?

37
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:52,080
Is it closer to eagle?

38
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:55,180
Should I put it closer to a bluebird,
and so on.

39
00:01:55,180 --> 00:02:00,120
So classification of this kind
often has a top down, establish,

40
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,780
refine, establish,
refine connected to it.

41
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:06,400
>> So one of the benefits of this
establish and refine approach is it

42
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,380
helps us figure out which variables
we need to actually key in on and

43
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:10,680
focus in on.

44
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:13,240
So for example,
we saw earlier that eagles are large,

45
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,650
but bluebirds are small.

46
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:17,120
So birds can come in different sizes.

47
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,850
So if we are trying to establish whether
something is a bird, a reptile, or

48
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:23,642
a mamma, we know that mammals also come
in different sizes like tiny mice or

49
00:02:23,642 --> 00:02:24,330
large elephants.

50
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:27,618
So size doesn't really impact our
decision whether it's a reptile, bird,

51
00:02:27,618 --> 00:02:28,850
or mammal.

52
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:30,620
But once we've established it's a bird,
and

53
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:34,530
we're trying to decide between eagle and
bluebird for example, we know that size

54
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:37,590
actually can be something that helps
us differentiate between to these two.

55
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:40,740
So now we'll pay attention to
size as a variable that matters.

56
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:43,250
>> So note that there are several
things going on here.

57
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:47,770
On one side, there is knowledge of these
different classes, but there's also

58
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:52,720
organization of these different classes
in a hierarchical particular kind.

59
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,125
This organization is very
powerful in some ways.

60
00:02:56,125 --> 00:02:58,805
If knowledge is power,
so is organization.

61
00:02:58,805 --> 00:03:00,425
Organization too is power.

62
00:03:00,425 --> 00:03:02,395
This organization provides power,

63
00:03:02,395 --> 00:03:06,415
because this organization tells you what
the controller processing should be.

64
00:03:06,415 --> 00:03:08,595
Establish one node, refine it.

65
00:03:08,595 --> 00:03:10,305
Establish that node, refine it.
