Welcome to Lesson 6. We're at Android Land here at Google. Why are we

2
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:07,460
at Android Land? Since this course is

3
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:10,570
about building server applications. Well, since we use

4
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:13,290
Cloud Endpoints when we built Conference Central,

5
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:15,645
we now build clients for any kind of

6
00:00:15,645 --> 00:00:20,180
device, Androids, IOS tablets, whatever. And we

7
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:25,600
don't have to change our server application. Hey,

8
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,890
this is Confer Central running on my Android

9
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:30,970
device. I can browse conferences. I can register

10
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:34,360
to attend them. That's super cool. This is

11
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,570
exactly what we will cover in this lesson.
