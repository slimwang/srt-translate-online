1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,380
So, if we're going to run the Car function we just to make sure that it

2
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:05,380
runs in the right context.

3
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:09,260
Luckily, we have a way of running functions in whatever context we choose.

4
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:12,830
The .call method of any function allows us to run that function in

5
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:15,290
exactly the context we want it to.

6
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:18,680
It basically means that the parameter this is going to behave even more

7
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:21,690
similarly to a positional function parameter.

8
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:26,010
Now we just have to decide what value to pass as our first argument so

9
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:28,560
that Car can run in the right context.

10
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:29,700
What do you think we should pass in?
