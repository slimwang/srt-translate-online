1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,091
Allocate, and remember, this is based on scan; we just scan the number of neighbors.

2
00:00:04,091 --> 00:00:07,880
In our example, we begin with the input array of 3 and 1,

3
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:11,715
because vertex 1 has 3 neighbors and vertex 3 has 1 neighbor,

4
00:00:11,715 --> 00:00:14,123
and we scan this array with an exclusive sum scan.

5
00:00:14,123 --> 00:00:17,189
So we get the resulting array 0, 3.

6
00:00:17,189 --> 00:00:20,965
Node 1 knows to start writing its edge list at offset 0.

7
00:00:20,965 --> 00:00:24,970
Node 3 knows to start writing its edge list at offset 3.
