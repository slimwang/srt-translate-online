1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,665
Operating systems support
devices via device drivers.

2
00:00:03,665 --> 00:00:08,620
Here's a chart that shows where device
drivers sit with respect to the rest of

3
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:12,320
the operating system and
the actual hardware they manage.

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,570
Device drivers are device-specific
software components.

5
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:20,570
And so, the operating system has
to include a device driver for

6
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:26,490
every type of different hardware devices
that are incorporated in the system.

7
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:31,170
Device drivers are responsible for
all aspects of device access,

8
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:32,790
management, and control.

9
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:36,950
This includes logic that determines
how can requests be passed from

10
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:41,830
the higher levels of the system software
applications to the actual device,

11
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:45,650
how can the system respond to
device-level events like errors, or

12
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:49,400
response notifications, or
other status change information.

13
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,270
Or in general,

14
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:55,920
any device-specific details regarding
the device configuration or operation.

15
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:01,300
The manufacturers or the designers of
the actual hardware devices are the ones

16
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:06,130
that are responsible for making sure
that their device drivers available for

17
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:10,060
the different operating systems or
versions of operating systems

18
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:13,480
where that particular type of
device needs to be available.

19
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:16,368
For instance you may have
had to download drivers for

20
00:01:16,368 --> 00:01:19,230
printers from a manufacturer like HP.

21
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:24,590
Operating systems in turn standardize
their interfaces to a device driver's.

22
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:29,400
Typically this is done by providing some
device driver framework so that device

23
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:34,420
manufacturers can develop the specific
device drivers within that framework,

24
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:38,980
given specific interfaces that
that operating system supports.

25
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:43,450
In this way both device driver
developers know exactly what is expected

26
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:47,890
from the ways the rest of the operating
system will interact with their device.

27
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:52,520
And also the operating system does
not depend on one particular device,

28
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:55,676
one specific device if there
are multiple options for

29
00:01:55,676 --> 00:01:58,510
devices that provide
the same functionality.

30
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:01,540
For instance, for storage you may
have different types of hard disk

31
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:04,220
devices from different manufacturers.

32
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:08,776
Or from networks, you may have different
types of network interconnect cards.

33
00:02:08,776 --> 00:02:12,710
And switching the hardware components
will require switching the device driver

34
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:14,490
but the rest of the operating system,

35
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:17,490
the rest of the applications
will not be affected.

36
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:20,040
So there's standardized
interfaces both in terms of

37
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:24,660
the interaction with those devices as
well as in terms of the development and

38
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:26,950
integration of the device drivers.

39
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:29,960
In this way we achieve
both device independence.

40
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:33,040
The operating system does not
have to be specialized or

41
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,980
to integrate this particular type of
functionality for each specific device.

42
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,790
And also device diversity.

43
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:40,960
It's an easy way for

44
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:45,340
the operating system to support
arbitrarily different types of devices.

45
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:46,990
We just need another device driver.
