00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:04,430
The important thing inheritance provides is a way to use attributes defined in

2
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:08,830
the Base class in the derived class without needing to cut and paste any code.

3
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:12,368
Let's try a simple example to see how this works before getting back to our

4
00:00:12,368 --> 00:00:16,798
Dishes. I hope no one's too hungry. Don't worry. Fried Python is a dish best

5
00:00:16,798 --> 00:00:21,492
served cold. Let's start by supposing we have a Bear class. Which has a

6
00:00:21,492 --> 00:00:25,368
GrizzlyBear as a subtype. Here's the Bear. Don't be put off by its color and

7
00:00:25,368 --> 00:00:29,360
peace symbol. Looks like a peaceful bear. It's actually very violent. And it's

8
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:32,741
got an eat method. It can eat a Human. Let's look at how that looks like in

9
00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:36,364
code. Here's what that looks like in code. We've defined a Bear class, we've

10
00:00:36,364 --> 00:00:40,548
defined a GrizzlyBear with Bear as its base class. We don't actually have any

11
00:00:40,548 --> 00:00:44,309
code in GrizzlyBear . In the bear class we've defined attributes. We got an

12
00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:49,314
initializer that sets the name of the bear and we've got an eat method that eats

13
00:00:49,314 --> 00:00:53,619
a victim. A victim has a name. We'll assume the victim is a Human. So let's see

14
00:00:53,619 --> 00:00:57,667
how that works. I'm going to import from the bear class, the bear, GrizzlyBear,

15
00:00:57,667 --> 00:01:00,916
and Human definitions. I haven't shown you Human, but you should be able to

16
00:01:00,916 --> 00:01:04,470
guess what it is. We need to give the Bear someone to eat. And we'll create some

17
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:08,840
instances of those objects, a Human instance and we'll create a Bear instance.

18
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:13,737
Since Bear has an eat method, the Bear should be able to eat a victim, and

19
00:01:13,737 --> 00:01:18,274
indeed it can. We can also create a GrizzlyBear. We didn't define any attributes

20
00:01:18,274 --> 00:01:22,319
for GrizzlyBear, but it has some. The GrizzlyBear can also eat Dave. It's okay,

21
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:26,452
Dave can be used more than once. And we can look a little more closely at what

22
00:01:26,452 --> 00:01:31,276
these attributes are, so it says that the bound method of the GrizzlyBear object

23
00:01:31,276 --> 00:01:35,956
and the GrizzlyBear object is this one, the Bear object, also has an eat method

24
00:01:35,956 --> 00:01:40,051
and it's of the Bear object. Now, this is an attribute, so we can assign it.

25
00:01:40,051 --> 00:01:43,771
Let's get rid of the eat method for Bear, because our Bear is a nice peaceful

26
00:01:43,771 --> 00:01:48,694
bear. Did that change the eat method for the Grizzly? And it didn't. The eat

27
00:01:48,694 --> 00:01:54,804
method for Grizzly is still there, that method got bound when the GrizzlyBear

28
00:01:54,804 --> 00:02:00,820
instance was created and the GrizzlyBear can still eat Dave as many time as he

29
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:01,434
wants.
