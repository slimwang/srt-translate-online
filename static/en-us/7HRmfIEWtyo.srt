00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:03,535
Now, even though there are limits to what IQ tests can tell you, they're widely

2
00:00:03,535 --> 00:00:08,455
used and can be pretty useful especially for educators. The popularity of IQ

3
00:00:08,455 --> 00:00:13,860
tests have been able to give us extensive knowledge of the range of IQ scores.

4
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:17,924
Let's look at what IQ scores look like for the entire population. IQ scores are

5
00:00:17,924 --> 00:00:23,124
converted to have a mean of 100. Now the standard variation around the mean is

6
00:00:23,124 --> 00:00:28,670
15 points. This standard variation is called the standard deviation. This show

7
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:32,465
how much the score varies from the mean. So, the mean would be 0 because

8
00:00:32,465 --> 00:00:38,268
there's no difference. 15 points one way would be one standard deviation. Two

9
00:00:38,268 --> 00:00:42,445
standard deviations and three standard deviations. Same with the other way. One

10
00:00:42,445 --> 00:00:45,370
standard deviation from the mean, two standard deviations from the mean, and

11
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:50,117
three standard deviations from the mean. 68% of the population is within one

12
00:00:50,117 --> 00:00:56,338
standard deviation from the mean. So 68% of the population has an IQ score

13
00:00:56,338 --> 00:01:03,188
between 85 and a 115. Now, 95% of the population is within two standard

14
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:10,346
deviations from the mean. So 95% of the people you know score between 70 and a

15
00:01:10,346 --> 00:01:16,174
130 on an IQ test, and 99.7% of the population scores within three standard

16
00:01:16,174 --> 00:01:26,775
deviations of the mean. So between 55 and 145. Now, as you can see, with 99.7%

17
00:01:26,775 --> 00:01:31,875
of the population scoring within three standard deviations in either direction

18
00:01:31,875 --> 00:01:36,450
of the mean, that doesn't leave a lot of room for people to score above a 145

19
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:43,730
or below a 55. It's only about 15 out of 1,000 people score higher or lower

20
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:49,162
than either one of these two extremes. We also did an example like this in

21
00:01:49,162 --> 00:01:52,650
lesson two, the research methods lesson. You should go back and check it out if

22
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:57,194
this is a little confusing. Now traditionally, those who have extreme IQ scores

23
00:01:57,194 --> 00:02:02,588
are given labels. Such as a genius who scores above 140 on an IQ test because

24
00:02:02,588 --> 00:02:09,050
not a lot of the population scores that high. Or intellectually disabled, those

25
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:12,884
who score less than 70 on the IQ test because again, not a lot of the

26
00:02:12,884 --> 00:02:16,199
population score that low.
