00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,149
welcome to the first module here you're

2
00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:04,620
going to learn how to use one of the

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:06,839
most exciting tools and self-driving car

4
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:09,750
development deep neural networks at the

5
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:11,730
end of this module you'll create a

6
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:13,410
project that demonstrates real-world

7
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:15,660
application of the skills you need to

8
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:17,278
become a self-driving car engineer

9
00:00:17,278 --> 00:00:19,769
that's right in the project you'll train

10
00:00:19,769 --> 00:00:21,510
a deep neural network to drive a car in

11
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:23,550
a simulator first you'll drive and

12
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:25,739
record training laps and simulation and

13
00:00:25,739 --> 00:00:26,969
then you'll build and train a deep

14
00:00:26,969 --> 00:00:28,559
neural network that learns from the way

15
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:31,559
you drive a deep neural network is just

16
00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:34,409
a term that describes a big multi-layer

17
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:37,710
neural network and a neural network is a

18
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:39,359
machine learning algorithm that you can

19
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:41,670
train using input like camera images or

20
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:44,100
sensor readings and generate output like

21
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:45,600
what steering angle the car should take

22
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,520
or how fast it should go

23
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,109
the idea is that the neural network

24
00:00:49,109 --> 00:00:51,119
learns from observing the world you

25
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:52,890
don't have to teach it anything specific

26
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:55,229
deep learning is just another term for

27
00:00:55,229 --> 00:00:57,329
using deep neural networks to solve

28
00:00:57,329 --> 00:00:59,340
problems and it's become really

29
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:02,128
important for self-driving cars but deep

30
00:01:02,128 --> 00:01:03,750
learning is relatively new until the

31
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,640
last few years computer simply weren't

32
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,290
fast enough to train deep neural

33
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:09,060
networks effectively now however

34
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,519
automotive manufacturers can apply deep

35
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:13,260
learning techniques to drive cars in

36
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:15,900
real time because deep learning is so

37
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,969
new automotive engineers and researchers

38
00:01:17,969 --> 00:01:20,310
are still experimenting with just how

39
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:22,739
far it can take us but deep learning has

40
00:01:22,739 --> 00:01:24,780
already were revolutionize segments of

41
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,759
autonomous driving like computer vision

42
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:29,159
and it has the potential to entirely

43
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:30,868
change the way we develop self-driving

44
00:01:30,868 --> 00:01:36,228
cars
