Now that you've gotten some practice with multiplying rational expressions,

2
00:00:03,796 --> 00:00:07,661
let's move on to dividing rational expressions. And instead of diving right into

3
00:00:07,661 --> 00:00:11,504
dividing rational expressions, let's start with what we know, dividing

4
00:00:11,504 --> 00:00:15,607
fractions. If we want to divide by a fraction, we really multiply it by the

5
00:00:15,607 --> 00:00:20,400
reciprocal of that fraction. So three-sevenths divided by two-sevenths would be

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,303
three-sevenths times seven-halves. We cancel the factors in the numerator,

7
00:00:25,303 --> 00:00:29,633
denominator which leaves us with three halves. We divide rational expressions

8
00:00:29,633 --> 00:00:33,710
the same way that we divide fractions. We're going to change division to

9
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:38,004
multiplication and multiply by the reciprocal. So try doing this rational

10
00:00:38,004 --> 00:00:42,227
expression problem. Change the division to multiplication and multiply by the

11
00:00:42,227 --> 00:00:47,070
reciprocal of this fraction. Make sure you find the cube of 2t before you

12
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:51,153
multiply. When you think you've got it, write your answer as a fraction here.
