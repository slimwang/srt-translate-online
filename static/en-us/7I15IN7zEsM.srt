1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,050
So the first statement is clearly true, and we talked about this a couple of times

2
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:04,400
in this unit.

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,350
If you know the state of the deterministic RAM,

4
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:08,320
that means you know whats in the memory

5
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,160
and where the program is currently executing,

6
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:14,500
then you can easily tell what the machine will do as a next step.

7
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,230
The second one is of course not true,

8
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:18,040
because we have the if-better function, and so

9
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:21,810
if we know the state of a non deterministic RAM at time point t,

10
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:24,780
and at that point in time, we call the if-better function,

11
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:27,110
then we can not say what the state will be

12
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:28,410
at time t plus 1.

13
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:31,820
There are basically either the first part of the code is executed

14
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:34,260
or the second part of the code is executed.

15
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:36,480
And this gives us the answer for

16
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,230
the last 3 statements here,

17
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:40,510
so this one here is false, because a non deterministic RAM

18
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:42,470
does not behave like a deterministic RAM,

19
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:44,940
but there is actually only one case where it does this,

20
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:47,220
and that is when if-better is called,

21
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:49,220
so this statement here is true,

22
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:52,690
and when the if-better is called, there can not be any number of next states.

23
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:54,240
There can only be 2,

24
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:57,140
because you'll remember, the if-better function works as follows.

25
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:00,090
You call if-better, then there's some code here,

26
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:02,620
and then you have an else statement, and there's some code here.

27
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:04,269
Then there's only 2 possibilities,

28
00:01:04,269 --> 00:01:06,060
so it's not any number of states;

29
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,420
it is actually just 2,

30
00:01:08,420 --> 99:59:59,999
so this is also false.
