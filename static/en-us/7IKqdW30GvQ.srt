00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:01,778
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,778 --> 00:00:04,800
Today I'm going to talk to you about
a question you might be faced with in

3
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:05,900
an interview.

4
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:08,090
Please tell me about a problem or

5
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:11,570
challenge you encountered and
how you dealt with it.

6
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:16,239
So how I would respond to that
question is in a previous company,

7
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:20,760
we had a particular challenge
where we had a large user base.

8
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:27,473
And a large portion of that user
base were our very loyal users and

9
00:00:27,473 --> 00:00:33,194
they were frustrated because
we would iterate quickly

10
00:00:33,194 --> 00:00:41,174
on the UI that they had to interact with
on a daily basis with their students.

11
00:00:41,174 --> 00:00:44,315
So we brought together
a cross functional team,

12
00:00:44,315 --> 00:00:47,918
someone from marketing,
product, engineering, and

13
00:00:47,918 --> 00:00:53,300
the support team to sort of discuss how
we would go about approaching this.

14
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:59,210
A lot of great ideas came out
of that collaboration, and

15
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:04,810
what we found was we had another
challenge that was somewhat similar.

16
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:09,490
Because metallurgy user base,
our support team at the time was

17
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:13,380
only about 20, 25 people and
it was difficult for

18
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:17,320
them to keep up on the demand especially
when we released the a project product.

19
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:22,330
A lot of questions would come in and
a lot of challenges a lot of bugs and

20
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:23,419
do it over though the team.

21
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:29,320
So what we ended up doing was
putting together a program where we

22
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:34,400
sort of deputized our teachers,
the most loyal teachers, and

23
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:39,060
gave them some insight into our
product development process.

24
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:44,030
And would give them first look at
our product before it was released.

25
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:47,630
Now, we wouldn't give them access to
that product until we were confident it

26
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:50,900
was 90, 95% out of the way there.

27
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:55,190
And that it would be released for
three or four weeks.

28
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:57,680
So when this did was it

29
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,605
allows those loyal users to feel
a part of the development process.

30
00:02:02,605 --> 00:02:07,225
It also gave them enough information
ahead of time that they could figure out

31
00:02:07,225 --> 00:02:11,615
strategic ways they can incorporate
the new design into their workflow.

32
00:02:11,615 --> 00:02:16,236
And in turn they can share
those ideas with teachers that

33
00:02:16,236 --> 00:02:20,761
might be facing similar
frustrations when the product

34
00:02:20,761 --> 00:02:24,616
would be released into
the general user base.

35
00:02:24,616 --> 00:02:29,205
We also incentivize them,
we gave them some swag,

36
00:02:29,205 --> 00:02:34,009
we gave them some opportunities
to contribute in very

37
00:02:34,009 --> 00:02:39,133
specific meet up type groups
that we would have online and

38
00:02:39,133 --> 00:02:44,280
we started the program with
about 30 to 50 teachers.

39
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,340
I think it was 50 teachers.

40
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:49,750
And during that first year and
I believe now today they

41
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:53,930
have over 150 teachers that are in
that program all over the world.

42
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:59,180
So we are able to have those teachers
respond to support questions.

43
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:02,330
We have those teachers able to alert.

44
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:05,796
The teachers in their communities and
in their schools and

45
00:03:05,796 --> 00:03:08,320
their online communities.

46
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:12,320
About potential on changes to the
product and how it would affect them.

47
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,242
It was quite an effective program.

48
00:03:14,242 --> 00:03:19,482
I think we are user base grew
even more because of it, and

49
00:03:19,482 --> 00:03:27,120
it really allowed our users to feel like
they were a part of this larger team,

50
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:32,960
this larger effort, that was working
hard to put together a quality product.

51
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:38,894
They exhibited tremendous
ownership of the product, and

52
00:03:38,894 --> 00:03:44,318
felt very defensive if someone
would attack it without a cause.

53
00:03:44,318 --> 00:03:49,570
Very successful program and
a very successful collaboration

54
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:54,700
amongst not only my team but
with the users as well.

55
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:59,760
And so, I think the product today
is a lot better because of it.

56
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,300
So that's how I'd answer that question.

57
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:05,650
Good luck and see you soon.
