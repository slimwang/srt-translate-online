1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:04,590
So the answer is that the post-processor

2
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:09,100
in a directory named by the variable
.Provider inside curly braces.

3
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:13,650
And the extension for the final artifact
is box, because it's a virtual box.

4
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:14,150
Box.
