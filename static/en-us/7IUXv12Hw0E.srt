00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:04,130
We've covered a handful of new
concepts related to networks, so

2
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:07,490
let's take a second to make
sure we remember what's what.

3
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:11,438
For each term listed here, I want you to
match it with the correct description.

4
00:00:11,438 --> 00:00:16,360
The description's are an HTTP request
where a client requests a specified

5
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:22,650
resource from a server, another term for
the type of HTTP request specifies

6
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:27,450
a location for retrieving data over the
network, a number returned in response

7
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:31,350
to a HTTP request that indicates
the results of the request, and

8
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:36,020
finally, the role that an iPhone plays
is accessing data from the network.

9
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:39,310
For example,
it's downloading images from Facebook.

10
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:41,410
Now for each description,
match the number for

11
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:42,970
the term that correctly describes it.
