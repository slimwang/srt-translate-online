00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,687
Today we'll learn how to
build a great Android TV app.

2
00:00:02,687 --> 00:00:06,647
Android TV is just Android
on a new form factor.

3
00:00:06,647 --> 00:00:09,441
So, if you're all ready proficient
with Android development,

4
00:00:09,441 --> 00:00:11,182
your existing skills will still apply.

5
00:00:11,182 --> 00:00:14,056
First, we'll work through
a starter project and

6
00:00:14,056 --> 00:00:16,800
explain how the key pieces work,
step by step.

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,023
Next, we'll apply these concepts
that we've learned by enhancing

8
00:00:21,023 --> 00:00:24,153
the mobile version of
the universal media player to

9
00:00:24,153 --> 00:00:27,224
also run on the TV form
factor in the very same APK.

10
00:00:27,224 --> 00:00:30,228
Here's how the universal media
player looks when we start and

11
00:00:30,228 --> 00:00:32,142
here's how it looks when we're done.

12
00:00:32,142 --> 00:00:33,756
How cool is this?

13
00:00:33,756 --> 00:00:36,659
It's complete with high
quality animations and

14
00:00:36,659 --> 00:00:38,363
a responsive cinematic UI.

15
00:00:38,363 --> 00:00:41,150

16
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:44,320
To build our app, we're going to
leverage the Leanback Support Library.

17
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,749
The Leanback Library is so
easy to use and so

18
00:00:46,749 --> 00:00:50,942
versatile that it's becoming synonymous
with writing Android TV apps.

19
00:00:50,942 --> 00:00:54,450
In fact,
this entire UI was built using Leanback,

20
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:56,991
with very little coding on our part.

21
00:00:56,991 --> 00:01:00,114
That said though,
Leanback is just a library.

22
00:01:00,114 --> 00:01:01,973
You don't have to use it at all.

23
00:01:01,973 --> 00:01:04,897
And you have complete freedom over
how your app looks and feels.

24
00:01:04,897 --> 00:01:08,000
Now, if you have an existing app you'd
like to run on the big screen, it's

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,006
important not to reuse the same activity
layout that you already have for

26
00:01:11,006 --> 00:01:11,908
phones and tablets.

27
00:01:11,908 --> 00:01:15,434
Although, technically this will
work on Android TV, it'll make for

28
00:01:15,434 --> 00:01:16,698
a poor user experience.

29
00:01:16,698 --> 00:01:19,395
And if you do that,
Timothy Jordan will get angry and

30
00:01:19,395 --> 00:01:21,122
you don't want to see him angry.

31
00:01:21,122 --> 00:01:25,000
In reality, Timothy's a super
nice guy but just to be sure,

32
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,132
your UI should be simple,
cinematic, and fun.

33
00:01:28,132 --> 00:01:30,779
For this lesson,
all you'll need is Android studio.

34
00:01:30,779 --> 00:01:34,945
We'll use a TV emulator to run our
code so everyone can participate.

35
00:01:34,945 --> 00:01:38,881
If you happen to have a real TV device
though, you can use that as well.

36
00:01:38,881 --> 00:01:42,551
In fact, I'd strongly recommend using
a real device instead of an emulator for

37
00:01:42,551 --> 00:01:43,987
developing production apps.

38
00:01:43,987 --> 00:01:45,252
Sound good?

39
00:01:45,252 --> 00:01:47,440
Let's get our app running
on the big screen.
