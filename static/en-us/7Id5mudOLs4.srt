Here's another question, but
it's more of a research question.

2
00:00:03,718 --> 00:00:07,250
In the 1980s,
everyone owned a Rubik's Cube puzzle.

3
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:10,710
The goal was to have all
the same colors on the same side.

4
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:14,180
The levels of the cube could be
twisted on the vertical or horizontal.

5
00:00:14,179 --> 00:00:18,179
How do we design a search algorithm for
Rubik's Cube that guarantees the least

6
00:00:18,179 --> 00:00:21,449
number of moves required to
finish from any starting state?

7
00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:24,919
We'll consider each
quarter turn to be a move.

8
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:27,790
Choose a search strategy most likely
to be part of your algorithm.
