1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:05,060
So I think it's important for
each co-founder to interview each early

2
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:10,090
employee that walks through the door
in the first few months of the company.

3
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:15,690
You want everybody to be aligned
that this new hire is good,

4
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:18,600
not only for the business, but
for the company's culture.

5
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,100
There's no one way of testing for
the culture.

6
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:21,920
It's really a feel.

7
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:27,220
But I think there's very specific ways
to test on the professional side.

8
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:28,500
But on the cultural side,

9
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,950
it's making sure that that person
is aligned with what you do.

10
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:36,600
So asking them about their experiences
in previous places of work,

11
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,850
the work they've had,
what they liked and disliked.

12
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:42,510
What are they looking for
in terms of a job, right?

13
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:46,220
Those are the things that
you need to be ask for

14
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:50,960
and then I think overspending
time with that person is key.

15
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,244
Don't just make quick hires because you
need somebody to walk through the door,

16
00:00:55,244 --> 00:00:57,963
you spend an hour,
looks good, let's get going.

17
00:00:57,963 --> 00:01:01,496
Actually, spend more time
than you thought originally,

18
00:01:01,496 --> 00:01:04,388
especially in the early
days of your startup.

19
00:01:04,388 --> 00:01:08,170
Because you want to make sure that
person is right for the type of business

20
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:10,880
you're building, not just
professionally, but culturally as well.
