1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So congratulations--you've now built a search engine.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
You've got all of the components that you need for a search engine.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
You've got a way to collect a corpus,

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
using a Web crawler that you built in the first 3 Units.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
In Units 4 and 5, you figured out--

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and hopefully understood--how to build the index

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
and then how to make it faster in Unit 5.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
And in Unit 6--what we've just finished--

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
you figured out how to rank the results.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
There's one little bit left:

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
we haven't used those ranks,

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
so one of the questions on your homework

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
will be using the ranks to get the best result.

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
If we want to get the best result, just having the dictionary ranks

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
is not enough--we need to use that to find

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
the result that matches the query that has the best rank.

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
And that's one of the questions that you'll do on the homework for this Unit.

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
There are a lot of other hard problems.

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
So you have a few problems left to solve

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
before you can build a search engine that will compete with Google.

21
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Probably the hardest one: you've got to come up with a name.

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
This is really hard.

23
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
You could try "Yoogle",

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
You could try "DuckDuck Find".

25
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
None of those really work--you'll have to come up with a better name,

26
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
and this is a pretty tough problem.

27
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Make sure to also talk to your Trademark lawyers.

28
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Another thing you'd like to be able to do

29
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
is actually get your search engine on the Web

30
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
so other people can send queries to it.

31
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
That's not something we're going to cover in this class,

32
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
but if you take the Web Applications course

33
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
that will start shortly after this class finishes,

34
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
you'll learn a lot about how to build

35
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Web applications and be able to do that.

36
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
So congratulations--you've reached the end of Unit 6.

37
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
And this is actually the last technical content

38
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
that will be in this course.

39
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Unit 7 will get you ready for the final exam and will give you

40
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
some interesting examples of using Computing in Context.

41
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
So congratulations. You've now finished building a search engine

42
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
and it actually does Page Ranking

43
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
better than any search engine that existed before 1998.

44
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
That's quite amazing.

45
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I first want to also congratulate David for getting you to this point.

46
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I think that's quite amazing and, honestly, he's put a lot of

47
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
sleepless nights into thisl.

48
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
But also, i want to tell you: you guys are my heroes.

49
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
You got to a point where you reached something, I think,

50
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
really significant in this class--you actually learned how to--

51
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
And you programmed your own search engine.

52
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Now, I have to say--I'm a little bit jealous.

53
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
When I was a student at college,

54
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
there was no search engines, and there wasn't even

55
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
and ability for me to learn all this stuff.

56
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
As for you, you've been afforded the ability to learn all this stuff.

57
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
But then you really got an amazing speed here.

58
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
That's something really, really significant.

59
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I hope--I mean, if you keep up that speed

60
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
and keep improving yourself with that same speed and learn new things--

61
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
maybe in 3 or 4 years you are the next Google.

62
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
That would be really amazing.

63
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Well, I think you're definitely on track to doing that,

64
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
and I hope you'll take some of the courses that we'll start offering,

65
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
as 200 available courses and more advanced courses later.

66
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
This is the end of Unit 6--we're not going to have

67
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
any more technical content to the course.

68
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Unit 7 is going to be all field trips and interviews,

69
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
giving you some idea of how the things that you've learned in class

70
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
fit into Context--and that should be a lot of fun.

71
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
The other thing that you'll have, as part of Unit 7,

72
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
is the final exam.

73
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
And I hope everyone enjoys Homework 6

74
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
and will be ready for the final next week. >>And I hope you enjoy the final exam.
