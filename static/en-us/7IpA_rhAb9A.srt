1
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:09,610
As I said, my name is Spencer Rugaber
and I have been with Georgia Tech for

2
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:10,470
25 years.

3
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:14,120
Before that I was an industrial software
developer, both for big companies like

4
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:18,560
Bell Laboratories in Spery, and for
a startup called Interactive Systems.

5
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,000
Since coming to Georgia Tech I have also
worked closely with industry Both for

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,970
the large telecommunications vendor,
and with several startup companies.

7
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:29,380
Throughout I have tried to combine
academic software engineering theory

8
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:31,820
with everyday industrial practice.

9
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:35,630
I am the developer of CS 6310,
and have taught it many times,

10
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:39,190
both on site in Atlanta, and
remotely in Korea, and France.

11
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:41,130
I also participated in the planning and

12
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:44,560
development of other software
insuring courses here at Georgia Tech

13
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:48,110
including the course on software process
that is part of the ahms program.

14
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:51,830
And other courses on software
generation and software requirements.

15
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:54,280
One thing that characterizes
these courses,

16
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,980
is their emphasis on learning by doing.

17
00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:00,540
Particularly for design, no amount of
academic knowledge can make up for

18
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:04,140
the hard won experience of
actually building things.

19
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:07,730
You will have that opportunity in
the project portion of this course.

20
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:10,720
You can have a look at my teaching
philosophy by following the link

21
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,310
in the instructor notes for this lesson.

22
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:15,970
I now want you to meet Jarrod Parkes.

23
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:20,010
You will see him in some of the lesson
videos acting as a typical student,

24
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:23,410
trying to solve the exercises and
asking questions that arise.

25
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:26,050
Jarrod, can you tell us
a little about yourself.

26
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:29,220
>> Absolutely, as Spencer said
my name is Jarrod Parkes and

27
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:31,990
I'll be working with you and
Spencer throughout this course.

28
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:34,670
In terms of software experience I've
worked in a number of different

29
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:36,340
places in my career.

30
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:38,400
I've worked in
a telecommunications company and

31
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,590
there I tested and programmed new
features for dsl routing equipment.

32
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:45,630
I've also programmed a number of
small video games and prototypes for

33
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:47,140
the biotech community.

34
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:51,070
And I own a web and mobile development
company with my twin brother, James.

35
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:51,620
More importantly,

36
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:55,230
though, is I want to help Spencer bring
a new, exciting feel to this course.
