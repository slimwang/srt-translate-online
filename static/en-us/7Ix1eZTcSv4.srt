00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:04,429
Since the launch of Android Jelly Bean,
notifications can take up to

2
00:00:04,429 --> 00:00:07,759
three action buttons,
which appear in the notification itself.

3
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:10,759
Each action button can launch
a different pending intent and

4
00:00:10,759 --> 00:00:12,669
perform different actions on your app.

5
00:00:12,669 --> 00:00:17,039
Even though actions are optional, you
should at least set the notification to

6
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,890
allow the users to launch the app so
that they can look at the event that

7
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:23,640
caused this notification to
show up in the first place.

8
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,469
To add actions to a notification,
you call

9
00:00:26,469 --> 00:00:30,979
the addAction as many as three times
when creating the notification builder.

10
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:36,361
The addAction method takes an input
parameter of type Notification.Action.

11
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:41,309
To create such an action, you post in
an image resource, the label text and

12
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:44,990
a pending intent that will be fired
when the action button is pressed.

13
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:45,800
Cool, okay.

14
00:00:45,799 --> 00:00:49,579
So let's see how to code these two
action buttons into our notification.

15
00:00:49,579 --> 00:00:52,000
One that will simply dismiss
the notification and

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,750
the other that will increment
the count for us.
