00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:00,990
Welcome back.

2
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:05,380
In this lecture, I'm going to talk
about the concept of coded photography.

3
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:08,790
Recall, again, the whole pipeline
of computational photography.

4
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:12,050
We have illuminated scene
that goes through a series of

5
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:16,230
different processes to be able to
capture the light to generate an image.

6
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:18,410
Now, one concept we looked at was,

7
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:22,080
how do we control different
aspects of this pipeline?

8
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,770
We looked at how to control light,
the illumination sources.

9
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:28,410
We also want to now start thinking about
how we can actually change things inside

10
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:32,910
a camera and the optics and such to be
able to generate newer forms of images.

11
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,830
This leads us to the concept
of coded photography.

12
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:39,720
We actually have looked at some of
these ideas briefly when we talked

13
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:42,300
about the concepts of
epsilon photography.

14
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:45,220
Epsilon photography was when we
basically said, let's take a series

15
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:48,560
of pictures of something,
just different in one parameter.

16
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,190
Now, actually,

17
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:54,370
let's talk about how we can create
those changes in the camera itself.

18
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:57,210
And the whole concept of coded
photography is basically being able to

19
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:01,130
put something in a camera that would
let us capture this information

20
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:03,080
right on the camera itself.

21
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:05,686
And all of the variations that come in,
perhaps,

22
00:01:05,686 --> 00:01:09,387
on things like epsilon photography,
but done on-board on a camera.

23
00:01:09,387 --> 00:01:13,700
We're going to talk about how to modify
cameras to support this in principle and

24
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:15,370
actually what you're learn about is,
again,

25
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:18,400
the whole principle of coded
photography through this lecture
