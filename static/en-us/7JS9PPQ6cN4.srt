1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:06,578
Well, this value here is just a point. It's mu, which is what we already know,

2
00:00:06,578 --> 00:00:13,422
the mean clock score, 37.72 in our last example, plus 1.96. It doesn't really

3
00:00:13,422 --> 00:00:19,122
make sense to add a z score, so this value is not an interval and it doesn't

4
00:00:19,122 --> 00:00:23,180
even make sense. Here, we're getting a little closer because now we have an

5
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:28,698
interval. But as I said before, it doesn't make sense to just subtract a z score

6
00:00:28,698 --> 00:00:33,846
because this is the number of standard deviations away from the mean, so we want

7
00:00:33,846 --> 00:00:38,944
to find the value along the x-axis for this interval. This one looks more

8
00:00:38,944 --> 00:00:44,970
promising. We have our sample mean. And we subtract 1.96 standard deviations,

9
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:50,730
and since the standard deviation is sigma divided by root n that would be this

10
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:56,400
value here, and then if we add 1.96 standard deviations that would give this

11
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:01,077
value here. And that is our confidence interval. So, we found the answer. But

12
00:01:01,077 --> 00:01:05,665
let's explore this one anyway. This one we can't even figure out what it is

13
00:01:05,665 --> 00:01:11,480
because we don't know this population mean after the intervention. So, we're not

14
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:16,740
able to compute this. If you selected this one, then you were pretty close. So,

15
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:17,543
good job.
