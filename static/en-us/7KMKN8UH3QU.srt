1
00:00:05,277 --> 00:00:07,354
Walter, you're up late.

2
00:00:07,354 --> 00:00:10,260
>> I find my mind is most clear when
the moon is in the eleventh house.

3
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:10,971
>> Mm.

4
00:00:10,971 --> 00:00:12,785
Wait, what?

5
00:00:12,785 --> 00:00:14,400
>> So life update.

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,910
I decided that I wanted to
upscale it my current career.

7
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:20,785
So I signed up for Udacity's fortune
teller and future seer nanodegree.

8
00:00:20,785 --> 00:00:22,026
>> Mm, interesting.

9
00:00:22,026 --> 00:00:25,244
Man, I wish that there was some way
that I could see into the future of

10
00:00:25,244 --> 00:00:26,272
ShoppingList++.

11
00:00:26,272 --> 00:00:29,381
With things so up in the air
with the data structure, man,

12
00:00:29,381 --> 00:00:32,043
a little foresight would
be really helpful.

13
00:00:32,043 --> 00:00:34,398
>> Here,
why don't you just take this amulet?

14
00:00:34,398 --> 00:00:37,730
It'll light up prophetic
visions of the future beyond.

15
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:41,080
Just say what you want to see three
times before you go to sleep.

16
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:44,550
>> Walter, this is amazing.

17
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:46,145
Can I keep this?

18
00:00:46,145 --> 00:00:47,480
>> Yeah, sure.

19
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:48,650
I'm on to bigger and better things now.

20
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,990
Now I'm going to go turn
Palter into a frog.

21
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:57,219
>> Yeah, a frog.
