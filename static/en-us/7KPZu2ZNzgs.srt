1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,210
The first one is not really proactive.

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:07,870
The regulation is sort of forcing you
to do something and when you comply,

3
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:10,840
you essentially,
you're reacting to the regulation and

4
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:12,940
doing what they demand that you do.

5
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:17,060
But the other one is Chief Risk Officer
of the company addressing cyber risk

6
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:18,820
regularly at the highest level.

7
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:23,480
And risk and investigation discussed,
I would say that is proactive.

8
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:26,180
Because you do this on a regular basis.

9
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:29,240
And highest level means you do
something to address them as well.

10
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:33,120
So this is proactive versus
reactive that we had discussed
