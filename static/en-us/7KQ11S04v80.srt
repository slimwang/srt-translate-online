We find that for the equation, 5y equals 10x, we can end up with y equals 2x.

2
00:00:05,707 --> 00:00:10,905
And we can change negative 3x plus y plus 2 equals 0, so that instead it reads,

3
00:00:10,917 --> 00:00:16,923
y equals 3x minus 2. I just used the same tools that we used in previous lessons

4
00:00:16,935 --> 00:00:22,045
to isolate y in each equation. So, even if an equation isn't initially written

5
00:00:22,057 --> 00:00:26,535
in the form, y equals mx plus b, as long as its graph is a straight line and, of

6
00:00:26,547 --> 00:00:30,925
course, it's not a vertical line, it can be arranged so it does fit this form.

7
00:00:31,027 --> 00:00:35,520
And, of course, once we get it in that form, it's super-easy for us to find the

8
00:00:35,532 --> 00:00:38,150
slope and the y-coordinate at the y-intercept.
