1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Now, we already learned something really interesting,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
which is the special case of a linear filter.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
We took an image, and we applied a small kernel.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
The application of a kernel is often denoted

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
with a special symbol over here.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
And we received a new image

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
that was slightly smaller, and we don't really worry

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
about the fact that it's smaller.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
There's ways to keep it the same size

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
by assuming everything around the original image is zero.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
But we did receive a new image that was part of the kernel over here.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
And the general math of the new image,

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
for any pixel accorded x and y, is obtained by summing

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
over all layers in the kernel, u and v,

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
of the original image shifted by u and v

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
times the kernel itself.

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Now, this will take some time to digest,

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
but what it really does is it does exactly what we did before.

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
We take our kernel, which in this case might be a 2 x 1 kernel.

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
We go over both of these fields

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
or any number of fields that exists over here.

22
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
We look at the corresponding image field and shift it a little bit.

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
We did this before. We shifted it by 0, 1 pixels.

24
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
We multiply these 2 things.

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
There was a +1 here and a -1 here before.

26
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
And we add all these things up

27
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
to arrive at the resulting image.

28
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Think for a moment to realize that this function over here

29
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
implements what we just did.

30
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
It's a nice and elegant function.

31
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
It's called a linear filter.

32
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
And the reason is the math inside this sum is linear.

33
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
It's a multiplication.

34
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
And so is the sum, and the convolution operation itself

35
00:01:35,000 --> 99:59:59,999
is often called the linear operation.
