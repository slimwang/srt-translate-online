1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:04,750
For this quiz, I'm giving you this
site with these three buttons.

2
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:08,740
I want you to load it on your touch
capable devices, like my phone here, and

3
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:09,895
I want you to do some research.

4
00:00:09,895 --> 00:00:14,030
Eudo just explain until you can use
pseudo-classes to make your your UI feel

5
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:15,765
more reactive.

6
00:00:15,765 --> 00:00:18,825
These three buttons have active,
focus and

7
00:00:18,825 --> 00:00:21,275
hover pseudo-classes applied to them.

8
00:00:21,275 --> 00:00:24,815
When a button is active,
it's background will be Aqua.

9
00:00:24,815 --> 00:00:28,525
When it's in focus,
it's background will be FireBrick and

10
00:00:28,525 --> 00:00:31,995
when it's hover it's
background will be HotPink.

11
00:00:31,995 --> 00:00:33,563
See how the first letters match?

12
00:00:33,563 --> 00:00:39,090
Clever anyway, take a look at this
site on your touchscreen devices and

13
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:39,962
answer this question.

14
00:00:39,962 --> 00:00:45,240
Which pseudo-class does not
get applied on mobile devices?

15
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:48,720
That means,
never gets applied on mobile devices.

16
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:52,800
Does active never show up,
does focus never show up or

17
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,800
does hover never show up?

18
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,830
Take a minute,
play around with the site and

19
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:58,920
then select one of these three answers.
