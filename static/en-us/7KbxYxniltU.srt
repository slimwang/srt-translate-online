1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:04,949
To help us understand this phenomenon
we'll take the help of an old friend,

2
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:06,610
probability theory.

3
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:10,929
It gives us a formal mechanism to
capture uncertainty in the real world.

4
00:00:10,929 --> 00:00:12,929
And lets us make sensible decisions,

5
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:16,030
even when we are not fully
sure about something.

6
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:17,740
>> Since the assignment of cars and

7
00:00:17,739 --> 00:00:21,489
goats is random, it doesn't really
matter which one we pick first.

8
00:00:21,489 --> 00:00:23,949
The chances that car is
behind one of these doors

9
00:00:23,949 --> 00:00:27,160
is the same as the chances that is
behind either of the other two.

10
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:31,109
>> We represent this by saying that the
probability of the car being behind door

11
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:37,909
A, which we denote by P(CarA), is equal
to P(CarB) and that is equal to P(CarC).

12
00:00:37,909 --> 00:00:42,679
Also, we know that one of these
doors surely has the car behind it.

13
00:00:42,679 --> 00:00:43,490
And by convention,

14
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:47,760
the probability of something that is
certainly true is set equal to 1.

15
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:52,920
Therefore, we can say that the sum
of these probabilities equals 1.

16
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,590
>> From these two statements,
we can conclude that

17
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:59,950
each of these doors has a one-third
probability of the car been behind it.

18
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:02,410
This is known as prior probability.

19
00:01:02,409 --> 00:01:05,450
Which is essentially our best
guess given no further evidence.

20
00:01:06,579 --> 00:01:10,149
Now let's say we now pick
door A as our first choice.

21
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:13,480
>> Monty then opens one of
the other two doors, say B,

22
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:18,210
to reveal a goat, which clearly implies
that door B does not have the car.

23
00:01:18,209 --> 00:01:21,329
Here, open B is
an observation we just made.

24
00:01:21,329 --> 00:01:26,739
And the expression, P(CarB) | OpenB,
is known as the posterior probability.

25
00:01:26,739 --> 00:01:30,219
That is our belief after
incorporating an observation, and

26
00:01:30,219 --> 00:01:31,980
in this case it is 0.

27
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:37,130
Now, one way to think about this is
that we have two doors left undisclosed.

28
00:01:37,129 --> 00:01:40,289
So the probability of the car
being behind either one of them

29
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:42,570
should be equal to half, right?

30
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:46,412
>> Wrong, you glossed over the fact
that Monty knowingly open the door with

31
00:01:46,412 --> 00:01:47,950
a goat behind it.

32
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:50,445
He would never reveal
the car at this stage.

33
00:01:50,445 --> 00:01:54,533
>> Ah-ha, so we are actually
interested in finding out the posterior

34
00:01:54,533 --> 00:01:58,906
probability of the car being behind
door C, given Monty opened door B and

35
00:01:58,906 --> 00:02:02,570
the implicit rule that he
would never reveal the car.

36
00:02:02,569 --> 00:02:06,779
>> Correct, we can express this
posterior probability in terms of

37
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:10,729
other quantities that we can
compute using Bayes' Theorem.

38
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:17,080
Here, the first term, P(OpenB) | CarC,
known as the likelihood, must be 1.

39
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:22,090
Because if the car is behind door C,
Monty's only option is to open B,

40
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:24,030
since we already picked A.

41
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:25,300
The second term, P(CarC),

42
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:30,160
is simply the prior, which we
already computed to be one-third.

43
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:33,539
>> And the last term,
known as marginal probability,

44
00:02:33,539 --> 00:02:35,650
is a little tricky to compute.

45
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:38,420
There are three possibilities
we have to consider.

46
00:02:38,419 --> 00:02:42,239
The car could be behind door A which
happens one-third of the time.

47
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:46,930
And in this case, Monty could open
either of B or C with equal probability.

48
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:49,949
Therefore, P(OpenB) |
CarA would be half.

49
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:55,090
Note that Monty cannot open door A as
we've picked it as our first choice.

50
00:02:56,199 --> 00:02:58,579
Or, the car could be behind door B,

51
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:01,030
which also happens
one-third of the time.

52
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:03,909
But in this case,
Monty will certainly not reveal it,

53
00:03:03,909 --> 00:03:07,810
therefore P(OpenB) | CarB is 0.

54
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:12,710
Finally, the car could be behind door C,
also one-third of the time.

55
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:15,760
In which case Monty is
forced to open door B.

56
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:19,043
Hence, P(OpenB) | CarC is 1.

57
00:03:20,189 --> 00:03:24,210
>> Let's plug these values back
into our Bayes' rule formulation.

58
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:28,400
As we can see, the probability that
it is behind the other closed door

59
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,030
has increased to two-thirds.

60
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:35,164
And even empirical evaluation indicates
that a consistent switch strategy wins

61
00:03:35,164 --> 00:03:36,840
two-thirds of the time.

62
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:40,793
>> It is fascinating how a careful
characterization of a given situation,

63
00:03:40,793 --> 00:03:42,542
combined with a formal method,

64
00:03:42,542 --> 00:03:45,801
can help us make decisions even
in the face of uncertainty.

65
00:03:45,801 --> 00:03:47,938
