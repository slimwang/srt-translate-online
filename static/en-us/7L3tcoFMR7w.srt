Our next topic in planning is called hierarchical planning.

2
00:00:03,895 --> 00:00:05,500
We'll introduce the idea to you.

3
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:09,758
We'll also introduce the representation called hierarchical task network to you.

4
00:00:09,758 --> 00:00:14,810
HTN for hierarchical task network. To illustrate hierarchical planning,

5
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:18,830
imagine that you are still in the box microworld. Here is the initial state. And

6
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:21,600
here is the goal state. These states are more complicated than any

7
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,800
initial state and goal state that we have encountered so far. So as previously,

8
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,060
we can use partial order planning to come up with a plan to go from

9
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:32,729
this initial state to goal state. Here is the final plan, and as you can see,

10
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:36,220
it's pretty long and complicated, with a large number of operations in them. So

11
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:42,020
the question then becomes, can we abstract some of these operations at a higher

12
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:48,080
level? So that instead of thinking in terms of these slow level move operations,

13
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:51,870
we can think in terms of high level macro operations. And

14
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:56,160
those macro operations will then make the problems space much smaller,

15
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,670
much simpler so that we can navigate it.

16
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:02,950
And then we can expand those macro operators into the move operations.
