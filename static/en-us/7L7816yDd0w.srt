We know if we use 100%, the company will keep it's 200 pairs of shoes. We want

2
00:00:04,988 --> 00:00:09,902
to increase this number. So we need to multiply by a number bigger than 100%.

3
00:00:10,012 --> 00:00:15,024
They want to increase the inventory by 25%. So, we should multiply by 125%. So,

4
00:00:15,036 --> 00:00:19,945
let's actually see this problem worked out. I want to take 125% of the

5
00:00:19,957 --> 00:00:26,245
inventory, so I have 125% of is times the inventory, which is 200 pairs of shoes

6
00:00:26,257 --> 00:00:32,545
from my company. I know percent means divide by 100, so I move the decimal point

7
00:00:32,671 --> 00:00:38,740
2 places to the left. I have 1.25 times 200. When I multiply, I get 250 pairs of

8
00:00:38,752 --> 00:00:46,658
shoes. Okay, this is great. And we can actually make sense of this another way.

9
00:00:46,814 --> 00:00:53,371
We can think of 200 as four 50's. Each 50 is one-quarter, or 25% of 200. If I

10
00:00:53,383 --> 00:01:00,467
want to increase 200 by 25%, I'm going to add another 50. So I have 50 and 50,

11
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:05,640
which is 100. I have another 100, which is 200. And 50 more, which is 250. If

12
00:01:05,652 --> 00:01:11,280
you could reason through percentages like that in your head, that's great. If

13
00:01:11,292 --> 00:01:14,016
not, you can always rely on the math.
