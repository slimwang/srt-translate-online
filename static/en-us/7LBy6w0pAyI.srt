All right, well welcome to computer vision, you know hopefully,

00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:05,930
from the introduction, you feel, inspired to charge through here.

3
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:09,900
And what we're going to do is we're going to start of easy, and and frankly,

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:12,240
we'll get kind of hard towards the end, which is okay,

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,340
because, by the time you get there you'll be, ready to do that.

6
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:19,900

00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:23,360

00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:27,290
