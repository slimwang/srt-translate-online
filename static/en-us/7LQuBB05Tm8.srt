00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:04,348
If there are five rows: the first, third, and fifth would be odd rows, and the

2
00:00:04,348 --> 00:00:09,370
second and fourth would be even rows. But how would we generalize this, to

3
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:13,642
figure this out let's look at a couple more examples. If the total number of

4
00:00:13,642 --> 00:00:19,725
rows was 6, then even rows would be 3 and odd rows would also be 3. If the

5
00:00:19,725 --> 00:00:25,310
number of rows was 7, then odd rows would be 4 and even rows would still be 3.

6
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:30,068
So, it looks like the number of odd rows is something like half of the total

7
00:00:30,068 --> 00:00:37,192
number of rows, but 4 isn't exactly half of 7 over 2. It would be half of 7+1

8
00:00:37,192 --> 00:00:42,541
over 2. What would happen if we added 1 on to this 6 as well. Then we will get

9
00:00:42,541 --> 00:00:48,510
7 over 2, which in Javaland for integers is still 3. For the even rows 6 over 2

10
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:56,150
is 3, that one works. And 7 over 2 is pretty close to 3. In Javaland that's 3.

11
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:58,970
So, if I just divide by 2 and throw away the remainders, it looks like I get

12
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:02,467
the numbers of even rows. If you don't believe me, you can try a few more

13
00:01:02,467 --> 00:01:07,515
examples. So, it looks like the total number of odd rows is the total number of

14
00:01:07,515 --> 00:01:13,682
rows plus 1, over 2, and then drop the decimal. Whereas the number of even rows

15
00:01:13,682 --> 00:01:19,519
is just the total number of rows over 2, and we drop the decimal. There's

16
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:23,285
another way you could calculate the odd rows. You could say that the odd rows

17
00:01:23,285 --> 00:01:28,307
are always the total number of rows divided by two and then you add one if the

18
00:01:28,307 --> 00:01:36,352
total number of rows is odd. So, that would be the total number over 2 plus one

19
00:01:36,352 --> 00:01:45,758
if 7 is odd. And if 7 is odd then 7 mod two would be one. So, total mod 2. Save

20
00:01:45,758 --> 00:01:48,769
these for later. And you could also try this one.
