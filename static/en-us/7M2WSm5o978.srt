I am now asking a hidden markov model question.

2
00:00:03,007 --> 00:00:07,445
In the given, the following hidden markov models with 2 internal states,

3
00:00:07,445 --> 00:00:11,583
with a property of transitioning to either side is 0.5,

4
00:00:11,583 --> 00:00:15,053
and the probability of staying is therefore, 0.5.

5
00:00:15,053 --> 00:00:21,059
This Hidden Markov Model has 2 possible measurements or observations, X and Y.

6
00:00:21,059 --> 00:00:25,263
The probability of observing X and Y depends on what state

7
00:00:25,263 --> 00:00:26,564
the hidden markov model is in.

8
00:00:26,564 --> 00:00:31,833
For A, it's 0.1 for X and 0.9 for Y.

9
00:00:31,833 --> 00:00:36,751
For B, it's 0.8 for X and 0.2 for Y.

10
00:00:36,751 --> 00:00:44,833
Let's assume that the initial probability of distribution at time 0 is 1/2 for either of the 2 states.

11
00:00:44,833 --> 00:00:51,089
I would like to know what's the posterior probability of being A at time 0 given that we observed

12
00:00:51,089 --> 00:00:59,999
X at time 0 and not Y, what's the posterior probability of state A at time 1 given the observation of X at time 0,

13
00:00:59,999 --> 00:01:08,273
and what's the posterior probability of A1 given the observations X at time 0 and X at time 1.

14
00:01:08,273 --> 00:01:12,273
That means two consecutive Xs.
