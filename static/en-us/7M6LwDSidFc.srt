00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:03,430
In future lessons, you can always come back to the examples we went

00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:07,130
over here and use them as inspiration or guidance.

00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:09,130
I'm really excited about this next lesson.

4
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:13,430
Coming up, we will be implementing separation of concerns, for cat clicker.

00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:14,710
Doing it right.

00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:17,920

00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,650
implementation, and our new, well organized implementation.

8
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:24,050
It'll feel really good, so let's do it.

9
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:25,040
I'll see you in the next lesson.
