1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Cheapest first says that we pick the path with

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
the lowest total cost.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
And that would be this path.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
It has a cost of 75 compared to the cost of 118 and 140

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
for the other paths.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
So we get here. We take that path off the frontier,

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
put it on the explored list, add in its neighbors.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Not going back to Arad,

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
but adding in this new path.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Summing up the total cost of that path,

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:40,000
71 + 75 is 146 for this path.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
And now the question is,

13
00:00:41,000 --> 99:59:59,999
which path gets expanded next?
