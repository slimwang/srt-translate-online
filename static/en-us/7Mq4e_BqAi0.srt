1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,820
So thus far, what we've been doing is writing a lot of functions. We generally

2
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:08,360
start by creating an empty Python file.

3
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:11,760
Let's call it some_module.py, in this case. And

4
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:14,840
then we add functions to it. Functions

5
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:18,678
like do.this. And another function, let's call it

6
00:00:18,678 --> 00:00:22,220
do.that, for instance. And, essentially what we're doing

7
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:25,360
is writing code, one line at a time.

8
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:28,790
Almost like a recipe and frankly that technique's

9
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:30,940
been working for us thus far. So, let's

10
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:33,410
continue to use this technique while solving the

11
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:37,200
next programming challenge which is building a movie website.
