1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Unit 5 combines ideas from graph search that we studied in Unit 3 with ideas about computing

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
statistic that we look at in Unit 4 and it puts these tools together to give us the way

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
of finding shortest path in these networks.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Social networks come in many different flavors.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Some of them consist of simple yes/no connections between the individuals in the network

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
but others include more detailed information about the strength of those connections.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
We'll also going to look at approximation algorithms which are key tools

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
for applying algorithms to a very large data seqs like these social networks.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Let's get started.
