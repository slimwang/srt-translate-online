00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:04,740
To build up our understanding of precise specifications, we will use a simple

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:09,920
example. Sorting. Everybody intuitively knows what it means to sort a list.

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:14,100
Everyone that is except the computer. You need to provide a sorting program too.

4
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:18,180
Imagine that we want to specify a program that could sort vectors of integers,

5
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:21,560
in ascending order. Let's name the program sort, and

6
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:26,440
say that it takes an input argument named X, which is a vector of integers.

7
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:29,950
It returns another vector of integers Y, that was a version of

8
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:33,730
X sorted in ascending order. We will begin by using First-order logic.
