1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,183
Brands use Klout to reach out to the influencers for word of mass marketing. So

2
00:00:05,183 --> 00:00:09,246
for example Audi has this test drive campaign that they offer to

3
00:00:09,246 --> 00:00:14,007
influencers in San Francisco. They basically invited all those opinion leaders

4
00:00:14,007 --> 00:00:18,147
in different vectors of the industry to come in and test drive one of this

5
00:00:18,147 --> 00:00:23,106
newest model, and get a sense of how they feel about this new model. That's what

6
00:00:23,106 --> 00:00:28,110
Audi do. And Virgin America for example offered this VIP service for those,

7
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:32,970
who are even just a Klout user, when they come to the airport terminals, they

8
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:37,722
invite those influences over to their VIP lounge, just for all the pros they have

9
00:00:37,722 --> 00:00:42,505
there. Because you know, they think having a Klout score is a good indicator of

10
00:00:42,505 --> 00:00:48,552
you being influential and savvy was this social media thing that's coming up. So,

11
00:00:48,553 --> 00:00:53,158
and people has different ways of using Klout scores across different domains. I've

12
00:00:53,158 --> 00:00:57,884
also heard of some dating sites using Klout score as a signal to match people up.

13
00:00:57,884 --> 00:01:02,918
>> Cool, are there any other ways that you can think of often top of your head. >> Some

14
00:01:02,918 --> 00:01:08,879
CMOs - chief marketing officers uses Klout to just filter their candidates with.

15
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:13,302
Because a lot of the bigger, more traditional companies, when they try to adapt

16
00:01:13,302 --> 00:01:17,397
to their social media era, they're trying to hire someone with social media

17
00:01:17,397 --> 00:01:22,658
background. To be able to help with their branding and, and, and the picture of

18
00:01:22,658 --> 00:01:28,696
their company. And for those jobs, having a Klout score is a must. I've heard. I think

19
00:01:28,696 --> 00:01:33,092
Barrack Obama, the President, has the highest Klout score of 99. And San

20
00:01:33,092 --> 00:01:37,784
Francisco Giants just recently after they won the World's Series, they had

21
00:01:37,784 --> 00:01:43,329
a share that same score for a month. >> Wow, and Justin Bieber? >> Justin Bieber

22
00:01:43,329 --> 00:01:48,870
has a very high Klout score of 92. And a lot of celebrities and media

23
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:53,691
celebrities are a whiz in their range. And but he's one of, definitely one of

24
00:01:53,691 --> 00:01:55,256
the highest Klout score.
