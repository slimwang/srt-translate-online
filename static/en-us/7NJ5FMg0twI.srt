00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,800
Welcome back, in the first two lessons
you learned how to build great inputs.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:07,960
In the last lesson you
practiced building great force.

3
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:11,480
Along the way you probably noticed
that building great experiences for

4
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:15,280
your mobile users has been
a major theme of this course.

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:19,150
>> Yes, and that's because it can be
a lot more difficult to build the really

6
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:21,970
fantastic experience for them.

7
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:24,400
When users choose to
interact with you app,

8
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,450
it should respond to that touch
in intuitive and beautiful ways.

9
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:30,840
And that's what you'll
learn in this lesson.

10
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,520
>> You'll fix a few sites that badly
need your help with some better

11
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:34,630
touch events.

12
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:37,730
And at the end of it you'll be
given this courses project.

13
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:41,320
If you feel like you need more practice
designing websites for mobile, I highly

14
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:44,850
recommend checking out the course called
Responsive Web Design Fundamentals.

15
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:48,130
Which I teach alongside Etos
colleague from Google Pete Lepage.

16
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:50,500
You can find a link to it
in the instructor notes.

17
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:54,760
>> Great, first thing first, I want
you to see why touch events matter.
