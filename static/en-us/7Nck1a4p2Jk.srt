1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,390
The only answer that the RPC
run time can definitely be

2
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:08,570
confident that is the correct
answer is any of the above.

3
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:10,640
As we explained in the previous morsel,

4
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:14,785
any one of these things can be
a possible cause of failure.

5
00:00:14,785 --> 00:00:18,345
Also, hypothetically,
though perhaps not very likely,

6
00:00:18,345 --> 00:00:22,775
it is possible that every one of these
things happened at the same time, and

7
00:00:22,775 --> 00:00:27,825
that's why even all of the above
is one of the possible answers.

8
00:00:27,825 --> 00:00:30,355
So, any of the above is
the only correct answer.

9
00:00:30,355 --> 00:00:33,155
That is the only thing that
the RPC runtime can know for

10
00:00:33,155 --> 00:00:36,065
sure when it sees that
request time back.
