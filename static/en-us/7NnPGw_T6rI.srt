00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,200
Now let's discuss botnet command and
control.

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:06,540
This is the most important
aspect of botnets.

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:11,100
Recall that the definition of botnet
is that a botnet is a network of

4
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:15,630
compromised computers that the botmaster
uses for malicious purposes.

5
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:19,560
Here, by botmaster,
we mean the attacker behind the botnet.

6
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:23,830
Because the botmaster needs to
make use of the network of bots,

7
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:25,800
he needs to communicate with the bots.

8
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,280
In other words, there needs to
be command control, or C&C for

9
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,890
short, from the botmaster to the bots.

10
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:36,130
For example the bot should report to
the botmaster its current status and

11
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:40,260
the bot may be directed by the botmaster
to another site to download

12
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:42,380
the latest malware version.

13
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:47,175
And the bot may receive instructions for
spamming, phishing and DDoS, and

14
00:00:47,175 --> 00:00:49,075
so on, from the botmaster.

15
00:00:49,075 --> 00:00:54,150
In short, we can see that without C&C,
a botnet is not a network, but

16
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:57,175
just a collection of
isolated infected machines.

17
00:00:57,175 --> 00:01:01,055
And as a result, the botmaster
cannot utilize the aggregate

18
00:01:01,055 --> 00:01:03,565
competition of power of
all the bots available.
