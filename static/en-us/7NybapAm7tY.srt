00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:04,193
Psychologists look at stress with two different vantage points. Stress as a

2
00:00:04,193 --> 00:00:09,546
stimulus and stress as a response. First, we have stress as a stimulus. This

3
00:00:09,546 --> 00:00:14,388
looks at stress as the result of a particular stimulus. Here we're saying that

4
00:00:14,388 --> 00:00:19,282
stress is the result of a stressor. In other words, an event that triggers

5
00:00:19,282 --> 00:00:24,190
stress. In the example we discussed earlier, the stressor could be the ten page

6
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:28,178
paper that needs to be written. Another example would be writing a check that

7
00:00:28,178 --> 00:00:30,984
you realize that you don't have the money in your bank account to cover, or

8
00:00:30,984 --> 00:00:35,423
getting in an argument with your roommate, or friend. Any of those things could

9
00:00:35,423 --> 00:00:41,830
be stressors. The idea here, is that a situation causes stress. The other

10
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:46,590
advantage point from which psychologists use stress is stress as a response.

11
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:50,208
Here psychologists look at the physiological changes or reactions that happen

12
00:00:50,208 --> 00:00:54,258
when we encounter a stressful situation. Think of this as what's happening

13
00:00:54,258 --> 00:00:59,270
inside of your body when we're stressed. Here, we'll see things that happen in

14
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:03,110
a body when we experience acute stress, as well as chronic long term exposure

15
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:09,445
to stress. Stress as a stimulus looks at what causes the stress and stress as a

16
00:01:09,445 --> 00:01:15,161
response looks at how the body responds to stress, when we're stressed. But

17
00:01:15,161 --> 00:01:18,200
let's go to Susan to start with examining stress as a stimulus.
