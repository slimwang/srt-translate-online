1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:05,550
So, the first step in training, are developing what's called visual code-words.

2
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:10,870
And, basically the way it works is this, you have some sort of an operator, and

3
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:13,080
we'll talk about interest point operators,

4
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,990
that generate what are called interest points.

5
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:18,610
That is, these are points in the image where reasonable amounts of

6
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:20,030
interesting stuff is happening.

7
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:23,350
And we'll talk about Harris corners and other ways of finding that.

8
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:25,300
What you do is, you take your interest point operator,

9
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:29,270
pull out all the interesting points on a bunch of training images.

10
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:32,830
You collect the little image patch right around those points,

11
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:36,170
you may get hundreds of them, or thousands of them, and then you cluster them,

12
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:38,310
and you use some algorithm for doing a clustering.

13
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:40,980
And when you're all done with those clusters,

14
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:45,770
the centers of those clusters are referred to, as visual code words.

15
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:48,560
So here, you can see all of these images that were

16
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:51,760
taken from something like tires, then they were all clustered, and so

17
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,180
the code word is this little tire piece.

18
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:56,380
Here's a, here is a centered tire, right?

19
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:58,860
This is the piece of a tire, this is a full tire.

20
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:02,400
And there are other kinds of code-words, so these become the little

21
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:06,150
features that we're going to look for in different images.

22
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:09,070
And this, of course, would assume in this particular case, we're looking for

23
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:11,760
cars, we got a bunch of training images on cars.

24
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,120
By the way I should say, all of this is done automatically, okay?

25
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:17,840
So, you're going to see some things that look a little strange in

26
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,160
terms of code-words, well.

27
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,760
It just happened to fall out of the data.

28
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,350
This is not a human doing it.

29
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:24,440
This is telling the system to go ahead and do this.

30
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:31,450
The second thing you do is you take these code words, these are our features.

31
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:33,040
Remember like we had the tire, and

32
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,110
we found everywhere that the tire landed in the image.

33
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:42,170
So what we have here is all of these marks, or these little interest points.

34
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:44,710
And what we do is, for every interest point,

35
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:49,080
we find the feature that seems to look best at that point.

36
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:52,150
So that becomes the label of that point.

37
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:54,960
All right, so remember just the way we had

38
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,540
a label before that said the gradient was horizontal pointing inward, here we

39
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:03,030
have the label is that it's the bottom right-hand corner of a tire, okay?

40
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:06,980
So this is mapping each of the interest points to some particular patch.

41
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:11,660
Finally, what we do is we take each of these little features and

42
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:15,500
we treat them just like we treated those little gradient images, right?

43
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:21,310
We take the patch, we find the displacement vector to the center, and we

44
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:26,950
write down that displacement vector in a table that's indexed by a patch label.

45
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:29,680
So if I find a tire and

46
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,510
it's to the left, which means the displacement vector is to the right.

47
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:34,200
I put down that displacement vector.

48
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,840
If I find a tire to the right which means its displacement vector is to

49
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:42,000
the left, I add that same displacement vector to the table with the entry

50
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,850
of the tire, and that stores all those displacements.
