1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:04,328
So the last type of combine approach that we will discuss and that has seen an

2
00:00:04,328 --> 00:00:07,632
increase in both research and in practice is mindfulness training and

3
00:00:07,632 --> 00:00:13,950
psychotherapy. Specifically, mindfulness based cognitive therapy or MBCT is an

4
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:18,558
approach that combines elements of both cognitive behavioral therapy with

5
00:00:18,558 --> 00:00:23,454
mindfulness meditation to help people with depression for instance, to learn to

6
00:00:23,454 --> 00:00:30,597
recognize and restructure negative thought patterns. This therapy uses both

7
00:00:30,597 --> 00:00:35,008
mindfulness meditation and cognitive therapy to restructure one's thoughts. So

8
00:00:35,008 --> 00:00:38,848
mindfulness meditation develops skills for approaching thoughts in a

9
00:00:38,848 --> 00:00:42,944
non-judgmental way, and enhances people's ability to realize that they are

10
00:00:42,944 --> 00:00:47,168
neither bound nor defined by their thoughts, feelings, and sensations, and to

11
00:00:47,168 --> 00:00:54,330
detect symptoms before they become a problem. So this approach has been used

12
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:57,948
successfully in preventing the relapse in depression, and in addition there's

13
00:00:57,948 --> 00:01:01,512
some research to show that mindfulness based meditation therapy has been used

14
00:01:01,512 --> 00:01:07,346
successfully in treating positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. The

15
00:01:07,346 --> 00:01:10,262
idea here is that this therapy can be used by teaching people with

16
00:01:10,262 --> 00:01:13,718
schizophrenia to learn to live more easily with their symptoms, and to not be

17
00:01:13,718 --> 00:01:18,799
defined or controlled by them. One new approach focuses on changing the

18
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:22,417
relationship that people have with the voices in their heads rather than trying

19
00:01:22,417 --> 00:01:27,425
to make those voices go away. Some early studies have shown that this technique

20
00:01:27,425 --> 00:01:31,151
results in less distress and improved functioning after training in mindfulness

21
00:01:31,151 --> 00:01:35,970
meditation. So if you're interested in trying meditaion, take a look in the

00:01:40,501 --> 00:01:42,585
mindfulness meditation.
