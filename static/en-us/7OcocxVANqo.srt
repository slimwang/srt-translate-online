1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
And this was an easy one.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
All we take is the function variance(data)

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
and pass it into the square root and return the result in standard deviation,

4
00:00:09,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and this gets us the correct solution.
