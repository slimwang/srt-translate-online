00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:04,490
In this lesson, the objectives are for us to now get a little bit more deeper

2
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:08,500
into understanding of how we can do simple image processing and filtering.

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:11,735
One of the things I'll be introducing you to today would be the concept of

4
00:00:11,735 --> 00:00:15,330
cross-correlation that I've actually already introduced in previous lecture.

5
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:20,260
But now I'm going to try to define it much more accurately and mathematically.

6
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:23,880
Using that concept, we will look at the whole concept of convolution and

7
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:26,735
the relationship between convolution, and

8
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:29,920
cross-correlation will also be introduced in this lecture.

9
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,670
I will also describe some of the properties of how these types of methods can be

10
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:38,160
used to do filtering types of processes that we won't actually do to be able to

11
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,710
do computer vision and image processing on images.
