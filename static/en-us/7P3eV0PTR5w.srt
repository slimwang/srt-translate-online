00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:01,500
Hey, welcome back.

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:03,050
So while you were taking a break,

3
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:06,700
our designer provided us updated designs
of what the app should look like.

4
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:07,200
And here they are.

5
00:00:08,586 --> 00:00:10,430
We could leave the app as is, but

6
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:13,578
as it stands,
the audio feature is hard to discover.

7
00:00:13,578 --> 00:00:16,059
Now, we want to provide
some indication to the user

8
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:17,870
that the list items are clickable, and

9
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:20,900
that by clicking it, they can here
the pronunciation of each word.

10
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:23,290
So our designer provided these designs.

11
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:26,690
And notice that each list item
now displays a play arrow icon

12
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:28,750
to indicate that the item is clickable.

13
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:29,639
So in this task,

14
00:00:29,639 --> 00:00:33,535
you will make your version of
the Miwok app look like these designs.

15
00:00:33,535 --> 00:00:35,715
I'd like you to add
the play icon to the app.

16
00:00:35,715 --> 00:00:39,275
Our designer also requested that
the icon be 24 dps by 24 dps,

17
00:00:39,275 --> 00:00:43,585
have it be vertically centered
within the list item and

18
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:47,045
also position 16 dps from
the right edge of the screen.

19
00:00:47,045 --> 00:00:50,315
Now, as a heads out, you might need to
make some significant changes to your

20
00:00:50,315 --> 00:00:52,385
layout in order to make
this new layout work.

21
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:55,060
So as for the icon,

22
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:58,730
you can download it from this free
library of material design icons here.

23
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:02,220
So this library was created by
the Google design team for you to use

24
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:05,840
in your own apps in order to comply
with the material design guidelines.

25
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,560
So this is a valuable resource if you
want to go on to create other apps but

26
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,880
don't have a designer to
create icons for you.

27
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,500
Now, if you scroll down
here to the AB section,

28
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,230
there's a play icon that we can use.

29
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:18,160
So click on it, and
it will give you options for

30
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:20,030
how you can download the icon.

31
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:23,210
So you want to choose the 24
dp version of the icon

32
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:24,960
as requested by your designer.

33
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,920
Then, I want to choose the white version
as opposed to the black version, and

34
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,280
then download PNGs.

35
00:01:31,336 --> 00:01:34,860
So the file is downloaded as
a zip file onto my desktop, and

36
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:36,830
then I unzipped it right here.

37
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:38,080
So let's open that up.

38
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:42,190
So we got different versions of the app,
so let's open up the Android folder.

39
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:46,220
So we organize these Java folders for
the various density buckets.

40
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:48,810
Now, inside this drawable HDPI folder,

41
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:51,830
we have the HDPI version
of the play arrow.

42
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:54,220
Now, I'd like you to go into
each of these folders and

43
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:58,360
copy over the image into your version
of the MiWok app in Android Studio.

44
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:03,197
So that means the HDPI icon goes into
the existing drawable HDPI folder in

45
00:02:03,197 --> 00:02:03,842
our app.

46
00:02:03,842 --> 00:02:09,172
The drawable MDPI icon goes into the
drawable MDPI folder in Android Studio,

47
00:02:09,172 --> 00:02:10,490
and so on and so on.

48
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:14,033
And you can also rename the file as
well so that they have a shorter name.

49
00:02:14,033 --> 00:02:18,970
So something like ic_play_arrow.

50
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:20,930
Remember where ic stands for icon.

51
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:25,300
Now, remember that we should include all
versions of the assets in our app so

52
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:28,478
that the icon doesn't appear
blurry on certain devices.

53
00:02:28,478 --> 00:02:29,860
And once you're done with this tasks,

54
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:31,570
I'd like you to check
this box to continue.
