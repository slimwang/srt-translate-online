1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,040
To solve this first equation, we can subtract 1 from both sides and get 2x

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:08,520
equals 3x minus 6. Next, we can subtract negative 2x from both sides to keep

3
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:15,012
our x variable positive. So, I'll have 0 equals x minus 6. Be really careful at

4
00:00:15,012 --> 00:00:18,383
this step. You know positive 2x and negative 2x sum to 0, so we need to make

5
00:00:18,383 --> 00:00:23,608
sure we have a place value over here. So if this left side is 0, that must mean

6
00:00:23,608 --> 00:00:29,955
x would have to equal positive 6. Since 6 minus 6 does make 0. We also see that

7
00:00:29,955 --> 00:00:35,958
by just adding 6 to both sides. So 6 is equal to x, or x is equal to 6. For the

8
00:00:35,958 --> 00:00:39,846
right equation, we want to distribute the negative 1 first. So we'll have 2x

9
00:00:39,846 --> 00:00:44,898
plus 1 equals negative 3x plus 5. I'm going to move my x terms to one side by

10
00:00:44,898 --> 00:00:50,260
adding 3x. This also gives me a positive X variable on the left. So if I have x

11
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:55,050
plus 1 is equal to 5 and then can subtract 1 to get 5x is equal to 4. If we

12
00:00:55,050 --> 00:01:01,041
divide both sides by 5 you get x is equal to 4 5ths. So here's my solution set.

13
00:01:01,041 --> 00:01:06,045
X could equal 4 5ths or x could equal 6. Either one of these would work. Let's

14
00:01:06,045 --> 00:01:10,637
make sure. We can check this first x value by plugging it in for x. 2 times 4

15
00:01:10,637 --> 00:01:16,605
5ths is 8 5ths. And then I can just change 1 to 5 divided by 5. So this makes

16
00:01:16,605 --> 00:01:20,428
13 5ths on the left side. Notice that I still have absolute value the entire

17
00:01:20,428 --> 00:01:24,310
way down my problem. Now I'm going to take the absolute value of this number.

18
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:28,530
And I get positive 13 5ths. That's the distance from 0. For the right hand

19
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:33,110
side, I'll have 3 times 4 5ths, which is 12 5ths. And then I'm going to change

20
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:38,201
negative 5 into negative 25 5ths. This term is still really negative 5. I

21
00:01:38,201 --> 00:01:41,983
subtract my fractions, and I get negative 13 5ths, or the absolute value of

22
00:01:41,983 --> 00:01:47,530
negative 13 5ths. The absolute value is always positive, so 13 5ths is equal to

23
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:52,854
13 5ths. So yes, this checks. I can do the same for the positive 6. I'll

24
00:01:52,854 --> 00:01:58,410
substitute it in for x to check my equation. 2 times 6 is 12, plus 1 is 13. I

25
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:02,916
notice I still have the absolute value. So the absolute value of positive 13 is

26
00:02:02,916 --> 00:02:07,768
13. On the right hand side I have 3 times 6, which is 18. And the absolute

27
00:02:07,768 --> 00:02:13,028
value of 18 minus 5 is the absolute value of 13. And hey, look at that, 13 is

28
00:02:13,028 --> 00:02:17,061
equal to 13. That checks as well. You might have gotten stuck with the negative

29
00:02:17,061 --> 00:02:21,040
sign when distributing or perhaps with this fraction. Think about the types of

30
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,560
mistakes you might be making if you are making any, and try and write them

31
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,640
down. This would be a good reference for you later.
