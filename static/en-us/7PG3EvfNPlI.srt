00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:04,650
Now that you know how to listen for the
actions your site's visitors perform,

2
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:07,920
I want you to set up an event
listener using jQuery.

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:11,730
Your event listener should listen to
the my-button element for click event.

4
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:14,940
And when that button is clicked, I want
you to use jQuery to remove the button

5
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:18,110
from the DOM and
add the class success to the body.
