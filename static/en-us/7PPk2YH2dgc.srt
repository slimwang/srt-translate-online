1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,530
If Alice was granted this access
with GRANT option, only then,

2
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:06,110
can she properly fully
propagate it to Bob.

3
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:11,360
If she wasn't granted access with
a GRANT option, she cannot propagate it.

4
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,210
So, the second option is not correct.

5
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:14,850
She cannot always propagate.

6
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:19,780
The access right must come with a GRANT
option, for it to be propagated.
