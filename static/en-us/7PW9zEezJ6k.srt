1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,611
With the polynomial 2 x squared plus 12 x plus 10, we got really lucky in how we

2
00:00:04,611 --> 00:00:09,353
got to factor. Because there was a common factor of 2 between all three of these

3
00:00:09,353 --> 00:00:13,982
terms. But you can imagine that for some polynomials, whose coefficients in

4
00:00:13,982 --> 00:00:18,415
front of the x squared term aren't one, this won't be the case. Let's say for

5
00:00:18,415 --> 00:00:22,391
example that we have an 11 here instead of a 12. Then we can no longer begin the

6
00:00:22,391 --> 00:00:26,356
problem by dividing all the terms by this 2. So we're not going to end up with a

7
00:00:26,356 --> 00:00:30,469
quadratic expression with a 1 in front that we know how to factor right away. We

8
00:00:30,469 --> 00:00:34,530
need to figure out another method for factoring. I think we should backtrack to

9
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:38,545
the thing that we first started factoring with. Let's look at the general case

10
00:00:38,545 --> 00:00:42,632
of a quadratic polynomial that's been factored, and whose leading coefficient

11
00:00:42,632 --> 00:00:47,844
will be 1. We have x plus a and x plus b as our linear factors. Let's go through

12
00:00:47,844 --> 00:00:52,917
multiplying this out again. I know we've done it many times before. Okay, so

13
00:00:52,917 --> 00:00:57,957
multiplying this out we get x squared plus the quantity a plus b, times x plus

14
00:00:57,957 --> 00:01:02,862
ab. What if instead of a and b we want to play with real numbers? But maybe in

15
00:01:02,862 --> 00:01:07,542
playing with those real numbers, I want to keep the equation for the quadratic

16
00:01:07,542 --> 00:01:12,169
in this form. Let's say we start off with a polynomial x squared plus 5x plus 6.

17
00:01:12,169 --> 00:01:16,774
We know that we can rewrite this, recognizing that 2 and 3 are factors of 6 and

18
00:01:16,774 --> 00:01:21,076
also add equal 5. As x squared plus, the quantity 2 plus 3, times x, plus 6.

19
00:01:21,076 --> 00:01:25,272
Which pretty simply becomes x squared plus 2x plus 3x plus 6. Great. Now this

20
00:01:25,272 --> 00:01:29,496
probably all seems simple leading up until now. But now I'm going to ask you to

21
00:01:29,496 --> 00:01:33,567
do something a little bit different. The thing that I'd like you to do that

22
00:01:33,567 --> 00:01:37,593
probably will feel a little bit strange is look first at just the first two

23
00:01:37,593 --> 00:01:42,041
terms here. And find a factor between the two of them that's in common. Pull it

24
00:01:42,041 --> 00:01:46,010
out and then write the rest of the equation in here, and then do the same thing

25
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:50,243
for the second pair of factors. Find a common factor and factor it out. And then

26
00:01:50,243 --> 00:01:52,769
the expression you have after that, right here.
