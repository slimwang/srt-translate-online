00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
All right. Now that you know the trick, let's see if you can decode a message yourself.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Here's the message after it's been altered by the spy--

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
the 15-bit code that you see in front of you.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
What I want you to do is figure out what message the spy was trying to send

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
and type it into the box below.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Now, the message itself is in binary,

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
but just type the digits--the bits in--the four bits.
