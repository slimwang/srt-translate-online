1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:04,420
The home route is the base URL,
so we just need to call home.

2
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:08,200
The mountain route needs an id, so
we need to capture that with a route

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:10,460
parameter, and
then call the mountain function.

4
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:15,570
This is just like the one above,
except that instead of a single value,

5
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:20,850
we use a splat to capture anything after
download, and then we'll call download.
