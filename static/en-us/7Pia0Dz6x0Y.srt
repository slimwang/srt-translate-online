00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,359
One thing we can do to simplify this expression, is to start out by inserting

2
00:00:04,359 --> 00:00:09,946
one new set of parentheses around this first 5 times 5. That way, just like

3
00:00:09,946 --> 00:00:12,982
we've done before, we're multiplying two things together and we know how to use

4
00:00:12,982 --> 00:00:18,378
the product rule in a situation like this. This is just going to be equal to

5
00:00:18,378 --> 00:00:24,155
log base 10 of 5 times 5 plus log base 10 of 5. Conveniently, we've already

6
00:00:24,155 --> 00:00:28,915
found this. That's what we got up here. Log base 10 of 5 times 5 is just log

7
00:00:28,915 --> 00:00:34,412
base 10 of 5 plus log base 10 of 5. And then of course, we have to keep this

8
00:00:34,412 --> 00:00:38,726
last, log base 10 of 5 added on to the end as well. Now we have three log base

9
00:00:38,726 --> 00:00:44,325
10 of 5s added together. And this is just equal to 3 times log base 10 of 5, or

10
00:00:44,325 --> 00:00:47,196
3 log base 10 of 5.
