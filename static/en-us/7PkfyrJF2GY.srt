00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:04,460
So this quiz asks us to write code for
the random_noun function, and we'll do

2
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:08,753
that by using the randint function we
learned about to generate a number from

3
00:00:08,753 --> 00:00:13,580
0 to 1, and return the string sofa if
the number is zero, else we return lama.

4
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:18,310
So the first thing we need to do is
generate this random number from zero to

5
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:22,300
one, and the way we would do that, is of
course, by using the randint function.

6
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:29,483
So I'm setting a variable
random_num = randint(0,1).

7
00:00:29,483 --> 00:00:33,450
And that's because the randint function
will return a random number from

8
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,520
the first to the second argument, but

9
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,770
with both arguments
included in that range.

10
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:41,170
So now that we have our
random number figured out,

11
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:43,100
we need to implement
some logic around it.

12
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:47,950
Since we returned sofa at
the random number of 0,

13
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:52,000
a check of random number 0, and
return the string sofa if it is.

14
00:00:53,808 --> 00:00:56,600
And since random_num can
only be one of two numbers,

15
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:00,150
we don't need to write another
comparison checking if num is 1.

16
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:01,710
We'll just return
the string "llama" instead.

17
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:04,040
And that's all there is to it.

18
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,560
We can now generate random_nouns.

19
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,235
You can see how we can expand
this function to generate more

20
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:12,530
random_nouns by increasing
the range our randint function.

21
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:16,040
In the next quiz,
there will be generating random verbs,

22
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:18,650
so we're going to start creating
some really interesting math glibs.
