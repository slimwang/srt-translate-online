1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,600
Now let's set up our app so that we
have the proper classes to display more

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,950
attributes about each earthquake.

3
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:08,220
In the next coding task,
modify the app so

4
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:11,980
that we can store more information then
just the location about each earthquake.

5
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:15,680
We should keep track of the magnitude,
the location and the date for

6
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,120
each earthquake.

7
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:19,000
When you're done,
it should look like this screenshot.

8
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:24,050
Continue to use fake data,
also known as place holder data

9
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:27,600
because we're setting up the key parts
of the app that are needed later.

10
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,330
You can make up any details you want for

11
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:32,119
each earthquake, it doesn't need
to match our fake data exactly.

12
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:35,610
There will be a fair amount
of code changes required,

13
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:37,190
which can be challenging.

14
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:40,430
If you find this task too hard, you can
review the content from the last course,

15
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:41,570
where Jessica walked you through,

16
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:45,170
step by step, on how to display
a list of data in the Me Walk app.

17
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:50,720
Otherwise, give this a try,
I'll offer you two hints below the quiz.

18
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:53,450
I also linked the Android Flavor
app from the last course,

19
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:55,380
if you want to use that for reference.

20
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:58,920
Good luck, when you're done
check this box and continue.
