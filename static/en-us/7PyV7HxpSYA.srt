00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,700
I'd like you to get started by looking at the structure

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:05,100
and the summary of the Yerger data set on your own

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:08,490
computer. You may want to pause the video now to give yourself

4
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:10,920
some time to load in the data set and to download it

5
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:14,710
first from the instructor notes. This Yerger data set contains over

6
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:17,190
2000 observations. For nine different

7
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:20,050
variables. The observations are for households

8
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:23,070
that buy Dannon yogurt over time. Now one thing that you

9
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:26,038
might notice is that most of the variables in here are integers.

10
00:00:26,038 --> 00:00:29,110
But I want to convert one of the variables to a factor, and

11
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:32,540
that's the ID variable. We'll see how this comes in handy later

12
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:36,060
in the course. But just make sure it says factor right here

13
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:39,396
on your data set as well. If ID doesn't say factor for

14
00:00:39,396 --> 00:00:42,405
the type of variable, make sure you run this command in order

15
00:00:42,405 --> 00:00:45,450
to change ID to a factor variable. Once you've done all this,

16
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:48,840
I want you to create a histogram of the Yogurt prices. Copy

17
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,410
and paste your R code in to the R chunk on the quiz

18
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:53,960
screen that will appear here. And then write a

19
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:56,420
few sentences about what you notice. So that way

20
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:58,100
we can be consistent as we work through the

21
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00,080
data set together. I want you to be sure to

22
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:02,030
read in the data set into the variable called

23
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:04,980
Yo. You can, of course, use other variable names.

24
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:07,540
But our auto grader will only accept answers for

25
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:10,820
programming assignments that have this data frame labeled as Yo.
