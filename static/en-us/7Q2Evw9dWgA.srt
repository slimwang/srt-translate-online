00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:03,090
Let's now take a look at layering.

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:06,450
By and large, security is enhanced because it is straightforward to

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:09,920
add a security layer between the system and its environment.

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:15,000
As far as the effect of the other four qualities on layering, performance may

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,450
be reduced because the response to external events must be passed up and

6
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:23,350
down the layers, which may in, may also increase context swapping.

7
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:24,710
Maintainability, on the other hand,

8
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:28,200
might be improved because of the stable interlayer protocols and

9
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,890
interfaces would lead to well-defined and reusable components.

10
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:36,880
It may even be possible to replace an entire layer or insert other layers.

11
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:41,350
Reliability may be reduced because an event may be handled in multiple layers.

12
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:43,500
That is, making it hard to find,

13
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,360
when something goes wrong, what the responsible layer is.

14
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:50,670
However the higher layers may have an oversight capability to provide

15
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:54,380
the necessary redundancy to improve reliability.

16
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:57,700
As far as safety is concerned, similar to security,

17
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:00,380
it maybe easy to insert safety monitoring layers.
