00:00:00,038 --> 00:00:01,784
We learned 3 algorithms today.

2
00:00:01,784 --> 00:00:04,255
We'll use all 3 in this week's homework,

3
00:00:04,255 --> 00:00:07,040
when we implement a procedure called tone mapping on an image.

4
00:00:07,063 --> 00:00:12,065
Generally, tone mapping is the process of converting one set of colors into another set of colors.

5
00:00:12,065 --> 00:00:15,438
The reason we want to do this is typically to take a raw image that

6
00:00:15,438 --> 00:00:19,448
accurately measures light intensity, and map it onto some physical medium, which

7
00:00:19,448 --> 00:00:23,132
might be a piece of paper, or a television, or your computer monitor.

8
00:00:23,155 --> 00:00:26,426
The problem is that a real world scene can have brightnesses that span

9
00:00:26,426 --> 00:00:28,897
many orders of magnitude and intensity.

10
00:00:28,897 --> 00:00:34,172
A piece of white paper in bright sunlight is literally a billion times brighter than on a dark night.

11
00:00:34,172 --> 00:00:38,210
And an output device like a CRT can only represent about two orders of magnitude

12
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:40,789
between its brightest and least bright pixel.

13
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,052
So, how do we do this mapping here?

14
00:00:43,052 --> 00:00:46,318
If we do a bad job, then we'll have images that are either too washed out,

15
00:00:46,318 --> 00:00:49,189
overly bright, or instead, overly dark.

16
00:00:49,196 --> 00:00:52,785
Let's take a quick look at some pictures to see why this is important.

17
00:00:52,785 --> 00:00:55,976
Here's a couple lovely images of old Saint Paul's in Wellington, New Zealand,

18
00:00:55,976 --> 00:00:59,552
licensed by the photographer Dean Pemberton, under the Creative Commons license.

19
00:00:59,552 --> 00:01:04,221
Thanks, Dean. What we see here are two different exposures of the interior of this building.

20
00:01:04,227 --> 00:01:09,203
If you look at the darker image here, you'll see most of it is quite dark and so it shows little detail.

21
00:01:09,203 --> 00:01:12,918
If we look at the brighter image, we see a lot more detail in some areas but bright

22
00:01:12,918 --> 00:01:16,443
parts of the image, like the stained glass window, are completely washed out.

23
00:01:16,458 --> 00:01:18,921
We can classify this in terms of histograms.

24
00:01:18,944 --> 00:01:22,815
In the dark image, most of the pixels are at the low end of an intensity histogram.

25
00:01:22,815 --> 00:01:25,177
And in the light image, they're at the high end.

26
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,971
What tone mapping does is it remaps those colors,

27
00:01:27,971 --> 00:01:31,081
so they do a better job spanning the entire color range.

28
00:01:31,088 --> 00:01:34,093
The intensity spectrum, thus, will look closer to this.

29
00:01:34,093 --> 00:01:39,546
In the homework, you'll implement a classic and excellent tone mapping algorithm developed by Greg Ward.

30
00:01:39,547 --> 00:01:42,838
This algorithm uses all three of the algorithms you learned today,

31
00:01:42,858 --> 00:01:46,932
reduce, scan, and histogram to implement such a tone mapping.

32
00:01:46,939 --> 00:01:49,452
Good luck, and we'll see you in the next unit.
