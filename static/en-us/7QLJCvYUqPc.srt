It was pretty cool visualizing the cars. Let's do something like that for the

2
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:08,390
social network. I want to update the constructor for a person object, so that

3
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:11,810
when I create a person, it draws the person's picture. This is how it might

4
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:21,510
look. In person demo, I create three person objects, and I pass in a name of a

5
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:26,320
picture, and also a location. And then when I run all of this, it creates this

6
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:31,900
picture. Can you update the person class so that it will do this when you run

7
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:34,830
the main method in person demo. You will need to take three additional

8
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:39,429
parameters in the constructor: a picture name, an x coordinate, and a y

9
00:00:39,429 --> 00:00:41,627
coordinate...
