00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,600
Okay, so thus far we have the slow and

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:04,920
the fast audio effects working really well.

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:08,840
The next thing I want to do is add an effect that make our voice sound

4
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:09,950
like that of a chipmunk.

5
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:14,150
We will begin by adding this button on the storyboard.

6
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:18,400
To make this button work, you will want to accomplish the same tasks as before.

7
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,030
Here they are one more time.

8
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:21,390
Check this box when you are done.
