1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:04,780
Let's look at different types of aspects
and benefits of this coded aperture.

2
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:06,939
One, of course,
it allows you to compute,

3
00:00:06,939 --> 00:00:09,800
capture an image in depth,
just from a single image.

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:12,860
And there is no real loss
of image resolution for

5
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:14,715
a simple modification to a lens.

6
00:00:14,715 --> 00:00:17,415
Again, I don't recommend doing
to a very, your favorite lens.

7
00:00:17,415 --> 00:00:20,305
Depth is of course coarse,
and we saw examples of that,

8
00:00:20,305 --> 00:00:22,395
I mean, again, we are trying to
get something out of nothing.

9
00:00:22,395 --> 00:00:24,575
If you get a little bit of depth,
but not very much, and

10
00:00:24,575 --> 00:00:27,485
again, that is because we are trying
to basically get this out of,

11
00:00:27,485 --> 00:00:30,555
by creating focus planes
by actually changing

12
00:00:30,555 --> 00:00:34,275
how the focus looks like differently
because of the coded aperture.

13
00:00:34,275 --> 00:00:38,120
But, you know, we get depth, of course,
we loose light and we know that, right?

14
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:41,640
Because we have a smaller opening than
this one, that basically means that

15
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,890
the light sensitivity in your lens
of the camera is going to go down,

16
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:46,750
darker scenes won't work very well.

17
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:49,284
But again,
we can actually do deconvolution and

18
00:00:49,284 --> 00:00:52,960
increase depth of field after
the fact from a single image.

19
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,470
So, in essence, this is like a light
field camera where we actually get

20
00:00:56,470 --> 00:01:00,140
defocusing and depth information by
changing in something in front of

21
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:03,520
the lens itself, the opening or
on the plane of the lens,

22
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,700
rather than changing the sensor, because
in light field, that's what we did.

23
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:09,940
Light field camera we changed the
sensors to be able to capture different

24
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:10,590
types of lights.
