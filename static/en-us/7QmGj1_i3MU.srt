00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:05,120
While we're on the topic of
problems that are easy or hard for

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:10,080
optimizers to solve, let's talk for
a moment about a particular class of

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:16,910
problems that are indeed the most easy
for these types of algorithms to solve.

4
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:19,770
And those are called convex problems.

5
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:23,230
Here's the formal definition
of a convex function.

6
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:25,628
I'm going to read it
to you from Wikipedia.

7
00:00:25,628 --> 00:00:29,010
And then I'll show you what it
means on these graphs here.

8
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:35,000
A real valued function f
of x defined on an interval

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,880
is called convex if
the line segment between

10
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:43,220
any two points on the graph of
the function lies above the graph.

11
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,540
A lot of words there.

12
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:49,920
Let me show you what
that means more easily.

13
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,150
First step, choose two points and
draw a line between them.

14
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:59,365
Now, for each of these lines, if
the line is above the graph, everywhere

15
00:00:59,365 --> 00:01:04,720
between those two points, then the
function is convex between those points.

16
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,105
So for this function, yes,

17
00:01:07,105 --> 00:01:11,630
it's convex because the line
is above the graph everywhere.

18
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:17,456
In fact, any two points you chose on
this graph, we'll have that property.

19
00:01:17,456 --> 00:01:23,600
So this function is convex everywhere,
at least where we're looking at.

20
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:28,820
Here, notice that this part of
the graph lies above the line.

21
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:32,130
So this is non convex.

22
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:37,740
Similarly, this one,
we've got this region here

23
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:42,700
that lies above the line, so
this one is also non convex.

24
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:45,040
And this one is of course convex.

25
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,780
So a couple things to observe here,
some properties that emerged.

26
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:54,300
One is in order for
the function to be convex,

27
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:58,250
it has to have only one local minima.

28
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:01,510
And in other words,
that local minima is the global minima.

29
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:03,920
This one fails for that reason.

30
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,760
We also can't have any flat regions

31
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,350
that essentially don't
have any slope downward.

32
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:15,950
Now, if the function you're trying
to find a minima for is convex,

33
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:21,510
then these algorithms will find
the minima quickly and easily.

34
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:26,640
But again, there are algorithms
that can still find the minima for

35
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,340
more complicated examples like these.

36
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,710
But they require a little
bit of randomness and

37
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:37,208
they aren't necessarily guaranteed
to find the global minima.

38
00:02:37,208 --> 00:02:41,710
So far, we've been looking at functions
that just have one dimension in x.

39
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:44,030
So for instance,
the parabola that we looked at.

40
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:50,630
It’s just as easy for these optimizers
to work in multiple dimensions.

41
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:54,480
Here’s an example of a function
that has two dimensions in x.

42
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,320
It still has its y result.

43
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:00,580
But the minimizers can solve these
problems with gradient descent

44
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,420
just as easily.

45
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:07,220
So instead of just one dimension,
we can have one,

46
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:09,370
two, three, four, as many as we’d like.
