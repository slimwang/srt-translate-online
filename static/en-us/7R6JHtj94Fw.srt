00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:02,870
In this question, you're going to go to the Play Store

2
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:06,270
and find an app you don't like, and then we're going to deconstruct

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:09,340
why. Now, you may already have an app in mind, something you've

4
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:12,520
used and don't like. You can use that. If you do go

5
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:15,220
to the Play Store, you may have to look a bit.

6
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:18,280
Sometimes Play Store will tend to feature the higher rated apps, of

7
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:21,110
course, so you may have to dig a little deep. After you

8
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:24,550
find an app you don't like so much, you should make two

9
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:31,250
flows, in Prezi. In the first flow you will describe, or depict I should say,

10
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:37,390
one flow through the app as it currently exists. I say one flow, because complex

11
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:39,990
apps can have a complicated hierarchy of

12
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:43,400
potential flows. After you do this, you're going to

13
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:46,110
think at a high level. Now, what about

14
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:49,504
this flow is making you unhappy? And then,

15
00:00:49,504 --> 00:00:54,280
you're going to fix it. Now, not every app that displeases you

16
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:57,410
is wrong because of its high level flow. You may just

17
00:00:57,410 --> 00:01:00,370
not be the intended audience. But hopefully you can find one

18
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:03,770
where this is the case, and focus on it. Once you've

19
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:06,720
made your two flows, you're going to post to the forum. You

20
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,420
can either find the thread in the instruction that's below, or

21
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:12,050
in the discussion section off to the side. The goal of

22
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:15,220
this whole question is to get your thinking and speaking like

23
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:18,480
a designer, and making high level improvements to products.
