1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,210
Let's start with an observation.

2
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:05,550
Here are the two paths that these
two messages are trying to take.

3
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:10,430
Notice that the paths intersect and
they're going in the same direction.

4
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:14,770
That means the messages will need to
serialize in their bandwidth term.

5
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:18,500
And since there are two such messages,
we'll take bandwidth term and

6
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,350
multiply by two.

7
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:23,790
This is essentially an application
of rule 5, k-way congestion.
