1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:02,480
To add a dependency to a Gradle project,

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:06,370
we first need to declare the repository
to fetch the dependency from.

3
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:09,500
The most basic sort of repository
is just a folder full of jars,

4
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:13,030
which Gradle calls a flat
directory repository.

5
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:17,800
All repository configuration is done
inside a repositories script block.

6
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:21,850
For a flat directory repository,
we just add a flat dir block and

7
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:24,540
configure the directories
we want to include.

8
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:28,260
This is great option if you're migrating
an existing project to Gradle, or

9
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:32,070
using a dependency if it's not
available from a remote repository.

10
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:34,790
But it also means you forego
a lot of Gradle's advanced

11
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:36,700
dependency management features.

12
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:40,200
The repository script block also
allows you to use shortcut methods for

13
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:45,075
commonly used repositories such as
mavenCentral, mavenLocal, or jcenter.

14
00:00:45,075 --> 00:00:46,565
Simply call the appropriate method, and

15
00:00:46,565 --> 00:00:49,245
the repository will be
automatically added.

16
00:00:49,245 --> 00:00:52,305
This is by far the most common
way to declare a repository.

17
00:00:52,305 --> 00:00:55,465
Gradle also supports resolving
managed dependencies from Maven and

18
00:00:55,465 --> 00:00:56,972
and IV repositories.

19
00:00:56,972 --> 00:00:58,952
The syntax for both is the same.

20
00:00:58,952 --> 00:01:02,712
Simply place your configuration
in Ivy or Maven block.

21
00:01:02,712 --> 00:01:06,172
For both Ivy and Maven repositories,
the only required configuration element

22
00:01:06,172 --> 00:01:09,360
is the location of the repository,
expressed as a URL.

23
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,240
In some cases, credentials may be
required to access a repository.

24
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,800
You can easily provide a username and

25
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,650
password by placing them
inside a credentials block.

26
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:21,600
Gradle supports a number of protocols
for accessing repositories.

27
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,110
In addition to the standard http and
https,

28
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:29,310
Gradle also supports sftp and
file-based repositories like this.
