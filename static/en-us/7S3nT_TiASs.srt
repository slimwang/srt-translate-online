00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,936
The second component is the behavioral component. And this refers to the ways

2
00:00:03,936 --> 00:00:08,234
in which I behave towards the Red Wings. Well obviously I buy a lot of Red

3
00:00:08,234 --> 00:00:12,744
Wings material. If the Red Wings are on TV, I'll watch a game. If I don't have

4
00:00:12,744 --> 00:00:17,073
access to a TV, I'll listen to them on the radio. When the Red Wings come to

5
00:00:17,073 --> 00:00:20,578
town, I'll buy a ticket and go see them. And this year, I even went to the

6
00:00:20,578 --> 00:00:24,240
hotel where they stayed so I could to try to meet some of my Red Wings.

7
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,210
Obviously, I have a strong behavioral component in my attitude towards the Red

8
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:32,077
Wings. And the third component is the cognitive component. And this refers to

9
00:00:32,077 --> 00:00:34,929
the rational thoughts and beliefs that make up my attitude towards the Red

10
00:00:34,929 --> 00:00:39,832
Wings. So here, I know things such as how many Stanley Cup championships we

11
00:00:39,832 --> 00:00:45,343
won, 11. When we first started the league in 1926. I know the famous Red Wing

12
00:00:45,343 --> 00:00:49,243
players, such as Gordie Howe, Ted Lindsay, Steve Yzerman, Brendan Shanahan,

13
00:00:49,243 --> 00:00:54,900
Nick Lindstrom. I know all the players' names and numbers. I know the rules of

14
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:59,608
the game, I know the coaches, and I even know the hometown announcers. All

15
00:00:59,608 --> 00:01:03,871
those are cognitive components of my attitude towards the Red Wings. Let's go

16
00:01:03,871 --> 00:01:05,790
back and finish up this part on attitudes.
