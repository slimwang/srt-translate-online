00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:02,960
There shouldn't be any changes in your local repository that

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:07,070
are not on GitHub because you ran getPush after the most recent change you

3
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:09,000
made to the local repository.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,550
Similarly, you ran getPull after the most recent change you

5
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:14,220
made directly on GitHub.

6
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:16,920
So there shouldn't be any changes on GitHub that aren't in your

7
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,730
local repository.

8
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:22,060
Instead the two repositories should have the same commits right now.
