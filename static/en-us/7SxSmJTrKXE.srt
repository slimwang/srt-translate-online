1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,980
Now, as you've probably heard over and
over and

2
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:05,540
over again,
there's no reward without risk.

3
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:10,120
And we often want to consider
multiple stocks together and

4
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:13,270
evaluate their risk versus return.

5
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:17,720
So, one way we can do that is
plot them on a scatter plot

6
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:21,890
where each dot here
represents one stock.

7
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:24,060
So risk goes along this axis.

8
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:26,350
Return is along this axis.

9
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:31,750
So for instance,
this stock here has higher risk,

10
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:34,850
but about the same return as this stock.

11
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:40,650
And then for comparison,
this stock here has shown, historically

12
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:44,390
about the same risk as this stock,
but it's got a much higher return.

13
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:49,960
Now we can build the portfolio
by combining multiple assets,

14
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:54,810
like the various stocks I've got
plotted here and waiting each asset

15
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:59,580
by a particular wait that represents
it's allocation within the portfolio.

16
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:03,710
So each stock has a wait and
when combined altogether

17
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:09,340
we end up with a portfolio that has
properties of each of the stocks.

18
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:14,330
It's typically got a risk
somewhere in the middle there and

19
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:15,960
a return somewhere in the middle
