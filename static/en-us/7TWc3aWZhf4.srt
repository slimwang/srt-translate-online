1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:06,238
We know the equivalent fraction for 1 6th is 4 24ths and the equivalent fraction

2
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:11,489
for 3 8ths is 9 24ths. I'm taking away 4 24ths and 9 24ths, so altogether, I'm

3
00:00:11,501 --> 00:00:16,665
taking away 13 24ths. I can see that visually, too. I have one, two, three,

4
00:00:16,813 --> 00:00:22,310
four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, 11, 12, 13 24ths. Those are the pieces

5
00:00:22,322 --> 00:00:29,531
I'm trying to subtract from my whole cake. So, 24 24ths minus 13 24ths leaves me

6
00:00:29,543 --> 00:00:36,839
with 11 24ths. That means this region must represent 11 24ths of my cake, that's

7
00:00:36,851 --> 00:00:41,310
the fraction that's not frosted. Let's see if this makes sense visually too.

8
00:00:41,411 --> 00:00:45,856
I've split my cake into 24ths, and if I count up the chocolate pieces that are

9
00:00:45,868 --> 00:00:50,004
not frosted, I can see that I have 11 of those. So I have 11 24ths of my cake

10
00:00:50,016 --> 00:00:50,694
not frosted.
