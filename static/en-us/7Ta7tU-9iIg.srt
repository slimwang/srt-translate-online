1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:02,330
What we're going to do is we're going to step through the geometry for

2
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:04,460
a pretty simple stereo system.

3
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:06,589
The first thing that we're going to do,

4
00:00:06,589 --> 00:00:09,890
is assume that the optical axes are parallel.

5
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:13,700
That's these right here, and because the optical axes are perpendicular to

6
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:16,329
the image planes, it means the image planes are parallel.

7
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:20,880
In fact, we're going to assume that they're exactly coplanar.

8
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:26,152
So this image drawn here is as if we were looking down on our camera rig system,

9
00:00:26,152 --> 00:00:26,970
all right?

10
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:31,010
The cameras are looking out, okay, and this is the image plane right here,

11
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:34,560
so we're looking down on the plane, and that will let us take a look at

12
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:38,119
how things shift left to right in the stereo imagery.

13
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:40,050
For our geometry here,

14
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:45,300
we're going to assume our cameras are separated by Baseline B and

15
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:50,690
that both cameras have a focal length of f, so f is on both sides.

16
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:53,150
So for the two cameras, they both have the same focal length.

17
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:59,360
Now, let's assume that we have some Point P in this scene, okay.

18
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:03,340
And it's located at a distance Z in the camera coordinate systems.

19
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:07,910
Now remember, the Z is the distance all the way down to the centers of

20
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:09,190
projection, okay?

21
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:12,590
So that's Z not to the image plane, but to the center of projection.

22
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:16,960
And if you remember, just for mathematical convenience, we put the image plane

23
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,580
in front of the center of projection so things don't get inverted.

24
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:24,830
So, that point P projects into both the left and the right images.

25
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:28,150
Now, just to make sure you're paying attention, on the left image,

26
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:31,080
the distance is going to be positive.

27
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,750
And on the right image, the distance is going to be negative because our

28
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:35,760
origins are right in the middle.

29
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:38,820
Zero is here is in the middle of the image plane, got it?

30
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:41,910
So, distance is positive in the left and negative in the right.

31
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:46,290
These quantities, xl and xr, are meant to be distances, so they're positive

32
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:51,190
values, but whether they move plus or minus depends upon which image we're in.

33
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:56,210
So here's our point pl, and there's our point pr, and pl, is as I said,

34
00:01:56,210 --> 00:02:00,230
this distance xl to the right of the optical axis, so

35
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:03,500
it's positive, and the point pr is to the left.

36
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:08,370
So it's negative xr to the left of zero, all right?

37
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:13,116
So now we can do some simple geometry to figure out the relationships between

38
00:02:13,116 --> 00:02:18,190
xs, ps, bs, ps and everything else that happens to be in the picture.

39
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:22,560
We want to find an expression for z, so we start by using similar triangles,

40
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,200
just like we did for projection, but these are different triangles.

41
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,630
The one's looking down.

42
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:30,150
We have the first triangle, which is based upon the point p and

43
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,420
each of the projections.

44
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:33,340
That triangle's shown in yellow.

45
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:37,300
And then there is another triangle that's based upon the center of projections,

46
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,740
and the point P.

47
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:40,310
And that one is shown here in blue.

48
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:41,160
See how it faded in.

49
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,070
Let me back it up.

50
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:44,760
There it is. That's the other triangle.

51
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:47,310
Well, we now have two similar triangles.

52
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:50,446
So we can write down what the relationship is between the edges.

53
00:02:50,446 --> 00:02:56,060
Namely that B minus these distances,

54
00:02:56,060 --> 00:03:03,380
so that's going to be this distance, okay, is to this distance,

55
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:08,750
which is just Z minus f, that's same proportion as

56
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:13,190
the total baseline B, I'll draw it here, is to the total Z.

57
00:03:14,215 --> 00:03:17,120
Okay, those similar triangles give us that relationship, so

58
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:22,980
very little bit of rearranging gives us an expression for Z that says that

59
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:28,561
Z is equal to f times B over xl minus xr, okay?

60
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:33,550
And that difference between the left and

61
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:37,230
the right amount, that's called the disparity.

62
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:40,600
The cool thing here is that we're computing the distance in

63
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:44,070
the scene based upon a difference between these two.

64
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:49,660
Now you should ask yourself a little question here.

65
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:51,820
What happens when disparity is zero?

66
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:58,330
Well when disparity is zero, that means that some point in the scene

67
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:03,830
projected to the same point in the left image as the right image.

68
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:08,930
In other words, as I moved my, from my left to my right camera,

69
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:10,890
that point didn't appear to move.

70
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,420
Well remember, we had a quiz on this.

71
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,610
We talked about how come the moon follows you.

72
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:18,480
Well, the moon follows you because Z is so

73
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:24,000
far away that you get, no change in the left and the right.

74
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,110
So the disparity is zero, so the depth is what?

75
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:29,180
It's infinite, okay.

76
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:32,780
And that's the inverse relationship between disparity and depth.
