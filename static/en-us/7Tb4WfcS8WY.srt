1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:05,850
The answer is no. You could get green, orange, or red, or yellow since those

2
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:08,029
are also in the jar. But most likely,

3
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:10,430
you'll get blue. Later in this course you'll

4
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:15,360
learn how samples, in this case the sample is the one M&M that you pulled out,

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:20,160
can be used to learn about the population, which is like the whole jar of M&Ms.
