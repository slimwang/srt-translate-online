1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:02,151
Let's go over the question again.

2
00:00:02,151 --> 00:00:07,031
We're supposed to use string slicing
to store everything before NOUN in

3
00:00:07,031 --> 00:00:11,911
substring1, everything after NOUN and
before a VERB in substring2,

4
00:00:11,911 --> 00:00:15,600
and everything after
VERB in subsstring3.

5
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,160
Let's find the indices that will
give us everything before NOUN

6
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:22,920
by taking a look at the sentence
variables' index values.

7
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:27,250
The beginning of the string,
or index 0, has a value of A.

8
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:28,890
So let's write that down.

9
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:31,874
Index 1, as we see, is a space.

10
00:00:31,874 --> 00:00:38,890
And index 2, is N, and
also the beginning of NOUN.

11
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:45,060
So, as we see, everything before
NOUN is before the second index.

12
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:47,040
Let's use our findings in substring1.

13
00:00:48,644 --> 00:00:50,570
So now substring1 is complete.

14
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:54,430
When the left hand side
of a colon is blank,

15
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:56,280
it means to start from the beginning.

16
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:00,140
And when there's a number in the right
hand side of a colon, it means the slice

17
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:03,880
will include everything up to,
but not including, that index.

18
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:09,320
So this will be equal to A with
space next to it, and not A space N.

19
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:12,280
Let's now move on to
substring2's indices, or

20
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:16,520
everything after NOUN and before VERB.

21
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:22,120
From finding substring1's indices,
we know that NOUN starts at index 2,

22
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:29,230
and since NOUN is four characters long,
we'll begin our substring2 at index 6.

23
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:31,500
So let's write that down.

24
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,300
Now we need to find where VERB begins.

25
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:37,630
I don't feel like counting all
these characters over here, so

26
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:40,870
I'll take a guess as to
what index VERB is at.

27
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:42,110
I don't know, let's say 26.

28
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:46,036
I'm now going to switch over to
my Python interpreter to see

29
00:01:46,036 --> 00:01:48,160
what the value is.

30
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:51,700
All right, so
here I am in my Python interpreter, and

31
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:53,780
let's start by declaring
the sentence variable.

32
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,920
Now that we have our
sentence variable declared,

33
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:00,700
let's take a look at
what the 26th index has.

34
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:01,400
All right, cool.

35
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,750
So the 26th index of sentence is c.

36
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:07,400
Since I don't see that letter
anywhere else in the sentence,

37
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:10,050
it's a safe bet that it's
the beginning of can.

38
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:12,970
Let's write that down in
our list of index values.

39
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:16,653
Now that we know the 26th index
value is the character "c",

40
00:02:16,653 --> 00:02:20,850
we can count up from there until
we find the beginning of VERB.

41
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:26,530
Counting from index 26, or c,
we found that four spaces over,

42
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:29,870
at index 30, we have V,
or the start of VERB.

43
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:33,100
So this is where we're
going to end substring2.

44
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:33,740
Let's fill that in.

45
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:38,515
And last but not least, we need to
fill in the substring indices for

46
00:02:38,515 --> 00:02:41,970
substring3, or everything after VERB.

47
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:46,140
To get the beginning slice index,
we'll add the length of the word, VERB,

48
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:50,920
which is 4, to 30, or
the index we found VERB at to get 34,

49
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:55,195
and we'll leave the right
hand side of the colon blank.

50
00:02:55,195 --> 00:02:58,690
Awesome, we now split out
sentence into three substrings.

51
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:01,722
We'll now be able to add our own
NOUN and VERB replacements to these

52
00:03:01,722 --> 00:03:04,521
substrings so we can create our
own Mad Lib-style sentence.
