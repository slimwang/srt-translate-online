00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Another quiz about parsing charts, although the hint for this one is to think about the closure.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I've written a grammar on the left. It's like the E plus E E minus a grammar, but this time,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
we're using multiplication and division instead for no adequately explored reason.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
We're currently looking at a state in chart 2.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Looks like this, E goes to E times, here's where we are,

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and then another E coming from chart state zero.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
What I'd like you to do is indicate which of these other states would have to be included in chart 2.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 99:59:59,999
That is, let's say we bring in closure from this parse state. What else we are going to bring in?
