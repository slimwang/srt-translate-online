1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
For N equals 1 it is 0.75 with 3/4 chance that particles will find themselves in B, D, or C,

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
and there's only a 1/4 chance that a particle is in A.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:18,000
For N equals 4, it's 0.316, which is the same as 0.75^4.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
For each particle we have a 75% chance to be outside A,

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and 0.75^4 are the chances of 4 particles are outside A.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 99:59:59,999
As we move on, we get 0.75^10 with a 0.0563.
