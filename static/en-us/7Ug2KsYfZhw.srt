1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The solution is whatever area we're starting this, it's going to shrink to zero.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
We know that because the motion dies out.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Eventually, the position will be fixed and the velocity will be zero.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
So any initial condition will eventually be taken to the same single point,

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
which means that if I start with any area in phase space and forget all of these initial conditions

6
00:00:24,000 --> 99:59:59,999
of a time, they will converged to that single point which means the area becomes zero.
