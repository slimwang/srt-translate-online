1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,928
So we've seen using k-means
that clustering is a for,

2
00:00:03,928 --> 00:00:06,730
is that segmentation is
a form of clustering.

3
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:10,500
And so far we've just
clustered in intensity space.

4
00:00:11,562 --> 00:00:17,112
And things get more interesting as we
either add more interesting dimensions,

5
00:00:17,112 --> 00:00:19,000
that is other descriptors.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,455
And also using a clustering algorithm or

7
00:00:21,455 --> 00:00:26,375
a way of finding these clusters that
are be, that's better than just k-means.

8
00:00:26,375 --> 00:00:27,770
And that's what we're
going to talk about next.
