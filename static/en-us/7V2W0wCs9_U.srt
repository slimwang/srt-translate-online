When we factor an expression like this, we're finding two numbers or expressions

2
00:00:04,364 --> 00:00:08,293
that multiply together to give us what we originally started with. We can

3
00:00:08,293 --> 00:00:12,591
quickly check by using multiplication. If I multiply 9x squared y squared by 5y

4
00:00:12,591 --> 00:00:16,798
and by 4x squared z. I should wind up with my original statement. This is where

5
00:00:16,798 --> 00:00:21,801
the properties of exponents come in handy. 9x squared y squared times 5y would

6
00:00:21,801 --> 00:00:27,497
be 45x squared y cubed. We add the exponents here. There's a 2 and a 1. And 9x

7
00:00:27,497 --> 00:00:32,986
squared y squared times 4x squared z would be 30 x to the 4th y squared z. 9

8
00:00:32,986 --> 00:00:38,438
times 4 is 36, x squared times x squared is x to the 4th, and then we have y

9
00:00:38,438 --> 00:00:40,320
squared and z on the end.
