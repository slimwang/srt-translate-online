00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:02,570
Writing code in an Internet
browser is fine, but

2
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:06,030
you're probably wondering what kind of
tools professional developers use and

3
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:08,350
how you get something like
this actually onto your phone.

4
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:12,730
This installation comes in two parts.

5
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:16,190
First, we're going to install something
called the Java Development Kit and

6
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:19,240
only once we're done with that,
then will we install Android Studio.

7
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:23,300
I want you to think of
Android Studio like a workshop.

8
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:26,320
And this is a pretty special workshop
because it's specifically designed for

9
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,250
making Android applications.

10
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:31,930
One where we have automated help
that makes creating apps easier.

11
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:34,900
The thing is, that while this workshop
is great, it's pretty useless without

12
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:37,590
tools and that's where
the Java Development Kit comes in.

13
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:42,670
Before we set anything else up, first
we'll install the Java Development Kit.

14
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:44,900
Essentially we're grabbing our tools.

15
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:48,090
Then we set up our app making workshop
by installing Android Studio.

16
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:50,735
Now it's important that you
do these steps in order and

17
00:00:50,735 --> 00:00:52,075
complete them correctly.

18
00:00:52,075 --> 00:00:54,835
If you don't have your tools ready then
you won't be able to do anything in

19
00:00:54,835 --> 00:00:56,315
your workshop.

20
00:00:56,315 --> 00:00:59,525
The whole process of setting both of
these up, should take you about 30

21
00:00:59,525 --> 00:01:02,255
minutes to an hour if your
Internet connection is fast.

22
00:01:02,255 --> 00:01:03,115
Okay, let's get started.
