Did you get an error? If you did, don't worry.

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:06,960
That's what I would have expected. The thing is that

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,620
you created a new query and you deployed it straight

4
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:13,190
to app spot without the index. So, since the index

5
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:16,140
doesn't exist, the app really can't serve the query, so

6
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:19,050
you will get an error. Or did everything work just

7
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:22,310
fine. Hm. It's hard to say that's wrong if it

8
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:25,290
did, but it's not what I would have expected. You were

9
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:29,940
trying to execute a query for which an index doesn't exist. So, unless you

10
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:33,860
ran it on local host first, I really wouldn't have expected the query to work.
