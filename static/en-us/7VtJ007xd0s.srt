1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,760
So what exactly do we need to
know to get a widget working?

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:07,620
How does the launcher even know we have
a widget the user could choose to add to

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:08,300
their home screens?

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,020
There's two main pieces.

5
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:16,726
An AppWidgetProvider XML file and
an AppWidgetProvider class.

6
00:00:16,726 --> 00:00:21,740
The AppWidgetProvider XML file Is what
describes your widget's attributes,

7
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:25,390
such as its size,
whether it can be resized, and

8
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:29,270
a preview image, which helps users get a
sense of what your widget will look like

9
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:31,910
before adding it to their home screen.

10
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:35,820
The AppWidgetProvider is
what holds all the logic for

11
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:39,980
creating the actual widget views,
filling the views with the correct data

12
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:43,490
and setting up the click listeners so
our widgets respond to touch.

13
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:46,440
One thing to keep in mind is that
users aren't limited to just

14
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:47,930
one instance of your widget.

15
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:50,520
They could have a bunch of
different sized widgets with

16
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,880
potentially different data.

17
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:57,570
That's one reasons why part of your
AppWidgetProviderInfo can specify

18
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:59,280
a configuration activity,

19
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:04,709
a special one-time setup activity that
appears when users select your widget.

20
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:06,130
Well, we won't use this for Sunshine.

21
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:07,250
You can imagine,

22
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:11,650
if Sunshine supported multiple locations
at once, we could use a configuration

23
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:16,480
activity to select which location we
wanted to display in each widget.

24
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,344
So, let's start simple.

25
00:01:19,344 --> 00:01:23,210
We'll build the one by one version of
our today widget with some static data,

26
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:28,750
say sunny and 76 degrees Fahrenheit,
a nice 24 Celsius.

27
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:31,730
What would our app widget
provider info look like?

28
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:34,970
In fact,
there's only a few required attributes.

29
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:38,020
First here is initialLayout.

30
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:41,788
This is the XML layout
to be used by default.

31
00:01:41,788 --> 00:01:42,954
minHeight and

32
00:01:42,954 --> 00:01:47,580
minWidth are what determine how many
cells in the launcher are used.

33
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:52,230
Note that the number and size of cells
can change based on the device or

34
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:53,420
launcher being used.

35
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:58,180
A good rule of thumb is this formula,
which works well for

36
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:00,020
all default launchers.

37
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:02,800
In any case, you should build your
widget such that it's flexible

38
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:06,600
enough to support slight
variations in the size available.

39
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:11,310
The last attribute, you can see here,
is the updatePeriodMillis.

40
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:16,320
By default, the system will wake up your
device at approximately this interval,

41
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:19,860
and call your app widget
provider update your widget,

42
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:22,860
with a minimum update
period of a half hour.

43
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:24,280
However, if you have static data,

44
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:28,850
you don't want to wake up
the data if it's in deep sleep.

45
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:33,180
Or, if you have another component
already controlling the flow of new data

46
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:37,384
into your app, such as
Sunshine Sync Adapter, you can use 0 to

47
00:02:37,384 --> 00:02:41,410
disable this functionality and
prevent unnecessary work.

48
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:42,710
That's all we need to get started.
