1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:03,180
So why do we care about how far light can travel

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:05,670
in one nanosecond? If you know what kind of processor you

3
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:08,950
have, and if you have a Mac, you can find this

4
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:14,290
by selecting from the Apple menu, About this Mac. They'll be

5
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:16,600
instructions on the website how you can do this for other

6
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,400
operating systems. But you'll see a window like this appear that

7
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,940
will tell you what kind of processor you have. And if

8
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:25,540
you zoom that a little bit you can see that we have

9
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:29,790
a 2.7 GHZ Intel Core processor. What GHZ stands

10
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:32,549
for is gigahertz. Which means that we can do 2.7

11
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:36,120
billion cycles in each second. So that means the

12
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,750
time we have for one cycle. Is actually less than

13
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:41,260
a nanosecond, and you can think of a cycle

14
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:44,080
as the time that computer has to do one step.

15
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:47,650
So it does one step 2.7 billion times in

16
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:51,140
a second, that means the time for each cycle is

17
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:54,460
1 divided by 2.7 nanoseconds. So that means

18
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:56,486
in the time that computer has for one cycle,

19
00:00:56,486 --> 00:01:00,240
light travels 11.1 centimeters. So how far is

20
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:03,840
that? So, let's have a little scale here. If

21
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,790
we have a dollar bill, that's actually quite

22
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:10,749
a bit longer than 11.1 centimeters. 11.1 centimeters is

23
00:01:10,749 --> 00:01:14,190
about three quarters of the way across the bill.

24
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:17,300
So within the time light can travel that distance,

25
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:20,510
the computer's gotta finish processing one cycle,

26
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:23,000
finish at least part of an instruction. This

27
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,560
should give you some idea of how fast

28
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,420
the computer is operating, and this is part

29
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:30,370
of the reason the processor has to be so small. If the processor was bigger than

30
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:33,760
11 centimeters, we couldn't even send light across

31
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,360
the processor in the time for one cycle.
