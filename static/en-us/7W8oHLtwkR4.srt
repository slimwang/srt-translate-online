1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:02,990
In short, when we render images to the screen.

2
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:06,310
A pixel layout dimensions may well not equal a pixel

3
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:08,920
in real device terms. And that relationship isn't a

4
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:11,530
fixed one either. Here, we have the same page on

5
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:14,430
two different devices. But even though the image is

6
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:19,320
approximately the same size on both devices, this image only

7
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,830
needs less than half the pixels of this image

8
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:25,600
to be rendered at one to one. Rendering an image

9
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,290
at one to one gives the best quality. But even

10
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:30,610
more important, you don't want to be pushing a lot more

11
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:34,060
bits down with the network than the device can use, and

12
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:36,150
you don't want to have poor image quality because you're not

13
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:40,620
pushing anywhere near enough high resolution imagery either. The best

14
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:42,790
way to think about this is that it's much like the

15
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:47,500
difference between standard definition tv and high definition tv. For most

16
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,640
of my life I watched standard definition tv, but now that

17
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,990
I watch most shows in HD, when a show

18
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:56,260
is broadcast in standard def, I defininately feel like

19
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:58,600
I'm living like an animal. You need to deliver

20
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,530
an HD experience when the user's device supports it.
