00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,900
One of the cool things about real lenses is as I'm looking at a scene if I

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:09,020
want too, I can just change, a little bit the focus in and out.

3
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:12,050
Now for those of us who use cameras that just take pictures,

4
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:15,150
our goal is to put something in focus or out of focus et cetera, whatever.

5
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:16,450
If you're like Meghan,

6
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:20,170
who thinks static pictures are just like way old school and the only thing that

7
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:25,000
matters is video, then the idea of changing focus during video is interesting.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Generates something that's called pulling focus or

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,250
a focus pull, and you get this really cool effect.

10
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:32,500
And here you can see this picture of this, pretty sure that's the Water Temple

11
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,680
in San Francisco, somebody else might remember.

12
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,750
And there's the back end, that's of a duck, but

13
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:40,120
you can kind of see that it's shot through a fence.

14
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:45,330
And as I run the video, you can see how changing focus changes where, how far in

15
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:50,780
the scene, how far z has to be in order for it be in focus on the image plane.

16
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:51,500
And that's pretty cool.
