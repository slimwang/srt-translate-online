1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,945
And it turns out, the first one is still okay,

but the last two would have been abnormal.

3
00:00:05,718 --> 00:00:08,161
And the reason is when you work out the Delta T

4
00:00:08,161 --> 00:00:10,946
in percent, you find that this one over here is a

5
00:00:10,946 --> 00:00:14,006
0.104% change, but it’s just too much for a single

6
00:00:14,006 --> 00:00:17,444
trade. And this one is an amazing 2.3% change

7
00:00:17,444 --> 00:00:20,735
within a single trade. And those clearly trigger

00:00:20,735 --> 00:00:24,735
the abnormality behavior. Let’s look at the data.
