The hardest thing about solving problems is often just figuring out how to get

00:00:03,035 --> 00:00:06,337
started. So let's start with a quiz. What's the first thing we should do when

3
00:00:06,337 --> 00:00:10,170
confronted with a problem like this one? The choices are, start writing code.

4
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:13,246
Make sure that we understand the problem. Search Google, or Duck, Duck Go, if

5
00:00:13,246 --> 00:00:17,471
you prefer, for the answer. Work out an algorithm that solves it. Check the one

00:00:17,471 --> 00:00:18,449
that you think is best.
