00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:04,250
Okay Michael, so I would like to give you a quick quiz.

2
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:04,640
>> Thanks.

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:07,420
>> You're welcome, Michael. I'm about helping others. Okay, so

4
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:08,710
here's the problem. Let me set it up for you.

5
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:10,500
You let me know if the, if, if the question

6
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,240
doesn't make any sense. Okay, so we have a set of

7
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:16,180
fea, we have a problem, we have a learning problem

8
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:18,730
that has four features in the input space, and I'm labeling

9
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:21,240
them a, b, c, and d. And here's a table

10
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:25,550
that has some training data. You'll notice that it's all binary,

11
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:27,640
I'm representing the binary as zeroes and ones

12
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,760
here, and that's the space that they're in. And

13
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,870
I have a label, minus or plus, which you

14
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:34,450
could also think of as zeroes and ones. Okay?

15
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:35,160
>> Okay.

16
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,140
>> And, here's what I want you to do. I want

17
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:41,380
you to find the smallest subset of features of a, b,

18
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:46,810
c, and d, that's sufficient to get zero training error, for

19
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:51,110
these two different learning algorithms, decision trees, the first one, and

20
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:55,160
the second is perceptron, but a very simple perceptron

21
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:58,350
where you simply have w transpose x greater than

22
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:01,960
zero. If it's greater than zero, you return positive.

23
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,379
If it's zero or less, you return negative. Got it?

24
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:06,840
>> I think so, yeah.

25
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:10,480
>> Okay, and so what I have out here are a bunch of checkboxes and I want you

26
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:13,520
to check off the variables that you need, or

27
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,170
the features that you need, in order to allow decision

28
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:19,230
tree to get zero training error or to

29
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:22,490
allow the simple perceptron to get zero training error.

30
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:24,050
>> And are we supposed to do this thinking of

31
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:26,570
it as a filtering thing or a wrapping thing, or?

32
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:27,570
>> Yes.

33
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:31,740
>> I see, so you just want to ans, us to answer the question.

34
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:35,540
>> yes. I want to answer the question and as a hint,

35
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:38,040
you should be thinking about this as a filtering or wrapping problem.

36
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:41,290
>> [LAUGH] I was kind of hoping you would tell me

37
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:42,030
which of those two.

38
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:45,410
>> Well let's see, you were really good

39
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:47,540
at picking filtering, so think about it as filtering.

40
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:50,070
>> Oh, okay.

41
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:52,950
>> So, so, I'm not going to ask you, I'm not going to require as a part

42
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:53,880
of the quiz, that you tell me

43
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,630
what criterion you were using, information gain, or

44
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:58,750
entropy, or variance, or anything like that,

45
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:00,390
but when you give me the answer, I'm

46
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:01,240
going to ask you to explain it to

47
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,080
me, because I'm curious what you're thinking, okay?

48
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:06,120
>> Okay, but I'm allowed to use the label to answer it too?

49
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:09,288
>> Yes, you're allowed to use the label if you want to, if you

50
00:02:09,288 --> 00:02:09,919
think it's necessary.

51
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:12,510
>> Right, because filtering methods, I, well I guess you

52
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:14,270
said that they, they can have access to the label.

53
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:15,059
>> Yes.

54
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:16,520
>> Okay.

55
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,550
>> You got it?

56
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:19,330
>> I think so, yeah, yeah.

57
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:21,450
>> Alright, good. Okay, okay. Well so, go.
