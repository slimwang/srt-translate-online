1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:04,741
Now, let's look at how nature and nurture affect IQ. Identical twins share 100%

2
00:00:04,741 --> 00:00:10,241
of their genetic make up. They're genetically identical. Fraternal twins share

3
00:00:10,241 --> 00:00:16,390
only 50% of their genetic makeup. This is also true for siblings and parents.

4
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:21,901
So, you share 50% of your genetic makeup with each one of your parents. So 50%

5
00:00:21,901 --> 00:00:27,531
with your mom and 50% with your dad. And you share 25% of your genetic makeup

6
00:00:27,531 --> 00:00:33,593
with your grandparents. Aunt, uncles, nieces and nephews. And people you are

7
00:00:33,593 --> 00:00:38,394
not related to? Well, you guessed it, you share 0% of your genetic make up with

8
00:00:38,394 --> 00:00:43,812
that. So we can turn these percentages into numbers ranging from 0 not related

9
00:00:43,812 --> 00:00:49,402
to 1 being identical twins, this is called genetic relatedness. Now,

10
00:00:49,402 --> 00:00:53,884
environment has to vary too. Typically, biological parents and children live in

11
00:00:53,884 --> 00:00:57,752
the same household. But that doesn't necessarily mean they have the exact same

12
00:00:57,752 --> 00:01:02,056
environment, but it is very similar. Now of course, there's also cases where

13
00:01:02,056 --> 00:01:07,420
biological parents and siblings are raised completely separate from each other.

14
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:11,524
For example, when people are adopted. Now, let's look at a graph to show how IQ

15
00:01:11,524 --> 00:01:16,198
is related to different types of nature and nurture. Here are our IQ

16
00:01:16,198 --> 00:01:23,070
correlations. Remember, 0, 1, 2, 3, not very good. They're not really related.

17
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:27,642
But high correlations mean they're really similar. And here, we'll see if they

18
00:01:27,642 --> 00:01:31,942
share an environment or not. Meaning if they live together or if they don't. So

19
00:01:31,942 --> 00:01:36,830
first, lets look at identical twins. They have a one on genetic relatedness.

20
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:40,370
Here we can see that identical twins who were raised together have a 0.85

21
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:45,410
correlation between IQ scores. So because they're genetically identical, and

22
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:49,790
they were raised in the same environment, their IQ scores are really similar.

23
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:53,330
But we know nature matters because identical twins who also have a one in

24
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:57,224
genetic relatedness because they're genetically identical, but were raised

25
00:01:57,224 --> 00:02:03,288
apart. So they didn't share the same environment, have a 0.75 IQ correlation.

26
00:02:03,288 --> 00:02:07,128
Meaning they're still really similar, but not as close as if they were to live

27
00:02:07,128 --> 00:02:13,948
together. Now, let's look at genetic relatedness of 0.5. Meaning sharing 50% of

28
00:02:13,948 --> 00:02:18,810
your genetic makeup. So fraternal twins share 50% of their genetic makeup.

29
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:22,116
Those who were raised together, so they shared an environment have a

30
00:02:22,116 --> 00:02:27,538
correlation of about 0.6. So that's pretty related. However, if they're raised

31
00:02:27,538 --> 00:02:33,139
apart, it goes just below .4. Showing that environment does play a big factor

32
00:02:33,139 --> 00:02:38,251
in IQ. Siblings again, who you share 50% of your makeup with. Those who are

33
00:02:38,251 --> 00:02:43,344
raised together with a shared environment have just below a .5 correlation. So,

34
00:02:43,344 --> 00:02:47,972
it's not very related. However, if the siblings were raised apart, so they

35
00:02:47,972 --> 00:02:53,596
didn't share an environment. This significantly drops to just above a 0.2,

36
00:02:53,596 --> 00:02:58,308
which is a really low correlation. And parents who raise their children, so

37
00:02:58,308 --> 00:03:03,320
sharing an environment with them again have less than a 0.5 correlation.

38
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:08,720
However when they didn't share an environment, again it drops to about a 0.2.

39
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:13,908
These show the importance of environment. Now, lets look at adoption. So these

40
00:03:13,908 --> 00:03:19,046
people have 0 genetic relatedness but they share the same environment. So

41
00:03:19,046 --> 00:03:23,306
adopted siblings are just above a .3 in their IQ correlation and adopted

42
00:03:23,306 --> 00:03:29,026
parents are just below a .2 in their correlation. Even thought they shared the

43
00:03:29,026 --> 00:03:33,060
same environment, they didn't have a very strong correlation among IQ scores.

44
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:37,338
That shows us that genetics are an important factor too. The formal conclusion

45
00:03:37,338 --> 00:03:40,872
of these studies says about 50% of the differences between people's

46
00:03:40,872 --> 00:03:45,964
intelligence is due to genetic influence. In about 40%, its due to

47
00:03:45,964 --> 00:03:52,072
environmental effects. That leaves 10% being unexplained. So we just don't know

48
00:03:52,072 --> 00:03:52,489
yet.
