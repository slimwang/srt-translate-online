1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:04,650
A movable character and a moving
obstacle to avoid are both correct.

2
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:07,820
Creating a variety of obstacles
like water and trains and

3
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:10,660
creating more characters
are all extra features.

4
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:11,700
Things that you can add later.

5
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:15,820
They would be nice to have but
aren't required for our game foundation.

6
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:19,450
At its simplest, this game is
basically a move and avoid game.

7
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:22,220
So those are the features that
need to be included in our minimum

8
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:22,930
viable product.
