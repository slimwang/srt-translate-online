1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:01,340
I'll start with style.

2
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:03,469
There are no style calculations here,

3
00:00:03,469 --> 00:00:06,070
because the element
styles are already known.

4
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:08,650
So, on the screen resize event,

5
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:11,180
the styles are actually
applied through layout.

6
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:13,810
And as you just learned,
if the browser runs layout,

7
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:17,420
it also has to paint the elements in
their new positions on the page, and

8
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:18,970
then composite them together.

9
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:22,910
There are actually exceptions to
the lack of style here, however.

10
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:26,340
If there was a resize handler
that changed the style, or

11
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:28,570
if a media query break point was hit,

12
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:31,470
then the browser would actually
have to recalculate styles.

13
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:33,890
But that's not happening here,
so don't check that box.
