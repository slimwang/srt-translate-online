1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Let's start with the MLE.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Obviously, it's 1 out of 4. It's 0.25.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Now, let's move to the Laplace estimator.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
The way I defined the fake data is that I added a data point for each possible of the 6 outcomes for the die.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,000
The answer should be 0.2 with 6 fake data points--1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 99:59:59,999
We get to observe the outcome 1 twice and that gives us 2 over 10 or 0.2.
