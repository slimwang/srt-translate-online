00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:02,740
Let's make some improvements to our scatter plot. This

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:05,080
time we're going to start by switching from the qplot

3
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:09,590
syntax to the more formal and verbose ggplot syntax.

4
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:12,530
I mention this in Lesson 3. The ggplot syntax will

5
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:16,149
let us specify more complicated plots. So just as

6
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:18,690
a reminder, this is the qplot syntax in order

7
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:21,970
to create the scatter plot. Ggplot is another plotting

8
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:26,180
function similar to qplot, and it has slightly different syntax.

9
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:29,560
Here's the equivalent code to produce this scatter plot. The main

10
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:32,740
difference between qplot and ggplot is that we have to say

11
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:35,610
what type of geom or chart type that we want. In

12
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:38,335
this case, we want a scatter plot. So we're going to use the

13
00:00:38,335 --> 00:00:40,760
geom_point. You can see the full list of chart types in

14
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:44,550
the ggplot reference, which is linked in the instructor notes. The second

15
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:48,160
big difference between the two plotting functions is that ggplot uses

16
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,760
this aes wrapper. We have to wrap our x and y variables

17
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,030
inside this aesthetic wrapper. Don't worry about this too much.

18
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:57,449
We'll cover this in more depth later. Now, I want to

19
00:00:57,449 --> 00:00:59,573
get some ranges on my age, so I'm going to run

20
00:00:59,573 --> 00:01:02,169
the summary command on age to figure out the lower and

21
00:01:02,169 --> 00:01:05,909
upper limits. The minimum age of a user is 13,

22
00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:10,588
and the maximum is 113. Now, let's click the x-axis

23
00:01:10,588 --> 00:01:13,753
at age 90 and at age 13. This seems reasonable

24
00:01:13,753 --> 00:01:16,585
since users who are younger than 13 are not permitted to

25
00:01:16,585 --> 00:01:19,882
use Facebook. And we're really not that confident whether people who

26
00:01:19,882 --> 00:01:22,562
report being older than age 90 are telling the truth. To

27
00:01:22,562 --> 00:01:25,724
do this, we're going to use the xlim layer. Now I'm

28
00:01:25,724 --> 00:01:29,216
not going to pass xlim into ggplot. Instead, I'm going to use it

29
00:01:29,216 --> 00:01:32,300
as an additional layer outside of it. Notice that we use

30
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:35,740
the plus operator to add a new layer to our figure.

31
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:39,050
And this is going to change the appearance of our x-axis. I

32
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:41,810
really recommend that you add one layer at a time when building

33
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:46,110
up plots. This allows you to debug and find any broken code. And there we

34
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:50,260
go. There's a nicer plot with our users ranging from 13 to 90 years old.
