1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,660
Well, this is one of these funny things.

2
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:03,700
Hm.

3
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:06,300
Well, these certainly true.

4
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:07,470
Okay.

5
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:09,740
Yes, I could remove the noise if you told me what the noise is.

6
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:11,410
But nobody ever tells you what the noise is.

7
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:13,750
Because if they did, they would have removed it in the first place.

8
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:15,140
So you don't know what the noise is.

9
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:17,410
You just know the statistics of the noise.

10
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:20,500
And then, here is one that's interesting.

11
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,400
False, because additive noise destroys information.

12
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,645
Well, if you have just plain addition, and

13
00:00:25,645 --> 00:00:28,446
the addition works, then that statement is not true.

14
00:00:28,446 --> 00:00:29,720
And so, C would be wrong.

15
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:34,560
But, suppose you have a limit between 0 and 255 or even 0 to 1.

16
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:37,569
If your noise pushes you beyond the limits and you clip.

17
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,900
You've lost that information.

18
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:43,870
So sometimes when you add noise you get these nonlinearities.

19
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:45,040
But in general,

20
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:49,780
we can't remove the noise because we don't know what the noise was.

21
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:51,670
If we did, we could just subtract it.
