1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,630
You can track exceptions and
crashes in Google Analytics.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,220
So in the dashboard, you would go to
Behavior > Crashes and Exceptions.

3
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:12,560
And the exceptions are grouped
by the app version number.

4
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:15,340
You could drill down with
the different version numbers.

5
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:19,050
And see, I had a NoSuchMethodException
and a NumberFormatException.

6
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:24,860
So you can track caught exceptions and
uncaught exceptions.

7
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:29,650
So to track exceptions that get caught,
you need to send an exception hit.

8
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:34,940
And you use ExceptionBuilder to build
a hit, and you set the description and

9
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:37,600
you setFatal, whether or
not it's fatal, and that's boolean.

10
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,720
And then you build the hit and send it.

11
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:43,770
And for uncaught exceptions,
you can't add code,

12
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:47,655
obviously, because you don't know where
in the code the exceptions occur.

13
00:00:47,655 --> 00:00:52,565
However, you can enable automatic
tracking for uncaught exceptions.

14
00:00:52,565 --> 00:00:57,845
And to do this you set
ga_reportUncaughtExceptions

15
00:00:57,845 --> 00:01:01,430
to true in the tracker config file.

16
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:04,709
I just want to mention that there have
been some issues about sending hits for

17
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:06,140
uncaught exceptions.

18
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:09,180
The issue tracker links in
the instructor notes below and

19
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,830
I leave it to you to setup tracking for
exceptions if you want.
