1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
All right. That just about wraps it up.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I hope you enjoyed the course.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
We certainly enjoyed putting it together for you.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Before we sign off, I want do to a few thank yous.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I want to thank Sebastian Thrun for inviting me to do the course

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
and for giving me this opportunity.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I want to thank the smart and energetic staff at Udacity who provided

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
support of various kinds in creating and delivering the course.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
And I'll single out Katie, Kathleen, Clark, Calvin, and Grant.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Grant, I guess, couldn't manage to get a K on the front of his name. We'll call him Krant.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
All of whom were just a delight to work with.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Thanks also to Mor Naaman, a professor at Rutgers,

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
who gave me some hints about how to gather social network data,

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
and of course the experts who participated in my interviews,

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Andrew Goldberg, Vukosi Marivate, Duncan Watts, Peter Winkler, and Tina Eliassi-Rad.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
They graciously shared their time and their knowledge in their interviews.

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
A big thanks to Eliot Escher, who gave me feedback on my vocal performance

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
in the song and also contributed her own beautiful voice to the music video.

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
You can probably figure out which one was her.

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I want to thank David Evans at Udacity for providing very detailed feedback

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
on my lecture notes to make this as Udacity-ish as possible,

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
even though this was my very first time.

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I want to thank my family for putting up with this extra drain on my time,

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
and finally, thanks to the class T.A. Job Evers,

25
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
who made the course happen day after day.

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
So, good luck to all of you on the final.

27
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
It's been a great experience for me, and I hope to see you around.
