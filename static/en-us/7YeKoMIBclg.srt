00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,500
What's going on with Anaglyphs?

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:05,370
Well basically, what we have is we have
patterns like this, and if you have

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:09,710
a glass like this, basically what's
happening is we can close the one eye,

4
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:13,980
and then close the left, and basically
you see different images pop up, right?

5
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:16,960
So in essence what this happens
is when you put a filter,

6
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,640
red filter selectively passes
only the red color information.

7
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,390
And the cyan filter basically only
lets the cyan information go through.

8
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:28,050
And of course,
then the brain attempts to do fusion.

9
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:32,100
So this is what actually is interesting
and lets actually play around with this.
