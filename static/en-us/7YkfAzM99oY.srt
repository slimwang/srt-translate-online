00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,052
Remember that the complex number a plus bi can be graphed on this coordinate

2
00:00:05,052 --> 00:00:10,039
plane as the point a,b. So, we need to figure out how each of these points is

3
00:00:10,039 --> 00:00:14,996
written in this form, or what a and b are each equal to. The number 7 is equal

4
00:00:14,996 --> 00:00:19,999
to 7 plus 0i, if you want to write it like this. So it should be the point 7,0,

5
00:00:19,999 --> 00:00:25,341
which is c over here. This makes sense. This is a real number, so it's written

6
00:00:25,341 --> 00:00:30,623
strictly along the real axis. A similar thing happens for negative 7i, which is

7
00:00:30,623 --> 00:00:35,617
just an imaginary number. Here, a is equal to 0 since there's no real part to

8
00:00:35,617 --> 00:00:41,026
this number, so its coordinates should be 0, negative 7, which is this point e.

9
00:00:41,026 --> 00:00:45,790
Now, negative 7 plus 7i is already written in a plus bi form or it's already

10
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:51,777
recognizably written that way. So, its coordinates are negative 7, 7, which is

11
00:00:51,777 --> 00:00:52,460
point h.
