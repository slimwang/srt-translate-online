1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
How do we compute such statistical correlations?

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Pearson correlation coefficient is

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
perhaps the best known indicator of correlation,

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
but this is suitable only for linear dependents.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
That is if you have 2 ranges of values.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
What we want instead is a correlation

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
between 2 binary values.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
On 1 side we have the outcome of the run,

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
either fail or pass.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
And then for each line we know that it's either covered or uncovered.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
And we want to come up with a correlation

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
between coverage on one side,

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
and outcome of the run on the other side.

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
So the Pearson correlation coefficient is not appropriate for this.

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
But there is another measure for such correlation,

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
and it was also invented by Pearson.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
It's called the Phi coefficient.

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
The Phi coefficient starts with a table.

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
In this table you count how frequently

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
a line was covered in failing runs

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
as well as in passing runs.

22
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
And of course you also count how frequently

23
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
it was not covered in failing runs

24
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
as well as in passing runs.

25
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,000
These 4 values take the names N11, N10, N01, and N00, respectively.

26
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Where the first digit stands for covered versus uncovered,

27
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
and the second digit stands for fail versus pass.

28
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
You also compute sums over all rows

29
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
as well as sums over all columns

30
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
as well as the total sum of events.

31
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
This then is the Phi coefficient.

32
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
It consists of multiplying the values in the first diagonal

33
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
and subtracting the product of the second diagonal.

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
This is then normalized according to the

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
square root of the sums of the columns and rows.

36
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,000
The Phi coefficient is high if 1 diagonal has a high value

37
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
and the other diagonal has a low value.

38
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
If it is this diagonal, which has a high value that's down here,

39
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
then it becomes positive.

40
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
If it's this diagonal, which has a higher value,

41
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
then it becomes negative.

42
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
So the higher the value in 1 diagonal

43
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
and the lower the value in the other diagonal,

44
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
the stronger the correlation.

45
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Our plan now is we compute the Phi correlation for each line,

46
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
and then we rank the lines from high correlation to low correlation.

47
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
And we start, of course, with the strongest correlation.

48
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Let me illustrate how the Phi coefficient

49
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
is computed on a simple example.

50
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Let's assume that we have a line in our program and a number of runs.

51
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
In the first run, line 10 is executed, and the run fails.

52
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
So what we enter in the table for this line is that

53
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
we now have seen 1 instance where it covered and failed.

54
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Next thing that happens with this line is that it's

55
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
not covered and the run passes.

56
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
So we add a 1 in this part of the table.

57
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Next thing we see, it's covered and it fails.

58
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
So the value on that table becomes 2.

59
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
And then again, we see uncovered and it passes.

60
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
So now we have seen 2 instances

61
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
of the line being uncovered and passing.

62
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Let's assume these are just the 4 runs that we observe.

63
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Then we have seen no instance of the line being covered and passing

64
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
and no instance of the line being uncovered and failing.

65
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Let's quickly sum up the remaining rows and columns.

66
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
We have seen 2 instances where the line was covered

67
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
and 2 where it was uncovered.

68
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
We have seen 2 instances where it failed

69
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
and 2 instances where it passed.

70
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
The total number of events is 4.
