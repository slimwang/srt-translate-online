1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:01,569
But there is one problem,

2
00:00:01,569 --> 00:00:04,710
what if there's a critical part of the
solution that is none of the parents?

3
00:00:06,209 --> 00:00:07,929
>> That could be an issue.

4
00:00:07,929 --> 00:00:10,330
Could also imagine that a critical piece

5
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:13,439
might be in a board that never
gets selected as a parent.

6
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:15,379
Like poor number 4 here, and

7
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:19,510
that critical piece gets bred out in
the early stages and never comes back.

8
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:20,710
How do we handle it?

9
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:22,039
>> More randomness.

10
00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:23,050
>> How so?

11
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:24,929
>> Just like we have
mutations in biology,

12
00:00:24,929 --> 00:00:27,929
we're going to use mutations
in genetic algorithms.

13
00:00:27,929 --> 00:00:29,750
For each digit,
I'm going to have a small but

14
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:33,380
significant chance that the digit
will mutate into some other digit.

15
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:36,290
In the first child,
the five changes into a one.

16
00:00:36,289 --> 00:00:38,600
The second child does not
have any mutations and

17
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:41,620
the third and
fourth children each have one mutation.

18
00:00:41,619 --> 00:00:45,539
>> So this mutation step is like
occasionally choosing a random direction

19
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:46,979
and simulated annealing
>> Or

20
00:00:46,979 --> 00:00:49,429
the randomness in
stochastic beam search.

21
00:00:49,429 --> 00:00:50,640
>> Exactly.

22
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,700
>> And given enough generations and
mutations,

23
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:54,690
we expect to get the desired answer?

24
00:00:54,689 --> 00:00:55,409
>> Yep.

25
00:00:55,409 --> 00:00:58,479
And one of the things often reported
in genetic algorithms papers

26
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:01,519
is how many generations are needed
until we get a good answer.

27
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,880
>> Okay.
Now that we've seen all the components

28
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:06,420
of genetic algorithms,
it seems like a good time for a quiz.
