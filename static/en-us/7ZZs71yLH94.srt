00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:04,080
You just implemented the code, that both
allows you to see an initial messages

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,339
list and enables the user to see
any new messages sent in real time.

3
00:00:08,339 --> 00:00:09,169
Don't believe me?

4
00:00:09,169 --> 00:00:10,460
Let's see it in action.

5
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:13,250
Okay, so I see my initial messages list.

6
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:18,070
And I'm going to go ahead and reply
with a what's up, and I'll press Send.

7
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:20,089
I see that it showed up in our database,

8
00:00:20,089 --> 00:00:23,250
which causes it to immediately
appear in our friendly chat app.

9
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:23,850
Good work.
