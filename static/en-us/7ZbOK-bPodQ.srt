00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,416
All we need to do here is starting with this equation for the general volume of

2
00:00:04,416 --> 00:00:09,112
a box, substitute in each of these expressions for the height, length and width.

3
00:00:09,112 --> 00:00:13,492
So we end up with v of x equals the quantity 7 minus 2x, times the quantity 5

4
00:00:13,492 --> 00:00:18,120
minus 2x times x. Now of course you could multiply this out as well. And if you

5
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:23,994
go through the whole task of multiplying everything out, we end up with 4x cubed

6
00:00:23,994 --> 00:00:29,347
minus 24x squared plus 35x. Either way though, is a totally fine form. In fact,

7
00:00:29,347 --> 00:00:31,890
I almost prefer this factored version.
