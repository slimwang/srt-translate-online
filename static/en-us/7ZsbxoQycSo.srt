00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:03,140
One of the most amazing things about the mobile

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:06,750
platform is the incredible array of sensors these devices typically

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:09,670
have. This phone has a camera that can take

4
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:12,960
stills and video, has audio input and output, it has

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,540
a GPS, a compass, a tilt sensing accelerometer. Far

6
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:20,950
more sensors than a desktop or laptop typically has. And

7
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:23,240
all this, in a device that I'm typically holding

8
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:26,120
in the palm of my hand. This enables the mobile

9
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:31,270
platform to play host to incredibly engaging and interactive user experiences.
