1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,480
So the answer, the first one is a valid string; it

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,970
has a double quote followed by another double quote, and a sequence

3
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:09,670
of characters between the double quotes. The second one is not

4
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:13,540
a valid string, and the reason it's not is because it starts

5
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:16,900
with a single quote, but ends with a double quote. A

6
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:19,660
valid string must start with the same kind of quote it ends

7
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:23,130
with. The third one is also not a valid string, and

8
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:25,550
the reason for that is it starts with a double quote but

9
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:29,810
there's no double quote that closes the string. The fourth

10
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:33,540
one is a name, this is a variable, it's possible it

11
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:36,720
could be defined to be a valid string, but without defining

12
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:39,619
Ada as some string, it's not a valid string by itself.

13
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:44,130
The surprising one, might be the last one. This

14
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:47,070
is a valid string, it starts with a single

15
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:49,410
quote, it ends with a single quote and it's

16
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:51,860
perfectly okay to have a double quote in the middle.
