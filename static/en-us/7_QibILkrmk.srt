00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,680
What do we do for crash recovery? Suppose the system

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:06,800
crashes and come back. Treat it just like an abort. Recover

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:09,975
the old image from the undo log. Remember that undo

4
00:00:09,975 --> 00:00:12,460
log will survive crashes, because it is in the RIO file

5
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:16,170
cache. So if the system crashes and comes back up,

6
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:19,030
you see there is an undo log. Take that undo log,

7
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:22,330
apply it to the virtual address space that it corresponds

8
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:25,450
to. You're back in business again. Could there be a crash

9
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:31,270
during crash recovery? No problem with that. Because of idempotency of recovery,

10
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:32,870
there's no problem in dealing with

11
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:35,080
crash that might happen during crash recovery.
