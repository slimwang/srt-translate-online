1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:04,900
We'll be representing colors using
a color class provided by libGDX.

2
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:09,260
To find out how it works, let's
check out the libGDX documentation.

3
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:13,698
You can find the libGDX website
at libGDX.badlogicgames.com, or

4
00:00:13,698 --> 00:00:16,219
just by searching of course.

5
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:18,370
There's a link to
the documentation in the nav bar.

6
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:20,960
Let's click it then,
if we scroll down a bit,

7
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,660
we find a whole bunch
of awesome resources.

8
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:25,570
But, what we're looking for is number 8.

9
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:26,476
Read the Javadocs.

10
00:00:28,613 --> 00:00:30,750
And now,
to find information on the Color class.

11
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:33,150
We can just search the page for a color.

12
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:33,810
There we go.

13
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:34,470
Let's check it out.

14
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:38,560
Awesome.
We've got a color class holding the RGB

15
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:41,970
and alpha components as
floats in the range 0 to 1.

16
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:45,470
Scrolling down we see that there's
also a whole bunch of predefined color

17
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:46,140
constants.

18
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,539
Why don't you go check out
the libGDX color documentation and

19
00:00:50,539 --> 00:00:54,408
see if you can figure out which of these
is not a predefined color constant?

20
00:00:54,408 --> 00:00:57,711
Firebrick, periwinkle,
goldenrod or chartreuse.
