Let's wrap up this lesson with some practice. I want you to simplify each of

2
00:00:03,732 --> 00:00:08,750
these roots and write your answer in the corresponding box. You'll want to use

3
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:12,780
your knowledge of simplifying numbers and variables. Also, pay particular

4
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:16,410
attention to the type of root you're taking. In this last one, you're taking a

5
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:17,523
fifth root.
