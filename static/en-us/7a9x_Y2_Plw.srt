1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,970
And of course, this is a bit of a nitpicker question but it equals O(1.3câ‚„^n*n to some constant)

2
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:15,380
and the reason being is that 4/3 is equal to 1.3333, of course, this goes on infinitely,

3
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:18,280
and for O notation to be correct, of course, you have to round up,

4
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:20,630
no matter what the digit is that you're rounding.

5
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:24,930
So the expected running time for this algorithm here is actually exponential in n.

6
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:30,770
Now, you might be asking--well, okay, so we know that three SAT is solvable in exponential time,

7
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:34,410
now we introduce randomness, which means we're not even sure that we're finding

8
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:38,680
the satisfying assignment, at least not totally sure, and we're still ending up

9
00:00:38,680 --> 99:59:59,999
with exponential running time, so what's the deal here.
