1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Let's consider the first one, two fish of type 1 die.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
This expression pretty much looks like it,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
but then again it appears here with a plus sign for fâ‚‚,

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
so this rather models that fish of type 1 become fish of type 2 after a certain time.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Remember the SIR model for contagious diseases

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
where a person is moved from one compartment to another compartment.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
No, fish of type 1 don't die. It's rather that we have two types of fish.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The first type becomes the second type after a while--young fish and mature fish.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
This growth rate can model both births and deaths.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
It takes care of the difference, so in a way

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
we have taken care of deaths and births from the beginning.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
What about our fish of type 2--harvested or not?

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
We've already explained the first term. What about the second one?

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
At least, this is not constant harvesting.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:03,000
For constant harvesting, we should be subtracting constant rate so and so many tons per year.

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
This could be, however, harvesting that's proportional to the

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
actual amount of fish, maybe just every second fishes being harvested,

18
00:01:13,000 --> 99:59:59,999
All in all, however, the second term looks like that fish of type 2 died of old age.
