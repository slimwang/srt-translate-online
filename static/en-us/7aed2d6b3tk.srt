00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,520
Now that we know how to run
a simple sample, and how it looks,

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:07,590
let's talk about what notification
features are possible on Android Wear.

3
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:12,150
The first thing we can do is add extra
action buttons to a notification.

4
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:16,020
The user can view these actions by
swiping the notification to the left.

5
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:19,630
These actions are also visible on
the phone notification as well, so

6
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:21,790
this is not wearable specific.

7
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:24,990
So you make a call to
the addAction method

8
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:27,340
of the notification compact builder.

9
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:29,600
You need to supply an icon to use, and

10
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:32,470
you also need to provide
a string to show underneath, and

11
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:36,680
finally you'll need to provide a pending
intent for the specific action.

12
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:39,170
You'll notice that this code
snippet creates a pending intent

13
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:41,738
that refers to a location, so

14
00:00:41,738 --> 00:00:44,700
it would open up a mapping application
to display this on the phone.

15
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,490
It is important to realize that
notifications created on the phone

16
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:53,140
always cause the intent to run on
the phone as well, not the wearable.

17
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:55,840
It's also possible to have different
actions appear on the wearable

18
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,550
device compared to
the actions on the phone.

19
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:01,980
To do this, we introduce a class
called WearableExtender for

20
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:04,319
wearable specific
features we want to use.

21
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:08,540
We use the extend method of
NotificationCompat.Builder, and

22
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:11,530
pass in the new WearableExtender object.

23
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:15,420
With WearableExtender,
we call addAction here

24
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:18,970
to add the wearable specific action,
which is defined here.

25
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:24,060
Note that when you use addAction
with the WearableExtender,

26
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:27,740
none of the regular addAction calls
will show up on the wearable, and

27
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:30,710
none of the wearable addAction
calls will be shown on the phone.

28
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:32,060
They're decoupled from each other now.
