1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,340
To answer this first question,
let's take a look at the database.

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:06,100
As JP showed us,
I can actually click here on list name,

3
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:08,720
which is the specific piece of
data that I'm interested in.

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:13,290
And up here, I can actually see
the URL that is specifically related

5
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:15,050
to the list name piece of data.

6
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:16,835
Here I've got the name
of my shopping list app,

7
00:00:16,835 --> 00:00:21,160
shoppinglistplspls.firebasedio.com, and
then we have the name of the key,

8
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,560
which is just listName.

9
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:27,780
So I can copy this, okay, and the next
question is, when the listener that's

10
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:30,655
attached to the list name is triggered,
what will you do with the data.

11
00:00:30,655 --> 00:00:33,645
We're going to want to
update the UI here.

12
00:00:33,645 --> 00:00:35,845
It has a couple of text views in here,

13
00:00:35,845 --> 00:00:39,165
which we'll probably want to
change using set text, and

14
00:00:39,165 --> 00:00:41,615
we can update that text view
using whatever the user entered.

15
00:00:41,615 --> 00:00:42,885
All right, let's get to it.
