00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,059
Half a kilometer and half a kilometer makes 1 full kilometer. I know 3 8ths is

2
00:00:04,072 --> 00:00:08,000
shorter than half a kilometer, and the same is true for 3 7ths. This would be

3
00:00:08,012 --> 00:00:12,315
the halfway point for 1 kilometer. So if I add two things that are less then one

4
00:00:12,327 --> 00:00:16,495
half, I can't get a full kilometer. You must have walked less than 1 kilometer.

00:00:16,592 --> 00:00:19,050
If you chose less than 1 kilometer, nice work.
