00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,375
So, what's the simplest polynomial function that we can create from the three

2
00:00:03,375 --> 00:00:07,666
factors we just found? Note that the only factors this polynomial function will

3
00:00:07,666 --> 00:00:11,684
have are these three, it won't have any others. You don't need to expand or

4
00:00:11,684 --> 00:00:15,183
simplify the expression, just write it in factored form right here.
