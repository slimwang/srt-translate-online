1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,691
The answer is 2 times the square root of 13. Great thinking if you found this

2
00:00:04,691 --> 00:00:08,902
number. We want to find the distance between these two points. So, we need to

3
00:00:08,902 --> 00:00:14,140
set up a right triangle with the vertical distance and the horizontal distance.

4
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:19,730
The horizontal distance between x equals negative 1 and x equals positive 3 is

5
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:25,870
4. We have to move four units in the x direction to get from x equals negative

6
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:31,983
1 to x equals positive 3. Now we need to find the vertical distance. We start

7
00:00:31,983 --> 00:00:35,287
at y equals 2, which is here, and then we go all the way up to y equals 8,

8
00:00:35,287 --> 00:00:40,965
which is here. So, this vertical distance on the y axis is a distance of 6

9
00:00:40,965 --> 00:00:46,584
units. Once we've found these two legs of our right triangle, we can use the

10
00:00:46,584 --> 00:00:52,203
Pythagorean theorem to find the hypotenuse. So, we'll have this leg squared,

11
00:00:52,203 --> 00:00:58,546
plus this leg squared, equals d squared, our hypotenuse. We solve this equation

12
00:00:58,546 --> 00:01:03,367
to get d squared equals 52. And then we take the square root of both sides to

13
00:01:03,367 --> 00:01:08,525
get d is equal to the square root of 52. Simplifying the square root of 52,

14
00:01:08,525 --> 00:01:15,012
we'll get d is equal to 2 times root 13. This is our simplified distance. And

15
00:01:15,012 --> 00:01:18,252
again, notice that the horizontal distance is simply the change in the x

16
00:01:18,252 --> 00:01:24,344
values. We went from x equals negative 1 to x equals 3. And notice that the

17
00:01:24,344 --> 00:01:29,113
vertical distance was the change in the y values. We went from y equals 2 all

18
00:01:29,113 --> 00:01:34,179
the way up to y equals 8. So, we'll have the change in y squared, plus the

19
00:01:34,179 --> 00:01:39,362
change in x squared equals d squared. We can use our algebra skills and

20
00:01:39,362 --> 00:01:41,080
eventually solve for d.
