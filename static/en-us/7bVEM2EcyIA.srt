00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,070
First I'll use Yeoman to quickly
generate a controller named brick.

2
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:06,120
I'll add this new
controller to the template

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:08,150
with the NG controller directive.

4
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:12,790
The controller is brick CTRL, and
I'll reference this instance as brick.

5
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:16,850
Now I'll copy over these values from
the template into the controller.

6
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:19,320
I want these values to be
pulled from the controller.

7
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:24,690
So I'll change green to brick.color and
wrap it in double curly braces.

8
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:29,210
Remember that this brick here comes from
this instance of the controller here.

9
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:31,250
Now I'll just update the other
values and I'm done.
