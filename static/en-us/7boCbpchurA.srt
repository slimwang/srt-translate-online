1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,330
So for quite a long time,
people built portfolios this way.

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:08,390
They would look at a bunch of assets,
essentially equally weight them,

3
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:12,440
and end up with a portfolio that
behaved somewhat in between.

4
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:16,370
Now, if you wanted a low-risk portfolio,

5
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:21,350
you should focus on assets
that are low risk out here.

6
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:23,400
If you wanted, for
instance, high return,

7
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,480
you should focus on assets over here.

8
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:31,250
In both those cases you would end
up with a portfolio, say, here, or

9
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:33,370
a portfolio, say, here.

10
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:35,560
Now, can we do better?

11
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:38,710
In other words, is it possible
to get portfolios over here?

12
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:44,860
So can we have a portfolio here
that has a return similar to

13
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:50,430
these assets over here, but
risk similar to these assets over here?

14
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:55,040
Indeed we can, and
it's due to a man named Harry Markowitz,

15
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:58,300
who won the Nobel Prize for his insight.

16
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:01,620
What he discovered, and
what people had been overlooking,

17
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:05,890
was the relationship between
stocks in terms of covariance.

18
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:09,380
So the resulting
performance of a portfolio,

19
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:13,740
especially in terms of risk,
is not just a factor, or

20
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:19,690
a blend of the various risks, but it has
to do with how they interact day to day.

21
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:24,210
So indeed, if we pick the right
stocks in the right proportions,

22
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:28,740
we can get a portfolio that
performs over here, that in fact,

23
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:33,970
can have lower risk than any
of the individual assets,

24
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:35,830
and I'll show you how to
do that in just a moment.

25
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:36,590
Now before I do that,

26
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:39,220
I want to mention though one other
thing about Harry Markowitz.

27
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:43,040
Up until the time of his discovery,

28
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,650
most people viewed bonds
as the lowest risk asset,

29
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:52,720
in other words, if you wanted low risk,
you should use bonds orly.

30
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,270
Markowitz showed that
a blend of stocks and

31
00:01:56,270 --> 00:02:00,970
bonds is actually lower risk than
either one of those by themselves.

32
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:02,630
And I'll show you how that
makes sense in a moment.
