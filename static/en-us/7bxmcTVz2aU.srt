1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,175
So going back to this term that we're
looking at earlier 5x times 7y times 2z, we can start

2
00:00:05,187 --> 00:00:10,300
to use what we just learned about
commutativity to rearrange all the factors

3
00:00:10,312 --> 00:00:15,100
that are multiplied together here, in
whatever way we want to. Now, what I

4
00:00:15,112 --> 00:00:20,125
really want in this case is for all the
variables to be on the back end of the

5
00:00:20,137 --> 00:00:25,525
term and all of the numbers. Are the
constant factors to be at the front of the

6
00:00:25,537 --> 00:00:31,435
term. So please write in these slots an
equivalent version of this term by filling

7
00:00:31,447 --> 00:00:36,540
in each slot with either a constant or a
variable. So, we're just going to

8
00:00:36,552 --> 00:00:42,219
rearrange these terms in an order like
this. Think about what answers are allowed

9
00:00:42,231 --> 00:00:42,983
because of the commutative property.
