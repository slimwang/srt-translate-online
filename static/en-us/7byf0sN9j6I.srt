1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,170
So as Doctor Rosenberg just discussed there were lot of applications of Ekman's

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:08,909
Research. First it demonstrated that emotion can be studied reliably and

3
00:00:08,909 --> 00:00:14,270
objectively through the face. And secondly it led directly to the development

4
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:18,950
of the Facial Action Coding System, anatomically based analysis of the human

5
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:25,190
face. And then lastly, FACS has been applied in many different settings, from

6
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:31,140
film animators to the development of a TV show called Lie to Me. Which was

7
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:32,671
based on Ekman's research

8
00:00:32,671 --> 00:00:37,092
>> But it's also been used very widely by emotion researchers themselves as well

9
00:00:37,092 --> 00:00:41,930
as people who study deception. So as you can see here, there's many

10
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:46,050
applications of emotion research. And now, we're going to go to Lauren who's

11
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:49,809
going to ask you another question about emotion and facial expression.
