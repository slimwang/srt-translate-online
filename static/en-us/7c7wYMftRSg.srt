1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,302
So this question's a little trickier than it seems, because we need to make it

2
00:00:04,302 --> 00:00:08,082
so if the two dates are the same, we should really get the result 0, not the

3
00:00:08,082 --> 00:00:12,618
exception. So the solution is to use a not and switch the order of the dates, so

4
00:00:12,618 --> 00:00:17,415
we're going to assert that the second date is not before the first date. Which

5
00:00:17,415 --> 00:00:20,986
is exactly what the requirement is here. So, now we've added the assertion. When

6
00:00:20,986 --> 00:00:25,195
we run this, instead of getting the value 0, we get an assertion error like

7
00:00:25,195 --> 00:00:29,178
this. Not a really friendly error message, for a regular user, but for a

8
00:00:29,178 --> 00:00:33,036
programmer this should help us a lot. It points us to the line in the code where

9
00:00:33,036 --> 00:00:36,273
the assertion failed and can look at that and understand what went wrong.
