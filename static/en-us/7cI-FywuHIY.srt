00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:02,570
All right, welcome back to computer vision.

2
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:06,660
We're going to to continue our discussion about frequency analysis and

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:11,020
how to study images with notion of frequency components.

4
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:14,260
If you remember last time we talked about the idea of

5
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:17,770
decomposing images based upon frequency.

6
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:20,280
And we motivated it by showing you this picture.

7
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:24,910
This is that famous Dali picture which when you allow the high frequency imagery

8
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:29,930
in there, you see a picture of a woman admiring the, the Mediterranean or

9
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:30,860
something like that.

10
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:34,990
But when you blur it, that is when you remove the high frequency you just

11
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:37,160
have the low frequency, it becomes a picture of Lincoln.

12
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:42,045
And this idea of how do we decompose images into thinking about what was

13
00:00:42,045 --> 00:00:44,860
going to be a basis set of that involved frequency and

14
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:50,830
the idea that a basis set was going to be some set of functions that

15
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:54,600
we're going to linearly span our possible signal.

16
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,995
So the idea is that we should build and make any possible signal out of

17
00:00:58,995 --> 00:01:03,030
this set, and that they are linearly independent so

18
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:06,518
I can ebb which basically allows me to do this summation.

19
00:01:06,518 --> 00:01:11,710
We're also going to end up within our Foginal basis set so that when you

20
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:16,420
change the amount of one basis element you don't get any change in the others.

21
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:20,058
And the basis set that we were talking about was this Fourier set, right?

22
00:01:20,058 --> 00:01:25,170
And the Fourier set basically decomposed things into sinusoids and they were

23
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:30,110
sinusoids here of increasing frequency that were sort of moving vertically and

24
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:35,090
horizontally, and the idea is that we could construct images doing this.

25
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:39,960
So related to that idea was this notion of what we call the Fourier Transform,

26
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:44,660
and the Fourier Transform was that you would put in a signal, showing it here in

27
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:49,370
1D, but also talk about it in 2D, and what you would get out was instead of f

28
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:53,650
as a function of x, that is the intensities of function of location,

29
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:59,490
you got out a F, cap F, as a function of I L Mayer, omega was frequency.

30
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:02,980
And the idea is that cap F would decompose into an even component and

31
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:06,960
an odd component being represented by complex numbers, and so this would

32
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:12,650
allow us to represent both the magnitude and the phase for a given frequency.

33
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:15,840
And if you wanted to, you could recover that magnitude and phase.

34
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,530
The magnitude is just the square root of the sum of the squares of each of

35
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:21,220
the real and imaginary component, and

36
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:25,040
the phase was just this arc tan of this relation.

37
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,900
To do the Fourier Transform is represented by this

38
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,630
sort of ugly looking integral.

39
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:32,660
Here I'm showing it to you in 1D, we'll do it again in a minute in 2D.

40
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:35,180
But the idea was you took your function and

41
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:38,220
you integrate from minus infinity to infinity.

42
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:42,560
And you multiplied it by sinusoids of whatever frequency and

43
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,140
sometimes frequencies omega.

44
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:46,020
When we're going to do it for two dimensions u and v,

45
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:47,680
so here's it's written as u.

46
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,390
And even though this does not look like a sinusoid,

47
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:55,960
you had to remember that e to the i k was cosine k plus i sine k.

48
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:59,160
So this is what allowed us to go from the spatial domain to

49
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,900
the frequency domain.

50
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:04,080
We also mentioned that you could inverse this, if you wanted to, right?

51
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,940
So if you give me the Fourier transform f of

52
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:11,420
u of a signal thereby just changing whether that's plus or

53
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:15,030
minus, I can do the integral and get back the original signal.

54
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:16,900
But now we have both u and v.

55
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,670
We also talked about the discrete version.

56
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:22,180
And we showed some examples here where you're taking the sums instead of

57
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:23,270
the integrals.

58
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:27,440
And most of the time, we're mostly interested in the power.

59
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,860
Remember, the square root of the sum of the squares?

60
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:31,450
And that's represented here.

61
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:32,430
So I might have a,

62
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:36,532
a signal that has a certain amount of even part and an odd part, or

63
00:03:36,532 --> 00:03:39,735
the real, imaginary, you take the square root of the sum of the squares and

64
00:03:39,735 --> 00:03:43,960
you got the magnitude, and the magnitude of the power is what we'll typically be

65
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:49,430
talking about when we talk about the presence of frequency with any given image.

66
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:50,750
We want to know the power of it.

67
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:53,140
The phase is important for doing reconstruction but

68
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:56,680
in general, we're not going to be doing a reconstruction.

69
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:00,230
So today, what we're going to do is in this lesson,

70
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:04,950
is we're just going to relate the Fourier transform to convolution.

71
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:06,930
And in particular, how it's,

72
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:11,180
how convolution in space is multiplication in frequency.

73
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:12,720
And let me show you how that works.
