00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,010
All of you detail-oriented people 
probably noticed that we never

2
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:07,190
actually used the coordinates we get
from the server for location,

3
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:11,460
relying instead on both the maps API, 
and the weather API to do the same thing

4
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:14,440
with location queries. 
Unfortunately,

5
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:18,680
they don't always agree. 
Implement maps using the coordinates

6
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:21,700
stored in the location table. 
You'll want to start

7
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:25,260
by moving the menu code 
from MainActivity to WeatherFragment.
