1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:00,910
So, essentially,

2
00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:04,810
we're already saying that we need to
do something about cyber security.

3
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:06,430
So how can that be done?

4
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:09,990
Making them go away is not
an easy thing obviously.

5
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:14,010
One thing we can do is we can
make sure that crime doesn't pay.

6
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:17,250
We're actually going to
talk about cyber laws.

7
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:20,180
But making threats go away is nice idea,

8
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:23,660
but it hasn't really
been all that effective.

9
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:25,770
You can reduce vulnerabilities, but

10
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:28,150
we're never going to have
zero vulnerabilities.

11
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:32,189
Complex systems, unfortunately,
always going to be error-prone, and

12
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:36,170
some of those errors are going to be
vulnerabilities that can be exploited.

13
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:40,960
The three things that you always talk
about when you talk about securing or

14
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,220
protecting access to information,
is the data

15
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:48,709
sensitive in the sense that it can not
be disclosed to unauthorized parties.

16
00:00:48,709 --> 00:00:51,850
Well that is really means
the data has what we call

17
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:54,090
a confidentiality requirement.

18
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:57,180
You want to stop and prevent disclosure.

19
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:01,620
It could be seen, but can only be seen
by those who are authorized to see it.

20
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:04,410
Another requirement is
what's called integrity,

21
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:08,200
that's really means that no one
should be able to corrupt it.

22
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:11,490
So maybe not sensitive in the sense
nobody should be able to see it

23
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:14,860
if they are not authorized, but
it could have integrity requirement.

24
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:18,220
Only authorized people should be
able to write it or modify it.

25
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:22,880
No one else should be able to change it,
and that is an integrity requirement.

26
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,430
The third requirement we have for
data is what's called availability.

27
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:30,470
The data is critical in the sense,
what we use it for is critical,

28
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:33,598
so if the data goes away in order to
be able to do something that's really

29
00:01:33,598 --> 00:01:34,840
important to us.

30
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:40,100
We can't access our online banking
services because the server has been

31
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:44,240
compromised, is down, or is a denial of
service attack, or something like that.

32
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,628
So these are called the CIA,
Confidentiality, Integrity, and

33
00:01:48,628 --> 00:01:51,994
Availability requirements for
sensitive data.

34
00:01:51,994 --> 00:01:55,620
So here we're only talking about data
which is sort of the cyber side.

35
00:01:55,620 --> 00:02:01,950
We should say that cyber attacks could
also have physical consequences.

36
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:04,580
So by successfully
attacking the computers,

37
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:07,692
we will be able to cause harm for
their physical system.

38
00:02:07,692 --> 00:02:13,290
Most well-known case of this is
the Stuxnet malware that infiltrated

39
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:18,460
the Iranian nuclear plant network,
and destroyed centrifuges, and so on.

40
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:22,385
So, that's an example where it's not
just this information disclosure, or

41
00:02:22,385 --> 00:02:23,277
corruption, but

42
00:02:23,277 --> 00:02:26,810
there's actually a physical
manifestation of a cyber attack.

43
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:29,610
When we say what should we do?

44
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:33,180
Well, we need to protect data and
we need to protect systems.
