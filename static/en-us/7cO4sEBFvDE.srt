In English, the word transform is a verb and means a dramatic change. Such as I

2
00:00:04,291 --> 00:00:09,455
saw the cube transform into a unicorn. I won't be using that form, I'll be using

3
00:00:09,455 --> 00:00:14,980
it as a noun, where transform is a mathematical term meaning an operation that

4
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:20,626
changes the position, orientation, or size and shape of an object. Transforms

5
00:00:20,626 --> 00:00:24,564
are a key part of computer graphics. In these lessons, I'll be explaining how

6
00:00:24,564 --> 00:00:27,906
transforms work. You probably didn't realize it, but you've already been using

7
00:00:27,906 --> 00:00:32,210
transforms in a few of the previous exercises. When you set the position of an

8
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:35,483
object, you were using a type of transform called a translation. We use

9
00:00:35,483 --> 00:00:39,753
transforms whenever we animate anything, objects, lights, or cameras. We're

10
00:00:39,753 --> 00:00:43,529
going to spend a fair a bit of time on transforms since they allow us to do so

11
00:00:43,529 --> 00:00:47,694
much. The study of transforms for computer graphics is associated with the field

12
00:00:47,694 --> 00:00:51,270
of linear algebra. This field is concerned with vector spaces and is usually

13
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:55,500
considered a prerequisite for any computer graphics programming course. If you

14
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:59,556
know a bit about linear algebra, great. Having a deeper and wider understanding

15
00:00:59,556 --> 00:01:03,178
of the subject will help. However, basic computer graphics needs just a few

16
00:01:03,178 --> 00:01:07,205
small bits of theory to get things going. My goal in these lessons ahead is to

17
00:01:07,205 --> 00:01:11,365
teach you the tools you'll need to quickly and effectively be able to control

18
00:01:11,365 --> 00:01:12,543
your virtual world.
