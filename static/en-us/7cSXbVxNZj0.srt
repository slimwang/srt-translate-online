00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Now let's take a look and see if we understand revenue streams.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
On the top we have some examples of revenue stream possibilities.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
We could have direct, ancillary, asset, usage, or subscription.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Why don't we match the best examples that go in each box.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Why don't you put the number that corresponds to what you think the best examples are

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,931
in the boxes underneath the revenue stream examples on the top.
