1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,940
Now you've seen how to query for
all of your data.

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:05,710
But in Sunshine, you'll also
want the ability to query for

3
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:08,150
just one day of weather to display.

4
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:11,199
So let's look at how you can modify
your query code to retrieve just

5
00:00:11,199 --> 00:00:11,869
one row of data.

6
00:00:13,009 --> 00:00:15,208
Let's think about this
in terms of SQL code.

7
00:00:15,208 --> 00:00:19,448
To select all the data in a table,
you write a select all query.

8
00:00:19,448 --> 00:00:21,890
And to narrow down the number
of rows that are returned,

9
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:23,920
you can use a WHERE clause.

10
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,640
A WHERE clause retrieves data
only when it fits some criteria.

11
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:31,480
For tasks, this could be only
tasks with priority equal to one.

12
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,759
Or that fit a certain description.

13
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:37,030
And to retrieve a single row of data,
you have to ask for

14
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:39,534
it with a unique criteria
which is its id.

15
00:00:39,534 --> 00:00:40,942
This is all well and good,

16
00:00:40,942 --> 00:00:44,960
but how can do the same thing
using only our provider query?

17
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,759
Well, a provider will translate method
calls into the correct SQL code

18
00:00:48,759 --> 00:00:50,500
to interact with data.

19
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:53,308
And to construct a WHERE clause,
it uses the selection and

20
00:00:53,308 --> 00:00:56,359
selectionArgs parameters
of its query method.

21
00:00:56,359 --> 00:00:57,420
Let's see how this looks in code.
