00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:04,595
Here's a list of the major things you've done so far. The z-test, t-test,

2
00:00:04,595 --> 00:00:09,890
ANOVA, or f-test, correlation and regression. And all of this has used

3
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:15,210
numerical data. We've been able to take the average and standard deviation.

4
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:20,450
Calculate our test statistics and do hypothesis testing. To start off this

5
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:25,150
lesson, we're going to go a little deeper into numerical data. There are three

6
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:29,150
different kinds that we want you to pay attention to. So I'm going to ask you a

7
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:33,824
few questions just to get you thinking. Here are three examples of data:

8
00:00:33,824 --> 00:00:39,050
percentage correct on a test, finishing order in a race and temperature in

9
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:44,720
degree Celsius. So, just imagine for example that we had 100 values for each.

10
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:50,065
We have 100 students, and we know what percent each of them got on a particular

11
00:00:50,065 --> 00:00:55,805
test. Or we had 100 runners, and we notes who finished first, second, third,

12
00:00:55,805 --> 00:01:00,570
etcetera, all the way to 100. And then we have, let's say, 100 different cities

13
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:04,420
around the world, and we note their average daily temperature and degree

14
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:10,730
Celsius. For each of these data examples, indicate which characteristic fits.

15
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:16,530
Are the data a simple rank. Or are they ranks with equal intervals? Meaning

16
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:22,890
that the distance between a value of five and six, let's say, is the same as

17
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:28,320
the difference between eight and nine. Or, are they ranks with equal intervals

18
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:34,230
and an absolute zero? Meaning that there can never be a value less than zero.

19
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:38,020
This is kind of a tricky question, and hopefully I explained it adequately

20
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:43,534
without giving away the answers. Give it some thought and make your best guess.
