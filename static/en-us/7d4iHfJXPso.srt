1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,939
The answer is that it
depends on the h function.

2
00:00:03,939 --> 00:00:08,774
A* will find the lowest cost
path if the h function for

3
00:00:08,773 --> 00:00:16,099
a state is less than the true cost of
the path to the goal through that state.

4
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:22,230
In other words, we want the h to never
overestimate the distance to the goal.

5
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:26,089
We also say that h is optimistic.

6
00:00:26,089 --> 00:00:30,519
Another way of stating that
is that h is admissible,

7
00:00:30,519 --> 00:00:35,200
meaning that it's admissible to use
it to find the lowest cost path.

8
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,340
So think of all of these
as being the same way

9
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:42,010
of stating the conditions under
which A* finds the lowest cost path.
