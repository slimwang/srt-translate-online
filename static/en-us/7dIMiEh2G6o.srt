1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,780
Given these requirements,
cloud computing provides the following.

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:06,500
First, a pool of shared resources.

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:10,930
These can come in as infrastructure,
compute storage networking.

4
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:13,650
That doesn't mean that
the cloud provider like Amazon,

5
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:17,240
is renting out physical machines,
or physical disks.

6
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:20,980
But instead that it's
renting out virtual machines

7
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:25,515
that are even potentially interconnected
to form some virtual clusters of such

8
00:00:25,515 --> 00:00:28,070
[INAUDIBLE] along with some ability

9
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:32,409
to store some amount of state
in the underlying storage.

10
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:37,490
Cloud computing can also come in as
shared resources that are used by

11
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:41,570
higher level software services,
so these are soft resources.

12
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:46,030
For instance, this can correspond to
certain popular services like email or

13
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:49,740
database or some processing run times.

14
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:55,155
So it may be easier to just rent all the
infrastructure along with the software

15
00:00:55,155 --> 00:01:00,235
stack that's appropriately configured,
as opposed to, as a customer, to come in

16
00:01:00,235 --> 00:01:04,855
and rent actual infrastructure and then
deal with the deployment of the service,

17
00:01:04,855 --> 00:01:08,070
the configuration and
the management of the service.

18
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:10,840
So both of these are options in terms of

19
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:14,000
what it is that cloud computing
provides as a resource.

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,880
These infrastructure software resources

21
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:22,330
are all made available via some APIs for
access and configuration.

22
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:24,550
The point is that they
need to be accessed and

23
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:28,170
manipulated as necessary remotely,
over the internet.

24
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:33,280
This typically includes web-based APIs,
also APIs that are wrapped in

25
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,890
libraries that can be integrated in
popular language runtimes like Java, or

26
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:41,010
command line interfaces,
or other types of tools.

27
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:45,760
Providers offer many different types
of billing and accounting services.

28
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:50,230
There is an entire marketplace
surrounding these cloud services and

29
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:55,890
cloud resources that includes
pricing models with spot prices or

30
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:59,440
reservations for future prices or
other types of models.

31
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:04,090
One common characteristic is that
billing is typically not done based on

32
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:05,480
actual usage.

33
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:08,090
Just because the overheads
that are associated with

34
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:11,982
ultra fine grain monitoring and
management tend to be pretty high, and

35
00:02:11,982 --> 00:02:16,100
instead billing is done based
on some discreet step function.

36
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:19,600
For instance, computer resources may
come in some number of preconfigured

37
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,560
alternatives, like tiny and
medium and large and

38
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,490
extra large and each of these
will have a different cost.

39
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:28,960
So, then the user picks which one
of these matches their needs and

40
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:32,460
then pays the corresponding
grade when using the VM.

41
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:34,010
And all of this, finally,

42
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:39,510
is managed by the cloud provider via
some sophisticated software stack.

43
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:42,550
Common software stacks that
are used in this space include

44
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:48,060
the Open Source OpenStack and also
the VMWare's vSphere software stack.
