1
00:00:00,345 --> 00:00:03,370
Now, recall,
the concept of Epsilon Photography.

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:05,160
Something by now,
you should be familiar with,

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:09,090
because you did an assignment of trying
to capture a sequence of pictures.

4
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:13,370
Epsilon Photography aims to capture
sequence of different pictures,

5
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:17,500
where basically, we're changing one
parameter by just a minute amount.

6
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:21,950
Very small Epsilon amount to capture
the variations in a scene, and

7
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:24,810
then, of course, fuse the different
pictures together, to create

8
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:29,430
a richer representation that captures
a scene, and variety of conditions.

9
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:34,120
And that could be used to synthesize
novel pictures, taking multiple captures

10
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:37,289
of the single scene, or the single
image to generate a newer image.

11
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:39,860
We looked at a variety of examples.

12
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:41,860
We can actually, change the exposure.

13
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:46,090
If you recall, this was an example
of what we did to create HDR images.

14
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:49,330
So, by fusing the three different
exposures of this image,

15
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:51,770
we were able to generate an HDR image.

16
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:54,900
Another example could be,
the viewpoint, right?

17
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:58,280
Where we change the camera parameters
by changing the viewpoint, and

18
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:01,240
then fusing them together,
we can create a panorama.

19
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,250
Many other examples of this exist.

20
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:07,325
Here is an example of being able
to capture a focus stack, and

21
00:01:07,325 --> 00:01:12,495
then being able to generate a new image
that basically has no focus variations,

22
00:01:12,495 --> 00:01:16,385
or, of course, sometimes we can then
controllrably change the variation.

23
00:01:16,385 --> 00:01:19,605
But in Epsilon Photography,
the goal was to be able to capture

24
00:01:19,605 --> 00:01:23,985
all of those images, and in fact,
actually capture multiple images.

25
00:01:23,985 --> 00:01:27,630
Then those multiple images could be
then used to generate a newer image, or

26
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:31,350
perhaps, you want a controllable image
that could be generated on the fly.

27
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:34,872
Now, remember, part pipeline for
Computational Photography.

28
00:01:34,872 --> 00:01:38,100
We want to capture a 3D scene,
which is illuminated,

29
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,920
the optics focus a light onto a sensor.

30
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:45,520
We can process the images to generate
a new output display for a user.

31
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,150
If you recall this from our earlier
lectures, basically this was kind of

32
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:54,140
showcased in the following manner,
we had a 3D scene, we can illuminate

33
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:59,170
the scene with the computer controlled
projector, a controllable light source.

34
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:03,420
And of course, we can control the light
source entirely, or also the parts of it

35
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:07,180
by creating some sort of,
a Modular Controllable Aperture.

36
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:09,900
Remember, again,
we have looked at this example

37
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:13,750
in the previous lecture when we talked
about projector camera systems.

38
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:16,390
Another option, also was to
create a camera, and of course,

39
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:17,910
we would, knew how to do cameras.

40
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:21,823
We learned all there is to, about
the updates and the pinhole aspect of

41
00:02:21,823 --> 00:02:25,799
a camera, but we can also start thinking
that now I can put some sort of,

42
00:02:25,799 --> 00:02:28,186
a Controllable Aperture
in front of this,

43
00:02:28,186 --> 00:02:31,339
that not only controls the amount
of light that goes in.

44
00:02:31,339 --> 00:02:36,282
But also, which parts of the sensor
will be lit based on which parts I

45
00:02:36,282 --> 00:02:38,630
either restrict or open.

46
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:41,225
So, that's the basic pipeline
that we have looked at.

47
00:02:41,225 --> 00:02:43,290
We've looked up
projector camera systems.

48
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:46,740
We have looked at how illumination
source with a camera can be used to

49
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:49,000
extract, and
generate a newer types of images.

50
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,120
We have looked at the camera, but
we haven't actually looked at how

51
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:55,230
to control different aspects of it,
in this way, except,

52
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:58,320
in a few examples like the dual
photography example that we looked at.
