1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:02,368
So given the various goals here, A and B,

2
00:00:02,368 --> 00:00:05,520
B and C, and so forth, write down the plan for

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,850
accomplishing each goal, as if these goals were independent of each other.

4
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:13,830
We are shown here only three goals here not the fourth goal of D on table,

5
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:17,294
because of lack of space. But D on table anyway is [UNKNOWN].
