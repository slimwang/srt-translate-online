00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,085
For this exercise you'll start with a fragment sheeter that performs diffuse

2
00:00:03,085 --> 00:00:06,340
sliding per pixel. I've hooked up a uniform called uBorder to the user

3
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:10,261
interface. Change the program to instead compute the diffuse component as

4
00:00:10,261 --> 00:00:16,633
follows. If the dot project is greater than uBorder, then diffuse is 1.0. Else,

5
00:00:16,633 --> 00:00:20,531
diffuse is 0.5. Make sure to use floating point number and don't leave off the

6
00:00:20,531 --> 00:00:24,800
point 0 in 1.0. When you get this new code in place, it should look like this.

7
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,532
Once you have the solution, try the border slider, and see the effect. If

8
00:00:28,532 --> 00:00:31,568
nothing for negative values of border, you might want to think about the effect

9
00:00:31,568 --> 00:00:33,229
of the max function.
