00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:02,040
Hi, I'm Ido Green.

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,850
I'm a Developer Advocate at Google.

3
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:04,950
>> And I'm Cameron Pittman.

4
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:07,260
I make front-end courses
here at Udacity.

5
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:10,750
>> Cameron and I want to help you
a bit with the forms, because almost

6
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:14,730
any meaningful experience on the webs
come with boxes that need to be filled.

7
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:18,600
>> It might be a registration form,
a shopping cart or a sign in form.

8
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,260
All of these need simple forms.

9
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:21,090
And why?

10
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:23,170
Well, it's because
the simpler the form is,

11
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:25,090
the more conversions
you're going to see.

12
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:28,060
>> Right, and in fact,
according to Chrome usage data,

13
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:33,260
you can make forms 30% faster by
just making them ready to autofill.

14
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:35,160
We will dive into it
in the second lesson.

15
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:39,040
For now, just remember that with
faster forms comes happier users and

16
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,570
more conversion.

17
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:41,740
And that's why we're here.

18
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:46,230
This course is all about best practices
for designing and developing forms.

19
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:48,390
We want you to build
forms that work great for

20
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:52,320
all your users, no matter their
platform, mobile or desktop.

21
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,160
However, mobile platforms are a bit
more of a challenge due to

22
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,770
the smaller screen size.

23
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:58,629
So we are going to focus on
that more in this course.

24
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:03,570
>> Yes, and for this course, Ido and
I expect that you're a web developer who

25
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:07,590
understands the fundamentals of HTML,
CSS, and JavaScript.

26
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:10,010
We expect that you've been
building sites with forms, and

27
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:12,800
you're always trying to stay up
to date with best practices.

28
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:13,895
>> In the first two lessons,

29
00:01:13,895 --> 00:01:17,020
you'll be learning about
inputs that make up forms.

30
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:20,570
All the little button and
toggles that clutter your user screens.

31
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:22,930
>> And in the third lesson,
you'll take on forms as a whole and

32
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:25,540
examine what you can do
to convert more users.

33
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:28,570
This is especially important for
e-commerce sites, but

34
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:31,300
it certainly applies to
any kind of long form.

35
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:35,230
>> In the last lesson, you'll make forms
reactive and touchable for mobile users.

36
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:36,620
>> That sounds like a lot of fun.

37
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:37,260
Let's get started.
