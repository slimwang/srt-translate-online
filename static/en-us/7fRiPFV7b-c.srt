1
00:00:00,167 --> 00:00:04,089
So lets suppose you have a whole bunch of matches and since you,

2
00:00:04,089 --> 00:00:08,976
the human are going to click on which one's are correct and which one's are not.

3
00:00:08,976 --> 00:00:10,111
Well, actually not you.

4
00:00:10,111 --> 00:00:11,879
This is what you're going to do if you're a professor.

5
00:00:11,879 --> 00:00:14,815
You're going to find a bunch of undergraduates, okay?

6
00:00:14,815 --> 00:00:17,600
And you're going to offer to pay them not very much money and

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,820
then you're going to offer to give them pizza.

8
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:20,354
Okay?

9
00:00:20,354 --> 00:00:22,924
You can get undergraduates to do anything for pizza.

10
00:00:22,924 --> 00:00:26,060
Turns out you can get graduate students to do anything for pizza and Coca-Cola.

11
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:29,229
So anyway, so you get a army of students to click on which matches were

12
00:00:29,229 --> 00:00:31,265
correct and which matches are not correct.

13
00:00:31,265 --> 00:00:34,035
So after everybody's clicked on all these matches,

14
00:00:34,035 --> 00:00:36,070
you can actually generate two graphs.

15
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:39,843
What you're going to do is you're going to measure the nearest

16
00:00:39,843 --> 00:00:41,542
neighbor squared error.

17
00:00:41,542 --> 00:00:46,947
So this is how good is the SSD of the nearest neighbor?

18
00:00:46,947 --> 00:00:50,801
And we're going to check it for all of the correct matches and

19
00:00:50,801 --> 00:00:52,853
all of the incorrect matches.

20
00:00:52,853 --> 00:00:54,454
And so incorrect matches,

21
00:00:54,454 --> 00:00:58,359
remember, are where the best match is actually not the right one.

22
00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:00,750
Okay? So we're just plotting the best matches, but

23
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:04,031
the correct, the ones that are correct and the ones that are incorrect.

24
00:01:04,031 --> 00:01:08,869
And so here is the squared error of the correct matches.

25
00:01:08,869 --> 00:01:10,504
That's what it says here, correct matches.

26
00:01:10,504 --> 00:01:13,174
All right. And you'll see that it falls off nicely.

27
00:01:13,174 --> 00:01:15,684
So most of them tend to be small and,

28
00:01:15,684 --> 00:01:19,213
you know, modest amount of them tend to be large.

29
00:01:19,213 --> 00:01:22,684
So you might say, well, I'll just set the threshold here and that'll be fine.

30
00:01:22,684 --> 00:01:24,985
Well, except not so fast.

31
00:01:24,985 --> 00:01:28,744
If you then take a plot of the incorrect matches,

32
00:01:28,744 --> 00:01:34,628
you see that the incorrect matches have a whole bunch of stuff early on also.

33
00:01:34,628 --> 00:01:37,779
So what that means is I've taken a point and

34
00:01:37,779 --> 00:01:42,603
I've found it's best match and the best one is not the right one.

35
00:01:42,603 --> 00:01:48,442
So it's not a surprise that it's a lowish value, because this is the best match.

36
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:53,027
The problem is that some of your best matches are correct and

37
00:01:53,027 --> 00:01:54,682
have a lowish score.

38
00:01:54,682 --> 00:02:00,721
But some of your best matches are not correct and they also have a low score.

39
00:02:00,721 --> 00:02:04,330
So it's not so clear where you, where you should set that threshold.
