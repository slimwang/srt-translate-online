1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:04,660
Georgia Tech is the first university
to offer a FHIR platform for

2
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:07,560
students to develop and
test their innovative ideas.

3
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:11,270
It provides access to
synthetic health data for

4
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:15,260
some 10,000 make believe chronic
disease patients like Marla.

5
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:20,230
You access that data using
some key FHIR resources, for

6
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:23,020
which we've implemented the ability,
with some limitations,

7
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:26,290
to create, read, update,
and delete, called CRUD.

8
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,420
You'll also have access to
the SMART on FHIR app platform.

9
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:35,560
You'll form teams,
each of which will turn its innovation

10
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:40,089
into at least a working prototype using
FHIR as the source of patient data.

11
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:43,130
Each team will be assigned to a TA,

12
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:48,570
who will help resolve any technical
issues and answer any questions.

13
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:50,110
If you want one, we'll try and

14
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:53,430
connect you with a domain expert
relevant to your project.

15
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:58,510
It's important that each team have
people with the right set of skills.

16
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:02,200
So we'll be providing assistance
to you to form effective teams.

17
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:08,190
We'll discuss FHIR in lesson 5B, but
I suggest you get started exploring it

18
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:11,700
now by visiting the websites I've
listed in the instructor's notes.
