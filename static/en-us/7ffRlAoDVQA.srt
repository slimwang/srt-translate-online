1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,730
We just found ourselves considering
the running time of the composition

2
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:05,270
of two turning machines.

3
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:09,010
Think carefully, and give the most
appropriate bound for the running time

4
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:17,626
of the composition of m, which runs in
time q with N, which runs in time p.

5
00:00:17,626 --> 00:00:21,880
You can assume that both N and
M read all of their input
