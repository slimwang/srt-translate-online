There are many different modes of raps such as gangsta rap, nerdcore hiphop,

2
00:00:03,945 --> 00:00:07,650
and crunk. I mean there are three main ways within WebGL of repeating a

3
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:12,830
texture. These are called wrap modes. Here's a demo showing them in action. The

4
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:16,250
repeat mode is the one you're most likely to use. It simply repeats a texture

5
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:20,420
one after another. If you want to have things look continuous, such as water,

6
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:23,255
then the texture itself needs to be what is called seamless, where its edges

7
00:00:23,255 --> 00:00:28,260
match up. If your texture is not seamless, one cheap way to tile it across the

8
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:33,360
plane is to set the wrap mode to be mirrored repeat. This concrete texture is

9
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,932
not seamless. I just grabbed a piece of an image on Wikimedia Commons. With

10
00:00:36,932 --> 00:00:41,892
mirrored repeat on, the texture flips on each repetition. This is a bit easier

11
00:00:41,892 --> 00:00:45,849
to see with the r texture. This wrap mode is not a great solution. It's often

12
00:00:45,849 --> 00:00:49,120
clear that the texture is being flipped in this way. Still, it's better than

13
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:53,570
nothing. The third wrap mode is called clamp to edge. The drawback or feature

14
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:56,010
of this mode is that the pixels on the edge are used to fill in the area where

15
00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:00,060
the texture does not appear. This is the default mode for wrapping, as it has

16
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:03,310
some advantages for filtering along the edges when the texture is not going to

17
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:08,430
be repeated. This code shows how to set each of the three wrap modes in 3JS.

18
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:13,001
The s and t axes essentially mean the u and v axes. You can in fact mix and

19
00:01:13,001 --> 00:01:18,242
match these modes, repeating on one axis and clamping on the other. Now give

20
00:01:18,242 --> 00:01:19,710
the demo a try yourself.
