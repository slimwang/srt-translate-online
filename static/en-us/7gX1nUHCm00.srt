00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,700
So let's also spend a bit of a time looking at the evolution of a camera.

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:09,180
Historically again, seeing where the camera, you know, how long has it

3
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:12,520
been since the earliest definition of what a camera was to what it is now.

4
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:17,650
While the earliest concepts camera has been known to existed from times of

5
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:23,030
Plato in the in the Greek philosophers time, but, the earliest

6
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:28,420
embodiment of a camera came about in the mid-1800s, with a device like this,

7
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:30,970
where basically, there was a lens associated with it and,

8
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:35,700
of course, you could put some sort of chemical at the back, 1839, you know, or

9
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:41,190
roundabouts was when these cameras were being, and used for photography.

10
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:45,440
1907 has been the basic theme of the technology to start saving them into prints

11
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:51,010
like this.1948 is perhaps when a smaller handheld types of cameras like this,

12
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:51,920
starting coming about.

13
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,290
1986 is the instamatic, disposable types of cameras,

14
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:59,510
you take a picture, throw this out and take the film and use it.

15
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:05,540
1991 is the first con, first concept camera for digital SLRs,

16
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:09,090
this was actually, I believe the resolution of this was about less than two

17
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:13,680
megapixels, when I started my research career, I tried to get one of these, for

18
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,580
various types of projects I wanted to work on, and they cost more than $20,000,

19
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:20,330
and I was allowed access to it so I could take a few pictures if I

20
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:25,150
go to the labs of some of the manufacturers of these cameras, but,

21
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:29,045
the bottom line is this is the kind of camera almost all of us have now.

22
00:01:29,045 --> 00:01:34,250
2000 is the first mobile cell phone camera that came out, so and

23
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:38,720
again you notice the evolution from 1839 to 2000, and

24
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:43,070
of course since 2000, we've even make leaps and bounds in this one.

25
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:45,740
Now cameras are getting smaller, and smaller like these.

26
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:50,140
And, more importantly, they're only going to get smaller, so

27
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:53,760
these are concept designs of cameras that could just be an lens.
