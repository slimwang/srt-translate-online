1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So the answer is the second choice.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The reason--for this we can see that it takes one input--

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
there's one parameter between the parentheses--

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
and it calls that input "n,"

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,446
and then what it outputs is--after the return,

6
00:00:13,446 --> 00:00:15,977
it outputs the result of "n+1."

7
00:00:15,977 --> 00:00:19,000
So whatever was the value of "n," which is the input,

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
the result of "inc" is the value, plus one.
