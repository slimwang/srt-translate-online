1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,552
>> You've gotten feedback
based on your responses and

2
00:00:02,552 --> 00:00:04,720
we hope you take it seriously.

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:06,640
There are two options for what happened.

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:10,638
In option one, one or more of those
feedback messages said that now isn't

5
00:00:10,638 --> 00:00:14,000
the right time for
you to begin this NIM degree.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,485
Maybe you don't have some background
knowledge, but you can get it.

7
00:00:17,485 --> 00:00:19,455
>> And once you get it,
you will be ready.

8
00:00:19,455 --> 00:00:21,990
And remember, even once you
are ready to start the program,

9
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:24,700
there still will be
challenges along the way.

10
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:25,459
>> Exactly.

11
00:00:25,459 --> 00:00:28,610
And option two is that you are ready.

12
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:31,308
And if you decide to make this
commitment, there's a good chance that

13
00:00:31,308 --> 00:00:34,800
in a matter of months, your career
will be drastically different.

14
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,472
But even if you're ready and
you do make the commitment,

15
00:00:37,472 --> 00:00:39,040
this will still be challenging.

16
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:39,840
>> Mm-hm.

17
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,280
It's perfectly possible that over the
next several months, you'll have times

18
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,671
where things feel challenging or you
feel frustrated, you feel overwhelmed or

19
00:00:46,671 --> 00:00:49,900
maybe you even feel like you
don't belong in this program.

20
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:51,820
>> I wouldn't even say
perfectly possible.

21
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:54,880
I would say, very probable.

22
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:58,349
And those things are going to
happen when your code won't run and

23
00:00:58,349 --> 00:00:59,549
you don't know why or

24
00:00:59,549 --> 00:01:03,297
you feel lost in intimidating
jargon that you don't understand.

25
00:01:03,297 --> 00:01:06,630
Or when you're trying to install
software and it won't run or

26
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:09,380
someone in the forum
is way ahead of you.

27
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:11,872
>> When these things happen, understand
that they happen to everybody.

28
00:01:11,872 --> 00:01:12,506
>> Right.

29
00:01:12,506 --> 00:01:16,510
And some of that struggle is
unavoidable and actually productive.

30
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:18,045
It's just what learning feels like.

31
00:01:18,045 --> 00:01:18,612
>> Mm-hm.

32
00:01:18,612 --> 00:01:20,443
And in those moments
when you're struggling,

33
00:01:20,443 --> 00:01:23,419
it's important to remember too that you
have a whole community of your fellow

34
00:01:23,419 --> 00:01:25,040
students out there to help you.

35
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,054
As well as your team of
Udacity coaches here.

36
00:01:27,054 --> 00:01:27,822
>> And Google.

37
00:01:27,822 --> 00:01:28,689
>> Yes, Google.

38
00:01:28,689 --> 00:01:29,730
Amazing resource.

39
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:32,026
Definitely figure out how to
answer your own questions.

40
00:01:32,026 --> 00:01:35,470
>> But not all of the struggle
with the productive kind.

41
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:37,264
Sometimes, it will be
because we made a mistake.

42
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:37,999
>> Mm-hm.

43
00:01:37,999 --> 00:01:40,610
>> And we're constantly learning and
improving too.

44
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:42,358
So maybe our instructions
weren't clear or

45
00:01:42,358 --> 00:01:44,305
maybe we assumed something
we shouldn't have.

46
00:01:44,305 --> 00:01:44,941
>> Mm-hm.

47
00:01:44,941 --> 00:01:46,870
When you're struggling,
be sure to let us know.

48
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:49,410
So like Andy said,
we can learn from your feedback.

49
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:52,010
Because that's,
that's how we learn how to improve.

50
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:52,820
>> Right.
The,

51
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:56,840
the bottom line is there will
be times when this is hard.

52
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:00,321
But if you persevere, you will succeed.

53
00:02:00,321 --> 00:02:03,354
>> Whatever you choose to learn next and
however you choose to learn it,

54
00:02:03,354 --> 00:02:05,552
remember that for
every obstacle you encounter,

55
00:02:05,552 --> 00:02:08,080
you'll be able to do amazing
new things as a result of it.
