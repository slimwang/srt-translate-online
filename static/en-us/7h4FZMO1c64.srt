1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Almost all of these are great examples of applications that are used everyday,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
and are primarily based on word models.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
We've seen classification before for spam and other types of categories,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
language ID and so on.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
There's also the idea of clustering, where we don't have categories ahead of time.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Yes, you can take news stories and classify them into, say, sports or weather,

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
but you can also cluster them to say here's a cluster of stories

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
that are all related about the latest topic that has maybe never occurred before.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
There's also input correction of various kinds such as spelling correction,

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
sentiment analysis--taking reviews of products and trying to decide

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
if they're favorable or unfavorable and rate products that way,

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
information retrieval--web search is a problem that I've worked on

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
and is primarily addressed with word models,

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
question answer such as IBM's Watson did in playing the game of Jeopardy.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
They use a variety of techniques.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Much of them are based around word models, but there are other techniques as well.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Machine translation--we saw the example of Chinese menus and translating to English from examples.

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The examples are primarily dealt with by phrases and individual words

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
and some augmentation to that as well.

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Speech recognition--as similar story.

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
And then finally I threw in one that is no primarily a question for word models.

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Driving a car is autonomously is primarily a question in perception and localization.

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Yes, you might want to be able to talk to the car to direct it to do something,

24
00:01:37,000 --> 99:59:59,999
but that wouldn't be part of the autonomous part.
