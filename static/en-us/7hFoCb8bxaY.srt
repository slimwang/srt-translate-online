1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,480
Up to this point, we mentioned
synchronization multiple times while

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:06,010
discussing other operating
system concepts.

3
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:09,340
In this lesson, we will primarily
focus on synchronization.

4
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:12,080
We will discuss several
synchronization constructs,

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,570
what are the benefits of
using those constructs.

6
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:18,590
And also we will discuss what is the
hardware level support that's necessary

7
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:22,240
in order for those synchronization
primitives to be implemented.

8
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,690
As we cover these concepts,
we will use the paper,

9
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:28,470
The Performance of Spin Lock
Alternatives by Thomas Anderson.

10
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:32,189
This paper will give you a deeper
understanding of how are synchronization

11
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:35,650
constructs implemented on top
of the underlying hardware, and

12
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:38,150
why they exhibits certain
performance strengths.

13
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:41,520
There is a link to the paper
available in the instructors notes.
