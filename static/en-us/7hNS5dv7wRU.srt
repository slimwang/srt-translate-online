00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
This actually puts us in a really interesting situation.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
We can build a sorting algorithm

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
out of the pieces that we just created.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
This is sometimes called heap-sort. You give it a (L).

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
And what it does is it builds a heap out of (L),

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
and then repeatedly, until there's no more elements left,

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
it does remove.mn.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
So it gets the smallest and then the next smallest and then the next smallest

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
until the list is exhausted.
