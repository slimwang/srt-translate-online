1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:02,840
So the first major component we're going to dive

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:07,250
into to help, is the HTML5 Application Cache. This lets

3
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:11,710
you provide a local cache of HTML files, CSF, JavaScript,

4
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:15,640
images, any other resources your client webapp may use. And

5
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:18,190
get the browser to use them even before it tries

6
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:20,760
to hit the network. So let's take a look at

7
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,840
how this works and how we can use it. The

8
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:25,740
application cache is a manifest that you point to from

9
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:28,850
inside your HTML element. Let's take a look

10
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:31,900
at the cache manifest for our conference application. The

11
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:35,710
manifest starts with a magic header, cache manifest Lines

12
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:39,010
that start with a hash sign are actually comments.

13
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:41,540
Typically, the second line is a comment with some

14
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:44,700
kind of cache version string. More on that later.

15
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,390
But this is followed by a cache section. Now

16
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:50,840
what do you think goes in the cache section?

17
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:55,060
Should it be every file that's on the servers file system? Every resource

18
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:59,460
that can be statically served, or should it be a collection of cat videos?
