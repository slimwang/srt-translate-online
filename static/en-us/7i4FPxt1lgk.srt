1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:02,800
So let's take a quick look at the code,

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:06,050
I put my code in
the ShowAllDinnersActivity and

3
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:09,130
the first thing you're going to need
to do is import these couple things.

4
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:11,360
Tracker and the HitBuilders.

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,430
And then I put my timing
code in the OnCreate method.

6
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:17,480
because that's where
we display the list.

7
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:22,410
I put my startTime down here,
actually after I set the ContentView.

8
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:24,960
You may have put it above,
it doesn't matter.

9
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,861
So I start recording the time here,
I get all the dinners,

10
00:00:29,861 --> 00:00:34,162
I create the ArrayAdapter,
I set the Adapter, and

11
00:00:34,162 --> 00:00:37,375
then down here I record the stop time.

12
00:00:37,375 --> 00:00:39,618
So now we've got the start and
the stop time,

13
00:00:39,618 --> 00:00:41,577
we need to calculate the elapsed time.

14
00:00:41,577 --> 00:00:44,925
And I've converted from
nanoseconds to milliseconds and

15
00:00:44,925 --> 00:00:49,180
then I have defined a new function
to report the timing hit.

16
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:54,110
So I have my method, send
AnalyticsTimingHit, got the tracker.

17
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:57,670
I use TimingBuilder to build the hit.

18
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:59,859
I set the category to
list all the dinners.

19
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:02,660
I passed in the elapsed time,

20
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:05,900
which is t and here I set
the value to the elapsed time.

21
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:10,920
Set the labels, set the variable and I
build the tracker and that sends a hit.

22
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:11,970
And that's all there is to it.
