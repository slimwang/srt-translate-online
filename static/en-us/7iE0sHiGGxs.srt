1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,310
Well the kernel, as we've written it, uses 32 by 32 threads, or 1,024 threads,

2
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:08,612
and the limit on my machine is 2,048 threads.

3
00:00:08,612 --> 00:00:12,095
That's keeping us down to no more than 2 thread blocks per SM.

4
00:00:12,095 --> 00:00:18,721
The kernel requires 7 registers for each of those threads, so that's a total of 7,168 registers.

5
00:00:18,721 --> 00:00:23,559
The limit is 65,536 registers per SM.

6
00:00:23,559 --> 00:00:28,949
So this is limiting us to no more than 9 thread blocks per SM. This is not the limit.

7
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:35,506
The kernel is requesting 4 kilobytes of shared memory to store the tile. The limit is 48k.

8
00:00:35,506 --> 00:00:41,880
So, this is restricting us to 12 blocks per SM, That's not our limiting factor.

9
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:48,109
And finally, there's a limit of 8 thread blocks per SM total, and that's clearly not the limiting factor.

10
00:00:48,109 --> 00:00:53,553
So in the end, the thing that's keeping us from running more thread blocks per SM,

11
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:58,181
and therefore keeping us from running more threads per SM is this first limit,

12
00:00:58,181 --> 00:01:00,265
the maximum number of threads per SM.

13
00:01:00,265 --> 00:01:04,027
We're limited to running 2 thread blocks per SM,

14
00:01:04,027 --> 00:01:09,918
and that means that we're going to be running a total of 2,048 threads on each SM.
