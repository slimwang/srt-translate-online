1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
All right, so here I have written out

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
3 JavaScript elements.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Number 1, a function definition of a function mymin,

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
given 2 arguments a and b, if a is less than b we return a.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Otherwise we return b. We're returning whichever one is smaller.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Over here, another function definition for a function called "square."

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
It takes in a variable x and returns x times x.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
And then over here, number 3, a statement.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
We're calling write, or if you prefer, document.write,

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,000
to display the result of calling mymin on the square of -2 and the square of 3.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
In essence what we're trying to figure out is which is smaller,

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
-2 squared or 3 squared?

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
And then we're going to print out that result.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Your mission, should you choose to accept it,

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
translate this to Python.

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Submit via the interpreter.

17
00:00:50,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Write a Python program that does exactly the same as this JavaScript.
