1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:04,100
Okay, so
back to activity content transitions.

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:07,860
These transitions allow you to animate
the views within an activity when they

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:09,650
enter or leave it.

4
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:12,780
Say you have two activities, A and B.

5
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:17,980
From activity A, we can launch
activity B by going startActivity and

6
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:20,710
return by hitting the back button.

7
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:23,810
When A calls startActivity
to launch activity B,

8
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:27,960
we have the opportunity to run two
sets of transition animations.

9
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:32,350
Firstly we can run an exit transition
on the views in activity A.

10
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:36,710
And secondly, we can run an enter
transition on the views in activity B.

11
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:40,724
We can define these transitions either
in code, or declare them in XML and

12
00:00:40,724 --> 00:00:43,460
then set them on the activities feed.

13
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:46,570
Let's take a look at
examples of both approaches.

14
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:51,090
Let's, for example, add animations to
this app, which shows a grid of images.

15
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:55,230
Clicking on an individual image
takes you to a detail screen.

16
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:58,420
So here's what it looks like before
we add any content transitions,

17
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:00,349
we just see the standard
window animations.

18
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:06,050
Let's add an exit transition
to the first grid screen.

19
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:11,120
We'll use an explode transition,
which moves all of the views outwards.

20
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,160
Let's do this declaratively.

21
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:17,611
First, we create a new file
in res/transition, and

22
00:01:17,611 --> 00:01:20,440
we're going to call it grid_exit.

23
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:24,310
You may have to create this transition
folder if it doesn't already exist.

24
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:28,480
Now, the transition itself uses
the exact same syntax as we saw earlier.

25
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:32,470
To use the built-in explode transition,
all we need is this explode tag.

26
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,420
Now, to assign the exit
transition to the activity,

27
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:40,670
we'll open the activities theme and
add an entry for

28
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:46,340
windowExitTransition which points
to the transition we just defined.

29
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:50,020
Lastly, there are a couple of things we
need to do to enable activity content

30
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:51,230
transitions.

31
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:55,280
First we'll need to alter our
call to start activity to use

32
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,490
this variant which takes a bundle.

33
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:01,360
We'll go into this bundle a bit shortly.

34
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:06,090
Next we might need to set
the windowContentTransitions flag

35
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:09,220
to true on your applications theme.

36
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:12,010
If you're already inheriting
from a material theme or

37
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:15,800
AppCompat then this will
automatically be set for you.

38
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,670
Okay, so now that we've done that,
here's how it looks.

39
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:19,320
Not too bad.

40
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:24,350
We see that the views move outwards
as we move on to the detail screen.

41
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:27,390
Let's add another transition to
the content on the detail screen

42
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:28,670
as it comes in.

43
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:31,900
Let's slide the text into
place from the bottom.

44
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:34,630
This time we'll create
the transition from code.

45
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:40,180
In the DetailActivity we instantiate
a new slide transition object.

46
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:44,160
And we here, in the constructor,
tell it to enter from the bottom edge.

47
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,179
We then set which views
it's acting on using this,

48
00:02:47,179 --> 00:02:49,860
addTarget call passing
in the id of the view.

49
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:51,696
We'll also set the duration and

50
00:02:51,696 --> 00:02:54,990
interpolator to quickly
ease the view into place.

51
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:56,800
More on these concepts soon.

52
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,210
Finally, we call
setEnterTransition on the window.

53
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:00,880
Here's the result.

54
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:07,710
Well, the title and description slide
in nicely, but the image just appears.

55
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:11,550
This is because by opting in to
use activity content transitions,

56
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:15,220
we're implicitly turning off
the window animation feature.

57
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:19,670
As our transition doesn't target
the image specifically, it just appears.

58
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:21,160
We'll fix that shortly.

59
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:24,190
Let's take a second to consider
these two different approaches for

60
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:27,200
creating transitions in code and XML.

61
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,670
Now, the code approach
might involve less steps,

62
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:31,890
but there are some
trade-offs to consider.

63
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:35,890
Firstly, it's harder to reuse
the transition in other places.

64
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:38,520
Also, this example was
relatively simple.

65
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:41,290
But as you create more
complicated transitions,

66
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:43,690
then this can get a bit more complex.

67
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:46,900
It can be nice to keep this
contained in a single XML file for

68
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:50,600
good separation of concerns and
to keep your activities clean.

69
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:54,630
Lastly, as we mentioned,
this feature was introduced in API 21.

70
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:58,360
So we should guard our code to not
attempt to use APIs that don't exist on

71
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,900
earlier versions.

72
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:06,150
In the code approach you can use an API
check like this or declaratively,

73
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:11,288
you can use a resource qualifier
such as transition-v21 and

74
00:04:11,288 --> 00:04:15,520
values-v21 to only use it
on the newer platforms.

75
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:18,970
As you might have guessed, I'm quite
a fan of the declarative approach, but

76
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:22,250
pick the one that makes the most
sense for your use case.

77
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:23,412
You can even mix and

78
00:04:23,412 --> 00:04:28,620
match by using a transition inflator
to load the XML transition in code.

79
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:32,790
Now you may have noticed that when we
hit the back button to return from

80
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:36,520
the details page to the grid,
our explode transition reversed,

81
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,380
or imploded, I guess.

82
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:39,922
Now, this is a default behavior,

83
00:04:39,922 --> 00:04:43,730
to reverse any transitions
that you set on the way back.

84
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:46,840
But you can, of course,
hook into this and set your own.

85
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:50,730
So in addition to the enter and
exit transitions we've looked at,

86
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:54,460
you're also able to specify return and
re-enter transitions.

87
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:58,930
So going from activity A to B,
and back again,

88
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:03,440
the sequence would be first,
an exit transition on activity A,

89
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,920
followed by the enter transition on
activity B we've already looked at.

90
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,880
Then when you hit back,

91
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:13,280
you have the opportunity to run a return
transition on the views in activity B,

92
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,990
followed by a re-enter transition
on the views in activity A.

93
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:22,090
Let's hook into the re-enter event to
customize the behavior when returning

94
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:24,100
from the details page to the grid.

95
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:27,820
Let's make the items slide
in from the top like this.

96
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:33,160
This is as easy as simply specifying
a new transition in the theme like so.

97
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:37,100
So here the windowReenterTransition
pointing to one of the default platform

98
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:37,760
transitions.
