00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:04,220
We want you to develop a mindset of being both curious and skeptical, when

2
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:07,510
you work with data. To help you get into this mindset, I want to share

3
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:11,250
another conversation that I had with Aude. In this next video, I want you

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:12,860
to listen to Aude's work and look

5
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:15,600
out for how she demonstrated this exact mindset.

6
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:20,880
>> So we gathered all the home towns and current cities from the

7
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:26,160
users and I was looking at conditional probabilities given

8
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,420
a hometown. What is the probability that you currently live

9
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:34,330
in each different cities? Like, for example given that your

10
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:36,970
hometown is New York, what is the probability that you

11
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:39,110
live in Chicago or that you live in, that you

12
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:40,620
still live in New York or that you live in

13
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:43,490
San Francisco or Paris and so on. And what I

14
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:47,830
was expecting is that, at least, the most likely city,

15
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:51,180
where you would live right now would be the city where

16
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:53,570
your home town is. If you grew up in

17
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:56,330
Chicago, the most likely place that you're going to

18
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:59,440
be now is still Chicago. You could be moving

19
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,030
as well but the most likely place would remain your

20
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:05,880
hometown. But I saw a fair number of cases

21
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,130
where the most likely current city was different from

22
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:12,080
the home town and, and that was, was a

23
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:16,570
fairly high probability. I was really surprised. I was wondering

24
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:21,840
if I had, had a prime in my computations, If there was some issues upstream of

25
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:28,280
what I was doing. So I decided to put all the cities on a map. All the pairs of

26
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:32,400
hometowns and current cities for which the most

27
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,960
likely current city was different from the hometown. And

28
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:39,200
what we saw on this map was really fascinating

29
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,760
because it was really not what we we're expecting.

30
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:46,340
It was not a bug in the code. We were really seeing patterns arise. Here we only

31
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:48,980
plotted pairs of hometown and current city, so

32
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:51,760
there's no movement between the pairs but what we

33
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:56,550
see is that a lot of these cities for which the most likely

34
00:01:56,550 --> 00:02:01,510
current city is different from the hometown arise in western Africa or in

35
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:06,940
India or in like Turkey, which we were not

36
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:10,780
necessarily expecting at the beginning. And there were a

37
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:14,240
lot of small cities all moving to the same current

38
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,620
city and so we decided to dig a bit

39
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:19,590
more into it. One thing that happens is that sometimes

40
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:23,250
the distribution of the current city is very flat.

41
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:27,100
Given that you grew up in, let's say Paris, maybe

42
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:29,165
you're still living in Paris but maybe you live in

43
00:02:29,165 --> 00:02:32,420
like one of the thousand cities in the suburbs and

44
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:35,230
so the distribution is really flat and so we

45
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:38,615
have to decide what was considered as a coordinates

46
00:02:38,615 --> 00:02:41,990
demarcation. We decided yeah, the probability to move to

47
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:44,616
that city is high enough that we're considering that.

48
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:51,540
And the other thing we have to think about is that if you look at the map at

49
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:54,120
the world scale or if you zoom to a

50
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:57,515
very specific area, you don't want to see the same things.

51
00:02:57,515 --> 00:03:04,600
So,we also want it to have interactivity in the visualization. And so we

52
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:11,650
decided to use D3, which is a Javascript-based visualization framework, which

53
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:15,340
enables you to have a lot of interactivity with with your data

54
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:18,810
and enabled us to do a lot of that exploration and so on.
