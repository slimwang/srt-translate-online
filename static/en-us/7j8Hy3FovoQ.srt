00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,575
There are several different situations in which we might see equal signs. The

2
00:00:04,587 --> 00:00:09,565
last case you did had an example of a conditional equation in it. Conditional

3
00:00:09,577 --> 00:00:14,175
equations are true for some values of the variable, but not all. So, like we saw

4
00:00:14,187 --> 00:00:18,320
earlier, this left side of the equation will be equal to the right side,

5
00:00:18,422 --> 00:00:23,053
depending on what we plug in for n. Some numbers will work, but some will not.

6
00:00:23,157 --> 00:00:27,967
Some things with equal signs will be identities. In an identity, no matter what

7
00:00:27,979 --> 00:00:32,546
number you plug in for the variable, you will get a true equation. The third

8
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:37,033
case is that we might see an equal sign in something that is not actually an

9
00:00:37,045 --> 00:00:41,838
equation. You've seen a few of these before. No matter what number I plug in for

10
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:46,060
y, over in this equation, I will never be able to make the left side equal to

11
00:00:46,072 --> 00:00:49,890
the right side. We'll talk more soon about the situations in which these

12
00:00:49,902 --> 00:00:54,060
different types of equations are used or at least, where these top two are used.

13
00:00:54,155 --> 00:00:57,998
The last one is usually something that comes up if a mistake has been made

14
00:00:58,010 --> 00:00:58,698
somewhere in our math.
