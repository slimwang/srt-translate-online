1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:04,480
So we can install multiple instances
of the engine next application now.

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:06,250
But can we run them?

3
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:09,480
Let's use the Docker Run command
to run the first instance

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:10,590
of the engine next container.

5
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:15,260
Now we can use the Docker PS command
to check that it's up and running.

6
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:17,640
I could run another.

7
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,335
It doesn't even have to
be the same version.

8
00:00:19,335 --> 00:00:24,150
Notice this time, since we didn't have
the image array on our system for

9
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:26,691
version 1.9.3 of nginx,

10
00:00:26,691 --> 00:00:30,525
the docker run command pulls
the image in the background first.

11
00:00:32,165 --> 00:00:35,855
Sometimes when I'm home alone,
I'll sit in front of my computer and

12
00:00:35,855 --> 00:00:37,695
just start up hundreds of instances.

13
00:00:37,695 --> 00:00:38,515
Just because I can.

14
00:00:39,535 --> 00:00:40,753
Let's run one more.

15
00:00:40,753 --> 00:00:42,611
I'll stick to three today.

16
00:00:42,611 --> 00:00:46,925
We can see that we have all three
instances running using the P.S.

17
00:00:46,925 --> 00:00:48,474
command from earlier.

18
00:00:48,474 --> 00:00:53,180
You can see from the output that we have
three nginx master processes running.

19
00:00:54,435 --> 00:00:56,390
Docket makes this so easy.

20
00:00:56,390 --> 00:01:00,980
We don't have to touch nsscripts,
setup ports, or any of that stuff to run

21
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:04,660
multiple instances, or even different
versions, at the same time.
