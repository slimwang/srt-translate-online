00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:04,670
Now that we have fixed the error, and every one of the threads has its own

2
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:10,680
private storage area to store the argument i, we expect to see the,

3
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:15,620
line thread number, with the numbers 0, 1, 2, and 3 appear in the output.

4
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:22,260
Given that, this first insert is not correct, and both of these two outputs,

5
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:26,130
the second and third output, are correct answers to this question.
