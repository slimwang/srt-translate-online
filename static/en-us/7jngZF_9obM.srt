1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,960
So now let's try a little more challenging example.

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:06,330
It's not really challenging, but it's a bit more difficult than the first one.

3
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:11,390
So this is a 3-line code and then I want you to tell me the number of time steps

4
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:15,060
that this code will need on the run.

5
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:19,220
For this, I should mention that we're going to count this operation here--the while

6
00:00:19,220 --> 99:59:59,999
and the comparison of s if it's greater than 0 as a simple operation.
