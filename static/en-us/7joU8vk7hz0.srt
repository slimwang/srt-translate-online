00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,860
I imagine that most everyone
checks something off this list.

2
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:05,360
These are the apps that I've used, but

3
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:08,490
there's one really important point
that I want to make about these.

4
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:12,360
Each one of these apps is using
the network and your app should too.

5
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:16,580
I mean, if you look at this list or
any of the other list mobidia maintains,

6
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:20,660
you'll see that every single app on
those lists is using the network.

7
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:22,850
So this has to be something
that we add to our tool set.
