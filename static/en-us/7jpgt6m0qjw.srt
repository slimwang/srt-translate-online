1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:07,538
And the solutions are, f of x equals 2 x plus 3 corresponds with letter c. F of

2
00:00:07,538 --> 00:00:14,240
x equals x squared plus 6 corresponds with graph of the letter b. F of x equals

3
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:21,655
2 corresponds with f. F of x equals x cubed minus 1 corresponds with letter a,

4
00:00:21,655 --> 00:00:28,534
and f of x equals the absolute value of x minus 2 corresponds with letter d.

5
00:00:28,534 --> 00:00:34,486
And finally, f of x equals the square root of 3x plus 2 corresponds with letter

6
00:00:34,486 --> 00:00:36,215
e.
