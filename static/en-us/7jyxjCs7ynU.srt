1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:02,850
Let's summarize what we need to do.

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:06,900
The AV audio recorder is going to call
out the record sounds view controller

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:08,530
once the recording is complete.

4
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:12,170
And the file is saved right
to this function here.

5
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:14,800
We need to den call the stop
recording segway and so

6
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,770
on along with it the path
to the recorded sound.

7
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:22,160
If we had this line to the audio
recorder did finish recording function

8
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,410
that you see here.

9
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:26,930
We can call the stop recording
segway and send it the URL for

10
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:28,240
the recording file is located.

11
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:32,750
Notice something here, the audio
recorder did finish recording function,

12
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:37,410
receives a flag, indicating if saving
the recording was successful or not.

13
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:38,800
We should read that flag and

14
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:43,160
if saving the recording failed, we can
print out a message to the console.

15
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:45,760
I'm going to switch out
the single call here.

16
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,140
For an if statement.

17
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:49,530
If the flag is true then I'm
going to perform the segue.

18
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:50,990
And if it's false,

19
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:54,910
I'm going to print out saving of
the recording failed out to the console.

20
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:57,720
Now we just need a way to inform
the play sound's view controller

21
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:00,840
it just received the URL
of the recorded audio.

22
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:01,600
Lucky for us,

23
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,690
UI Kit makes that fairly simple as
I'll show you in the next step.
