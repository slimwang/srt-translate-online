1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,506
We now have two things added together. We have 4 x times the quantity 2 x plus

2
00:00:05,506 --> 00:00:11,160
5, added to 3 times the quantity 2 x plus 5. Between these two terms, we have a

3
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:17,058
common factor of 2 x plus 5, so we can start by pulling that outside. And then,

4
00:00:17,058 --> 00:00:22,184
we can multiply that, and then we can rate the things that it multiplies. 4 x

5
00:00:22,184 --> 00:00:27,411
plus 3. So the final factored form of 8 x squared plus 26 x plus 15 is just this

6
00:00:27,411 --> 00:00:32,453
expression, the quantity 2 x plus 5 times the quantity 4 x plus 3. Awesome.

7
00:00:32,453 --> 00:00:36,860
Let's check that just to make sure. We multiply 2 x by each of these terms, and

8
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:40,948
then we multiply 5 by each of these terms. All we need to do now is add like

9
00:00:40,948 --> 00:00:45,300
terms, and voila, we have verified that this factored form is in fact equal to

10
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,944
the expression we started out with. Awesome.
