00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:04,080
Now, let's discuss some details
of intrusion detection.

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,940
First, what are the key design elements
of an intrusion detection system.

3
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:13,220
First, for
intrusion detection to even be possible,

4
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:16,250
we need to make some
important assumptions.

5
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:20,870
First, we can observe system and
network and user activities.

6
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:24,750
Second, from the activities
that we can observe, normal and

7
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:29,470
intrusion actions have distinct
evidence, that is, for

8
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:34,480
intrusion detection to even be possible,
we must be able to find evidence of

9
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:40,900
intrusions by observing systems,
networks, and user activities.

10
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:44,410
When it comes to designing
an intrusion detection system,

11
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:46,780
we must consider the following.

12
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:49,530
From the point of view
of detection algorithm,

13
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:53,370
we must consider the features,
meaning how do we capture and

14
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:56,980
represent intrusion or
normal activity evidence?

15
00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:00,030
We must also decide
the detection models.

16
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:03,180
Meaning, how do we piece
the evidence together, so

17
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:08,870
that we can decide whether
an activity is normal or intrusive.

18
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:14,430
The system architecture typically
includes several modules including

19
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:18,810
audit data processor,
a knowledge base, a detection and

20
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:23,950
decision engine, and alarm
generation and response mechanisms.
