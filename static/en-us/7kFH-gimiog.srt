Now that we found that 2 over 6 is a zero of this function, does that mean that

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:09,650
one of it's factors is 6x minus 2? Please tell me yes if you agree that this

3
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:14,200
follows the pattern of previous relationships between zeros and factors, or

4
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:18,400
tell me no if you think that the fact that 6x minus 2 is divisible by 2 But 6x

5
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:25,589
cubed minus 17x squared plus 11x minus 2, is not as a problem.
