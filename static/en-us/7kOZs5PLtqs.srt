Great job so far, this is pretty complicated stuff. To wrap up this lesson we're

2
00:00:06,131 --> 00:00:10,289
going to do a little experiment and it's going to be awesome if you guys

3
00:00:10,289 --> 00:00:15,460
participate. Together we're all going to generate sampling distributions of size

4
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:20,832
1, 5, and t0. So here's what we're going to do. Pick a number, any number

5
00:00:20,832 --> 00:00:25,723
between 1 and 1048. Click the link to access the Klout score data, and then find

6
00:00:25,723 --> 00:00:31,098
the Klout score in the row of the number you picked. So if you picked the number

7
00:00:31,098 --> 00:00:36,926
786, for example, go to row 786, find what Klout score that is, then write it

8
00:00:36,926 --> 00:00:43,278
down. Next,pick 5 numbers between 1 and 1048, find the Klout scores in these

9
00:00:43,278 --> 00:00:49,476
rows, take the average, and then write this number down. Finally, repeat this

10
00:00:49,476 --> 00:00:54,896
process with ten numbers. So you should get three numbers. Write these numbers

11
00:00:54,896 --> 00:00:59,518
in the Google form, with the link below. So essentially, we're going to get a

12
00:00:59,518 --> 00:01:04,717
bunch of means, depending on how many of you guys participate. So let's say 1000

13
00:01:04,717 --> 00:01:10,140
of you participate. Then we'll have 1000 Klout scores. Which we'll then create a

14
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:14,692
distribution for. And this should look like the population distribution. And

15
00:01:14,692 --> 00:01:22,179
we'll also have 1000 means, of samples of size five. And we'll have 1000 means

16
00:01:22,179 --> 00:01:27,481
from samples of size 10. Then we'll be able to graph each of these sampling

17
00:01:27,481 --> 00:01:32,337
distributions and see if it turns out how we theoretically would have expected.

18
00:01:32,338 --> 00:01:36,763
So time for your last quiz of this lesson. Is this going to be awesome?
