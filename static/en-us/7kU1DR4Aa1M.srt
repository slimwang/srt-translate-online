00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:02,870
After you answer a question, there's typically going to be a short

2
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:06,740
video explaining the answer before moving on to the next video or topic.

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:09,200
>> For example, right now I'm explaining that all

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,700
the answers to the last question were correct. Go us!

5
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:11,945
>> Woohoo

6
00:00:11,945 --> 00:00:12,780
[NOISE]

7
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:15,430
Now some questions are going to have right or wrong answers. If

8
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:17,650
you don't get it right the first time, don't worry about it.

9
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:19,850
>> Just pay attention to any feedback that

10
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:21,760
you see appear on the screen and try again.

11
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,950
>> And some questions don't have right

12
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:25,740
or wrong answers at all. These questions

13
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:28,890
are just meant to get you thinking. Or poll the class in interesting ways.

14
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:31,050
>> And remember, you should have fun answering

15
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:34,170
these questions. After all, genetics is all about fun.
