1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,300
So this is an app called Trimensional.

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:05,036
Grant Schindler did PhD,
with us at Georgia Tech and

3
00:00:05,036 --> 00:00:07,267
here we notice a couple
of things he's doing.

4
00:00:07,267 --> 00:00:11,253
Just by an app like this, and he
basically puts it in front of himself in

5
00:00:11,253 --> 00:00:15,490
a dark room and, of course, the app
turns on different types of lights.

6
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:20,400
And, based on how the face is lit,
it actually can generate a, well,

7
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,890
interesting 3D mesh.

8
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:25,840
Now, it's not the most accurate mesh or
anything like that, but

9
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,650
you can see that it
does a pretty good job.

10
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:33,008
And all it does is basically
changes how the face is lit.

11
00:00:33,008 --> 00:00:35,940
This is a whole concept that actually
also sometimes is referred to as

12
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:36,930
photometric stereo.

13
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:40,412
That is, how do you photometrically
change the properties of the environment

14
00:00:40,412 --> 00:00:43,208
and capture the variations that
are coming in because of that,

15
00:00:43,208 --> 00:00:44,808
to extract the shape of something?

16
00:00:44,808 --> 00:00:46,981
So in this case of course,
it was done for faces,

17
00:00:46,981 --> 00:00:50,060
just like I showed you in the previous
example of shape from shading.
