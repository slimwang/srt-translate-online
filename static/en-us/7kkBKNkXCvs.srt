Before we go into more depth about rational expressions, let's recall our

2
00:00:03,602 --> 00:00:08,393
knowledge about fractions. A fraction is a rational number or a ratio of two

3
00:00:08,393 --> 00:00:13,049
integers. In this case, we have the ratio of five to eight or five eighths. A

4
00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:16,990
student showed the following work when trying to simplify five eighths. Do you

5
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:21,898
think this work is correct, and why? Choose yes or no and then check off either

00:00:21,898 --> 00:00:24,174
reasons that support your answer.
