1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:02,480
You should get out and network.

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:06,260
My parents must have told me this 100
times when I started looking for jobs.

3
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:08,039
For the same reason of getting a job,

4
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:10,110
your apps should get out and
network, too.

5
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:14,190
Because networking is such a key
feature in so many iOS apps.

6
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:17,950
Now the networking over here,
this really isn't my forte.

7
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:18,900
But you're in luck.

8
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:22,490
I'm good at iOS networking, and
I'm going to show you how to do it.

9
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:25,810
If you've never heard about
networks before, that's okay.

10
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:29,001
In this course, the main prerequisite
is that you're comfortable with UIkit,

11
00:00:29,001 --> 00:00:32,770
you've built a few apps, and
that you're ready to learn.

12
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:33,990
Throughout this course we're going to

13
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:36,180
build four small apps
that use networking.

14
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:40,440
These apps will prepare you to build
a portfolio app called, On The Map.

15
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:44,102
Among other things, On The Map will
allow you the Udacity student,

16
00:00:44,102 --> 00:00:48,022
to share your location and something
awesome about you on a map with other

17
00:00:48,022 --> 00:00:50,319
Udacity students from around the world.

18
00:00:50,319 --> 00:00:54,050
To build On The Map, we'll need to learn
how networking works, how to send and

19
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:58,030
receive data over the network, and how
to display that data that we receive.

20
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:01,290
My name is Jared Parks and I'm going to
be the instructor for this course.

21
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:02,850
For now let's get to the point.

22
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:04,864
You should go out and network.
