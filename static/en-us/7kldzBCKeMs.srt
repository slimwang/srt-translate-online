1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:02,009
So now, of course,
that begs the question.

2
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:03,830
How do I define similarity?

3
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:10,887
So here I'm just showing you a few
frames, f1, f2, f3, 4 and so forth.

4
00:00:10,887 --> 00:00:14,280
And, as we know we have 90 of them.

5
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:17,800
First, I can basically think about
computing the Euclidean distance

6
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,230
between two frames.

7
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:21,890
So here basically,
let's consider just two frames.

8
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:24,530
And we can try to do this
mathematically very simply.

9
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:30,290
That first frame here is p, and it has
all of these pixels up to n pixels,

10
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:32,490
and q all of these
pixels up to n pixels.

11
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:35,420
Again, they have to be the same size,
as we know, right?

12
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:39,568
So of course, now we want to know how to
compute the Euclidean distance here, and

13
00:00:39,568 --> 00:00:44,030
I'm referring, that basically is d2
from p to q, which basically, kind of,

14
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:45,990
now takes the square of
difference from each and

15
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:52,280
every one of the two similar pixels, p1
minus q1, p2 minus q2, for all of them.

16
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:55,720
This, of course, can be made into
a simple equation, which is shown here.

17
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:58,980
Summation across from 1 to N,
all of the pixels, and

18
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,970
subtracting one element by the other,
and of course,

19
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:04,360
we're taking the square difference,
which is the Euclidean difference here.

20
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:07,530
This distance metric is
referred to as an L2 norm.

21
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:10,920
And, of course, this is a way of kind of
computing the distance between each and

22
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,800
every one of the frames.

23
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:17,060
I can do this again, as I said, for
each and every f1 to the other 90, f2,

24
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:19,140
the other 90, and all that stuff.
