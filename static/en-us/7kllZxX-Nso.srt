In dynamic programming, this happens to be really easy to program--

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
even easier than in A-star. Here is how I did it.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I defined a field called "policy" of the same size as my grid,

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
initialized it with lots of spaces.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Now in my dynamic programming procedure

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
check for whether we have reached the goal state, and we have.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Then I set the corresponding element to star,

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
using a single new command that just sets policy [x, y] to star.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Finally, in my big update loop where I assign an improved value to a grid cell [x, y]

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
based on its successor, I assign to the policy the character

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
that corresponds to the action that led to that update over here.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Put differently, as we look for a better value we look into all possible directions

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
by looping over all actions.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
If one of those succeeds, I just memorize in my policy function what that action was

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
with a command over here.

16
00:01:01,000 --> 99:59:59,999
If I finally know output this, then I get this field over here.
