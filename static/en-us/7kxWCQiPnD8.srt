1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:05,290
So this is the basic definition of a pinhole camera or a camera obscura.

2
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:09,300
The basic idea is that if you have a 3D scene and if you can

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:14,700
create a small device like this one, which basically has a small hole,

4
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:19,820
a pinhole, then all the light from this 3D scene would go through this pinhole.

5
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:24,860
And if you put some sort of a screen or a sensor inside this box,

6
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:28,120
it'll appear upside down inside this box.

7
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:33,110
The simplest definition of a camera, therefore, would be as basically how light

8
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:39,350
goes through this hole, is generated upside down in the back of this box.

9
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:43,300
And if you notice, all the light is basically going in from one hole and

10
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:45,252
appearing upside down here.

11
00:00:45,252 --> 00:00:48,060
And now, of course, the simplest thing we can do to make this

12
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:50,290
into a camera that would preserve this image,

13
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:54,920
would be to be able to store this image in some form or the other.

14
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,460
I'm just showing you a few more examples.

15
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:59,040
These are the classic examples of pinhole cameras.

16
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,660
And I did mention earlier that this definition of

17
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:05,209
a camera has existed from about three to 400 BC.

18
00:01:05,209 --> 00:01:08,590
Where you would put a light source here, go through a pinhole, and

19
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:11,890
an image would be formed upside down inside the box.

20
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:16,640
And this was a classic method used in the old days also, where basically 3D

21
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:21,160
scenes like this would actually be captured through a pinhole upside down.

22
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:24,790
And people would actually use various types of sketching mechanisms to

23
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:26,010
preserve this.

24
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:29,790
And they would actually do sketching or painting on a wall to preserve this.

25
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:33,585
Of course, we have many different methods of preserving this, and

26
00:01:33,585 --> 00:01:35,980
there's a whole lot of stuff about both films, and

27
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:37,850
of course, digital sensors that can do this.
