1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:01,050
All right, cool.

2
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:03,920
I've got a shopping list name that
anyone in the world can update.

3
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:06,990
Let's call on some users and
see what the big picture looks like.

4
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:09,170
Okay, we have three of us using
the version of the app that you

5
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:10,220
just created.

6
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:13,468
When the app starts up,
it attaches a value event listener.

7
00:00:13,468 --> 00:00:16,860
This listener gets triggered
immediately, it takes a snapshot, and

8
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:20,400
it delivers the snapshot of
Dummy Data to us immediately.

9
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,610
So all of our apps read Dummy Data.

10
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:23,270
Okay.

11
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:26,530
Let's say my roommate Kagure changes
the name of the shopping list to

12
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:27,830
Kagure's List.

13
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:29,410
What happens with Firebase?

14
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:32,090
It occurs in milliseconds but
it's fairly complex.

15
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:33,070
Okay, go for it, Kagure.

16
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:38,740
Once she does this, the app sends the
data to a specific location in Firebase.

17
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:41,160
Base URL plus listName.

18
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:44,312
And the value in Firebase
changes to Kagure's List.

19
00:00:44,312 --> 00:00:47,990
Because listName changed, the listeners
triggered, and a snapshot is taken.

20
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:50,240
Because we were all sitting
at the same location and

21
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:54,360
it changed, we all get the updated data
in the form of a database snapshot.

22
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:58,210
Then the onDataChanged has triggered all
of our apps with this data snapshot.

23
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:00,380
And if you wrote your code correctly,

24
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:04,120
then everyone's UI display changes
to seamlessly show the updated data.

25
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:07,620
And the same thing happens no
matter who changes the data.

26
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:10,150
One person will change it,
and it updates for everyone.

27
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:12,905
And that's what's so cool about
reading and writing data in Firebase.
