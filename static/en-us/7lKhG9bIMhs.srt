1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,160
Here were the correct answers.

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:06,670
Doctor visits per year is an ordered data type, life expectancy is and

3
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:09,580
spending per person are both quantitative data types, and

4
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:13,020
has universal healthcare is a nominal data type.

5
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:14,582
Now among these four variables,

6
00:00:14,582 --> 00:00:17,860
I think doctor visits per year was probably the hardest to identify.

7
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:19,530
Let's take a look at why.

8
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:22,960
Average number of doctor visits per year is represented by the size of

9
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,500
these circles.

10
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:28,450
And if we look closely we can see that each of these circles corresponds to

11
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:29,000
a range.

12
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:32,980
So basically we've taken quantitative data and

13
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:38,350
split it up into bins which makes this data type an ordered data type.

14
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:41,070
Average life expectancy at birth and spending per

15
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:45,740
person are both quantitative data types just like in the graph we saw before.

16
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:46,300
And whether or not

17
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:49,630
a country has health insurance is really just a nominal data type.

18
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:51,660
It's really a yes or no question.

19
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:52,900
So that's two categories
