1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Now, every problem is a little different,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
and all of the database products are a little different,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
so most of what I'm going to cover in this lesson applies

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
in the general case, but not always.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
But one of the things that does apply in almost every general case is this notion of tables,

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
so let's say we're building a site like Reddit that's going to take links from users,

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and we will store them in a database and allow users to vote on those links,

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and then we'll show what's the most popular.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
We'll probably have a table for links,

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
and this link is made up of a number of things.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
It's got an ID.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
It's probably got a number of votes.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
It's got the user that submitted the link.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
It's got a date of when the link was submitted,

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
and it probably has a title.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
This is what we'd display on the site, and a URL.

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
These are all called columns of the database.

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Columns are basically the properties that

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
make up a particular type, so in this case, our type is a link.

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
That's what we're going to call our table, and these are columns.

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Now, every entry of a link in this table is called a row,

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
so we might have a link that looks something like this.

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Here would be an example ID, 5.

24
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
It's just an integer.

25
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The number of votes that this link has.

26
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
The user that submitted it. This is an interesting column.

27
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
We'll come back to this.

28
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
The date of when the link was submitted and a title and a URL.

29
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Let's talk about each of these columns.

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Now, this thing in its entirety is called a row,

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
and a row is one instance of an element in this table,

32
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
so we'll have many, many rows for all of the links that are submitted.

33
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
And my label isn't very good here, but these are the columns.

34
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Columns go down, rows go across.

35
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Let's talk about each of these columns.

36
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
The ID column is important in almost all tables.

37
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Generally every row will have an ID,

38
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
and this is how you refer to that row specifically.

39
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
This is link #5.

40
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
It's not required in most databases that you have something called an ID,

41
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
but it's really helpful, and in some databases, it is, in fact, required.

42
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Usually it's an integer. It could be a string.

43
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:14,000
The database on Google App Engine allows you to use integers or strings.

44
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
This column here, votes, this column is also an integer.

45
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
This refers to the number of votes on this link.

46
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
This column here, user, is also an integer,

47
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
so this is a reference to the ID of the user who submitted the link,

48
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:33,000
so we may have another table called Users or User

49
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
that may have its own set of columns, one of which is an ID.

50
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,000
It may also have name and date

51
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
and maybe password.

52
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
There could be another table called User that stores all of our users,

53
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
and this column is just a reference to this other table,

54
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
and we'll come back more to these types of relationships later,

55
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
but just know that this is a common way of doing things.

56
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Okay, so then we'll have our date column for the link,

57
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
and this probably has a type of date.

58
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Not all databases support the date type, but the ones we'll be using in this class do,

59
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
and it's really handy to store this stuff.

60
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
And this is ultimately probably an integer, but depending on

61
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
the sophistication of the database, they may have a real date type.

62
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
And of course, we'll have the title,

63
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
which is a string.

64
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
This may also in some databases be known as text

65
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
or varchar or there's lots of ways of referring to it,

66
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
but it's basically just referring to this type, but it's just a string.

67
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
And URL is the same thing. It's also a string.

68
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Our table is made up of--defined of columns,

69
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
and it's filled up with rows.

70
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Every time a user submits something, we add a new row.

71
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:54,000
If another submission comes in--we may have 0 votes and submitted by user 27--

72
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
this table can have a lot of data in it.

73
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Before we go into specific database stuff, let's work through some

74
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
examples in Python of how we might manipulate

75
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
this kind of structured data programming.
