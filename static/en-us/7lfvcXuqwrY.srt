1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:05,250
I look for a developer that has
a strong basis in Java, but

2
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:08,590
also has a very wide knowledge
of Android in general.

3
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:12,720
You find a lot of developers
that have very specific roles

4
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:15,580
the where they only know a very
narrow system of Android.

5
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:20,510
I think just having a good grasp on
every fundamentals is very important.

6
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:22,810
When I interview candidates I'm
looking for candidates that,

7
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:26,890
I intentionally give them a very broad
question, and I want them to clarify.

8
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:30,150
I want them to be able to ask
me more questions about it.

9
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:33,870
Follow up with kind
of other solutions or

10
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:36,850
just be very creative
on possible answers.
