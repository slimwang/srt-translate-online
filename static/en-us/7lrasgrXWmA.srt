1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,340
Firewalls have limitations.

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:06,520
That is, there are situations where
a firewall provides no protection.

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:09,050
If traffic does not pass
through a firewall,

4
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:13,280
then a firewall cannot examine said
traffic and provide protection.

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:17,050
For example, if traffic is routing
around the firewall, meaning that

6
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:21,020
the traffic does not pass through the
firewall, then there is no protection.

7
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:24,560
Or for traffic that's internal to the
network meaning that the traffic does

8
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,810
not go across the boundary between
internal and external networks,

9
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:32,980
then there's no protection by the
firewall that sits between internal and

10
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:34,460
external networks.

11
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:36,382
If the firewall is misconfigured,

12
00:00:36,382 --> 00:00:40,940
the traffic that passes through, the
firewall cannot examine it correctly.
