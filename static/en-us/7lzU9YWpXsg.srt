1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:01,830
So if we look through the documentation,

2
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:04,590
we'll see that StringProperty
is indexed by default.

3
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:06,140
TextProperty is not.

4
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:07,860
DateTimeProperty is.

5
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:10,810
BlobProperty is not, and
JsonProperty is not.

6
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:12,970
The only tricky one here
is DateTimeProperty,

7
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:16,129
where it doesn't explicitly say in
the docs if it's indexed or not.

8
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:18,620
But since the default
behavior is indexed for all,

9
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:20,170
we can assume it's indexed.

10
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:21,990
You can also look at your datastore and

11
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:24,479
see that you have Date/Time
values with an index.
