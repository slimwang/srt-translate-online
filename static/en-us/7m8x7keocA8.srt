00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,763
>> Our slope is negative 3, or negative 3 divided by 1. It terms of direction,

2
00:00:04,763 --> 00:00:09,104
we know we need to travel down 3 units and then right 1 unit. From our y

3
00:00:09,104 --> 00:00:13,674
intercept we travel down 3 units and to the right 1 unit. We wind up at 1,

4
00:00:13,674 --> 00:00:18,650
negative 4. So this point is certainly on our graph. Once we have two points, we

5
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:23,074
can connect our line and draw it in. We can see we have some other points on our

6
00:00:23,074 --> 00:00:27,581
graph, like negative 1, 2 and negative 2, 5. But these aren't any of these other

7
00:00:27,581 --> 00:00:31,971
points, so they don't work. If you also plugged in these values for x and y into

8
00:00:31,971 --> 00:00:36,316
our equation, you would find that you'd get a statement that wasn't true. So

9
00:00:36,316 --> 00:00:40,626
these points aren't on the line because they don't satifsy our equation. If

10
00:00:40,626 --> 00:00:45,115
you're still having some trouble with slope, remember you can always refer back

11
00:00:45,115 --> 00:00:49,605
to the directions. You start at the point, and move down 3 and right 1. Drawing

12
00:00:49,605 --> 00:00:51,177
your arrows to help you out.
