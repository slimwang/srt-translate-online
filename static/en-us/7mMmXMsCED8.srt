1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:02,360
All right. There are a bunch of new concepts here.

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:03,650
Let's start with init.

3
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:05,430
Init creates a repository and

4
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:08,830
doesn't directly relate to any of the other concepts currently on the map.

5
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:10,370
So it seems pretty straightforward.

6
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:12,430
We just want to connect it to repository.

7
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:15,190
Since it does something with repository, it creates it.

8
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:17,220
This is an operates on connection.

9
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:20,200
There's only spot that makes sense for init, given this.

10
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,280
The rest of these are a little bit trickier.

11
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:24,140
Let's think about the staging area.

12
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:27,610
You put things into the staging area before you make a commit.

13
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:29,896
So it's pretty related to the concept of a commit.

14
00:00:29,896 --> 00:00:30,514
Git add and

15
00:00:30,514 --> 00:00:34,860
git status both work on the staging area to help you make the commits.

16
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:38,410
Both of these are going to have operates on connections to the staging area.

17
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:41,100
Status also shows you what's in your working directory, so

18
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,120
it'll have an operates-connection to working directories as well.

19
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:48,000
So this gives us enough information to go ahead and fill in all of these.
