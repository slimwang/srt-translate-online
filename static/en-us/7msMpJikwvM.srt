00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,920
Here is an example of the first known photograph.

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:06,970
It's one of the first known recorded projections done in 1826.

3
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:11,520
You can see the device here on the left, and on the right

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:15,560
was a reproduction that was made in the mid 50s of what the image looked like.

5
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:20,150
Now, what's remarkable is this image is called a Heliograph.

6
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:23,120
Helio sun because it took a lot of sunlight in order to make that picture.

7
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:27,370
A pewter plate, which is metal, was coated with something called Bitumen of

8
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:31,450
Judea, which is some sort of derivative of a petroleum chemical.

9
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:37,380
After a day long exposure, so like, eight hours, the plate's removed and

10
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:41,595
the image is found by, you have to wash it in a solution,

11
00:00:41,595 --> 00:00:44,910
a mixture of oil of lavender and white petroleum.

12
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:48,700
Which dissolved away the parts that had not been hardened by the light.

13
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:51,480
So the idea was you have a chemical, it was a liquid that had

14
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,720
underwent a chemical reaction from, from the light that would change it.

15
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:59,520
So then you could then remove some of that and that's how you got an image.

16
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,080
Those of you who've been fortunate enough ever to work in a dark room,

17
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:08,000
it still has that principle of chemicals manipulating silver halide.

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,230
Or, or, or some silver elements that are changed by light.

19
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:15,240
Of course, most of us don't do that any more.

20
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:19,120
We we use these fancy devices which have no soul, but

21
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,800
which capture pixels better.
