If you answered no, you were right.

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:09,000
Scaling does not change the value of the Pearson's correlation coefficient.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,180
The value is still 0.9989.

4
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:17,870
Specifically, scaling features can make the feature better,

5
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:20,590
both computationally and visually.

6
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:25,110
And you won't lose the correlation between variables or features.
