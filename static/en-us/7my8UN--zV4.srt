00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,356
When multiplying 1 by a power of 10, I can see that the decimal point moves one

2
00:00:04,368 --> 00:00:08,675
place to the right, it goes here. When I multiply by another power of 10, the

3
00:00:08,687 --> 00:00:13,006
decimal place moves again to the right, right here. So I can easily tell that

4
00:00:13,018 --> 00:00:15,289
the decimal point is always moving right.
