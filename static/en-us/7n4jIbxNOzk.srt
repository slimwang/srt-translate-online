We learn how to multiply radicals using the product rule. Whenever we have the

2
00:00:04,477 --> 00:00:09,480
same index, we can simply multiply the radicals together. We can't multiply

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:12,576
square roots and cube roots together but we could multiply fourth roots and

4
00:00:12,576 --> 00:00:17,422
fourth roots together since the indexes would match. Lets dive deeper into

5
00:00:17,422 --> 00:00:21,708
multiplying radicals and see if you can get some of these correct. See if you

6
00:00:21,708 --> 00:00:25,292
can multiply each pair of roots here together and then simplify the answer if

7
00:00:25,292 --> 00:00:28,333
possible. Try your best on these.
