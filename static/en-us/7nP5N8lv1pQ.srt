1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,980
I'd like to take a slight tangent here, very slight and very brief, and look at

2
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:07,748
a number like this, 6 over the quantity 1 minus the root of 2. Now, at first

3
00:00:07,748 --> 00:00:11,726
sight, this may seem completely unrelated to what we were just talking about.

4
00:00:11,726 --> 00:00:15,677
But I'd like you to focus on the denominator for a second. The problem that I

5
00:00:15,677 --> 00:00:20,024
see with this quantity, and the reason that we can't really do anything with

6
00:00:20,024 --> 00:00:24,578
this fraction right now, is that there's a rational part and an irrational part

7
00:00:24,578 --> 00:00:28,715
in our denominator. I think in general, numbers are easier to work with the

8
00:00:28,715 --> 00:00:32,759
closer they get toward the center of that world of numbers diagram. So, let's

9
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:36,480
see if we can make our denominator have only one component, probably just a

10
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,869
rational component instead of an irrational one. So, what number would you need

11
00:00:40,869 --> 00:00:45,419
to multiply the numerator and denominator of this fraction by in order to come

12
00:00:45,419 --> 00:00:50,109
up with an equivalent fraction, where the denominator is a rational number and,

13
00:00:50,109 --> 00:00:51,877
of course, it's not equal to 0?
