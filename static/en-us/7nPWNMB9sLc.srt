1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:05,700
Another review role is that of the reader. Reviews should be systematic and

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:10,460
thorough. One way to deal with this need is to explicitly address each part of

3
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:13,950
the artifact being reviewed. For example, in the code review, each line should

4
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:17,280
be individually looked at. The reader is the person responsible for

5
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:21,150
enforcing this thoroughness by leading the participants through the artifact and

6
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:24,780
for each part paraphrasing what, what the artifact is expressing for

7
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:29,590
that part. The paraphrasing should be its, should be descriptive, and

8
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:34,320
not try to say why that particular part is there. Some organizations run their

9
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,360
reviews with the artifact's authors being the readers. Other organizations make

10
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,240
sure that someone else does the reading. I think in the case of the first type

11
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:49,970
of organization, the thought is that an author might buy us the discussion

12
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:55,680
by emphasizing certain things, the author felt as important, even at the expense

13
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,300
of perhaps hiding some details which need to be looked at more carefully.

14
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:03,620
In either case, the reader should use impersonal pronouns such as it,

15
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:08,080
referring to the artifact, rather than referring directly to the author with I,

16
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:13,330
or he, or she, or something like that. Personalizing a review by using I and,

17
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:17,440
and you, and, and so on, can raise the defensiveness level of

18
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:20,960
the participants thereby reducing the review's effectiveness.
