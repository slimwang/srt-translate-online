00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,160
Here I want to show you another example, where we can do same kinds of things.

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:07,020
Except, we want to use this approach to take the scenes that are the most

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:11,940
similar, either out or put them back in to extend the size of this image.

4
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:14,220
So here the goal is, I have this image.

5
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:15,890
What happens if I want to shrink it, so

6
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:18,950
I want to get rid of some information in the horizontal, or

7
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:23,270
I want to increase the size so the aspect ratio is much wider here.

8
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:24,070
And I want to add frame.

9
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:26,040
This is a method called scene carving, and

10
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:28,790
again, you can look at more details on the papers listed below.

11
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,360
Here's how the dissolve looks like.

12
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:33,580
So here I'm basically shrinking them,

13
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:38,290
what's really happening is some of the, you know, seam is being removed.

14
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:40,480
Or, when I'm stretching it out,

15
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,420
more seams are added based on the sample space between them.

16
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:47,820
And this is allow used, allows you to kind of generate a much larger

17
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:50,000
aspect ratio or a small aspect ratio.

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,660
These kinds of approaches are very common and also available in

19
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:57,360
standard Photoshop tools like content aware fills and stuff like that.

20
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,420
They are widely available in a variety of photo apps these days.
