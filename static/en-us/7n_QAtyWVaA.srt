1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:03,310
If you think back to
the diagonalization of Turing machines.

2
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:05,530
You'll notice that we hardly
refer to the properties of Turing

3
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:07,070
machines at all.

4
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:09,970
In fact, except at the end,
we might as well have been talking

5
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:13,970
about a different model of computation,
say, the doomaflitchy.

6
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:15,590
Perhaps, unlike Turing machines,

7
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:19,400
doomaflitchies halt on every
input,these models exist.

8
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:20,900
A model that allowed one step for

9
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:23,360
each input symbol would
satisfy this requirement.

10
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,800
How do we resolve the paradox then?

11
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,670
Can't we just build the dumaflache
that takes the description of

12
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:32,610
a dumaflache as input and
then runs it on itself?

13
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:38,000
It has to halt so
we can reject if it accepts, and

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,660
accept if it rejects,
achieving the needed inversion.

15
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:43,440
What's the problem?

16
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,440
Take a minute to think about it.
