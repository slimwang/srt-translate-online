1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,176
My answer is everything but the TLB.

2
00:00:03,176 --> 00:00:05,220
Here's the condition
that you need to check,

3
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:08,840
does the cache have more
lines than words per line?

4
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:11,050
For instance,
let's take the register file.

5
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:15,880
A cache line is just a register,
and the line width is 16 bytes.

6
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:17,650
So the number of lines is 16,

7
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:21,880
and the words per line is 16
Bytes divided by 8 Bytes, or 2.

8
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:25,480
So the register file is indeed tall.

9
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,960
Now let's take the L1 cache example.

10
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,670
The number of lines is 2,048.

11
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:32,820
That's 32 kiB divided by 64 bytes.

12
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:35,970
The number of words per line is 8.

13
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:38,130
So it's also tall.

14
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:39,850
Now let's skip to the TLB.

15
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:43,570
The number of lines is just the number
of TLB entries, which is 256.

16
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:46,720
But that's actually less than
the number of words per line,

17
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,468
which in this case is 1,024.

18
00:00:48,468 --> 00:00:52,220
Thus, this quote-unquote cache is short.

19
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:53,960
So here are the final answers again.

20
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:57,790
The main conclusion of this exercise is
that most levels of the memory hierarchy

21
00:00:57,790 --> 00:00:59,970
are indeed tall, but
not all of them are.
