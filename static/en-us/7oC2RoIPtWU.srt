1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,115
Dividing both sides by 3 gives us x is greater than or equal to 4. Let's check

2
00:00:04,115 --> 00:00:07,764
this on a number line. Here is what this inequality should look like on the

3
00:00:07,764 --> 00:00:11,517
number line. The number line is thus divided into two regions. There's one

4
00:00:11,517 --> 00:00:15,448
region over here on the left of values that x is not allowed to equal. And then

5
00:00:15,448 --> 00:00:19,288
the region on the right of the number line, that's all the values that x is

6
00:00:19,288 --> 00:00:24,655
allowed to equal take on. Let's pick one value from each, and see if they verify

7
00:00:24,655 --> 00:00:30,174
our solution. First, I'll pick a value of x that should work in the original

8
00:00:30,174 --> 00:00:36,150
inequality. Maybe, 6. 3 times 6 is equal to 18. And, yes, 18 is greater than or

9
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:41,759
equal to 12. So that works. Now let's check a value from the left side, the area

10
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:46,433
that's not shaded in. So when I plug in a value from over her to the original

11
00:00:46,433 --> 00:00:50,913
inequality, I should not make this true. A value from over here should not

12
00:00:50,913 --> 00:00:55,393
satisfy this. Let's pick 0. 3 times 0 is equal to 0, and 0 is not greater than

13
00:00:55,393 --> 00:00:58,537
or equal to 12, so this also confirms our solution.
