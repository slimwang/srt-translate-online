1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,650
First it uses repeating key letters.

2
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:08,700
As we have shown in the example, the key
stream is as long as the plain text and

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:12,200
the key letters will be
repeated in a key stream.

4
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:16,379
For example, the key stream can be
lemon, lemon, lemon, and so on.

5
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:20,990
Because the key letters are repeated,
think even a long plaintext message.

6
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:24,900
The same letters may be mapped
to the same cipher text,

7
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:28,540
because they have the same
repeated key letters.

8
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:33,386
For example, if the plaintext letters
A-T-T appear multiple times in

9
00:00:33,386 --> 00:00:37,754
the plaintext, and the key
letters L-E-M are being repeated,

10
00:00:37,754 --> 00:00:41,489
then there high probability
that the same cipher text,

11
00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:46,010
L-X-F will also appears multiple
times in the cipher text.

12
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:48,460
Then using knowledge of
the English language or

13
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:50,530
the context of the communication,

14
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:55,950
the attacker can guess what other words
that may be repeated multiple times.

15
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:59,710
Therefore, by searching for
the repeated cipher text words,

16
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:03,570
the attacker can then compare
the cipher text words and

17
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:06,450
the plaintext words to
uncover the key letters.

18
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:09,350
So this is a weakness
that can be exploited.

19
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:13,170
Second, require security for
the key, not the message.

20
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:16,190
This is, in fact,
a strength of the cipher.

21
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:20,930
Third, the length of the key can be
determined using frequency analysis.

22
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:23,940
This is also a weakness
that can be exploited.

23
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:26,980
For example,
using knowledge of the English language,

24
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:29,420
the attacker can look
at the cipher text and

25
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:34,420
determine that the most frequently
used three letter word is the, T-H-E,

26
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:39,380
and then by looking at the distance
between the two occurrences of there,

27
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:43,210
the calculator can then
guess the length of the key.

28
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:48,155
Knowing the length of a key would help
the attacker uncover the whole key

29
00:01:48,155 --> 00:01:50,553
instead of just a few key letters.

30
00:01:50,553 --> 00:01:51,486
So therefore,

31
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:55,730
this is a weakness that can be
exploited to break the Vigenere Cipher.
