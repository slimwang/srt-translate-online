1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:06,840
The second line here specifies what type of data our x-axis represents.

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,010
Which in this case,

3
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:12,592
is a continuous time value as indicated by the Time Axis function.

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:17,260
Notice that we call this function on the chart object return by

5
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:18,860
the dimple constructor function.

6
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:25,080
We could potentially have multiple charts on a single page and this allows us

7
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:30,400
to specify which chart we would actually like to manipulate and add an axis to.

8
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:35,500
The first argument is the axis which we would like to add, in this case, x.

9
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:41,210
In the second argument, the string representing the column name of

10
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:45,940
what we would like to plot on that axis in this case, the year.

11
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:52,480
So this line of code says, add to my chart a time axis which will be represented

12
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:58,110
by the x-axis on our chart and correspond to the year column of our data.

13
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:06,200
The third line here specifies what type of data our y-axis should represent,

14
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:09,830
and has an identical interface to the add time axis function.

15
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,290
In this case, we have a continuous value we

16
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:19,280
would like to plot on our y-axis specified by add measure axis.

17
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:25,860
The third line says add to my chart a continuous value

18
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:29,890
on the y-axis which corresponds to the attendance column of my data.
