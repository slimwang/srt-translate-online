00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:03,420
So back in the source code for
our Tsunami app, let's go ahead and

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:08,350
open up the MainActivity and
look at the makeHttpRequest method.

3
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:12,820
Now this is the method that performs the
actual HTTP request to the server and

4
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:15,530
takes as input a URL object.

5
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:18,401
A few lines in,
inside our try catch block,

6
00:00:18,401 --> 00:00:22,913
you can see that we call the
openConnection method on the URL object.

7
00:00:22,913 --> 00:00:28,116
Then we cast the return value into
this HttpURLConnection object and

8
00:00:28,116 --> 00:00:31,716
stored in the variable
called urlConnection.

9
00:00:31,716 --> 00:00:36,698
So the answers to the quiz were
the data type of the return value of

10
00:00:36,698 --> 00:00:41,760
url.openConnection is the data
type HttpUrlConnection.

11
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,443
If you looked at the documentation for
the URL class and

12
00:00:44,443 --> 00:00:47,883
then looked at the Public methods
section, then you may have said that

13
00:00:47,883 --> 00:00:52,010
the return value of the openConnection
method is a URLConnection object.

14
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:55,392
Now for this quiz,
we actually accepted either answer

15
00:00:55,392 --> 00:00:59,816
because HttpURLConnection is actually
a subclass of URLConnection.

16
00:00:59,816 --> 00:01:03,119
It inherits all the behavior
of URLConnection and

17
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:05,825
adds more functionality on top of that.

18
00:01:05,825 --> 00:01:10,739
In our case, we're going to be working
within HttpUrlConnection object,

19
00:01:10,739 --> 00:01:13,135
and nor a URLConnection.

20
00:01:13,135 --> 00:01:14,210
Let's discuss this more next.
