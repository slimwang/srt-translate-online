1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:03,570
You've got your building blocks
in place for your app, and

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:06,990
you're almost ready to jump back
into Xcode and start writing it.

3
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:09,891
But, by now,
you should be able to give an estimate

4
00:00:09,891 --> 00:00:12,600
of how long it's going to
take you to complete it.

5
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:16,177
Which is good for whatever career path
you might decide to pursue, whether

6
00:00:16,177 --> 00:00:20,310
you're going to work for a company or
you're going to be a freelancer.

7
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:25,670
For companies, project managers, like
myself, are very grateful for those that

8
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:28,765
can accurately estimate how much time it
will take them to complete something.

9
00:00:28,765 --> 00:00:32,400
And if you're a freelancer,
you need to be able to

10
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,940
accurately estimate how long its
going to take you to do something or

11
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:40,070
else you're going to get totally
screwed and not get paid enough.

12
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:42,640
Go through the list of features
that you plan to use in your app.

13
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,790
How long do you think it will
take you to implement each one?

14
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:48,580
Be generous with your estimates here,
and

15
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:50,690
make sure that you're
including debugging time.

16
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:54,540
It's actually where you'll probably
spend the majority of your time.

17
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:55,130
And here's a hint.

18
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:58,730
It will take you about twice as
long as you think it's going to.

19
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:02,740
But, if you're not sure at all how long
it's going to take you to complete this

20
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:05,810
app, think back to the portfolio apps.

21
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:10,000
How long did it take you to implement
features for MemeMe, or OntheMap, or

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,560
VirtualTourist?

23
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,630
You're doing something
very similar here.

24
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:17,150
You, essentially, have a specification,
you know what APIs you're implementing,

25
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:18,550
you know what features
you want to include,

26
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:22,120
and you're going to build your
app to that specification.

27
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,160
So use past experience as a guide.
