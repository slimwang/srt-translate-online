1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,258
The number that belongs here is 23. So, how did I figure that out? Well, one way

2
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:10,416
to check if the solution is correct is by writing this equation, and then

3
00:00:10,428 --> 00:00:15,724
substituting in values for d and for n, and seeing if they match our table. We

4
00:00:15,724 --> 00:00:21,040
know that,= after 3 days, for example, 69 wiper sets have been produced. So,

5
00:00:21,052 --> 00:00:26,438
that means that if we take d and we replace it with 3, we should get that n

6
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:30,788
equals 69. And sure enough, 23 times 3 is 69. That checks off their table. So,

7
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:36,165
we can see that our equation fits the situation that we were trying to make it

8
00:00:36,177 --> 00:00:40,135
fit. You could do a similar thing with any of the other sets of entries on this

9
00:00:40,147 --> 00:00:44,050
table. When you plug in a number for d, you should end up with a corresponding

10
00:00:44,062 --> 00:00:48,025
number for n when you simplify. But checking if a solution is correct is pretty

11
00:00:48,037 --> 00:00:52,030
different from creating the solution yourself. So, how did we come up with these

12
00:00:52,042 --> 00:00:56,120
mathematical descriptions, these equations on our own? That's what the next few

13
00:00:56,132 --> 00:00:57,455
lessons are going to be about.
