00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,979
I hope you enjoyed learning about neural

2
00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:04,679
networks and convolutions so far you've

3
00:00:04,679 --> 00:00:06,240
been learning about deep neural networks

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,369
at the conceptual level and applying

5
00:00:08,369 --> 00:00:10,259
these techniques to a range of image

6
00:00:10,259 --> 00:00:13,500
classification tasks in the next project

7
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,388
you're going to return to autonomous

8
00:00:15,388 --> 00:00:16,859
driving that's right

9
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:18,809
next you're going to build a deep neural

10
00:00:18,809 --> 00:00:21,089
network to classify traffic signs your

11
00:00:21,089 --> 00:00:22,829
network should be able to take an image

12
00:00:22,829 --> 00:00:24,929
and decide if it's a stop sign a yield

13
00:00:24,929 --> 00:00:26,699
sign a different type of sign or maybe

14
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:29,189
no sign at all this will be a terrific

15
00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:31,500
portfolio project to demonstrate for

16
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,780
employers to your hands on practical

17
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:40,670
experience with deep neural networks
