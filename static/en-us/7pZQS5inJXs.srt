1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
[Thrun] And the answer is 0.125.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Each head has a probability of a half.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
We can multiply those probabilities because they are independent events,

4
00:00:10,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and that gives us 1 over 8 or 0.125.
