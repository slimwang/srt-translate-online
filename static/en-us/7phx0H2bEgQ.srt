1
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:06,460
We're going to be using Google Chrome

2
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:09,160
and Google Chrome developer tools or dev tools,

3
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:11,400
throughout this course. And I recommend that you

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,980
actually use Chrome Canary. Which has all of

5
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:17,970
the latest and greatest development tools built in.

6
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:20,170
And one more thing, when we capture all

7
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:21,850
of our traces. I recommend that you use

8
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:24,425
your phone, to actually capture the profiling data.

9
00:00:24,425 --> 00:00:29,010
>> Mm. Well, that makes sense. But, how do I capture this data with my phone?

10
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:30,550
>> Great question. For the remainder

11
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:32,020
of this lesson, you're going to get some

12
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:33,610
instructions from Peter Lovers, on how to

13
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:37,240
set up mobile debugging. And if you're already familiar, feel free to skip ahead
