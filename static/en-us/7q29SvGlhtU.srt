00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,210
Since this equation is in the same form as the equations for which we could read

2
00:00:05,222 --> 00:00:10,075
the slope as the coefficient of the x to the first term, the slope for this

3
00:00:10,087 --> 00:00:15,261
equation is m. In fact, this is the letter that we usually use to represent the

4
00:00:15,273 --> 00:00:16,595
slope of any line, m.
