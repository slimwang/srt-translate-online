00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,600
Let's take a look at inline elements.

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:07,290
Inline elements such as spans, treat
height the same way as block elements.

3
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:10,340
However, the width is
treated differently.

4
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:12,590
It is content based, that means,

5
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:16,900
an inline element will only be as
wide as the content inside it.

6
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:20,660
Also, unlike block elements,
you cannot set the width and

7
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:22,610
height of inline elements.

8
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:27,690
The box will simply take on the size
of the content, no more, no less.

9
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:30,730
So, you might be thinking to yourself,
well, what happens when the content in

10
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:33,790
an inline element is wider
than the space available?

11
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:35,650
That's a great question.

12
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:37,600
The content wraps.

13
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,920
Each one of these is called a line box,
and

14
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,110
they're all part of
the same inline element.

15
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:47,680
You can think of this one element,
as being broken up into different lines.

16
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,390
Notice that each line box has a top and
bottom border.

17
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:55,550
But the left border only get's drawn at
the beginning of the first line box and

18
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:59,910
the right border only get's drawn
at the end of the last line box.

19
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:05,150
Another interesting behavior, is inline
elements can accept margin And padding.

20
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:10,020
When added, margin will push elements
away horizontally but not vertically.

21
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:11,090
In the next video,

22
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:14,150
you'll have a chance to look at
a wide variety of inline elements.
