1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:03,010
First, let's look at
this helper function

2
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:07,580
that turns the detected activity
type code into a string.

3
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:11,230
It's a very simple switch statement
that just looks at the different codes,

4
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:14,390
be they in_vehicle,
on_bicycle, on_foot, etc.

5
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:18,780
And then returns a string from our
resources file that matches this.

6
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:21,760
So if I have detected
activity in_vehicle,

7
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,030
I'm returning the string for
r.string.in_vehicle.

8
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:28,080
And if you remember earlier on,
when we pasted into our strings file,

9
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,750
I had put those codes in there.

10
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:34,000
So if I come back down to my strings
file, here you can see I have

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,430
things such as in vehicle, in a vehicle
on bicycle, there's on a bicycle, etc.

12
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:42,010
So I've just set up those
strings in my strings file.

13
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:45,840
And then back on my main activity,
whenever I detect that code,

14
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,300
I'm just returning
the equivalent string.

15
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:51,990
So now, let's take a look at what
we've done in the on receive function.

16
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:55,330
Now if you remember, you created it
earlier on and it received a context and

17
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:56,550
an intent.

18
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:57,410
So what do we do?

19
00:00:57,410 --> 00:01:00,950
Well, first of all we create a new
array list of detected activity.

20
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:04,959
I call this updated activities and
we just get the value of this

21
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:09,570
from the getParcelableArrayListExtra
that we spoke about.

22
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:14,080
Now if you remember when we pushed
the detected activity array list

23
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,700
onto the intent, in the intent service,
we called it by a name,

24
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:21,030
which was Constants.ACTIVITY_EXTRA.

25
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:24,580
So we just use that name to address
it to get it right back out.

26
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:27,470
So now we have the array
list of detected activities

27
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:32,490
in our main activity, or at least in the
nested class within the main activity.

28
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:36,840
So now we can just go through and
update the status string as a result.

29
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,990
And because this is a nested class, I
can actually call mStatusText directly.

30
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:46,720
So now all I have to do it I say String
strStatus equals empty to empty it.

31
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,010
And then for each activity,
for each DetectedActivity

32
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:54,080
within this updatedActivities,
I now just update my status

33
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:58,280
to be the string that corresponds to
the actual code returned by getType().

34
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:03,060
And then the actual
confidence as a percentage.

35
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:06,060
So the confidence is
returned as a percentage.

36
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,550
So I just put the percent character
afterwards on a new line.

37
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:12,400
And that's where we were able
to get all of the activities

38
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,510
that we saw on the demo
earlier on on new lines and

39
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:18,990
a rough estimate of what of
the accuracy of that activity.

40
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:22,810
Now there's one more step that we
need to do, and we have to declare

41
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:27,180
this receiver class on the main activity
and make sure that we're using it.

42
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,210
This is pretty simple.

43
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:29,960
Let's go ahead and do that right now.

44
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,660
So first of all,

45
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:34,130
on my MainActivity class where I've
declared these other member variables,

46
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:37,280
I'm going to declare one for
our broadcast receiver, and here it is.

47
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,690
I'm just saying protected
ActivityDetectionBroadcastReceiver and

48
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:43,140
I'm going to call it mBroadcastReceiver.

49
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:46,680
Then in my onCreate function, as I
create all the other member variables,

50
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,930
I'm just going to come in here and

51
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:53,740
paste in that mBroadcastReceiver is a
new ActivityDetectionBroadcastReceiver.

52
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:54,870
We're almost there now.

53
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:57,740
We just need to finish the last part,
and that's to hook up the buttons.
