00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:04,390
Similar to the last question, if we're not sure, then we'd assume that there

2
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:10,460
are equal numbers of males and females. Since there are 2000 people and we're

3
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:14,990
guessing that there will be the same proportion of males and females, then our

4
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:19,683
null hypothesis will be that there are 1000 males and 1000 females.
