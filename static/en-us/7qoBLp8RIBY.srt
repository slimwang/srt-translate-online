00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:02,310
You know, on, on Reddit we can get any page in

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:05,070
JSON, or we can also get it in XML by changing

3
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:07,540
our extension. And a lot of webpages have this feature, where

4
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:11,160
you can get their content in different formats. Another good example is

5
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,549
Twitter. If we were to go Twitter and do a search,

6
00:00:13,549 --> 00:00:16,636
let's look for udacity, we can see all of the tweets about

7
00:00:16,636 --> 00:00:21,213
udacity. Now, if we want to get a JSON listing of this, I happen to know the

8
00:00:21,213 --> 00:00:27,290
URL. We can go to search.twitter.com/search.JSONq=udacity.

9
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:31,140
And now we get a JSON listing of the search result that we

10
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:34,400
were just looking at in Twitter. If you're writing web software and you want

11
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,950
to manipulate another website or get data from another website, you know, it

12
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:39,790
usually just takes a little bit of poking around to find their APIs. Now

13
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:43,770
the way I found this API is I just Googled for Twitter API,

14
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:46,180
and this was, you know, the documentation for this came up. I'll show you

15
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:49,780
that real quick. There's this whole page about you know, twitter search API. One

16
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:52,440
of the nice things about when you're building websites is if you have data.

17
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,510
You know, if let's say you have a blog. Making your blog

18
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:58,100
so it supports RSS. You know, an XML representation of its content, and

19
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00,890
maybe JSON representation of your content, or else other people to build

20
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:04,319
software on top of your website, that, that can do equal things. And

21
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:08,090
so, many large websites, Wikipedia, Twitter, Reddit, all support this types of

22
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:11,700
functionality, and your homework in this class is actually going to be, to

23
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,742
add that functionality to your book that we've been working on. Just something

24
00:01:14,742 --> 00:01:17,294
to be aware, most users don't really see this side of the Internet,

25
00:01:17,294 --> 00:01:19,548
right? It's really only other developers get to

26
00:01:19,548 --> 00:01:21,418
see this APIs and these other formats for

27
00:01:21,418 --> 00:01:25,150
the content, so it's cool that it's all there and it's good to be aware of it.
