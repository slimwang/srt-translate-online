1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:09,216
Well, let's calculate the range for values that are not considered outliers. So

2
00:00:09,216 --> 00:00:18,281
Q1 is 49,191, and the interquartile range is 4,944. So that means that Q1 minus

3
00:00:18,281 --> 00:00:27,088
1.5 times the IQR is 49,191 minus 1.5 times 4944. And this is 41,775, so

4
00:00:27,088 --> 00:00:38,819
anything less than this number is considered an outlier. We also know that Q3 is

5
00:00:38,819 --> 00:00:50,726
54,135 so Q3 plus 1.5 times the IQR Is 54,135 plus 1.5 times 4,944, and this is

6
00:00:50,726 --> 00:01:02,460
61,551. So anything between these numbers is not an outlier. Anything less than

7
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:08,580
this is an outlier, and anything greater than this is an outlier. So that means

8
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:13,615
that statistically these values are outliers, but not $60,000.
