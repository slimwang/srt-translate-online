1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,130
A couple of cool properties as we said,
that this does,

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:09,810
it's very easy to construct the MHI for
one TAL from the other.

3
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:12,380
So you can go from TAL 30 to TAL 15 and

4
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:15,230
that's basically a linear scaling,
right.

5
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:18,820
So if I have an action that can go fast,
or go slow, that's okay,

6
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:22,170
it's not okay for an action that goes
the first half of it is fast and

7
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:25,620
then the second half is slow, where
I have to do something more serious,

8
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:28,210
some more serious dynamic
time-warping or something like that.

9
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:31,540
The whole idea is that we have these
atomic primitives, that can be performed

10
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:34,790
quickly or slowly, but
they don't have lots of parts to them.

11
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:38,190
It's very, it's,
recursive so it's very fast.

12
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:42,310
What's interesting is, and I've had
conversations with some, people who do

13
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:47,020
work in vision from the neural side, or
from, computational vision from biology.

14
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:52,440
You could imagine building
something like these mhi detectors

15
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,450
from very simple neural hardware.

16
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:57,070
Basically filters with slow responses.

17
00:00:57,070 --> 00:01:01,380
And, the fact that these can work
from very low resolution images,

18
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:02,300
which I haven't shown, but

19
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:05,519
because it's just a global pattern
you don't need a lot of pixels.

20
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,330
It means that out here in your
peripheral vision where you have hardly

21
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:13,120
any resolution at all,
when we do the human vision, lesson.

22
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:16,010
We'll, we'll talk about how, you think
you can see out here, but not really.

23
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:16,531
You're just making it up.

24
00:01:16,531 --> 00:01:19,410
All right, but,
what it means is a very low resolution.

25
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:20,940
You can recognize things.

26
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:24,160
So I'm not going to claim anything
in terms of biological reality.

27
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,870
I'll just say that there's some
biological plausibility to,

28
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:28,290
to this kind of work.

29
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:32,060
And there's a reference in PAMI,
which sort of talks more about this.

30
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:35,780
We actually use this system
to build a couple things.

31
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:41,593
Here's Jim Davis, when we were both
much younger building a aerobics system,

32
00:01:41,593 --> 00:01:45,690
where you would be taken through
aerobics by the system and

33
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:48,470
it would watch you and it would know
which, which aerobic you're doing,

34
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:49,970
I mean which one you're
supposed to be doing.

35
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:51,950
It tells you, so
it can recognize it was real easy.

36
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:57,150
We did have this cool little thing that
the music in Jim is very clever making

37
00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:01,830
this happen, the music was actually MIDI
controlled so we can control the tempo.

38
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,700
Right, it wasn't just prerecorded.

39
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:05,430
So that means we could watch you, and

40
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:08,940
we could always make the music go just
a little faster then you were going.

41
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:13,320
So we could sort of, just play with your
head and speed you up and make you sweat

42
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:16,510
more, but it was cool that the thing
would just recognize the system.

43
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:21,050
A more compelling use of this
technology, we built this thing called

44
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:25,600
the KidsRoom, and it was an interactive
play space for children.

45
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,330
The original intent was to
just illustrate how computer

46
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:30,930
vision could do some
interesting cool stuff.

47
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:34,560
And, what was interesting is,
nice article about it in Presence,

48
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,170
but, some folks came by,

49
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:39,450
I don't remember exactly how it was
that they were at the media lab.

50
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:43,580
But they really liked it and they
ported it to the Millennium Dome, so

51
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,200
they built this big thing
called the Millennium Dome,

52
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,410
in London, at the turn of the century,
at the millennium.

53
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:49,500
And they had all these pavilions,
and they were looking for

54
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:53,030
interesting technologies, and this is
one of them that they put in there.

55
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:56,288
So, I, I have a little video here
that shows you first of all,

56
00:02:56,288 --> 00:02:57,933
temporal templates being used.

57
00:02:57,933 --> 00:03:01,710
So the monsters teach the kids these
moves, and then, which is good,

58
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:05,105
because if we wanted to we could
actually get training data from

59
00:03:05,105 --> 00:03:09,265
the actual kids that were there, but the
system is robust enough that we could

60
00:03:09,265 --> 00:03:12,851
use training data from just a couple
of people that we trained on and

61
00:03:12,851 --> 00:03:14,490
it would work for everybody.

62
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:18,580
We also used temporal templates plus,
this little extra stuff that we used.

63
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:20,600
It's all in the paper if you
wanted to read about it.

64
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,700
The, the Presence paper.

65
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:25,680
And then there was a little interesting,
cool thing in, interac.

66
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,900
Well here, I'll just get this started.

67
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:31,263
Okay, so here we have the last bit
where the monsters are teaching,

68
00:03:31,263 --> 00:03:34,590
the last two of the moves,
there are only four of them.

69
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:40,420
First he teaches the kid to do a crouch,
and then she does a crouch in response,

70
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:44,660
and, he's praising how well she's doing
these crouches, and that's great.

71
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:48,070
We go to the point where he's teaching
her to do these flapping motions, and

72
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:49,480
you can see he's pleased with her.

73
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,150
And he's giving her
lots of good feedback.

74
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:56,930
And then I think the last one he's going
to teach her how to do is how to spin.

75
00:03:56,930 --> 00:04:00,720
Say something like surely love
do a spin, and ready spin dude.

76
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,530
There he goes, he's spinning, and

77
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:07,230
now she starts spinning,
and compliment her on that.

78
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:09,320
And when the music changes,

79
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,630
basically they're supposed
to do their own moves and

80
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:15,720
the monsters will follow them but, it
takes them a little while to catch on.

81
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,730
And from now on he's following her.

82
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:21,230
Now one of the thing's that we did in
order to make this room look a lot

83
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:22,620
smarter.

84
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:25,764
The monster would say what you're doing,
right?

85
00:04:25,764 --> 00:04:28,920
And when it would recognize it but

86
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:32,630
it only did that,
when it was sure it was right.

87
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:34,294
If it was close maybe you're spinning,

88
00:04:34,294 --> 00:04:38,580
maybe you're flapping it would just do
whichever one it thought was right.

89
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:41,370
But it would only say
it if it were sure.

90
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:44,080
And the reason is,
if the monster goes and

91
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:49,120
does something that is not what
you are doing, what do you do?

92
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,340
You say, oh,
he wanted to do something else.

93
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:55,940
You just describe intentionality
to the character, but, if he says,

94
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:59,840
oh really cool spin,
and you're flapping?

95
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,250
He just looks stupid.

96
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:04,060
So the way you avoid this interactive
system from looking stupid,

97
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:08,470
is it only speaks when it's sure,
and it acts all the time,

98
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:09,910
because you'll ascribe intentionality.

99
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:11,030
We, we wrote that up in the paper.

100
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:14,420
It was kind of a cool insight in terms
of how to build interactive characters
