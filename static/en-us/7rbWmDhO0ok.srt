00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:04,920
We saw earlier that we could add
a map fragment or a layout file and

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:08,270
set properties on it to get some
pretty interesting and cool maps.

3
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:11,980
We even had a 3D fly over of New York
city that was pretty cool right?

4
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:14,710
Well that just scratches
the surface of the types of app

5
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:17,000
that you can build with map integration.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,050
The XML based maps always
start in the same location and

7
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:22,120
that can be limiting for a mobile app.

8
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,980
So in order to get
a little more power and

9
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:28,600
flexibility, we're going to switch gears
and start using the Google Map objects

10
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:32,009
to compliment the map
fragment using Java code.

11
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:36,120
Once we've gotten that, it then becomes
really easy to set properties and

12
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,490
respond to user events on the map.

13
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:41,910
Let's start with an example where
we set the different map types

14
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:46,220
such as the standard map,
the satellite view or the hybrid view.

15
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:49,250
In this app,
you can see a map of New York City.

16
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:51,740
And I have control
over this map by touch.

17
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:55,090
I can panoram the map, and as you can
see, I can pinch to zoom in and out.

18
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:59,130
When I press the buttons at the top
of the map, Map, Satellite and

19
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:01,430
Hybrid, I can change the map type.

20
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:02,770
So if I touch Satellite,

21
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:07,050
I now can see details of the buildings
taken from Satellite images.

22
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:10,120
Here you can see Madison Square Garden
and even when I zoom in I can

23
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,630
begin to see some of the seating
plans in Madison Square Garden.

24
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:16,680
And of course Hybrid gives
me a hybrid of the two.

25
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,170
I can see satellite but

26
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:22,600
I can also see data such as landmarks
like the Empire State Building and

27
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,830
street names such as Fifth Avenue,
as you can see here.

28
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,140
I've done all of this using a Google
map object in my Java code.

29
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:32,280
This is slightly different
from the fragment that

30
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,600
you used in the earlier sample.

31
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,240
And we're going to dive in to take
a look at how to do this next.
