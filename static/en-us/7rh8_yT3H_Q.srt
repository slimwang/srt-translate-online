00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,392
Now, the first way I thought of solving this problem, or just simplifying the

2
00:00:03,392 --> 00:00:06,512
left hand side rather, was to go through and multiply every term from the first

3
00:00:06,512 --> 00:00:11,619
set of parentheses by every term in this second set of the brackets. But that

4
00:00:11,619 --> 00:00:15,153
way, we end up this really, really long polynomial, and it does reduce, but

5
00:00:15,153 --> 00:00:19,526
it's not very pretty. So, I'm going to show you a different way of thinking

6
00:00:19,526 --> 00:00:23,674
about this multiplication. We can start off by distributing this negative sign

7
00:00:23,674 --> 00:00:27,779
to each of the terms inside this inner set of parentheses. We can do this for

8
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:31,914
both of the sets of brackets. Now, this is pretty interesting. You see that we

9
00:00:31,914 --> 00:00:35,677
have x minus 2 here, and x minus 2 here. Why if we see if we can just consider

10
00:00:35,677 --> 00:00:39,664
those as a unit, and see what happens. At this point, we can recognize that

11
00:00:39,664 --> 00:00:44,150
we're going to end up with a difference of two squares as our final polynomial.

12
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:48,610
Let's see that happen. Since we have an x minus 2 in both of these expressions,

13
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:53,322
and then opposite signs of negative 3i and positive 3i here, we end up with x

14
00:00:53,322 --> 00:00:59,264
minus 2 squared plus 9. Notice I've already multiplied the i's together and

15
00:00:59,264 --> 00:01:03,885
switched the sign. Multiplying out this square and adding the 9 gives us a

16
00:01:03,885 --> 00:01:09,762
final polynomial of x squared minus 4x plus 13 equals 0. And this is a pretty

17
00:01:09,762 --> 00:01:13,654
cool trick, definitely saved a lot of space and a lot of writing for me. And,

18
00:01:13,654 --> 00:01:16,643
you know, I always love ways to be a little bit more lazy with my math.
