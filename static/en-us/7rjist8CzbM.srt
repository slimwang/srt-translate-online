1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Yes, so that was one thing that was interesting that we learned on Reddit over the years.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
In the beginning it just had a small amount of content,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
but as we grew the content kind of turned into two flavors.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Not just hot versus saved but was kind of new versus old.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
If you go to your profile page, that content isn't accessed very often.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Before we did the precomputing thing, the hot pages were highly optimized.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
The queries were fast. Everything worked nicely. It was cached perfectly.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
But somebody will hit a user page that hadn't been accessed in a month.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
All of a sudden it's just stale, cold data, it's not in the cache and the whole system just like chugs to bring that out.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
That's when we started precomputing those and you guys are taking it to the next level. >>Right.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:54,000
One thing that we actually do there is there's a special-- comment is the really bad one.

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
There's just so many comments, so much data and those databases get overloaded,

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
especially when you pull up an old comment page from two years ago,

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
and nobody's seen it in like 3 months and it has to load

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
500 comments and that's a disk hit for every one of those.

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:16,000
We actually have a dedicated comment slave that is just for the likes of Google.

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
This a whole separate stack for Google, right? >>Yeah, and it's read-only.

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Yeah. I would draw a picture, but basically--I think we started adding this just as I was leaving.

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
There's a whole separate set of databases and app servers, maybe one app server-- >>Two or three.

20
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
A couple of app servers that's just for Google,

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
because Google will come through and index everything.

22
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Reddit gets a lot of traffic these days from Google.

23
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
You can take any two or more combination of the front page of Reddit.

24
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Do a Google search for it and it will be in the top 10.

25
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
And enough of those, Google is just murdering Reddit.

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
So we had to build a whole separate infrastructure just for Google,

27
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
because they hit the site in a completely different way from users

28
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
in a way that it's really hard to cache for.
