1
00:00:00,233 --> 00:00:03,590
As you sort of talk about a more
complete definition of this model,

2
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:07,050
there is another requirement which is
called the tranquility requirement

3
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:10,100
in this model that says
classification of a subject or

4
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:13,050
object does not change during a session.

5
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:15,930
You can't change the label
associated with this.

6
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:19,090
So this principle is needed,
one of two reasons.

7
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:21,190
Okay, so the two options we have here.

8
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:24,910
So try to give the reason why we
need to have this requirement,

9
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:28,740
or need to have tranquility
principle has to be satisfied.

10
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:32,670
So you have to choose the right option,
and sort of explain why.
