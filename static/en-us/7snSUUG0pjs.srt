1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Most of those are answerable without truth tables.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The first one is satisfiable. If A is false then not A is true,

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
but it could also be false, which is if A is true.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
So it's not valid, and it's not unsatisfiable. We can make it either true or false.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
The second one is always true.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
If you look carefully, A or not A, no matter what is set for A, one of those two things will be true.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
The same is true for the next one,

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
and it comes with this funny thing about the implies relationship.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
A and not A is always false,

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
and we know that if the condition of an implies is false

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
then we consider the entire statement as true no matter what is on the right side over here.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
That means because the left hand condition is always false,

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
because it is always valid.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
The next one is satisfiable.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
It is easy to see if we look for examples for it becoming true or false.

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
If I find one of each, of course, I show that it can't be valid, and it can't be unsatisfiable.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:10,000
If A and B and C are all true, then this statement will naturally be true.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
If we flip B to false, then this expression becomes false

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
whereas the others will remain true,

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
but the conjunction of those will become false.

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I have just given you an example for making it true or making it false.

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Hence it is satisfiable.

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The next one is tricky, and I'm going to use my truth table

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
to show that it is actually unsatisfiable.

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Let me write down the combinations for A and B.

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
There are four combinations in total.

27
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:47,000
A implies B is true as long as we don't have that A is true or B is false.

28
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
This is the false version. Everything else will be true.

29
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Not A or B is true as long as B is true,

30
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
and also true if not A is true, which means A is false.

31
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
We find that these two expressions are identical.

32
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,000
But because we negate the second expression and with this expression,

33
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
the negation over here is just the opposite--false, true, false, false.

34
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
There is no way to make any of these come true.

35
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Hence it is unsatisfiable.

36
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
The final one is a simple counterexample.

37
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,000
This is always true if all A, B, and C are true.

38
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
It is at least satisfiable, but it is not valid,

39
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
because if I flip B to false then the expression on the left becomes false,

40
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
but the right expression is not affected.

41
00:02:39,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Hence it is just satisfiable.
