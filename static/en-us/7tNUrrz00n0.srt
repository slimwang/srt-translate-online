1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:04,920
So now, I’m going to give you a very concrete example to suggest the importance

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:08,410
of pinhole size and its relationship to pe, eh, the image quality.

3
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:11,490
Let’s start off with our simple example, our tree again.

4
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:16,780
This time around again, we have an obstruction and a screen, a sensor.

5
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:20,506
What we will do, of course, is we will create this quote,

6
00:00:20,506 --> 00:00:24,626
unquote, the eye to the world, a pinhole in this obstruction.

7
00:00:24,626 --> 00:00:27,612
So then, we can actually capture what's been actually visible at

8
00:00:27,612 --> 00:00:29,600
this point here, to the screen there.

9
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:33,940
Of course, as we expect, all rays of light going from this point will go and

10
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:36,240
form on the other side here.

11
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,930
And all rays from here, and of course all rays in

12
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:43,730
between will actually use that to create a inward a tree on the other side.

13
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:47,924
Just for sake of explanation I'm basically showcasing a example image here,

14
00:00:47,924 --> 00:00:51,898
this is not exactly the same tree here just showing what's going on.

15
00:00:51,898 --> 00:00:55,529
That this would be a nice crisp image if this was a nice crisp hole

16
00:00:55,529 --> 00:00:58,762
because everything would be going through perfectly.

17
00:00:58,762 --> 00:01:02,310
And it would get a nice crisp image on the other side.

18
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:04,595
Now let's look at another example of the same situation,

19
00:01:04,595 --> 00:01:07,870
again a screen a tree and obstruction.

20
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:08,600
Here I'm actually,

21
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:12,560
going to create a little bit of a bigger one hole than this one.

22
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,140
And we going to just do same kinds of tracing of rays.

23
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:17,930
So for example, I take tree of light.

24
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:21,990
And now, the hole is bigger of course the're is one going form the top of

25
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:25,240
the hole and another one from the bottom of the hole, when it gets here.

26
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:28,560
And in this case also, one ray is going to the top and to the bottom.

27
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,080
Because again, the hole is bigger here.

28
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:34,360
I showed you just one that in assume, it assumed that only, you know,

29
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:38,560
the hole was small enough that not many rays would go through it.

30
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,450
You know, just by looking at the triangles here.

31
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:44,500
If this size is bigger, you can expect this to be much,

32
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:47,279
you know, getting bigger as you get farther away from this point.

33
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:50,669
And, of course, what would happen in this instance is,

34
00:01:50,669 --> 00:01:51,752
because of these two rays.

35
00:01:51,752 --> 00:01:54,075
The trees would kind of start cut into,

36
00:01:54,075 --> 00:01:59,640
you know, inter, interfering with each other as they form on the surface.

37
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:04,430
And as I put more of them there, you would see that, of course,

38
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:07,180
on the screen we have a blurry image.

39
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:08,470
Basically putting in more and

40
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:11,440
more these and the tree, of course, is looking blurry.

41
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,300
And again, basically think of it as nothing else as the, because of the size of

42
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:18,840
this the triangles are getting bigger and this is the blur point here.

43
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:22,360
Of course, the resulting example could be something like this where now,

44
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,280
of course, it's much more blurry.

45
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:27,330
So this basically starts implying is, that this size of

46
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:31,369
the pinhole is an important parameter in how well we can capture images.

47
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:34,110
Now, one thing we haven't start calling is,

48
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:38,830
we want to start actually referring to this opening as of the pinhole,

49
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:39,770
as the aperture.

50
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:43,160
Again, remember what we looked at when we looked at the insides of a camera.

51
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,590
The size of the aperture was basically the opening.

52
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:49,360
because that is the amount of light that was allowed into the camera before it

53
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,290
reached the sensor.

54
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:51,810
Well in essence, this is what it is.

55
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:52,530
Right?

56
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:53,480
It's the aperture.

57
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,150
And the size of this aperture is extremely important parameter for

58
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:59,470
us to know as we move towards capturing light into a camera.

59
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:03,960
Just as a note, these images are simulated just to kind of showcase this point.
