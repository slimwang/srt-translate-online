1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,220
And this one, we talked not about the
labels that we were just discussing but

2
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:05,550
we're talking real numbers.

3
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:09,030
So these are number,
integers, rational numbers,

4
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:11,130
we have real numbers,
it's all the numbers.

5
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:16,300
So take any two numbers and there is
this thing relation called less than it.

6
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:20,740
So, number 1.5 is less than 2.5,
for example.

7
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:24,000
So, if you look at the less
than relation and real numbers,

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,100
does it define a partial order or
does it define a total order?
