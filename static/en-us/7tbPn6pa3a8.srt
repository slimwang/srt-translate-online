00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,774
Right now, we have two separate statements about the values that x is allowed to

2
00:00:03,774 --> 00:00:07,610
equal. But looking at our number line, there's only one area of the number line

3
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:11,324
shaded in. [unknown] then, it would seem that we could write this as a sort of

4
00:00:11,324 --> 00:00:15,446
connected inequality, combining these two inequalities together. So, how would

5
00:00:15,446 --> 00:00:18,868
you guess that we could write this as, what I'm going to call, a chained

6
00:00:18,868 --> 00:00:23,878
inequality? Insert the inequality symbols that you think belong in this two

7
00:00:23,878 --> 00:00:24,388
boxes.
