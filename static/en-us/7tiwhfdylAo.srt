1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
And here's my code, this implements Bayes rule.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
You take p0 a prior times a probability of seeing a positive test result

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
and divided by the sum of the same plus the expression for not having cancer,

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
which is the inverse prior and the inverse of this specificity is shown over here.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
When I plug in my reference numbers, the ones from over here, I indeed get 0.33333.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
So, this is the correct code and we can plug in our return numbers.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
It's fun if we give it a zero probability prior to have cancer

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
and guess what, no matter what the test is, you still don't have cancer.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 99:59:59,999
That's the beauty of Bayes' rule, it takes the prior very seriously.
