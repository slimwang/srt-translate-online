00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:05,019
Now, copy and paste the sample means from the instructor notes to the link

2
00:00:05,019 --> 00:00:10,381
that's also in instructor notes. This is Wolfram Alpha, and it's a really cool

3
00:00:10,381 --> 00:00:15,029
site. Enter those values here and click this icon. This will analyze all the

4
00:00:15,029 --> 00:00:20,997
data that you put in here. In our case, that's the mean of all possible samples

5
00:00:20,997 --> 00:00:25,650
of size 2. Look at the histogram that visualizes the frequency of means. This

6
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:30,614
visualizes the distribution of the sample means, and this is called the sampling

7
00:00:30,614 --> 00:00:37,400
distribution. What's the shape of this sampling distribution? Uniform, bimodal,

8
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,114
normal, or skewed?
