00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:05,920
This entire course, I'm going to focus
on the problem of classification.

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:10,480
Classification is the task of taking
an input, like this letter, and

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,760
giving it a label that says,
this is a B.

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,230
The typical setting is that
you have a lot of examples,

5
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:20,570
called the training set,
that I've already been sorted in.

6
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:23,730
This is an A, this is a B, and so on.

7
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:25,980
Now, here's a completely new example.

8
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:29,140
And your goal is going to be to
figure out which of those classes

9
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:30,482
it belongs to.

10
00:00:30,482 --> 00:00:32,930
There is a lot more to machine
learning that just classification.

11
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:34,650
But classification, or

12
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:39,360
marginally prediction, is the central
building block of machine learning.

13
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,580
Once you know how to classify things,
it's very easy, for

14
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:46,650
example, to learn how to detect them,
or to rank them.
