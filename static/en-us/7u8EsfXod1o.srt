00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,410
Here's the F table and we'd need to use the degrees of freedom that you found

2
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:07,812
earlier. Since there are three groups, remember that there were two degrees of

3
00:00:07,812 --> 00:00:13,250
freedom, and there were three cows per group who consumed the food. There were

4
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:17,990
nine total values and the degrees of freedom within group variability was 6.

5
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:24,608
They intersect here at 5.1433. Our F statistic, 27, is much greater than our F

6
00:00:24,608 --> 00:00:29,303
critical value. It's out here somewhere in the critical region, probably way

7
00:00:29,303 --> 00:00:33,704
out there. Therefore, we would accept the alternative. At least one pair of

8
00:00:33,704 --> 00:00:39,138
significant differences exists between the amount of food that cows ate. We

9
00:00:39,138 --> 00:00:43,105
summarize our results in our ANOVA table. This is how the results are typically

10
00:00:43,105 --> 00:00:45,470
presented even when we use software.
