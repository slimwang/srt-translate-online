Let's summarize what we've been talking about for the past few quizzes. We

2
00:00:03,212 --> 00:00:09,800
started with a function, f of x equals x minus 5 times x plus 3. We figured

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:13,168
out, it's two factors are these two quantities inside parentheses. That told us

4
00:00:13,168 --> 00:00:16,696
that the x coordinates of the x intercepts are 5 and negative 3, and these two

5
00:00:16,696 --> 00:00:21,946
numbers are the same as the zero's, or the roots of the function. Let's see if

6
00:00:21,946 --> 00:00:26,779
we can fill out all this information for a new function. This time we have f of

7
00:00:26,779 --> 00:00:33,536
x equals x minus 2 times x plus 7 times x minus 1. Please tell me what the

8
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:36,992
factors of this function are, what the x coordinates of it's x intercepts are

9
00:00:36,992 --> 00:00:42,121
and what the 0s are. Notice I've already written an x equals here for you. So,

10
00:00:42,121 --> 00:00:45,598
in the zero box, I'd like you to just write, the values that x needs to equal

11
00:00:45,598 --> 00:00:50,626
in order for the function to equal zero. In each of these three boxes, please

12
00:00:50,626 --> 00:00:52,749
separate your answers by commas.
