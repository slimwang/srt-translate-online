1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,230
So let's look at the AMAT equation
when we have a cache hierarchy.

2
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:09,980
The AMAT is still equal
to L1 hit time plus

3
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:15,200
the L1 miss rate times the L1 miss
penalty, but it used to stop here and

4
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,405
the L1 miss penalty would simply
be the memory access time.

5
00:00:19,405 --> 00:00:25,010
But now we have that the L1
miss penalty is the L2 hit time

6
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:30,544
plus the L2 miss rate times
the L2 miss penalty and

7
00:00:30,544 --> 00:00:35,500
the L2 miss penalty is the L3
hit time plus the level 3

8
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:40,930
miss rate times the level 3 miss
penalty and so on until at some point,

9
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:45,980
we have a cache whose miss
penalty is equal to the main

10
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:50,820
memory latencies because there
is no more caches beneath it.

11
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:55,270
This cache whose misses go
directly to memory is called

12
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:58,250
the last level cache, or LLC.

13
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:06,890
So it used to be that the L1 cache was
the only cache, so L1 cache was the LLC.

14
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:09,748
Then level 2 cache's were introduced so

15
00:01:09,748 --> 00:01:14,650
level 2 miss penalty was the main
number latency because level

16
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:19,085
2 went directly to memory and
that was the last level cache and

17
00:01:19,085 --> 00:01:23,405
then level 3 cache's were introduced so
they became the LLC and so on.
