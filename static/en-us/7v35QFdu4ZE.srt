00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:04,316
Probably the easiest case would be when the two countries are exactly equal, so

2
00:00:04,316 --> 00:00:08,342
if this dot equals other country then I can immediately return zero, otherwise

3
00:00:08,342 --> 00:00:11,758
if this dot area is less than other country dot area I want to return a

4
00:00:11,758 --> 00:00:15,540
negative number, I will just go with minus one otherwise if this dot area is

5
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:19,444
less than, I mean greater than OtherCountry.area, I want to return a positive

6
00:00:19,444 --> 00:00:28,870
number. I think one'll do. Otherwise their areas must be exactly equal, in

7
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:32,461
which case, I'll use the string compareTo method on the name, and return the

8
00:00:32,461 --> 00:00:37,540
result of that. Once I fix my syntax errors, I want to check that this actually

9
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:42,570
works the way I'd expect. So I'm going to get out my code pad. And make some

10
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:47,200
new countries. El Salvador should come before Belize. So If I compare El

11
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:52,392
Salvador to Belize, I should get a negative number. So far, so good. Certainly

12
00:00:52,392 --> 00:00:56,281
the opposite direction should be positive. And Belize compared to Belize should

13
00:00:56,281 --> 00:01:00,399
give me a zero. And just to make sure that I'm breaking ties, let's compare

14
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:05,140
Belize to a made up country, with the exact same area. Alright, negative 11

15
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:09,990
sounds good to me. So long as compareTo doesn't return zero, with two countries

16
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:14,053
that are clearly different countries. Now, to make sure the work wasn't all for

17
00:01:14,053 --> 00:01:17,164
nothing, I want to show you that now we can sort all of the Central American

18
00:01:17,164 --> 00:01:22,384
countries. Using the Arrays.sort method now if I run this, now I've tempered

19
00:01:22,384 --> 00:01:26,290
with the two string method a little bit just to make this easier to see, I get

20
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:30,511
the countries in order by their areas, sorting is actually an interesting task,

21
00:01:30,511 --> 00:01:34,291
when many people have studied for years but we just managed to do it in one

22
00:01:34,291 --> 00:01:40,350
line of code array for interfaces.
