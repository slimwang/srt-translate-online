1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,362
Let's take a look at the solution.

2
00:00:02,362 --> 00:00:05,880
Like getFavoriteMovies,our first step
will be to specify the session ID

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:07,020
as one of the parameters.

4
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:12,140
Then because the method contains the ID
that we need to substitute with the user

5
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:15,600
ID, we can use this
substituteKeyInMethod.

6
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:18,630
If we follow the constant
that we used here,

7
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:21,410
you can see that there's the ID
that will end up being substituted.

8
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:24,340
The next step is to
make the git request.

9
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:27,140
Then we check for an error.

10
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:28,510
Otherwise, we have our results.

11
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:33,710
Now the results in this case is
an array of dictionaries, so

12
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:38,080
we can use this moviesFromResults
method that's part of the TMDBMovie

13
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:42,400
to create an array of TMDBMovies
from the array of dictionaries.

14
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:45,220
And then we return them in
the completion handler.

15
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,490
Okay, let's see if this works.

16
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:54,050
I'll run the app,
we'll click through to authenticate, and

17
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:55,040
then, let's go to the watch list.

18
00:00:57,130 --> 00:00:59,780
And here, in the watch list,
I see some movies that are on my watch

19
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:04,769
list and I can check the movie database

20
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:07,800
website to verify that these movies
are indeed on my watch list.
