This lesson's about texture animation. When I hear the phrase texture

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:07,390
animation, it brings to mind 2 different ideas. The first is shown here, in a

3
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:11,250
tutorial by Lee Stemkoski. The idea is the same as a flip book, where you draw

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:14,798
a different image on each page, and then flip through them. The other form of

5
00:00:14,798 --> 00:00:17,486
texture animation is where you move the texture by transforming the texture

6
00:00:17,486 --> 00:00:21,370
coordinates, such as shown here. There's plenty of animation that can be done

7
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:24,984
without a motion capture studio or even a modeler. Remember that almost

8
00:00:24,984 --> 00:00:27,416
anything you can set on a model, light or camera is something you can change in

9
00:00:27,416 --> 00:00:31,866
the render loop. You can modify material, color and shininess, transparency and

10
00:00:31,866 --> 00:00:34,180
visibility and just about everything else.
