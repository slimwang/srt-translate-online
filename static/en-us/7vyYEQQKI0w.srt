00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Splitting up words by spaces is such a common task in computer science

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
that Python has a built-in function, string.split(), that does just that.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
For example, suppose we take one of Charlotte Bronte's books as a string

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and we call split on it.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
We'll get out a list where each element of the list corresponds

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
to one of the words in this string separated by spaces.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
This space here leads us directly to this comma, separating these list elements.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Let's take a moment now to get a little more practice with this new approach

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
to splitting by whitespace.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Whitespace is just a more formal name for some series of spaces or tabs.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Here I've written three Python expressions, each one of which is a constant string.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
We're calling split on it.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I'd like you to fill in each box with the number of elements in the list returned

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
by the split expression.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,872
You can use the interpreter if you like, but try to reason it out no your own.
