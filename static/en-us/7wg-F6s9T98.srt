1
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:02,340
Hopefully you typed it in all right.

2
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:07,090
A common mistake is to forget the
semicolon at the end of each statement.

3
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:11,820
Or you may have misspelled the quantity
variable in subsequent lines of code.

4
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:15,800
The variable name must match
the same spelling and capitalization

5
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:19,790
as the very first time that
the variable was originally declared.

6
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:22,870
Also int has to be spelled
specifically in this way.

7
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:26,560
Otherwise java won't recognize that this
is supposed to be an integer variable.

8
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:30,490
For best practice, remember that
we always add a space before and

9
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:32,210
after any operators.

10
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:34,550
In this case,
we only have a sign operator, so

11
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:38,330
we add a space here and
here, in all these cases.

12
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:40,910
Thanks for
making some observations about the code.

13
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:43,060
There's no right or wrong answer here.

14
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:46,280
One of the observations you may have
made is that int is only used on

15
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:50,730
the very first line of code, right here,
but not on subsequent lines of code.

16
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:52,060
Let's talk more about that next.
