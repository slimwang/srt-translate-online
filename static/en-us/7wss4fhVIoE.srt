00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:01,100
Howdy, Charles.

2
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:02,500
>> Howdy, Howdy.

3
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:04,640
>> Sure, why not. How's it going?

4
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:07,350
>> How do? It's, doing quite well. Thank you for asking.

5
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:07,840
>> Sure.

6
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:09,110
>> How's it going on your end of the world?

7
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:14,540
>> I'm feeling okay, let's say. Though I'm a little concerned because

8
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:18,200
last time we, we were talking and you said you had a question.

9
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:22,030
And I promised that I would get into it. And it's, it's complicated,

10
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:23,850
but it's really interesting. So let's,

11
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:25,880
let's remind ourselves what the question was.

12
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:29,510
So, we're talking about bounding the number of samples that

13
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:33,300
we need to learn. A classifier or a concept in

14
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:36,440
some given hypothesis base, h. and we ended up driving

15
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:39,170
a formula that looks like this. So, the formula tells us

16
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:41,140
that we're okay, as long as the number of samples

17
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:44,252
is at least as large as 1 over the air parameter,

18
00:00:44,252 --> 00:00:47,040
epsilon ; times the quantity log of the number of

19
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:50,660
hypotheses. Plus the log of 1 over the failure parameter. And,

20
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:54,690
and so if the We want to make sure that we succeed with very

21
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:57,080
low failure probabilities. Delta's very small and

22
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:59,080
that means we need more samples and if

23
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:02,120
we want to make sure that this error is really small, that also makes

24
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,670
this quantity big, which means we need

25
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:05,410
more samples. Right, so do you remember this?

26
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:06,980
>> I do remember this.

27
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:08,790
>> Alright and what was your concern?

28
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:12,580
>> Well my concern was that the number of depended

29
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:15,730
on the size of the hypothesis space. And I was

30
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:17,460
wondering what happen if you have a

31
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:19,900
really, really large hypothesis space. Like for

32
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:22,630
example, one of infinite size or infinite

33
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:24,200
cardinality I suppose is the right term.

34
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:26,540
>> Alright well lets do a quiz.
