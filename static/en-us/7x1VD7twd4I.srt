1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,030
Okay, Michael so enough of all
this hand-waving you like to do.

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:05,260
Let's actually write out some equations.

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:07,614
>> [LAUGH] Okay.

4
00:00:07,614 --> 00:00:09,489
>> There's no need to fear
the equations Michael.

5
00:00:09,489 --> 00:00:13,459
So I'm going to leave our little picture
up so you can remember what it was

6
00:00:13,459 --> 00:00:17,171
we're talking about, and
I'm going to leave out the definition or

7
00:00:17,171 --> 00:00:20,554
the tuple part of what an option is so
that you remember that and

8
00:00:20,554 --> 00:00:24,270
then I'm just going to write
an equation up here and here it is.

9
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:30,412
So V sub t + 1 of s = max over O
of the quantity R of (s,o) plus

10
00:00:30,412 --> 00:00:36,460
sum over s prime of s, o,
s prime times V sub t of s prime.

11
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:38,520
What does that equation
look like to you?

12
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,810
>> It has a lot in common
with the Bellman equation.

13
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:42,420
>> Right and
in fact that's exactly what it is.

14
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:45,390
It is a rewriting of
the Bellman Operator.

15
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:49,180
So what do you think the various
constituent parts are?

16
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:53,960
>> Maybe an easier thing to
do would be to explain what

17
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,280
looks like it might be different.

18
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,450
>> Okay.
>> So for one thing, a has become o,

19
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:02,020
because I guess actions have become
possibly temporally extended actions.

20
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:02,900
>> Or options.

21
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:04,140
>> Or options, good.

22
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:06,630
Do we need to include
a in there as well?

23
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:08,820
Why, how can we ignore all the a's?

24
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:10,860
>> Well because the a's
are inside the o's.

25
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:12,740
>> The a's are inside the o's.

26
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:14,860
>> Yes.
>> There's actually an o inside an a.

27
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:17,760
>> Well I think that depends upon
whether it's a lowercase or capital a.

28
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,380
>> That's fair.

29
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:21,030
>> Thank you.
>> But i still don't quite understand.

30
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:24,730
So, you're saying options
are made out of actions.

31
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:27,100
>> Yes because there
may have little pulses.

32
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:30,590
>> But can you have an option
that is just an action?

33
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:31,600
>> Of course, right.

34
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,498
So options are a journalization
of actions.

35
00:01:34,498 --> 00:01:37,420
If I wanted to take an action and
I wanted to turn it into an option,

36
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:40,890
then the initiation set would just be
everywhere where that action is valid.

37
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:45,879
The policy inside that option would just
say for whatever state I'm in, take that

38
00:01:45,879 --> 00:01:50,508
action with probability one and all
other actions with probability zero and

39
00:01:50,508 --> 00:01:54,558
then the termination probability
would be one for all of the states

40
00:01:54,558 --> 00:01:59,200
that I can reach from that particular
state to particular action.

41
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,290
Actually would just be one everywhere.

42
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:01,830
>> One everywhere.

43
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:02,930
I see.

44
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:04,170
I say, that's okay.

45
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:05,690
That's actually really cute.

46
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:09,539
That kind of helps me understand
why these three quantities

47
00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:10,360
are the way that they are.

48
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:13,890
So it allows it to specifically say,
yeah,

49
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:18,520
well we can always include an action
which is a primitive action, that just,

50
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,360
you can use it whereever
you can use the action.

51
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,810
It just does the action and
then it stops right away.

52
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:23,920
>> Right exactly.

53
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:24,870
>> Okay, all right, good.

54
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:29,400
So then the o, okay,
I get the o's generalizing the a.

55
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:33,590
Then another difference is there's
no discount factor that I can see.

56
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:38,160
And then the last difference is that
we seem to have spelled T as an F.

57
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:43,000
>> Right well, F and T are the same for
an appropriate kind of thinking about.

58
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,880
>> Only in logic.

59
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,200
>> Only in logic?

60
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,580
>> Yeah T and F are the same.

61
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:50,000
>> Actually they're
the opposite in logic.

62
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,050
>> Whoops.

63
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:52,640
>> Yeah, T is true and F is false.

64
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,530
I hadn't thought about that.

65
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:56,800
That's kind of an interesting thing
that we could talk about for an hour and

66
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,890
a half or
I could just explain to you what F is.

67
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:01,960
So you did the right thing, you noticed
that we still have a reward function as

68
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,820
we did before in the Bellman operator.

69
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:05,861
We still have value functions,
is what we're trying to do,

70
00:03:05,861 --> 00:03:07,510
trying to update value over states.

71
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:11,068
We have little s's and the s primes,
the o's are basically a,

72
00:03:11,068 --> 00:03:13,218
so that doesn't seem different, but

73
00:03:13,218 --> 00:03:17,734
the two big differences are a lack of a
discount factor which isn't quite true.

74
00:03:17,734 --> 00:03:20,371
We actually have a discount factor but
it's hidden and

75
00:03:20,371 --> 00:03:22,330
instead of a transition model we have F.

76
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:25,130
So F is,
this really is a Bellman operator.

77
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:29,080
F is sort of, I think, clearly playing
the role of a transition function.

78
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:33,470
It's somehow telling you something
about states, options and next states.

79
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:35,300
And what I really need to do
to make this clear, I think,

80
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:38,260
is to just really write out what F is.

81
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,430
>> That would be super helpful.

82
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:40,350
>> That would be really nice, but

83
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:45,210
it turns out that I have to write out
something else as well and that is R.

84
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:49,114
So R look sort of superficially like
the reward function that we had before,

85
00:03:49,114 --> 00:03:52,713
although, in this case the reward is
from you know taking a particular

86
00:03:52,713 --> 00:03:54,178
option a particular state.

87
00:03:54,178 --> 00:03:58,813
But actually this reward function is
hiding a lot of complexity as well and

88
00:03:58,813 --> 00:04:02,790
to see what the complexity is I
think it helps to draw a picture.
