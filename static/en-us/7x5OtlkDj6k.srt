1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:04,059
Some APIs will also require
you to set up credentials and

2
00:00:04,059 --> 00:00:07,570
access using
the Google Developers Console.

3
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:08,290
For example,

4
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:12,560
in the maps course, you'll need to
enable your map to use the maps API.

5
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:15,710
And if you look here on the left,
there's APIs & auth.

6
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:20,220
When I select that,
and I select APIs, and

7
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:24,750
then I select enabled APIs,
you can see the APIs that I've enabled.

8
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:26,500
And one of the map apps that I build,

9
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:29,117
I'm using here
the Google Maps Android API version 2.

10
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,090
You'll also need credentials for
some of your apps.

11
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:37,300
So for sign in maps, and some of the
others, the system needs to know which

12
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:42,100
apps are using which resources, and as
a result credentials need to be enabled.

13
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:44,590
And here you can see I've
selected credentials.

14
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:47,400
And here you can see I've
generated an API key for

15
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:50,240
the apps that I've built
that are using Maps.

16
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:53,320
As you need them, you'll be stepped
through everything that you need to

17
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:57,040
do on the Google Developer's Console
in the lessons, but

18
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,330
it's good to have a look at it.

19
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:02,110
Go to console.developers.google.com and
have a play around.
