00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:02,799
So let's have a quiz and a programming exercise on this.

2
00:00:02,799 --> 00:00:04,852
Here, we've given you the code that you just saw.

3
00:00:04,852 --> 00:00:10,298
Now, what I want you do to is modify the code to time several different scenarios, okay?

4
00:00:10,298 --> 00:00:15,139
So try running a million threads, each incrementing one of a million elements,

5
00:00:15,139 --> 00:00:18,434
so every thread is uniquely incrementing a single element,

6
00:00:18,434 --> 00:00:21,821
a million threads atomically incrementing a million elements,

7
00:00:21,821 --> 00:00:25,602
a million threads incrementing a hundred elements, or a million threads

8
00:00:25,602 --> 00:00:28,732
atomically incrementing a hundred elements, or finally, 10 million threads

9
00:00:28,732 --> 00:00:30,940
atomically incrementing a hundred elements.

10
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:33,738
And for each of these choices, I'm going to want you to tell me 2 things.

11
00:00:33,738 --> 00:00:38,832
First of all, does it give the correct answer? Put a check mark by those that give the correct answer.

12
00:00:38,832 --> 00:00:42,240
And second of all, rank them from fastest to slowest,

13
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:45,258
so the fastest will be 1, the slowest will be 5.
