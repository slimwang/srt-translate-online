1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,620
once again we're in the fortunate

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:03,359
position to be able to bring a world

3
00:00:03,359 --> 00:00:05,370
expert into the classroom Vincent van

4
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:07,230
hook is the principal scientist of

5
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:09,210
Google's deep learning team and he'll

6
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:10,679
teach you the fundamentals of deep

7
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:13,529
neural networks Vincent will cover the

8
00:00:13,529 --> 00:00:15,539
jump from machine learning to deep

9
00:00:15,539 --> 00:00:18,089
learning the architecture of multi-layer

10
00:00:18,089 --> 00:00:20,489
deep neural networks and the concepts

11
00:00:20,489 --> 00:00:22,109
underpinning convolutional neural

12
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:25,079
networks a convolutional neural network

13
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:26,820
is a specialized type of deep neural

14
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:28,260
network that turns out to be

15
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,149
particularly important for self-driving

16
00:00:30,149 --> 00:00:33,270
cars at the end of this section you'll

17
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:35,488
use the tensorflow deep learning library

18
00:00:35,488 --> 00:00:37,350
to build your own convolutional neural

19
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:39,329
network within the course you'll see

20
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:41,128
optional assignments which are designed

21
00:00:41,128 --> 00:00:43,590
to familiarize you with tensorflow these

22
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:44,969
assignments are a great way to get more

23
00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:46,409
practice and stand out to employers

24
00:00:46,409 --> 00:00:49,619
first things first let's learn from

25
00:00:49,619 --> 00:00:51,420
Vincent about how to take what you know

26
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:53,549
about machine learning and use it as an

27
00:00:53,549 --> 00:00:55,890
entry point to deep learning will see

28
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:01,489
you when you finish
