>> Since we know what points of intersection, the y value for the two lines that

2
00:00:04,422 --> 00:00:08,762
are crossing through there will be the same, we can set 0 equal to negative x

3
00:00:08,762 --> 00:00:13,370
squared over 8 plus 4x minus 14. And that's the equation we need to solve. The

4
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:17,843
solutions to this equation, values of x, will give us then the x values of the

5
00:00:17,843 --> 00:00:20,295
points where these two lines intersect.
