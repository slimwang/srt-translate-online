1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:01,910
Now at first glance, 
reducing the payload

2
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:03,270
of each transfer,

3
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:05,286
and only transmitting data
when it's required

4
00:00:05,286 --> 00:00:07,152
seems like a sound approach.

5
00:00:07,152 --> 00:00:09,330
You're reducing the amount
of data being transferred,

6
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:10,813
so that's less data on the network.

7
00:00:10,813 --> 00:00:12,696
That's less superfluous
work being done

8
00:00:12,696 --> 00:00:15,844
storing processing data
on the device.

9
00:00:15,844 --> 00:00:18,092
It's basically a case
of putting off any work

10
00:00:18,092 --> 00:00:19,900
until you actually know
you need to do it.

11
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:22,140
But it turns out that this
approach has it's drawbacks,

12
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:25,980
compared to the big cookie model
of doing all that work up front.

13
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:27,880
So, overall, this is
a better solution.

14
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:30,470
But let's take a closer look
at the big cookie model.

15
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:32,369
And to do that, we really 
need to understand

16
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:35,000
the underlying
cell radio state machine.
