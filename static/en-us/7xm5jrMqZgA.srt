Humans consume many drugs for the psychoactive effects that they have on us.

2
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:07,942
Here we're going to discuss drugs that are potentially abused, as opposed to

3
00:00:07,942 --> 00:00:12,240
drugs that are used as medicines, such as something for high blood pressure.

4
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:16,486
Some have argued that humans have a basic need to cope with their daily lives,

5
00:00:16,486 --> 00:00:21,728
and that some people do so by using drugs. There are four main reasons why

6
00:00:21,728 --> 00:00:27,046
people use drugs. The first is for recreational purposes. Here an individual

7
00:00:27,046 --> 00:00:32,162
may use a drug to experiment or to have fun. Another reason is for social

8
00:00:32,162 --> 00:00:36,196
purposes. Here an individual may take a drug because it makes them feel like

9
00:00:36,196 --> 00:00:39,332
they can interact better and socialize, or they may take it for peer pressure

10
00:00:39,332 --> 00:00:41,210
purposes.
