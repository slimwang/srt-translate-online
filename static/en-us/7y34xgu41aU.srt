1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:05,203
Between group variability should be the numerator, because as it increases.

2
00:00:05,203 --> 00:00:09,235
This will increase the whole test statistic, and this leans more in favor of

3
00:00:09,235 --> 00:00:13,395
the alternative hypothesis, that at least one pair of means is significantly

4
00:00:13,395 --> 00:00:19,605
diffferent. Within group variability should be the denominator, because as this

5
00:00:19,605 --> 00:00:25,100
increases the f ratio decreases, which you can see algebraically. If the

6
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:29,850
denominator increases then the whole quotient will decrease. And this leans

7
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:33,946
more in the favor of the null hypothesis that the means are not significantly

8
00:00:33,946 --> 00:00:39,360
different. Just like the t statistic the numerator indicates much group means

9
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:45,000
differ. This is explained variation. Because it most likely results from

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,978
differences due to a treatment. Or just differences in the populations. With

11
00:00:50,978 --> 00:00:54,626
the clothing example from the beginning of the lesson, the difference in the

12
00:00:54,626 --> 00:00:58,160
numerator can be explained by the fact that the clothes are from different

13
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:04,562
brands. But the denominator is a measure of error. Within-group variability

14
00:01:04,562 --> 00:01:09,394
measures individual differences of subjects within each group. This is

15
00:01:09,394 --> 00:01:13,012
considered error variation because we don't know why subjects in the same group

16
00:01:13,012 --> 00:01:17,580
are different, whether they're people or shirts. They just are.
