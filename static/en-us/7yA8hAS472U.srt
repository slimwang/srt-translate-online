00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,950
Here's a simple site, Skinny Ties.

2
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:05,040
I've opened up Dev Tools
in another window, so

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,790
when I resize this, you'll see
the resolution show up right here.

4
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:11,290
And like any responsible,
responsive designer,

5
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:14,100
I'm starting with a small mobile design.

6
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:15,550
This one looks pretty clean.

7
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:21,560
I'll start expanding and at 480 pixels,
I hit the first break point.

8
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:25,700
There are now two columns, there are bow
ties and pocket squares next to each

9
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:31,510
other, okay and at larger than 690
pixels, there are three columns, nice.

10
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:36,420
Once the view port is larger than 915
pixels, all of the fonts get bigger,

11
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:38,930
which is a pretty nice touch.

12
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:43,020
I also noticed a few other small
changes as the page was getting larger.

13
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:45,720
After you watch this video,
maybe you can check out Skinny Ties, and

14
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,130
try to find them.

15
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:49,880
I also took a look at
CNN.com's new layout.

16
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:53,130
This one is a bit more complicated.

17
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:55,400
Once again, I am starting small.

18
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:59,350
Notice the hamburger icon in
the top right-hand corner.

19
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:01,370
Clicking on it makes
the nav bar show up.

20
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:02,660
That's pretty nice.

21
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:06,970
Also notice that there are social media
icons underneath this main story.

22
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:11,290
I've expanded the page larger
than 725 pixels across, and

23
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:15,000
now these social media icons are gone,
unless you hover over.

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,090
This would be use something that
would be called a minor breakpoint.

25
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:21,000
Which isn't a huge page layout change,
but

26
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,220
there's still something
slightly different.

27
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:26,510
I've expanded the page
past 800 pixels wide, and

28
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:29,690
I see that the hamburger icon is gone.

29
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:31,070
There's more room at
the top of the page,

30
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:36,160
so as a result, the navigation menu
options are just showing up here.

31
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:40,480
Larger than 935 pixels,
the layout really changes.

32
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:43,630
With the extra screen real estate,
a few sentences about the main

33
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:47,830
story show up over here, and all of
this description is now on the right.

34
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:51,240
Notice the social media icons,
are once again showing by default.

35
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:55,210
Larger than the classic 960 pixel width.

36
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:59,680
The new screen real estate is being
taken up by other top stories for today.

37
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,000
And I found one more small break point.

38
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,710
Larger than 1024 pixels, an ad shows up.

39
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:07,860
All in all, not a bad design.

40
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:10,160
So now, it's time for
you to think about break points.
