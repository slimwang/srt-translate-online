Okay, so a quick quiz. What does a database refer to?

00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Is it a program that stores and retrieves data?

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Is it the machine running that program?

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Or is it a group of machines working together to store and retrieve data?

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Check all that apply.
