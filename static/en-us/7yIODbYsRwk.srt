00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,990
Let's go through these one by one. Under a light

2
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:06,830
load, CSMA/CD will be efficient, because when a frame is

3
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:09,370
ready, it will be sent. And then you shouldn't expect

4
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:13,920
many collisions. The same holds for switched ethernet. Token ring on

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,309
the other hand, is not efficient, as a node might

6
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:18,630
have for the token to pass all the way around the

7
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:22,620
ring before he can send his frame. CSMA/CD suffers under

8
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:25,760
heavy load. As we are likely to see repeated collisions and

9
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,980
long back offs, much of which will be wasted. Token

10
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:31,070
Ring, on the other hand, will continue to operate as

11
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:33,840
usual because of strict rules on whose turn it is

12
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,300
to access the medium. Switched Ethernet is resilient because the collisions

13
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:40,720
are either avoided altogether at the port routing or the

14
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:43,590
switch can queue up messages and send them when the machine

15
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:47,030
is ready. As to being fair, CSMA/CD is susceptible to

16
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:50,660
hogging. From one node continues to succeed and sending its frames,

17
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:53,700
while the others backoff longer and longer, because of the exponential

18
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:57,650
backoff. Token is designed for fairness, that is basically everyone gets

19
00:00:57,650 --> 00:01:01,790
asked before someone can send another frame. Switched Ethernet is fair,

20
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:04,200
because pretty much everyone gets what they want all the time
