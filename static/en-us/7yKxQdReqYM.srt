1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,610
To recap, you made a new app called Festival

2
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:05,930
app. And when you created that app, the platform automatically

3
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:09,360
created an object to track Festivals. You added fields

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,550
to capture the start and end dates, and then you

5
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:14,450
created a record for a specific festival, which Samantha

6
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:19,870
and Andy called Cloudstock. Objects, fields, records. These terms might

7
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:23,290
still be a little unfamiliar to you. If that's confusing,

8
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:25,360
let's step back for a moment and relate this model

9
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:28,990
to something you're probably already comfortable with, spreadsheets.

10
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:30,630
If you were to track this same information with

11
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:33,990
a simple spreadsheet, it might look something like this.

12
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:37,272
You'd create a new spreadsheet called Festivals. And you'd

13
00:00:37,272 --> 00:00:40,470
add a column for Festival Name, Start Date, and

14
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:43,880
Date. Then you'd add Cloudstock as a row under

15
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:47,040
those headers and complete the dates. You can add

16
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:50,400
many different festivals as new rows on that spreadsheet.

17
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:54,710
Now this is starting to make sense. Based on this analogy, how do these

18
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:58,470
terms objects, fields, and records correspond to

19
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:01,340
tables, columns, and rows on a spreadsheet?
