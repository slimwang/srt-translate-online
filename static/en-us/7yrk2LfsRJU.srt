1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:00,893
You know,

2
00:00:00,893 --> 00:00:04,589
there are other ways to predict
what your users will want to type.

3
00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:08,689
>> Yeah, for instance, if you already
have your users relevant data,

4
00:00:08,689 --> 00:00:11,240
why not just prefill the form for them?

5
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:12,609
It's easy enough.

6
00:00:12,609 --> 00:00:16,580
>> Even if your users aren't logged in,
you can still help them out.

7
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:19,209
For example, you could guess their
location using location services.

8
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:23,360
Check the instructor notes for
more details.

9
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:27,130
In the end, this is all in the pursuit
of the most important principles to take

10
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:28,630
out from this lesson.

11
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:30,330
Speed equals conversions.

12
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:34,580
>> This lesson got you thinking
about fast, efficient inputs, but

13
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:36,420
you are just getting started.

14
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:39,456
In the next lesson, you'll dive
into other time-saving tricks,

15
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:42,239
like creating inputs that
support autofill and validation.

16
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:43,830
>> Awesome, see you there.
