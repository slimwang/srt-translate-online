00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,530
Looking at the figure, I can see I'm going to need to go to the right somehow

2
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:07,090
to get to the R vector. The V vector looks like a good place to start negated.

3
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:10,798
I put a negative 1 for this V vector. That got me going to the right. Now I

4
00:00:10,798 --> 00:00:14,236
need to go upwards. I could add the vector N twice, but this would take me too

5
00:00:14,236 --> 00:00:18,730
high. After adding N just once, I can see that I'm above the mirror surface. So

6
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:22,814
another N would take me beyond my goal of R. The vector dN looks like a winner

7
00:00:22,814 --> 00:00:27,283
as this is essentially just the Y component of the V vector. Adding it to the

8
00:00:27,283 --> 00:00:31,268
negated V vector is the same as simply moving to the right. Adding dN twice

9
00:00:31,268 --> 00:00:35,887
gets us to the R vector, so two dN vectors are needed. The final formula then

10
00:00:35,887 --> 00:00:39,902
is R equals 2 times dN minus V or to expand out R equals 2 times the dot

11
00:00:39,902 --> 00:00:44,183
product of V and N, times N minus V.
