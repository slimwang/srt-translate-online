1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,480
You remember our problem solving work.

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,049
We have a state space like this and

3
00:00:05,049 --> 00:00:09,849
we're given a start space and
a goal to reach and

4
00:00:09,849 --> 00:00:14,989
then we'd search for a path to find
that goal and maybe we find this path.

5
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:19,560
Now, the way a problem solving agent
would work is first it does all the work

6
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:23,789
to figure out the path to
the goal just doing by thinking.

7
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:27,739
And then start to execute
that path to drive or

8
00:00:27,739 --> 00:00:31,899
walk or however you want to get there
from the start state to the end state.

9
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:34,439
But think about what would happen
if you did that in real life?

10
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:38,289
If you did all planning ahead of time,
you have to complete goal and

11
00:00:38,289 --> 00:00:40,269
then, without interacting
with the world,

12
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:44,400
without sensing it at all you
started to execute that path.

13
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,899
Well, this has in fact been studied.

14
00:00:46,899 --> 00:00:52,699
People have gone out and blind folded,
walkers put them in the field and

15
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:57,040
told them to walk in a straight line and
the results are not pretty.

16
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:58,659
Here are the GPS tracks to prove it.

17
00:00:58,659 --> 00:01:03,719
So we take a hiker, we put him at
a start location, say here, and

18
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:07,569
we blindfold him so that he can't
see anything in the horizon, but

19
00:01:07,569 --> 00:01:10,849
just has enough to see his or
her feet so that they

20
00:01:10,849 --> 00:01:15,250
won't stumble over something, and tell
them, execute the plan of going forward.

21
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:18,689
Put one step in front of each other and
walk forward in a straight line.

22
00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:20,480
And these are the typical paths we see.

23
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:24,840
Start out going straight for awhile,
but then go in loopty-loops and

24
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,070
end up not on a straight path at all.

25
00:01:27,069 --> 00:01:31,579
These ones over here, starting in this
location, are even more convoluted,

26
00:01:31,579 --> 00:01:35,060
going straight for a little bit and
then going very tight loops.

27
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:37,879
So people are incapable of
walking a straight line

28
00:01:37,879 --> 00:01:40,289
without any feedback
from the environment.

29
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:43,240
Now here on this yellow path,
this one did much better.

30
00:01:43,239 --> 00:01:43,719
Why was that?

31
00:01:43,719 --> 00:01:47,909
Well it's because these paths
were on overcast days and so

32
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:51,769
there was no input to make sense of.

33
00:01:51,769 --> 00:01:54,560
Whereas this path was
on a very sunny day.

34
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:59,420
So even though the hiker couldn't see
farther than a few feet in front of him.

35
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:01,189
He could see shadows and

36
00:02:01,189 --> 00:02:04,280
say, as long as I keep the shadows
pointing in the right direction.

37
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,570
Then it can go in
a relatively straight line.

38
00:02:06,569 --> 00:02:09,758
So more or less, we need some
feedback from the environment.

39
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:12,599
We can't just plan ahead and
come up with a whole plan.

40
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:16,379
We've got to intervene planning and
executing.
