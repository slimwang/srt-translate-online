00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:02,100
Welcome back.

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:04,830
Now you've learned the fundamental
process of prototyping.

3
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:07,980
We're going to take this lesson to
talk about where to go from here.

4
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:10,400
We'll talk about how to continue
to iterate on your prototype

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,560
using the same tools, or new ones.

6
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:14,815
We'll also talk about how
to bring in designers and

7
00:00:14,815 --> 00:00:19,205
engineers either as a sole
entrepreneur or as part of a company.

8
00:00:19,205 --> 00:00:22,645
And finally we'll talk about how to
present your prototype and talk about it

9
00:00:22,645 --> 00:00:25,205
to potential shareholders either
within your company or outside it.
