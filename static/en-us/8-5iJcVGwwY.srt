1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:05,195
So 62,535 is the biggest
integer that can be represented

2
00:00:05,195 --> 00:00:07,508
with two octets or 16 bits.

3
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:11,301
If you have a one in each one
of the 16 positions here,

4
00:00:11,301 --> 00:00:13,865
it's going to sum up to 65,535.

5
00:00:13,865 --> 00:00:18,701
So that strongly suggests that port
numbers are represented as 16-bit

6
00:00:18,701 --> 00:00:19,340
values.

7
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:20,170
Which indeed, they are.
