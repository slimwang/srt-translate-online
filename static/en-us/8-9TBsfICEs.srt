You might be wondering what perpendicular means, well it means that the lines

2
00:00:03,685 --> 00:00:08,758
cross at a right angle. We have seen this before with complimentary angles.

3
00:00:08,758 --> 00:00:13,062
They formed a 90 degree angle together. With complimentary angles we had two

4
00:00:13,062 --> 00:00:17,485
angles that added up to 90 degrees. And in this case we have two lines that

5
00:00:17,485 --> 00:00:22,360
create four 90 degree angles. That's what it means to have perpendicular lines.
