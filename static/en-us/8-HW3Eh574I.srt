1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:01,569
The goal of this course is for

2
00:00:01,569 --> 00:00:05,129
you to start building your first
iOS app as soon as possible.

3
00:00:05,129 --> 00:00:08,629
To that end, we will teach you the
minimum amount of Swift Syntax you need

4
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:09,530
to build Silly Song!.

5
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:11,169
Silly Song!

6
00:00:11,169 --> 00:00:14,509
is a single screen app that prompts
the user to enter their name and

7
00:00:14,509 --> 00:00:16,980
creates a Silly Song based on the input.

8
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:20,719
In order to build Silly Song!, you will
need to be able to manipulate strings,

9
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:22,539
which we will learn in lesson one, and

10
00:00:22,539 --> 00:00:25,849
define and call functions,
which we'll learn in lesson two.

11
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:28,780
In lesson three, you'll build
the logic for silly song, and

12
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:31,510
in lesson four,
you'll learn how to use X code,

13
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:34,560
the integrated development
environment for iOS.

14
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:38,175
Then you'll finish up the app and
submit it for your first project review.

15
00:00:38,174 --> 00:00:41,214
Throughout the course we'll be
working through examples together and

16
00:00:41,215 --> 00:00:44,385
the first lesson will begin with
a set of exercises on strings

17
00:00:44,384 --> 00:00:47,394
to get you writing Swift code ASAP.

18
00:00:47,395 --> 00:00:49,005
That's it for the road map,

19
00:00:49,005 --> 00:00:52,495
let's check out the first exercise to
see what Swift strings are all about.
