1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This number would be 0.0005 per day and person. Let's do the computation.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Let's look at the given data. What do we know about each infected person?

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
As every other person, each infected person that meets 25 persons a day.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
All this susceptible persons can be infected, so the question is how many

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
susceptible persons are among these 25?

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
We can compute that by ratio.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
If there are 1,000 people in total, then the ratio of the number

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
of susceptible persons divided by the total of 1,000 persons

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
times these 25 persons that would be susceptible.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Imagine, everybody was susceptible then we would compute 1,000 persons times 25.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:53,000
All 25 would be susceptible. If every second person was susceptible, 500 divided by 1,000

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
results in one half times 25, every second person would be susceptible.

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:05,000
So this is the number of contacts between a single infected person and susceptible persons per day

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
and each of these contacts will lead to infection with a probability of 2%.

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
So now, we can compute how many persons are infected by the single infected person per day

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
versus the number of contact of susceptible persons per day and multiply with probability.

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
This will be the number of new infections per day.

18
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:32,000
We can cancel the persons, these three numbers combine to 0.0005 per day

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:39,000
and per infected person, and that's precisely the expression we are needing in the SIR equations.

20
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Constant times the number of susceptible persons times the number of infected persons.

21
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
But keep in mind that we are dealing with average values here,

22
00:01:48,000 --> 99:59:59,999
25 persons per day give or take a probability of 2%, things can occur more often or less often.
