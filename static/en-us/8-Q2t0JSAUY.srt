00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,400
By now it should be clear that
successful management of chronic

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:09,420
diseases in our highly specialized
healthcare system requires

3
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:14,677
digital data that can be shared as
needed to achieve coordinated care.

4
00:00:14,677 --> 00:00:20,090
However, patient-specific healthcare
data is highly sensitive,

5
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:23,620
and is protected by a law called HIPAA,
which calls for

6
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:28,050
severe penalties, including prison time,
for failure to properly

7
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:32,060
secure what is called
Protected Health Information or PHI.

8
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:38,960
PHI is healthcare data that is linked to
information that identifies the patient.

9
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,500
You will hear the term de-identified
data which refers to the same health

10
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:48,470
information once it has been separated
from any fields that could directly or

11
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:50,740
indirectly be used to
identify the patient.

12
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:54,680
Everyone in healthcare is
concerned about HIPAA.

13
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:59,520
So the topic of this lesson are the
critical technologies that secure

14
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,220
PHI to make sure it is only shared for
legitimate purposes and

15
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:09,260
even then, the sharing has been approved
by the patient or their legal designee.
