00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Before I dive into mathematical detail about

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
value functions, let me just give you a tutorial.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
The value function is a potential function

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
that leads from the goal location--in this case, the 100 in the upper right--

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
all the way into the space so that hill climbing

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
in this potential function leads you on the shortest path to the goal.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
The algorithm is a recursive algorithm.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
It spreads the value through the space, as you can see in this animation,

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
and after a number of iterations, it converges,

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and you have a grayscale value

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
that really corresponds to the best way of getting to the goal.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Hill climbing in that function gets you to the goal.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
You can simplify.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Think about this as pouring a glass of milk

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
into the 100th state and having the milk

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
descend through the maze, and later on,

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
when you go in the gradient of the milk flow,

18
00:00:51,000 --> 99:59:59,999
you will reach the goal in the optimal possible way.
