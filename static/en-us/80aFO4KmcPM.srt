1
00:00:00,312 --> 00:00:03,690
A college-issued ID number is
a good example of a primary key.

2
00:00:04,689 --> 00:00:08,760
It's a unique identifier that somebody
has issued for just this purpose.

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:11,330
As long as everyone in the course
is an enrolled student,

4
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:12,610
they will have a unique ID.

5
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:16,660
Home mailing address is
not a valid primary key.

6
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:19,550
What would happen if you had two
students taking the course who live in

7
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:21,040
the same house?

8
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:24,870
Students' email address might
be an okay primary key.

9
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:27,870
College students don't share
email addresses with each other,

10
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:30,630
so this is a correct choice.

11
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:34,520
But it isn't a great primary key though,
because people sometimes change their

12
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:38,540
email addresses and that can be annoying
to work around in your application.

13
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:41,470
Date of birth is not
a valid primary key.

14
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:44,500
There's a famous math example called
the birthday problem that proves that

15
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:48,990
you only need 23 people in a room to
have a 50/50 chance of two people in

16
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:50,950
the room sharing a birthday.

17
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:53,670
Also, college students are frequently
around the same age, so

18
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:57,190
there's a good chance that two students
will share the same date of birth.

19
00:00:57,190 --> 00:01:00,550
In any event, a primary key
shouldn't just be maybe unique.

20
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:01,920
It has to be definitely unique.

21
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:06,020
Finally, driver's license
numbers are unique,

22
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:10,260
at least if you also include what state
or country the driver's license is from.

23
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:13,890
The problem with this though, is that
not everyone has a driver's license.

24
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:15,510
Some people don't drive.

25
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:18,080
And so, some students could
have no value at all for

26
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,150
this column and that would make
it not a valid primary key
