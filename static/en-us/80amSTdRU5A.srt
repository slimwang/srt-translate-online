I've run through the basics of what the vertex and fragment shaders use for

2
00:00:03,006 --> 00:00:06,590
inputs and outputs. Say you have a triangle with a shading normal stored at

3
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:10,734
each vertex. Which of the following are true? The vertex shader can output the

4
00:00:10,734 --> 00:00:14,092
average position of the three vertices. The fragment shader can use the

5
00:00:14,092 --> 00:00:17,356
interpolated shading normal. The vertex shader can output a color for the

6
00:00:17,356 --> 00:00:21,316
fragment shader to use. The fragment shader can use the position of the third

7
00:00:21,316 --> 00:00:24,719
vertex in the triangle. Check the box if this statement is true.
