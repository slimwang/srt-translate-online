The basic HTML for grabbing the canvas object is pretty straightforward. We've

2
00:00:03,408 --> 00:00:07,711
seen this before. The interesting thing that we haven't yet covered is grabbing

3
00:00:07,711 --> 00:00:12,572
the context of the canvas. Think of the canvas object that we fetched from the

4
00:00:12,603 --> 00:00:17,645
DOM as a DOM element. While the context is a handle to the drawing APIs that

5
00:00:17,657 --> 00:00:22,182
we'll be able to use to modify the canvas visuals later. In this simple example,

6
00:00:22,187 --> 00:00:26,115
we set the width and height to 1200 by 720 respectively. Now, it's worth

7
00:00:26,127 --> 00:00:30,355
pointing out, that any time the user would resize the screen, the canvas will

8
00:00:30,367 --> 00:00:33,885
remain this size. For the purposes of GRITS, we actually use the

9
00:00:33,897 --> 00:00:38,800
window.innerwidth and window innerheight. sizes for our canvas, allowing it to

10
00:00:38,812 --> 00:00:40,715
occupy the fullscreen for the user.
