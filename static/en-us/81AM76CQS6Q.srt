1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Now, the next market type is a new market. Customers don't exist today.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
As the real questions are, if they don't exist, how will they find out about you?

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
And how will they even become aware that they need to be in this new market?

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
And by the way, how do you know the market size of something that doesn't even exist today?

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
The market size is zero and what factors should you create that the industry has never offered.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Now, a way to look at this is take a look at the chasm.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Man, this is scary. That is you can sell to the crazy people all you want.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
The early evangelists, the early adopters, and that's nice but you'll have a small business

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
until you figure out how do we get the masses to adopt?

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
and here's what that hockey stick sales curve looks like.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Here are the early people you're selling to and one of the mistakes

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:00,000
that start-ups and entrepreneurs and founders make, is look at that slope of those early sales,

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
and when you get them, you go great time to like kick up spending

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
and look at this, our board is happy and when we start doing advertising

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
and stepping up the company, but then it kind of declines

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
and people scratch their heads on what's going on.

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:20,000
What's going on is the mainstream market just hasn't adopted and this might go on for years

18
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
and never kick in but if you're lucky, you'll hit a tipping point and market adoption happens.

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
And when it happens, it happens faster than you could imagine

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
but at times, it takes longer to get there than you could imagine.

21
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
So in a new market, one of the things you need to be thinking about is that,

22
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
is there any possible way to move this curve in?

23
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
There's a couple of really interesting things to notice about in a new market.

24
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
One is this value of debt of almost no sales can continue for years.

25
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Now, why is this important to know?

26
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Well, just imagine you're a start-up and you put together a nice financial forecast

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:08,000
for your board and your investors and they all believe that you are an existing market.

28
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
So, they're expecting you to have revenue that increases every year.

29
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Why? Because you've never asked the question what type of market am I in?

30
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Now, if you're in a new market, you now know that it's quite possible that you might have a curve

31
00:02:23,000 --> 99:59:59,999
that doesn't look like this but actually is flat for a long period of time.
