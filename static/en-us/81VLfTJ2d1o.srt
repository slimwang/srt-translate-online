1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,740
CCDA documents are assembled
from templates,

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:07,200
which are essentially
reusable XML components.

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:14,455
Templates can be constructed at the
document, section, or data entry level.

4
00:00:14,455 --> 00:00:17,630
These correspond conceptually
to the parts of a paper form,

5
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:21,920
where the document as
a whole consists of sections,

6
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:28,000
each of which consists of fields where
specific data items can be recorded.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,590
Here at the document level,
sections are specified.

8
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:35,350
And within those,
data elements are specified.

9
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:41,770
In this case, a clinical observation,
which is recorded as free text.
