1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:04,410
So during leaf counting we
talk about a tree having or

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:07,290
consisting of a left and right sub-tree.

3
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:08,770
>> Sounds right, anything else?

4
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:17,800
>> There's parts of a pile which
is tree as parts so that's.

5
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:18,870
>> Okay.
>> kind of that left and

6
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:20,840
right sub-tree kind of
going back to that.

7
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:22,380
>> So you've got it.

8
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:23,370
In our diagram now,

9
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:27,750
we're going to have an aggregation
relationship between pile and tree.

10
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:32,258
This means there's a line between
the two and at the pile end of the line,

11
00:00:32,258 --> 00:00:39,380
is this open diamond indicating that
a pile is a collection of trees.

12
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:42,060
Likewise if we have sub-trees
being parts of trees,

13
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:45,508
we have an aggregation relationship
between a tree and itself.

14
00:00:45,508 --> 00:00:50,960
Okay, so we'll have a line,

15
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,310
a looped line going from tree to itself,
and at one end of that line,

16
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:58,670
we'll have the diamond indicating that
tree is a recursive data structure,

17
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:00,320
as you might expect, okay?

18
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,180
Consisting of parts which are trees.
