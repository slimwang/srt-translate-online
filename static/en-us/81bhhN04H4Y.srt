00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,920
I'll be going over my
solution in a second.

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:03,080
But, if you want to inspect it for

3
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:06,350
yourself, you can find a link to
it in the downloadable section.

4
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:08,770
First things first,
I want my images to fit.

5
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:10,670
I set the max width on
the image tag to 100%.

6
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:12,410
And look at that.

7
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:15,570
Now the images are actually
fitting inside the view port.

8
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:18,950
You can see the whole thing instead of
some massive, stretched out monster.

9
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:20,910
Then I set the width on
the article tag to 50em.

10
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:24,670
You can immediately see that
the content is actually fitting.

11
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:26,810
The blog's starting to look
a lot more reasonable but

12
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:30,600
the browser is still downloading
images that are way too large.

13
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,270
I need some smaller images.

14
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:35,480
I could use a tool like
OS10 Preview to resize and

15
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:39,760
compress each image individually,
but that really isn't scalable.

16
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:44,920
So, I used this grunt task to create new
images that were scaled and compressed.

17
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:48,290
I set a width of 1600 pixels for
2x displays.

18
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:53,360
At a width of 50em on a 1x display an
image is going to be 800 pixels across.

19
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,480
But, on a 2x display,
it's going to be 1600 pixels so,

20
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:57,438
I went with the large one.

21
00:00:57,438 --> 00:01:01,840
I thought 30% still looked good while
keeping the bites to a minimum.

22
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:06,010
Additionally I'm appending large_2x
to the end of each file for

23
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:08,670
reasons that will make
sense later in the course.

24
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:12,368
With all that done all I have to
do is change the image sources to

25
00:01:12,368 --> 00:01:18,130
images/whatever-1600_large_2x and bam.

26
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:20,150
My page just got a lot smaller.

27
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:21,080
Check it out.

28
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:24,120
After the changes,
my page is down to 1.3 megabytes,

29
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,930
which I'm feeling really good about.

30
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:27,880
And lastly, I used the figure tag,

31
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:31,170
because it includes
the awesome figcaption tag.

32
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:35,630
Simply fill in the caption in
figcaption, and it shows up on the page.

33
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:39,340
So the blog is looking a lot better
overall, but it's still not perfect.

34
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:42,580
At the end of the next lesson, you'll
have another chance to improve the blog.
