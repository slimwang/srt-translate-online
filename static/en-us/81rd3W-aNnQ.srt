1
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:03,969
There's a wide world of Gradle
plugins out there created and

2
00:00:03,969 --> 00:00:07,420
maintained by Gradle, its partners,
and by developers around the world.

3
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:11,840
To find documentation on plugins
included with Gradle by default,

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,230
check out the Gradle User Guide.

5
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:16,970
Specifically, Chapter 21 on
the standard Gradle plugins.

6
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:19,410
There are three broad types of plugins.

7
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:23,180
Language plugins for compiling
languages like Java or [INAUDIBLE].

8
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:26,530
Integration plugins for
creating different sorts of artifacts.

9
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:28,260
And software development
plugins that make

10
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:29,700
the software development process easier.

11
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:34,017
To find plugins written
by third parties,

12
00:00:34,017 --> 00:00:37,420
check out the Gradle plugin
portal at plugins.gradle.org.

13
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:39,740
Here you can search for

14
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:43,170
plugins that will help you automate
whatever it is you're working on.

15
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:45,740
Now since these plugins
are provided by third parties and

16
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:48,620
aren't bundled with Gradle, there
needs to be a way to distribute them.

17
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:53,050
Just putting them under source
control leads to the same messes with

18
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:55,320
libraries or any other artifact.

19
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,720
Fortunately, Gradle's dependency
management can be used for

20
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:01,200
the dependencies required
by the build script itself.

21
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,860
If you click on any of
the available plugins.

22
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:07,950
You'll see a snippet for
using the plugin in your build.

23
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:11,570
The build script block means that this
configuration applies to the execution

24
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:13,240
of the build script itself and

25
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:17,510
not to the compilation or execution of
whatever project Gradle is building.

26
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:20,550
This block declares a maven
repository hosted by great deal and

27
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:23,010
a dependency on this particular plugin.

28
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:25,280
Also since this is
a quite common pattern.

29
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,370
There's a simpler way to
do the equivalent thing

30
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:28,470
using the plugins block.
