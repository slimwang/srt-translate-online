00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,300
We just used one method for factoring this polynomial right here, 5x squared

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:08,759
minus 28x minus 12. And because I know that factoring polynomials that don't

3
00:00:08,759 --> 00:00:13,175
have leading coefficient of 1 is a little bit tricky, I want to take a second to

4
00:00:13,175 --> 00:00:17,384
go more in-depth into the logic of figuring out what numbers belong in our

5
00:00:17,384 --> 00:00:21,641
linear factors. Saying that a polynomial like this one, of degree 2, is

6
00:00:21,641 --> 00:00:26,162
factorable, it means that we can write it in this form. As two linear factors,

7
00:00:26,162 --> 00:00:30,592
or factors with an x to the first power in them, multiplied together. And the

8
00:00:30,592 --> 00:00:35,060
general form of a linear factor is just like this. You have some coefficient

9
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:39,545
times x plus some constant term, what we've been talking about is how to figure

10
00:00:39,545 --> 00:00:43,893
out what numbers belong here. Now, of course, one way to do this is to factor by

11
00:00:43,893 --> 00:00:48,117
grouping like we have been that entailed expanding this middle term into two

12
00:00:48,117 --> 00:00:52,539
terms that added together to equal it and then grouping pairs of terms together,

13
00:00:52,539 --> 00:00:56,631
so considering this first pair as a chunk, and the second pair as a separate

14
00:00:56,631 --> 00:01:00,855
chunk, and pulling the greatest common factor that we can out of either those

15
00:01:00,855 --> 00:01:05,233
pairs. This is why we call this factoring by grouping, because we're grouping

16
00:01:05,233 --> 00:01:09,332
these terms and grouping these terms. We can use a slightly different kind of

17
00:01:09,332 --> 00:01:13,451
logic though, to get to the same answer. If we've already written out the form

18
00:01:13,451 --> 00:01:17,050
that we want the equation to end up in, we can look directly at what we might

19
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:21,062
want from these different coefficients and constant terms based on what we start

20
00:01:21,062 --> 00:01:24,751
out with. We know that the way we end up with this x squared term here is by

21
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:28,680
multiplying the term with an x to the first power from each binomial in it. So,

22
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,392
that means that whatever the coefficient is here, multiplied by this

23
00:01:32,392 --> 00:01:36,717
coefficient, must equal 5. We can write out all the different factors of 5, we

24
00:01:36,717 --> 00:01:40,924
can either have 1 times 5 or we could have negative 1 times negative 5. Now,

25
00:01:40,924 --> 00:01:45,279
another thing we know is that the two constant terms multiplied together, equal

26
00:01:45,279 --> 00:01:49,786
the constant term in the original expression. So, we can think about the factors

27
00:01:49,786 --> 00:01:54,090
of negative 12 as well. There are a ton of different ones here. I guess I will

28
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:58,608
write them all out though just for your pleasure, and voila, there we go. I hope

29
00:01:58,608 --> 00:02:02,361
I didn't miss any. Now we know that the way we get this negative 28, the

30
00:02:02,361 --> 00:02:06,585
coefficient of the middle term here, is by multiplying whatever this number is

31
00:02:06,585 --> 00:02:11,215
times this number. And then, adding that to this number times this number. That

32
00:02:11,215 --> 00:02:15,759
means, we are going to have either 5 times some number plus 1 times some number

33
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:19,877
equals to negative 28 or for the other pair over here, negative 5 times

34
00:02:19,877 --> 00:02:24,687
something minus 1 times something equals negative 28. Now, since I rather have

35
00:02:24,687 --> 00:02:29,712
two positive coefficients for x having the two negative ones, let's just select

36
00:02:29,712 --> 00:02:34,112
to use 5 equals 1 time 5. This makes our job a lot easier because that only

37
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:38,731
leaves 1 combination of factors over here that we can plug in. You just have to

38
00:02:38,731 --> 00:02:42,591
figure out which one it is. And, of course, as we already saw in the previous

39
00:02:42,591 --> 00:02:46,262
quiz, we know that this has to be negative 6 and this has to be positive 2. I

40
00:02:46,262 --> 00:02:50,614
can fill in the coefficients in front of the x's, and then since I know that the

41
00:02:50,614 --> 00:02:55,170
two outer terms multiply when we're trying to find this middle coefficient, and

42
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:59,386
the negative 6 goes in this slot, and the 2 goes in this slot, since the inner

43
00:02:59,386 --> 00:03:01,694
terms are contributing to this as well.
