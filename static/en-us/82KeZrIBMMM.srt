1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,570
At this point, your share gif
method should be in place and

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:05,230
connected to the share button.

3
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:07,590
So your app might look
something like this.

4
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:09,150
Here's a video of my coworker,

5
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:11,250
who I accosted while she
was looking at her data.

6
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:15,950
I add a caption, and
now I can text it to my teammate.

7
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:20,380
And you can see that in the text
message it appears as a GIF.

8
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:23,840
So now, we can check off Share the GIF.

9
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,200
Next step, convert a video
from the album into a GIF.

10
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:31,860
In order to convert a video
from the album into a GIF,

11
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:35,900
you'll need to create an action
sheet that has three options.

12
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:37,190
Record a video.

13
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:39,040
Choose from existing videos.

14
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,570
And cancel.

15
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:43,120
To enable the option to
choose from that album,

16
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,590
you'll need to write a method
that launches the photo library.

17
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:48,810
So let's move on to
create an action sheet.
