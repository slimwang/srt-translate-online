Hi, I'm Mike Wales, the web
curriculum manager here at Udacity.

2
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:06,645
In a past life,
I built web applications for

3
00:00:06,645 --> 00:00:09,660
three-letter intelligence agencies
you've probably heard of.

4
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,700
There was no room for
error with these applications.

5
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:14,880
They had to function as intended
all the time, every time.

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,580
More importantly, we needed a way to
add new features to these applications,

7
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:20,800
while making sure we
didn't break anything.

8
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,560
You're probably already doing
this in your own web apps.

9
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:25,630
You refresh the browser,
click around and

10
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:28,210
just watch to make sure
everything is working correctly.

11
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:31,720
Although this works, it's a pretty
slow and inaccurate process.

12
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:34,450
What if I told you there was
a way you could programmatically

13
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:36,700
check your application's functionality?

14
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:39,100
In this course I'll show
you how to do just that.

15
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:42,290
You'll learn how to write your very own
unit tests which are suites of functions

16
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:45,750
that check if parts of your application
are functioning as you expect.

17
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:49,490
In fact, I'll even show you a whole new
way to go about application development

18
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:52,150
called test-driven development
where you write tests for

19
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:55,120
your features before you even
write the feature itself.

20
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,970
So what is a test anyway?
