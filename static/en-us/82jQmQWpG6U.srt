00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:05,460
You now know how to read stock data,
slice it, and plot it.

2
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:10,830
The challenge for you now is to write

IBM over the date range.

4
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:16,587
Go ahead and
write your code in this function.

5
00:00:16,587 --> 00:00:19,340
The clue to this is use slicing.
