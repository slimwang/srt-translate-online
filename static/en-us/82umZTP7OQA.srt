00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
So as the first exercise, say this is the probability, let's print the probability of the inverse event.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Let's make the function over here that takes p but returns 1 - p.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,829
So please go ahead and modify this code such that the return value is 1 minus p and not p.
