1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,634
Now for the last method we'll write for the friend's class, at least for this

2
00:00:02,634 --> 00:00:07,222
lesson. It's possible right now for John to have TJ as a friend and TJ not to

3
00:00:07,222 --> 00:00:12,230
have John back. Let's write a method, removeMeanFriends, that removes all of

4
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:17,995
the friends that don't like John back. So for example, if John has friends, TJ,

5
00:00:17,995 --> 00:00:25,670
Maria, Jamesha and Joe. Let's say Jamesha and Joe both like John back, but TJ

6
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:33,296
and Maria don't. So we want to remove TJ and Maria from John's friends list. So

7
00:00:33,296 --> 00:00:37,422
in this case we'll start with TJ at index zero. So we'll remove TJ from the

8
00:00:37,422 --> 00:00:41,766
list. Now the list gets re-indexed. To look at the next person in the list we

9
00:00:41,766 --> 00:00:45,770
need to look at the zeroth person again. So we can't just have a counter

10
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:50,225
variable that we increment by one each time. We look at Maria and Maria also

11
00:00:50,225 --> 00:00:54,028
doesn't like John. So we'll remove Maria and the rest of the list will get

12
00:00:54,028 --> 00:00:58,000
re-indexed again. So yet again to look at the next person we have to look at

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,597
the zeroth person. We look at Jamesha and Jamesha likes John, so she should

14
00:01:02,597 --> 00:01:06,840
stay in the list. We'll increment the counter and look at the next person. Joe

15
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:10,736
likes John, so we'll keep Joe in the list. So we should increment the counter

16
00:01:10,736 --> 00:01:14,582
variable and look at the next person, which would be at index two. But two is

17
00:01:14,582 --> 00:01:18,860
no longer a valid index. Even though it was, originally. So we're done.
