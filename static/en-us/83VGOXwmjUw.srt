1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:05,452
Our mean difference as you found earlier is negative 2.72. For the lower bound

2
00:00:05,452 --> 00:00:09,807
we'll subtract the T critical value times the standard error, we found before

3
00:00:09,807 --> 00:00:16,170
that the T critical value is 2.064 when there are 24 degrees of freedom. And

4
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:22,122
then we'll multiply this by S the standard deviation of the differences. divide

5
00:00:22,122 --> 00:00:27,326
by the square root of 25. This gives us about negative 4.24, then we'll do the

6
00:00:27,326 --> 00:00:34,263
same for the upper bound of this confidence interval. Negative 2.72 plus 2.064

7
00:00:34,263 --> 00:00:43,247
times 3.69 divided by the square root of 25. If we round to the hundreths

8
00:00:43,247 --> 00:00:48,802
place, this gives us negative 1.20. We can conclude then, by saying that on

9
00:00:48,802 --> 00:00:53,488
average, users will make around four to one fewer errors on the QWERTY keyboard

10
00:00:53,488 --> 00:00:57,498
than on the alphabeticle keyboard.
