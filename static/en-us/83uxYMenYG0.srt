We're about to take a look at the graph of f of x equals 3x minus 8 over x

2
00:00:04,436 --> 00:00:11,134
minus 5. But just before we do, let's find it's vertical asymptote. Where do

3
00:00:11,134 --> 00:00:15,246
you think it is? Remember, we just need to check what value of x is going to

4
00:00:15,246 --> 00:00:19,535
make the denominator equal to 0. Write in the equation of the asymptote right

5
00:00:19,535 --> 00:00:20,251
here.
