1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,114
So for the quiz, your goal is to define a next day procedure that takes as input

2
00:00:04,114 --> 00:00:08,079
a valid data in the Gregorian calendar, which is encoded as three numbers, the

3
00:00:08,079 --> 00:00:11,983
year, the month and the day and then returns the next day as a threetuple of the

4
00:00:11,983 --> 00:00:17,022
year, the month and the day. And to keep this simple, you should assume that all

5
00:00:17,022 --> 00:00:21,317
months have 30 days. This of course will not be correct in some cases, but will

6
00:00:21,317 --> 00:00:23,593
be a good start towards solving the problem.
