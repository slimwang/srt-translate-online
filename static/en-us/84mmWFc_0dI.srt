You just saw how to read from a file and how to find the largest value in a

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:07,480
data set. The last program prints out the population of the most populous

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:12,410
country, but it doesn't print the name of the most populous country. Edit the

4
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:16,190
program so that it prints out the country's name as well as its population at

5
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:20,420
the end. And here's a hint, what else do you need to remember? What variables

6
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:23,620
should you add so that you can print the population and the country name at the

7
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:24,749
end?
