00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,252
Now that we've seen a couple of different transformations, let's look at

2
00:00:03,252 --> 00:00:08,118
several at once. Each of these equations represents some sort of transformation

3
00:00:08,118 --> 00:00:13,016
of our original graph, f of x equals x squared 2. What I would like you to do

4
00:00:13,016 --> 00:00:16,600
is match the letter next to each of these equations over here with the way that

5
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:21,702
it transforms this function. Then, if there's any missing information like the

6
00:00:21,702 --> 00:00:25,921
number of units the graph has shifted by, please fill that in as well. One

7
00:00:25,921 --> 00:00:31,530
thing to note is this last choice down here, reflected in the x axis. What this

8
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:35,250
means is that if we have our standard x,y axis here, we have some curve drawn

9
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:40,770
like this, maybe a sort of parabola. If it's reflected in the x axis, that

10
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:45,090
means it's been flipped across the X axis or flipped over the x axis, like

11
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:50,847
this. So, this graph below would be a reflection in the x axis of the one

12
00:00:50,847 --> 00:00:56,730
above. Now it's up to figure out what equation makes that happen. Good luck.
