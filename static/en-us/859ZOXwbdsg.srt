1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,850
>> I'm with IDEO, one of the largest design companies in the,

2
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:07,480
in the world. I'm with Tim Brown, the CEO of IDEO, and,

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:12,020
Tim has written this very interesting book, Change By Design, which includes

4
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:15,880
among other things, a big section on the importance of design thinking.

5
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:22,210
So Tim, design thinking. One of the points you argue, is that it doesn't just

6
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:26,200
make you a better designer, it makes you better at anything. Tell us about that.

7
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,530
>> I've always thought as, the one of

8
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:30,640
the wonderful things about being a, being a designer

9
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,620
is not just that I get to lots, work on lots of exciting projects, but it helps

10
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:36,250
me in my life, right? So I, and

11
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:38,380
when I want something as simple I'm going to throw

12
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:39,940
a dinner party for some friends so I

13
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:43,430
start. Instead of just turning up at, you know,

14
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:46,000
7 o'clock and thinking about what I'm going to make. I actually design

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,080
that, I try and design that experience. I think well who am I

16
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:51,250
going to bring together and what's the space going to be like and how does

17
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:53,380
the food and the space work together. All of these things that I

18
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:57,460
naturally think about as a designer. And I think that's what design thinking

19
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:00,310
does for you. It's a set of tools that allows you to approach

20
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:04,870
life, particularly the parts of life where it might be advantageous to solve

21
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:08,650
the problem differently, that allows you to approach that with some level of

22
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:11,940
confidence because you got some ways of going about it.

23
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:14,520
And we have many, we're taught at school many ways

24
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:17,836
of analyzing problems, of put, picking them apart and studying

25
00:01:17,836 --> 00:01:21,590
little pieces of them. Often that's very valuable. But, but design

26
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:23,640
thinking gives you a different way of tackling a problem.

27
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:27,110
Often, often ones that are centered around the needs of the

28
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:30,100
people you're trying to solve for. That might be yourself.

29
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:33,840
It might be a customer in in if, if, if you're

30
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,730
in a professional environment, it might be you're

31
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:39,510
colleagues. Int in in a work, work environment. It's

32
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:43,770
centered around that. And so it starts with thinking

33
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:47,190
hard, looking hard, listening hard and trying to study

34
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:51,470
people. And understand, in this instance, wh, what

35
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:54,150
their issues might be, what their problems might be.

36
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:56,529
w, how they're thinking, how they, how they are,

37
00:01:56,529 --> 00:01:58,910
how they are navigating the world or dealing with

38
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:01,090
the world at, at, at, at hand. And then

39
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:03,592
using that as the starting point for having ideas.

40
00:02:03,592 --> 00:02:06,010
>> Mm hm, I actually, I often describe it,

41
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,730
don't solve the problem. In fact, as a consultant never solve

42
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:14,720
the problem you're given, but figure out what the real problem is.

43
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,390
>> Yeah, figure out what the question is. I mean, many of us think we're

44
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:20,340
talk about, when people talk about creativity

45
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:24,000
or design, I think it's all about solving

46
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,690
the problem and, and being creative about

47
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:28,250
that. But I find generally the most interesting

48
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:30,350
solutions come out of the most interesting

49
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:33,710
questions and, and so that insight about what

50
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:37,200
the problem might really be, is often the most important than the

51
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,610
biggest creative step. And so, if you just assume you know the

52
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:45,240
question then especially if it's the same question that everybody else is,

53
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:48,040
is asking. Then you'll probably get to the same answer that everybody it

54
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,530
getting to. But if you study a little bit and think a

55
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:53,250
little bit, and maybe look at it, look at the, look at things

56
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,740
from a slightly different perspective, really get under the skin of the

57
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:58,830
people that you are trying to serve, it's surprising how often you end

58
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:00,690
up completely re-framing the question.

59
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:02,050
>> And so, as you point out, this could be

60
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:06,620
used by anybody, a business person, an artist, a journalist, anybody.

61
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:08,830
>> Yeah. I mean, you, you can think about how you use it. I mean, one

62
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:12,950
of the things I talk about in, in, in, in, in my book is, is ways

63
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:15,490
of applying design thinking to your own life.

64
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:17,260
I mean, think about your career. How can

65
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:19,820
I apply a design thinking approach to my

66
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:23,570
career, to the choices I make, or, or, or,

67
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:25,690
absolutely how you apply it in your, in, in your,

68
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:27,925
in your workplace. No matter what you do. You might, you

69
00:03:27,925 --> 00:03:30,710
might work in the finance department, have a company, and be

70
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:33,220
thinking, well how could I be, find more creative solutions to

71
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:37,170
the way that we, the processes that work within our organization. Or the way

72
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:42,480
that we come together as, as, as, as people. And so I think whatever your

73
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:48,570
background, if you have the, the tools to hand, the thinking tools to hand,

74
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:52,610
and the confidence to use them. that, that, that design can be a great help.

75
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:54,010
>> Thank you.
