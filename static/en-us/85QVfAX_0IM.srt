1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,880
Let me actually introduce to you some
concepts on, how we can get depth?

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:08,210
If somebody gave me a single image
like this, how would you compute that?

3
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:10,478
Well, an interesting
thing in this image is,

4
00:00:10,478 --> 00:00:15,440
there's perspective in this image
that is, if I was to let's say,

5
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,970
draw a line let's just draw
a line connecting all these

6
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:25,330
points here or I can draw a line
connecting all these points here.

7
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:28,470
And I can draw a line connecting
all these points here.

8
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:31,960
In essence, if you look at them, each
and every one of the lines that I would

9
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:35,810
draw is basically pointing that
these are vanishing lines.

10
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:37,570
They get closer and closer, and

11
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:40,840
converging to a same point
at the distance away.

12
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:45,700
So, in real scenes you will always find
that there are pre-determined, well

13
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:50,540
defined vanishing lines and points that
an image in a real scene will point to.

14
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:53,160
And that basically start showing
is of course there's depth.

15
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,080
Things that are farther
away are smaller,

16
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:58,630
things that are closer up are larger,
and by disconstructing it

17
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:01,910
as you go farther into the scene
they get smaller and smaller.

18
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:04,470
So this is an important cue,
the perspective and

19
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:07,170
basically just looking at
vanishing lines and points.

20
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:09,670
Now one thing I want to remind you is,
this is actually true for

21
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:12,770
mostly real images and photographs.

22
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:16,670
Just as an exercise I recommend trying
to do the same exercise on paintings and

23
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:19,220
seeing, you might actually
find that sometimes

24
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:20,790
vanishing lines do not converge.

25
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:25,200
Here is another perspective
to look at depth, right.

26
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,720
Here I'm basically sharing an image.

27
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,680
Again it's hard to,
in this instance find vanishing lines.

28
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,850
There is horizon and everything, but the
vanishing lines are hard to determine.

29
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:37,890
But, I know what humans usually are or
what size.

30
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:39,860
So by looking at this and
noticing the fact that,

31
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:43,650
as you go further, this same humans are,
are different people.

32
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:45,890
They're getting smaller and smaller.

33
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:49,080
That also starts giving
me the sense of the depth

34
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,700
as I move further down this way.

35
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:55,310
Right, so
just objects of known sizes help me

36
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:58,850
understand how I'm going to
be able to perceive that.

37
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:03,950
Another high level cue, and when I mean
high level is it requires a lot more

38
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:08,780
kind of analysis of a scene is something
which could be called occlusions, right?

39
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:12,670
These two people well,
he's in front of this lady here.

40
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:15,030
She's in front of all
of the shopping stuff.

41
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:19,040
She's in front of the,uh, you know,
materials and this market here.

42
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,860
Which basically starts saying, is I
can't see any of this because she's in

43
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:24,630
front of it, I can't see anything
behind her because she's occluding it.

44
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:28,210
And there's a whole lot of
information on how the occlusions

45
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:30,110
are kind of manifesting it selves.

46
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:32,500
And this kind of starts telling
me more about the scene, so

47
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:36,520
occlusions are also an important cue
that could be used to analyze scenes.

48
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:41,060
A really well known method in
the computer vision is extracting

49
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:46,200
information of shape of a object
by just seeing how well or

50
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,130
how differently it's lit?

51
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:51,790
So here is an example of just by
looking at the lighting variations on

52
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:55,420
the surface, you can actually
extract the shape and the depth.

53
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:58,685
As I said depth as you go
into the image of this face.

54
00:02:58,685 --> 00:03:02,615
This is an interesting example of
how we can actually start looking at

55
00:03:02,615 --> 00:03:05,685
depth of different types of scenes,
and just to showcase this,

56
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:08,885
I'm going to show you something fun and
interesting that one of our alums

57
00:03:08,885 --> 00:03:12,025
Grant Schindler worked on, and
which is an app on the App Store now.
