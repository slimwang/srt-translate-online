1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,690
Okay, that first quiz was
a little bit on the simple side.

2
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:05,880
This one's going to be more useful.

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:09,725
You'll be matching jQuery's.ready
feature by wrapping a check for

4
00:00:09,725 --> 00:00:12,830
document.readyState in a Promise.

5
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:16,430
You are now in the thening
stage of the course.

6
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:20,365
I want you to use then to perform
an action after a promised result.

7
00:00:20,365 --> 00:00:24,930
Document.readystate has
three possible states.

8
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:27,320
Loading, interactive, and complete.

9
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:31,420
Loading means the document
is still loading.

10
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:34,560
Interactive means the document
has loaded and been parsed.

11
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:39,182
But subresources like images and
style sheets have yet to load.

12
00:00:39,182 --> 00:00:41,659
This is equivalent to
the dom content loaded event.

13
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:45,370
Lastly there's the complete state,
and that means that

14
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:49,520
all the subresources including
images and style sheets have loaded.

15
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,400
Every time the document's
ready state changes

16
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,200
a ready state change event fires.

17
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:59,310
Creating a promise to run on interactive
is really useful if you want to run

18
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:04,019
some code as soon as all of the initial
dom elements have been loaded.

19
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:08,720
For this quiz I'm giving you an event
handler for ready state change.

20
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,502
I want you to wrap it in a promise so

21
00:01:10,502 --> 00:01:13,470
that it resolves when
the dom is interactive.

22
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:14,980
Or, in other words,

23
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:19,680
I want it to resolve when the ready
state is no longer loading.

24
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,800
Like the last quiz, you don't need to
worry about air handling because if

25
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:26,760
the dom is never ready then
the page won't display anyway.

26
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,760
Make sure you test, too.

27
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:32,760
Do so by using .then to chain
the method wrapperResolved when

28
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,540
the document is ready.

29
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:36,250
Make sure you check out
the Instructor Notes for

30
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:37,730
help getting started, and good luck.
