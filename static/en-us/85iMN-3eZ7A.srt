1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,872
So the application not responsive error
is something that doesn't have one

2
00:00:03,872 --> 00:00:04,723
correct answer.

3
00:00:04,723 --> 00:00:07,556
If you think about it there
could be a ton of reasons why.

4
00:00:07,556 --> 00:00:09,933
And I think again it's
important to follow up with,

5
00:00:09,933 --> 00:00:11,400
what does your application do?

6
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:16,375
I think if Sam was able to ask
a couple more questions about,

7
00:00:16,375 --> 00:00:17,995
okay well is it a music app?

8
00:00:17,995 --> 00:00:19,311
What runs in the background?

9
00:00:19,311 --> 00:00:22,584
Starting to probe into why
it's not responding, and

10
00:00:22,584 --> 00:00:27,311
kind of figuring that out because it's
either what my application is doing or

11
00:00:27,311 --> 00:00:29,725
how it's structured, is important.

12
00:00:29,725 --> 00:00:33,361
So again, with these type of questions,
they're very broad and

13
00:00:33,361 --> 00:00:35,157
there's not one right answer.

14
00:00:35,157 --> 00:00:38,662
It's just important for you to kind
of talk to your interviewer and

15
00:00:38,662 --> 00:00:40,110
nail a very specific area.
