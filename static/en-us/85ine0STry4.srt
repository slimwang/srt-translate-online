Thanks Susan. Now, Andy, would you mind telling me and the viewers at home a

2
00:00:02,833 --> 00:00:04,612
little more about this event.

3
00:00:04,612 --> 00:00:08,710
>> Lauren, that's a great question. So, at its core what we have here is a weight

4
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:13,068
difference threshold competition. What that means is, let's say I took these

5
00:00:13,068 --> 00:00:16,899
two mugs, they're identical, they have the same weight. So, if I gave them to

6
00:00:16,899 --> 00:00:18,978
you right now, what would they feel like?

7
00:00:18,978 --> 00:00:20,302
>> The same!

8
00:00:20,302 --> 00:00:23,455
>> Right. And what if instead, I put a gram of water into one of these mugs, and

9
00:00:23,455 --> 00:00:27,270
you're blindfolded, remember. Could you tell the difference?

10
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:29,020
>> I don't think so, it's just one gram of water.

11
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:31,750
>> But if there was, let's say 100 grams of water?

12
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:35,253
>> Yeah, I think I'd be able to tell the difference between 100 grams of water.

13
00:00:35,253 --> 00:00:39,155
>> You probably would. So the question is, where is that threshold? At what point

14
00:00:39,155 --> 00:00:42,270
can you tell the difference in weight?

15
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:44,036
>> How exactly are they going to measure this though?

16
00:00:44,036 --> 00:00:47,568
>> So, what we're going to be doing is making a lot of comparisons. We're going to

17
00:00:47,568 --> 00:00:51,078
have our 100 gram reference weight and our atheletes are going to be comparing

18
00:00:51,078 --> 00:00:54,318
that to 101 grams and then a 102 grams, and for each of these comparisons,

19
00:00:54,318 --> 00:00:59,010
they'll identify, or try to identify which is heavier.

20
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:00,738
>> That's fascinating, Andy.
