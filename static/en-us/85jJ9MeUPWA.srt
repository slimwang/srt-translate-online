00:00:00,005 --> 00:00:04,793
As we said before, the reason we need to restrict what x is allowed to equal is

2
00:00:04,793 --> 00:00:09,850
because certain values of x aren't going to make sense in our situation. So the

3
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:14,355
domain here is the set of values that are possible inputs of a of x. So the

4
00:00:14,355 --> 00:00:18,998
first choice is correct. We can also think of this, however, as the set of

5
00:00:18,998 --> 00:00:24,312
possible values of the independent variable. Since the independent variable and

6
00:00:24,312 --> 00:00:25,908
input are the same thing.
