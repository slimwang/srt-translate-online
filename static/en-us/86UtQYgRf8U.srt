1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,790
So the first one, from a computational perspective, NP-complete problems

2
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:05,790
are the hardest ones out there.

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:08,130
This is actually false. There are much harder problems.

4
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:12,120
For example, problems that are in the complexity class P space,

5
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:17,550
or exponential space, or any number of other complexity classes.

6
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:20,810
The second one is also false.

7
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:24,800
P=NP would not imply that all NP-complete problems are solvable in practice.

8
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,260
We might still have huge polynomials.

9
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:32,700
For instance, we might have a polynomial that is n to some very, very large number,

10
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:36,200
and in practice this is still not going to be solvable.

11
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:42,010
P=NP isn't necessarily going to imply that we can solve these problems in practice.

12
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:44,080
The third statement is true.

13
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:49,530
All NP-complete problems are solvable in polynomial time on a nondeterministic RAM.

14
00:00:49,530 --> 99:59:59,999
That's more or less the definition of what it means for a problem to be an NP.
