00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,700
When you're creating
apps like Email Clients,

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:05,820
there will be times when there
are many emails that have arrived.

3
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:06,430
On a handheld,

4
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:10,810
you will be shown a notification that
looks like this using inbox style.

5
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:14,340
When you touch the notification,
it will open up on the Email Client and

6
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:15,790
show you all the emails.

7
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:19,190
On a wearable, you would like to see
more information about the emails

8
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:21,800
without having to pull
out the handheld device.

9
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:25,790
It's possible to create a series of
notifications, one for each email and

10
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:28,260
then stack will group them together.

11
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:31,240
The notifications are initially
shown as a single card.

12
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:34,690
That can be expanded into
multiple cards by touching it.

13
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:36,890
So here we create
a separate notification for

14
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:38,970
each email our app knows about.

15
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:43,750
You can see that we add the sender here
and the subject here for each email.

16
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:48,010
Now, we use the setGroup method to
specify a unique key for this group.

17
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:50,680
So Android Wear knows which
notifications should be

18
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:51,870
stacked together.

19
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:54,900
We then issue this like
any other notification.

20
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:57,450
And here is another notification for
a second email.

21
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:00,760
You'll notice the use of setGroup here,
just like the previous one.

22
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:03,890
And we issue this notification
in the same way as well.

23
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:06,080
The final step is to create
the notification for

24
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,060
the phone like it's shown here.

25
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:11,190
Clearly we don't want the individual
emails to each get a notification on

26
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:12,620
the handheld device.

27
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:16,170
This code sample creates the inbox
style shown in the previous image.

28
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:19,580
It adds a summary of all the emails
in a nice format that's perfect for

29
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:21,540
showing on a handheld device.

30
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:25,770
The interesting part is the code is
setGroup here, and setGroupSummary here.

31
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:28,780
This makes the notification
part of the previous group, but

32
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:32,920
we've specified that this is the summary
of the group by passing true here.

33
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:36,270
Summary is shown on the phone while
the other group items are shown

34
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:37,380
on the Android Wear device.
