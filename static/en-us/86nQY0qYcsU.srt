1
00:00:00,264 --> 00:00:02,463
Now I offer these as a fictitious example – these

2
00:00:02,463 --> 00:00:03,045
are relatively

3
00:00:03,045 --> 00:00:05,598
large numbers. But what’s important to notice

4
00:00:05,598 --> 00:00:10,246
is the chances of dying in a hospital are 40

5
00:00:10,246 --> 00:00:13,524
times as large than dying at home. That

6
00:00:13,524 --> 00:00:16,889
means whether you die or not is correlated

7
00:00:16,889 --> 00:00:18,939
to whether or not you are in a hospital. So

8
00:00:18,939 --> 00:00:21,574
the chances of dying in a hospital are indeed

9
00:00:21,574 --> 00:00:25,189
40 times larger than at home. So let me ask

10
00:00:25,189 --> 00:00:27,728
the critical question. Shall you now stay at

11
00:00:27,728 --> 00:00:30,060
home, given that you are a really smart

12
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:33,172
statistics student, can you resist the temptation

13
00:00:33,172 --> 00:00:36,272
to go to the hospital because indeed it

14
00:00:36,272 --> 00:00:40,000
might increase your chances of passing away.
