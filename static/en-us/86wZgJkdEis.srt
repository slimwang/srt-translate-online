1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
It's the final option. The time step has to be smaller than half of Δx² divided by thermal diffusivity.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Let me explain why--if the time step was exactly equal to 1/2 * (Δx)² divided by thermal diffusivity.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
This expression would equal to and our result would be -1.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
What would happen is that our initial temperature distribution would be reflected

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
after the first time step where it was 1 before, it would be -1 after,

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
and it's easy to compute that where it was -1 before, it would be 1 after.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The next time step would undo this reflection and here

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
the blue distribution again and so on and so on.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
We would see infinite oscillation. We would see oscillation but no decay.

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,000
If age is smaller than 1/2 this ratio, this expression is smaller than 2.

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
If age is smaller than 1/2 times this ratio, this expression is smaller than 2,

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
we're subtracting less, so the result is larger than -1.

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Oh a new temperature, 1/2 to 1 times step at position 0 is not -1 but a little more than that,

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
and of course, it's similar for the others.

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
So you see that when it totally reflecting our function, we're losing a little,

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
and with the next time step, we again are going to lose a little, so that's going to work out well.

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
As soon as age is smaller than 1/2 this ratio, we're going to see decay,

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
but to stop that oscillation during the decay, we indeed have to pick age smaller than

19
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
1/4 of that ratio, so that we're subtracting less than 1.

20
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
This condition shows that our method is really poor.

21
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
If you use a spatial subdivision that's finite by a factor of 2,

22
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
we have to use a time step that's smaller by a factor of .4.

23
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Hopefully, this reminds you of Unit 3, the recovered implicit methods to deal with such instabilities.

24
00:01:55,000 --> 99:59:59,999
For partial differential equations, implicit methods maybe unavoidable.
