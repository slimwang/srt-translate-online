00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,922
>> If I multiply the left side by 10, I get 58a. >> I notice 58a is on the left

2
00:00:03,922 --> 00:00:08,018
side in all my answer choices, >> So there's something else going on. >> Notice

3
00:00:08,018 --> 00:00:12,394
that I use brackets around the entire expression. That's because I already had

4
00:00:12,394 --> 00:00:16,479
parenthesis here. >> I only need to distribute the 10 to the 2 and 1 10th and

5
00:00:16,479 --> 00:00:20,682
the 2, because when we distribute the 10 will be applied to the 3a and the 2. >>

6
00:00:20,682 --> 00:00:24,623
And then of course on the end, I have 2 times 20. >> So we know this one must be

7
00:00:24,623 --> 00:00:28,586
correct. >> This was a really tricky quiz, so don't worry if you didn't get it

8
00:00:28,586 --> 00:00:32,564
right on the first try. >> Hopefully you learned something about decimals and

00:00:32,564 --> 00:00:34,681
the distributive property along the way.
