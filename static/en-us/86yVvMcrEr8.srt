00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,743
This is a pretty involved lesson. And I don't expect you to absorb it all at

2
00:00:03,743 --> 00:00:07,918
once. But I do want you to at least heard of the idea. I know it's taken me

3
00:00:07,918 --> 00:00:12,152
about 20 years to really grasp this whole concept. Let's get started. In

4
00:00:12,152 --> 00:00:15,568
previous lessons we've seen that the order of transforms for an object is

5
00:00:15,568 --> 00:00:19,640
usually rotate and then translate. For example, we start with the letter F, at

6
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:24,892
the origin. If we rotate it negative 45 degrees, we get a tilted F. We then

7
00:00:24,892 --> 00:00:29,477
translate it by one unit vertically, and it moves up. This we write out as TR,

8
00:00:29,477 --> 00:00:33,954
with the matrices applied in reverse order. However, we're now able to use

9
00:00:33,954 --> 00:00:38,358
matrices which ever way we want. So say we reverse the order. If instead we

10
00:00:38,358 --> 00:00:43,881
first translate up a unit, then rotate, we get this, the notation RT. Clearly

11
00:00:43,881 --> 00:00:48,408
different, with T changing the origin we then rotate around. Here is another way

12
00:00:48,408 --> 00:00:53,503
to look at it. Say we first just rotate the F. We express this by the notation

13
00:00:53,503 --> 00:00:58,302
R. We could add a translation matrix before or after this rotation. If we add it

14
00:00:58,302 --> 00:01:02,654
before the R this means we translate the object after the rotation and so move

15
00:01:02,654 --> 00:01:07,257
it with respect to the world. Whatever happens before this translation was

16
00:01:07,257 --> 00:01:11,472
applied is said and done. The object is in whatever orientation that has already

17
00:01:11,472 --> 00:01:17,096
been set. Ancient history, so TR is this top case as before. If we put the T

18
00:01:17,096 --> 00:01:21,884
after the R, it says to apply the translation first so everything is rotated

19
00:01:21,884 --> 00:01:26,464
around the origin. So finally I haven't said anything new. However, another way

20
00:01:26,464 --> 00:01:29,866
to look at all this is you're changing the frame of reference by each of these

21
00:01:29,866 --> 00:01:34,336
transforms. Instead of rotating or translating the object, we can think about it

22
00:01:34,336 --> 00:01:38,752
as changing this frame of reference. By taking this new path, we can think of

23
00:01:38,752 --> 00:01:43,238
the transforms in these terms. First the rotation changes the frame of reference

24
00:01:43,238 --> 00:01:48,126
that any transforms to the right of it will use. Then the translation moves the

25
00:01:48,126 --> 00:01:52,312
object with respect to this new frame of reference. Any point of space is given

26
00:01:52,312 --> 00:01:56,238
some x y z coordinate only with respect to something. We started off by thinking

27
00:01:56,238 --> 00:01:59,748
of this something as world space, but notice that we have actually been making

28
00:01:59,748 --> 00:02:03,484
things in what we call model space, and then transforming them to world space.

29
00:02:03,485 --> 00:02:07,676
For example, when we have a parent child relationship, the child is oriented

30
00:02:07,676 --> 00:02:11,860
with respect for the parent, not the world. So it's all about respect. Just a

31
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:16,660
little bit. When we put the T matrix after the R, we're saying to translate with

32
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:21,515
respect to the view of the world of the R matrix. So putting the T here, moves

33
00:02:21,515 --> 00:02:26,610
the objects with the respect to the R matrices frame of reference. That is, the

34
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:31,380
translation is done with respect to the R's y axis. Putting the T in front of

35
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:35,220
the R means that the translation is not done in the R's frame of reference, but

36
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:39,202
in the world's frame of reference. The R itself is now influenced by the T's

37
00:02:39,202 --> 00:02:43,168
frame of reference. Another way to say this is that the first matrix to the

38
00:02:43,168 --> 00:02:47,328
right of some given set of matrices is transforming the object with respect to

39
00:02:47,328 --> 00:02:51,344
that set. In other words, everything to the left of it. For example, on the top

40
00:02:51,344 --> 00:02:56,360
here, the rotation is transforming the F with respect to the frame of reference

41
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:00,436
of the T translation to its left. This all may sound obtuse, but think of

42
00:03:00,436 --> 00:03:04,468
someone looking at a hubcap in your model, he wants to know where it's located

43
00:03:04,468 --> 00:03:08,816
and what angle it's at. You might describe it as well, I moved the hubcap so

44
00:03:08,816 --> 00:03:13,541
it'd be properly attached to the wheel, and then I moved the wheel so that. But

45
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:17,808
he cuts you off, I don't care how it got there, where is it now. When you

46
00:03:17,808 --> 00:03:22,096
position the hubcap you weren't really moving the hubcap to its position you are

47
00:03:22,096 --> 00:03:26,043
positioning it with respect to wheel's frame of reference. And then you are

48
00:03:26,043 --> 00:03:29,462
positioning the wheel with respect to the car's frame of reference. It's more

49
00:03:29,462 --> 00:03:33,554
like the car's location and the wheel's location were maps for where the hubcap

50
00:03:33,554 --> 00:03:37,578
should go. Different frames of reference are just like you might use latitude

51
00:03:37,578 --> 00:03:41,070
and longitude to fly somewhere. Then use a street map, a different frame of

52
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:44,720
reference, to get from the airport to the office. Then use a map of the building

53
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:49,334
to find the room you want. Each frame of reference takes you to the next.
