1
00:00:00,424 --> 00:00:03,279
Perhaps this is the true
goal of intelligence.

2
00:00:03,279 --> 00:00:06,230
To be able to produce reasonable
behavior while dealing with

3
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:08,540
different sources of complexity.

4
00:00:08,539 --> 00:00:09,209
>> I like that.

5
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:12,460
But what exactly is intelligence then?

6
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:15,530
>> Boy, okay,
let's look at some examples and

7
00:00:15,529 --> 00:00:18,399
you tell me whether you consider
them as intelligent or not.

8
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:21,179
How about a piece of rock?

9
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:24,289
Or a plant?

10
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,460
How about a thermos?

11
00:00:31,089 --> 00:00:35,362
Or Siri?

12
00:00:35,362 --> 00:00:39,280
How about myself?
