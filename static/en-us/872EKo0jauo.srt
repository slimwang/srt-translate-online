1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:05,660
p plus 4 divided by the quantity p plus 2 is correct. Impressive work if you've

2
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:09,715
got that correct. To divide by a rational expression, we multiply by the

3
00:00:09,715 --> 00:00:13,735
reciprocal of the second fraction. Now, we really just have a multiplication

4
00:00:13,735 --> 00:00:18,534
problem that we're familiar with. We factor this trinomial to get p plus 5 time

5
00:00:18,534 --> 00:00:23,935
p minus 1 and we factor this denominator to get p plus 5 times p plus 2. These

6
00:00:23,935 --> 00:00:28,833
factors reduce to 1 and we're left with p plus 4 in our numerator, and p plus 2

7
00:00:28,833 --> 00:00:30,233
in our denominator.
