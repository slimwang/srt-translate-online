00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:01,580
I'm here with Kevin Mayo.

2
00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:06,010
He is a graduate of the Frontend
nano degree program, and

3
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:08,850
he is now a Frontend
engineer here at Udacity.

4
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:13,070
So Kevin, I wanted you to
talk to our students about

5
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:16,250
what you do when you
are learning a new technology.

6
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:17,070
Where do you go?

7
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:19,850
What sort of resources
do you find helpful?

8
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:20,600
>> Yeah, sure.

9
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:26,595
So I guess that's one of the skills that
I picked up from the nano degree is,

10
00:00:26,595 --> 00:00:32,240
when you're trying to learn something
new, I usually go right to the official

11
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:38,470
documentation or official site,
whatever the technology has set up.

12
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:45,190
Pretty good nowadays about giving you
a little tutorial, code example, and

13
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:48,780
like, good documentation,
because basically, there's so

14
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:52,680
many new things coming out that if
you don't provide good documentation,

15
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:53,910
nobody's going to use your technology.

16
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:56,710
So, that's like,
the best place to start, and

17
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:59,360
just get some kind of a feel for it.

18
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:02,510
And then obviously you're going to
have questions, or I always do.

19
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:07,700
So then that's when you can
go to the Udacity forums.

20
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:12,790
You can go to Stack Overflow,
just Google things.

21
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:16,720
But usually I like to jump as
quickly as possible into a project,

22
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,930
so it can be a simple to do app.

23
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:22,200
Everybody does those.

24
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,580
Or like a Udacity project.

25
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:27,020
That's a great starting point too.

26
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:30,284
And just kind of go,
trying to actually build something,

27
00:01:30,284 --> 00:01:33,640
that's where you'll
start to have questions.

28
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,300
And you're kind of forced to learn.
