00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,180
Here, x would equal 4 3rds. Nice thinking if you got this number. Now, if this

2
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:09,020
gave you some trouble, that's okay. We haven't had a lot of practice rewriting

3
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:13,535
numbers with different bases, so let's see how it works. I know that both 27

4
00:00:13,535 --> 00:00:20,275
and 81 are the result of raising 3 to a certain power. For example, 3 cubed is

5
00:00:20,275 --> 00:00:27,775
27 and 3 to the fourth is 81. Notice too that now I have the same base. I have

6
00:00:27,775 --> 00:00:32,552
a 3 here, and a 3 here. But before I do anything, let's combine these two

7
00:00:32,552 --> 00:00:37,820
exponents. When we raise a power to a power, you multiply these two together.

8
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:43,232
This is how we get 3 to the 3x equals 3 to the fourth power. Now, since these

9
00:00:43,232 --> 00:00:48,053
two bases match, we set these exponents equal to one another. So we'll have 3x

10
00:00:48,053 --> 00:00:52,832
set equal to 4 here, and then we'll divide both sides by 3 to get x equals 4

11
00:00:52,832 --> 00:00:59,385
3rds. And if you check this in a calculator or by hand, you'll definitely see

12
00:00:59,385 --> 00:01:05,304
that 27 raised to the 4 3rds equals 81. We know this is true since the cube

13
00:01:05,304 --> 00:01:12,170
root of 27 equals 3. And 3 to the fourth power is 81. So yes, our answer checks

14
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:14,300
and we can be sure that it's correct.
