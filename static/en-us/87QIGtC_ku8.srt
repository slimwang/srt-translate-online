1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
And the answer is 88.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
It takes 7 steps to go from start to goal

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
if we just count the go straight steps.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
And we have to turn once in this spot right over here,

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
which costs an additional -5, so we pay a total of -12.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 99:59:59,999
That plus 100 gives us 88.
