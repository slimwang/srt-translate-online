00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,500
So before I run this program, let me share with

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:04,950
you my hypothesis of what will happen when I run this

3
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:07,510
piece of code. Now one of the first things we are

4
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:10,740
doing here in this program, is that we're creating an instance

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:14,450
of class child we called it miley_cyrus. As soon as that

6
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:18,020
line of code runs, the init method inside class child will

7
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:21,680
get called. The first line within the init method, is this

8
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,450
print statement. So my hypothesis is, that this print statement will

9
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:29,080
be printed out first in our output. After that

10
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:31,590
the constructor for the class parent is going to get

11
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:34,370
called. So the control will move from here up to

12
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:38,120
here. When the init method for class parent is called,

13
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:40,580
this statement is going to get executed. So my

14
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:44,290
hypothesis is that this print statement parent constructor called will

15
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:47,395
be the second thing that gets printed. Then the instance

16
00:00:47,395 --> 00:00:51,760
variable's last name and eye color will be appropriately initialized.

17
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,250
Once the init method for class parent has successfully

18
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:57,010
run, the control will come back here. At that

19
00:00:57,010 --> 00:01:01,280
point, the instance variable number_of_toys will successfully get initialized.

20
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,700
So at that point, the init method for class child

21
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:06,480
is done, which means that the instance miley_cyrus has

22
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:10,580
been created successfully. Then, the following two print statements which

23
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:12,560
are trying to print the last name and number

24
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,500
of toys for miley_cyrus will get executed in that order.

25
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:21,160
Alright, this time let me actually run this piece of code. And there's

26
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:25,460
my output. And it seems pretty close to what I thought it would

27
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,900
be. Now, I want you to pause the video here for a second,

28
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:31,750
and I want you to see if the output here matches your hypothesis.
