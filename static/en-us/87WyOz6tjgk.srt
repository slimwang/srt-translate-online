00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:04,750
Okay. Let's get started with Knowledge PCI. Today we'll talk about

2
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:09,910
semantic networks. This is the kind of knowledge representation scheme. This is

3
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:14,970
the first lesson in our fundamental topics part of the course. We'll start

4
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:18,950
talking about knowledge representations, then we'll focus on semantic networks.

5
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:24,470
We'll illustrate how semantic networks can be used to address two by one matrix

6
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:30,716
problems. You can think of this like a represent and reason modality.

7
00:00:30,716 --> 00:00:35,822
Represent the knowledge, represent the problem, then use that knowledge to

8
00:00:35,822 --> 00:00:41,980
address the problem. As simple as that. At the end, we'll close this lesson

9
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:45,800
by connecting this topic with human cognition and with modern research in AI.
