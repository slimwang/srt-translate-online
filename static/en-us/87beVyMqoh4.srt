1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:00,871
All right so

2
00:00:00,871 --> 00:00:04,605
now we're going to get started on some
technical coding tech questions okay?

3
00:00:04,605 --> 00:00:05,362
>> [CROSSTALK] All right.

4
00:00:05,362 --> 00:00:06,942
>> So I'm going to erase the board here.

5
00:00:16,732 --> 00:00:24,307
All right, so let's imagine
that we're building a website.

6
00:00:24,307 --> 00:00:30,319
And this website,
let's say this is our viewport here.

7
00:00:30,319 --> 00:00:33,160
This website will present
a slideshow of images.

8
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:33,690
>> Got it.

9
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:37,436
>> All right so this is the web site and
this is also the viewport.

10
00:00:37,436 --> 00:00:43,549
And here's an image and on top of this
image there will be buttons going left

11
00:00:43,549 --> 00:00:49,705
or right allowing you to cycle through
the images and then kind of off here.

12
00:00:49,705 --> 00:00:55,200
Tthis is the first image
that's outside the viewport,

13
00:00:55,200 --> 00:01:00,980
you're looking at this one and then
you have on and on and on over here.

14
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:03,030
Let's say five images in total.

15
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:03,750
>> Right.

16
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:07,990
>> I would like you to write
the HTML markup you would use.

17
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:09,880
Don't worry about styling.

18
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:14,350
Just the HTML you would
use to build this out.

19
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:14,870
>> Got it.

20
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:19,140
>> Don't worry about HTML, the head tag,
the body tag, just assume all that's

21
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:23,240
provided, and just what you need
to do this year to set it up.

22
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:27,420
>> And I assume I'll use JavaScript
to flush this out later, right?

23
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,280
>> Yeah we'll move into that.

24
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,320
>> We'll move into that okay.

25
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:33,110
>> Right now just focus on the HTML
that you would use to build this.

26
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:36,130
>> Right so first thing I really
don't understand, was okay I

27
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:39,190
want to make sure I have all my
variables and all my constraints right.

28
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:42,570
It's that I need to make a carousel and
then I need to have pictures,

29
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:44,860
right, that show up.

30
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:46,620
And right now here's the viewport.

31
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:50,790
And it looks like to me it looks
like there's a section here.

32
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,170
So this is a box so what I'm going to
do is actually define that box first,

33
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:56,880
in my viewport.

34
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,990
So I'm going to use,
most likely I'm going to use,

35
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:01,970
I like to use semantic tags so
I'm going to use section.

36
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:08,050
And probably class, carousel?

37
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:12,120
Probably define that.

38
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:14,520
And section here.

39
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:18,380
So this will define this here.

40
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:19,060
>> Okay.

41
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:20,290
>> So within the section.

42
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:25,710
How we are going to do this is
I'm actually going to create.

43
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:31,170
I need buttons here, so
probably I'm going to have buttons.

44
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:38,264
So I'm going to actually want to
expand this a little more, Section.

45
00:02:40,482 --> 00:02:45,223
I'll probably see,
since I'll probably make some

46
00:02:45,223 --> 00:02:49,781
sort of span, Here.

47
00:02:51,964 --> 00:02:54,576
Class equals button.

48
00:02:57,153 --> 00:03:03,385
Left, and
then I'll have another span here.

49
00:03:03,385 --> 00:03:04,478
And a span here.

50
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:10,980
Because then I'll use CSS to
style my buttons later on but

51
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:14,433
this is how I would set up my structure.

52
00:03:14,433 --> 00:03:20,712
Class equals button right.

53
00:03:26,587 --> 00:03:30,340
Okay, within here, again,
I actually want the main picture.

54
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:34,632
So I'll have an image tag here.

55
00:03:34,632 --> 00:03:39,609
Class equals I'll probably

56
00:03:39,609 --> 00:03:43,760
name this carousel me,

57
00:03:46,107 --> 00:03:50,570
pic, right here.

58
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:56,592
Now and how we would like set up
these other things off the view port,

59
00:03:56,592 --> 00:04:01,559
I would probably have some
sort of JavaScript that would

60
00:04:01,559 --> 00:04:04,743
like load within the section here.

61
00:04:09,472 --> 00:04:10,340
At the end here.

62
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:13,535
Probably have some JavaScript
that would like load.

63
00:04:13,535 --> 00:04:15,954
JavaScript.

64
00:04:19,077 --> 00:04:20,190
To preload.

65
00:04:23,031 --> 00:04:27,720
Take these images and

66
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,850
then I click.

67
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:37,030
If I click on the button then like
I would preload these images all.

68
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:42,020
And I want to get a clarification
like if I click on this button here.

69
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:44,080
That the image will actually animate and
shift.

70
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,516
>> We're not worried about animations.

71
00:04:45,516 --> 00:04:46,983
>> Okay.
>> We would just want if you were to

72
00:04:46,983 --> 00:04:49,149
click this button,
this picture would go away and

73
00:04:49,149 --> 00:04:50,810
this picture would be in it's place.

74
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:51,498
>> Okay.
>> And so

75
00:04:51,498 --> 00:04:55,124
if you were to click obviously the right
button the opposite would happen this

76
00:04:55,124 --> 00:04:57,859
picture would they move this
way because semantically and

77
00:04:57,859 --> 00:04:59,892
structurally that's what would happen.

78
00:04:59,892 --> 00:05:02,039
>> Okay.
>> But not animation wise.

79
00:05:02,039 --> 00:05:06,118
So if you would equate the right button
you would end up having two images out

80
00:05:06,118 --> 00:05:07,114
of view somehow.

81
00:05:07,114 --> 00:05:07,735
>> Okay.
>> And

82
00:05:07,735 --> 00:05:10,126
then this third image
would be in the view.

83
00:05:10,126 --> 00:05:11,370
>> Okay, got it.

84
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:14,320
Then, so thanks for the clarification.

85
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,776
So then, I would probably

86
00:05:18,776 --> 00:05:23,637
have an image here, class,

87
00:05:23,637 --> 00:05:28,310
carousel, like off left.

88
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:30,218
Left here?

89
00:05:30,218 --> 00:05:31,650
>> Mm-hm.

90
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:39,490
>> And then I will have a image here,

91
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:46,210
class carousel off rights.

92
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:50,693
And that's how it was set up
because basically these two.

93
00:05:50,693 --> 00:05:52,790
I will set up my CSS and
these two will be off the field for

94
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:57,300
using some sort of like width to make
sure that we need to make sure that

95
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:00,240
the viewport there so
you know what you look this will be.

96
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,590
This will show up.

97
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:04,660
This will just show up here in
the viewport, this will show up here.

98
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:05,870
And this will show up here.

99
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:06,708
>> Right.

100
00:06:06,708 --> 00:06:09,093
>> And that's how I would set
up just a pure structure.

101
00:06:09,093 --> 00:06:11,095
>> Okay.
>> Right now.

102
00:06:11,095 --> 00:06:14,940
So a few questions.

103
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:16,490
In choosing these spans here.

104
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:19,330
You said that these
are essentially buttons.

105
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:22,970
>> Yeah.
>> But you're using the span tag.

106
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:28,010
>> Yeah.
>> Are there any negative consequences

107
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:32,660
from using that span as opposed to
using something like an anchor tag?

108
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:35,130
Or a button itself?

109
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:40,865
>> The negative consequence that I
see is that, the span takes up space.

110
00:06:40,865 --> 00:06:42,190
>> Mm-hm.

111
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:47,990
>> Though this space will be guided by
whatever background image I give it.

112
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:48,610
>> Okay.

113
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:51,660
>> So, I think it's, if i'm correct,

114
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:56,750
this span tag will actually take
up space versus an anchor tag,

115
00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:01,650
and anchor tag you can use a anchor tag.

116
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:05,420
>> There's a specific advantage for
using a anchor tag or a button.

117
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:07,350
Let's assume the user
does not have a mouse.

118
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:12,680
>> Okay for accessibility concerns yeah.

119
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:18,510
You're right,
I would op to think about accessibility.

120
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:21,120
I would actually change
my span to anchor tag.

121
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:21,620
>> Okay.
