1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,860
And, obviously, the answers, are all of these.

2
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:07,020
It is a pain to change. We've basically hard-coded

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:09,240
these percent s's here and there and we're doing

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,070
this complicated logic to put everything together. That is

5
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:15,830
zero fun. We don't get any syntax highlighting. That's

6
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:19,250
correct. Because we're putting HTML in our Python code.

7
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:21,480
So, we're not dealing with HTML. We're basically dealing

8
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,620
with big strings. And that's really tedious to manipulate

9
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:28,170
when your editor is set up to write Python. Our code is

10
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:31,910
ugly. I didn't have a whole lot of fun explaining that code

11
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:34,420
to you. I can't imagine you had a whole lot of fun

12
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:37,720
listening to me attempt to do so. We can certainly make things

13
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:41,370
a lot more clear. And it's error prone. You know if you

14
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:43,990
miss one of those percent s's, you get a percent s in

15
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:47,226
your output. If you want to, you know, add extra things, it's very

16
00:00:47,226 --> 00:00:51,040
difficult to reason about and kind of figure out what goes where.

17
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:54,890
So this is, obviously, not a particularly great approach

18
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:58,590
for generating HTML from our web application. It works for

19
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:00,890
short, little things like just a simple, simple tiny

20
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:04,060
form. But anything more complicated than that is very unwieldy.
