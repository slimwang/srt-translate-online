1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,240
The answer is scheme 1.

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:06,410
Remember that the alpha term
cost of a tree-based algorithm

3
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:09,530
is proportional to log
of the number of nodes.

4
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:12,720
By contrast,
any sort of bucketing will be linear.

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:16,440
Now in this case, since we're operating
on a 2-D mesh, it'll be linear and

6
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,470
square root of P rather than linear and
P.

7
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:21,740
But that's still worse than log.

8
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:25,310
So, at least with respect to
the alpha term, scheme 1 is better.

9
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:28,500
Now, had I asked you which scheme
has the largest beta term,

10
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:29,750
what would you have said?
