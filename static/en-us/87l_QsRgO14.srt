00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:04,678
Let's try another equation. This time, the bases are fraction. Now, don't be

2
00:00:04,678 --> 00:00:09,580
worried, it works the same way as before. We want to think about rewriting the

3
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:13,424
right-hand side of the equation, so that way we have the same base of 3 5ths,

4
00:00:13,424 --> 00:00:18,960
as we do on the left. Once we have identical bases, of 3 5ths, we can set these

5
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:24,466
two exponents equal to one another. So, try your best and see if you can find

6
00:00:24,466 --> 00:00:25,300
x.
