1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,890
That was a more difficult problem. If you got negative 3 or negative 1 5th,

2
00:00:04,192 --> 00:00:08,638
congratulations. I would say that you have mastered absolute value equations.

3
00:00:08,738 --> 00:00:13,032
Let's see how we got those answers. When I have two absolute values that are

4
00:00:13,044 --> 00:00:17,476
equal to each other, I still have to make two cases. And the two cases for this

5
00:00:17,488 --> 00:00:22,015
problem are going to be 3 x plus 2 equals, the first case is going to be exactly

6
00:00:22,027 --> 00:00:26,885
what's inside the absolute value, which is 2 x minus 1. The second case, we keep

7
00:00:26,897 --> 00:00:31,340
the left side of the equation the same and make the right-hand side of the

8
00:00:31,352 --> 00:00:35,888
equation negative, so I have negative 2 x minus 1. Let's go ahead and solve

9
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:40,300
these. First I subtract 2 x from both sides. When I subtract 2 x from both

10
00:00:40,312 --> 00:00:45,370
sides, I get x plus 2 equals negative 1. And when I subtract 2 from both sides,

11
00:00:45,482 --> 00:00:50,720
I get x equals negative 3. So, there's one of my answers. we have to be a little

12
00:00:50,732 --> 00:00:55,595
more careful here. I have negative parentheses, 2 x minus 1, which means

13
00:00:55,607 --> 00:01:02,002
negative 1 times 2 x minus 1. Which means I need to distribute that negative

14
00:01:02,014 --> 00:01:08,441
sign. Negative 1 times 2 x is negative 2 x, and negative 1 times negative 1 is

15
00:01:08,453 --> 00:01:14,509
positive 1. From here, I'm going to add 2 x to both sides, which gives me 5 x

16
00:01:14,521 --> 00:01:19,293
plus 2 equals 1. When I subtract 2 from both sides, I get 5 x equals negative 1.

17
00:01:19,396 --> 00:01:23,992
Divide both sides by 5, and I get x equals negative 1 5th. That problem was more

18
00:01:24,004 --> 00:01:28,616
difficult then a lot of the absolute value equations. So, if you got the answer

19
00:01:28,628 --> 00:01:33,190
right, I'd say you've mastered absolute value equations. And, we're ready to

20
00:01:33,202 --> 00:01:35,518
move on to absolute value inequalities.
