00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,370
The answer is we will store a function object in that sagas array.

2
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:08,870
From the f to the end curly brace is the definition of a function object, and

3
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:11,340
that is the value that we're pushing into the sagas array.

4
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:15,320
A lexical scope is actually just characters of code that you find in

5
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:16,560
a file somewhere.

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,420
And that's not actually a value that can be stored anywhere in a variable or

7
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:21,770
as an element of an array.

8
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:24,900
An execution context is one of these boxes that we

9
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:29,230
see pictured here wherein we find stored key value pairs.

10
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:32,650
And fundamentally this is not something you can even have a reference to.

11
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:35,190
And similarly it can't be stored in an array.

12
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:37,790
There is no anonymous function being called here.

13
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:40,150
The closest thing is this function object.

14
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:42,500
But since there are no parens appearing after it,

15
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,550
we will not be invoking an anonymous function.

16
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:47,720
And, therefore, we won't be getting the result of an anonymous function.
