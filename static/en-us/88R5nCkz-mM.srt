Okay, let's do a little quiz called, how to optimize? So as rows

2
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:08,480
here, we have objectives. Optimize application code,

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,540
reduce latency for static content, make app

4
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:14,810
more responsive, reduce data store reads

5
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:18,280
and improve performance as user base grows.

6
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:20,690
And as columns, we have different optimization

7
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:25,520
techniques. Edge caching, mem cache, automatic scaling,

8
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:28,570
app stats, and queues. Please select

9
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:31,300
the appropriate optimization strategy for the different

10
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:34,150
objectives. There could be more optimization

11
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:36,850
techniques for a single objective. Good luck.
