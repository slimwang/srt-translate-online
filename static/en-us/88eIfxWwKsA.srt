Awesome work adding
a flavor specific activity.

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:07,360
It's not actually required to assign
a unique application ID to each flavor,

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:11,520
however, it does help by distinguishing
log messages and most importantly

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:15,620
it allows installation of both flavors
on the same device at the same time.

5
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:18,510
Well, while there's a lot more to
learn about Android build variance,

6
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:20,390
you're well on your way
to building bigger and

7
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:23,240
better apps, all while keeping
your build complexity manageable.
