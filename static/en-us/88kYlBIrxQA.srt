In addition to design methods, representations and

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:06,860
validations, there are some other issues that arise with software design.

3
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:11,510
We already talked about the difference between architectural and

4
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:16,840
detail design and exactly where that boundary is. Of key importance is

5
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:21,760
the respective energies we put into designing the functional part of the system

6
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:26,190
versus dealing with those non-functional constraints. At a more abstract level,

7
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:31,700
there's the difference between what and how. The specification process deals

8
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:37,210
with what the system will do. The design process begins to say how we're

9
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:42,380
going to do it. Finding the right boundary between those two is a key issue. And

10
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:48,120
finally, what is there about your particular application that is going to affect

11
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:53,620
the design process? For example, you have some existing resources that you want

12
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:57,220
to reuse and build in your solution. They can affect the design that you do.
