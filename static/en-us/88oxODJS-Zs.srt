1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:06,510
First, an IKE SA needs to be established
before IPSec SAs can be negotiated.

2
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:13,810
This is true, because the purpose of an
ISA is to use it to negotiate IPSec SAs.

3
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:16,490
Second, the identity
of the responder and

4
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:21,570
receiver and the messages they have
exchanged need to be authenticated.

5
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:22,650
This is true.

6
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:25,500
This is the last step of
the Phase One protocol.

7
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:29,800
Third, with perfect forward secrecy,
the IPsec SA keys

8
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:34,160
are based on the IKE shared
secret established in Phase One.

9
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,270
This is false.

10
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:40,210
With perfect forward secrecy,
the IPsec SA keys are not based on

11
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:43,430
the shared secret keys
established in Phase One.

12
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:46,800
So that if the phase one
keys are compromised,

13
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,570
the IPSec SA keys are not compromised.
