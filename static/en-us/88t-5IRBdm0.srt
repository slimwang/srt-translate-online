1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:04,850
So to start off, I decided to grab the values of the street and city.

2
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:06,660
And to do so I opened up Dev tools and

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:10,890
saw that street has an ID of street, and the city input has an ID of city.

4
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:16,160
Back inside the script I created a new variable called streetStr, and

5
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:22,030
I set it equal the value of the text inside the element with the ID of street.

6
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:23,420
I did the same thing for city.

7
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:26,100
And then I created a full address with a comma in

8
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:28,380
between by concatenating them together.

9
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:30,970
I, of course, made our fun little heading that says, so

10
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:35,470
you want to live at the White House, or 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, Washington DC.

11
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:37,972
And then I created a URL.

12
00:00:37,972 --> 00:00:41,890
This streetViewUrl is simply a string that starts off with what we

13
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:43,090
saw before in the API.

14
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:47,250
I decided to hard code the size as 600 by 400 pixels.

15
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:51,030
And then we set the location to the address that we just created up here.

16
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:53,790
Then it's a simple matter of appending the right image to

17
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:56,730
the page with the right class and the right URL.

18
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:59,550
To test our code, let's use a different address.

19
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:04,280
I've entered in the address to AT&T Park in San Francisco, and let's hit Submit.

20
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,820
Okay. This looks good but let's double check.

21
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:11,290
I'll go ahead and get rid of New York Times and Wikipedia real quick.

22
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:13,630
And check it out, we've got AT&T Park in the background.
