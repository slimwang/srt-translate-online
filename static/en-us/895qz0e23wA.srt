1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:06,130
So let's compare the Simultaneous Multi
Treading and Dual-Core processors.

2
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:09,420
Let's say that we have two threads
to execute, one is floating-point

3
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:14,480
intensive, most of the stuff it does, it
does on floating-point execution units.

4
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,410
And another thread that is integer-only,

5
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:19,870
it has no floating-point
operations whatsoever.

6
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:24,200
Let's say we have 4-issue core that
can issue two floating points and

7
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:26,650
two integer instructions per cycle.

8
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:31,130
Do we get more performance per
hardware dollar we put in with SMT

9
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:34,490
added to a core like this,
or with two such cores?
