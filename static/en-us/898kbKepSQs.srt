00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,450
Our starter project created a whole
bunch of project settings for us.

2
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:08,050
We can find some of the more
important ones under

3
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:10,929
Project Structure > App > Flavors.

4
00:00:12,039 --> 00:00:15,529
The version code is a number
that describes the app version.

5
00:00:15,529 --> 00:00:17,949
Higher numbers represent
more recent version, and

6
00:00:17,949 --> 00:00:22,049
this is recognized both by
the platform and by Google Play.

7
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:26,426
The assumption is that you cannot safely
downgrade to an older app version, but

8
00:00:26,426 --> 00:00:29,449
you should be able to upgrade
to a more recent version.

9
00:00:29,449 --> 00:00:33,728
We also have the minimum SDK version and
a target SDK version,

10
00:00:33,728 --> 00:00:36,450
this requires a bit more explanation.
