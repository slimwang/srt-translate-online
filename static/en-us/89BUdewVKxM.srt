1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,040
So that completes the last portion of this

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,990
lesson module, where we visited the structure of parallel

3
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:10,060
operating systems and in particular looked at tornado as

4
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:13,830
a case study. This completes the second major module

5
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:17,450
in the advance operating systems course, namely parallel systems.

6
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:20,870
I expect you to carefully read the papers we

7
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:23,170
have covered in this module which I've listed in

8
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:25,890
the required readings for the course, and which served

9
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:30,440
as the inspiration for the lectures that I gave you in this module. I want

10
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:33,830
to emphasize once more the importance of reading

11
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:36,530
and understanding the performance sections, of all the

12
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:39,950
papers. Both to understand the techniques and methodologies

13
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:44,540
therein, even if the actual results may not

14
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:46,790
be that relevant due to the dated nature

15
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:49,090
of the systems on which they've been implemented.
