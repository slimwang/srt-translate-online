1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Looking at our solution over here, we can see that the only place this matters

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
is p(1-p) flows right through to down here.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
So we need to change these to numbers.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:25,000
So this is going to be 0.5<i>0.5</i>1.96²/0.05²

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
and for this it will simply be 0.6 times 0.4 times the same thing.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:46,000
For p = 0.5, this evaluates to 384.16 and for 0.6 it evaluates to 369.79.

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Since again we can't have fractional people, the answer is 385 and the answer for 0.6 is 369.

8
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
A quick way to see why this changed so little is simply that this is the same.

9
00:01:01,000 --> 99:59:59,999
N 0.5<i>0.5 is 0.25. N 0.6</i>0.4 is 0.24.
