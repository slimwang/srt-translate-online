1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The answer is this one.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
They both display a negatively sloping somewhat linear relationship.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
If we look at this one, the relationship look something like this,

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
so a bar chart would look something like--

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Whereas this one would just have some equally spaced bars, and this one would actually

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,000
be the same thing because there's just more noise but it's the same flat non-relationship.

7
00:00:39,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Whereas for this one, we can see we could draw bars kind of like that.
