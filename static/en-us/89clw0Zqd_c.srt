00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,137
We've been talking about parallel lines a lot recently, but here I've drawn two

2
00:00:04,149 --> 00:00:08,356
lines that are clearly not parallel to one another. Rather, these lines are what

3
00:00:08,368 --> 00:00:12,443
we call perpendicular to one another. Making us some observations about these

4
00:00:12,455 --> 00:00:16,491
two lines that I've told you are perpendicular, what do you think that you can

5
00:00:16,503 --> 00:00:20,729
say about perpendicular lines in general? If two lines are perpandicular to one

6
00:00:20,741 --> 00:00:24,248
another do they have the same slope? Do they have different slopes? Do they have

7
00:00:24,489 --> 00:00:28,416
specially related slopes? Do they have slopes are related in a special way?

8
00:00:28,507 --> 00:00:32,164
Should they form a right angle with one another, or do they have slopes with

9
00:00:32,176 --> 00:00:35,014
oppisite signs? You can pick as many choices as you think are correct.
