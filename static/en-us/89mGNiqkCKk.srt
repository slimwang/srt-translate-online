00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:05,820
Welcome to Lesson 3. You've now learned four basic fundamental

2
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:11,420
concepts. Affordances, signifiers, conceptual models,

3
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:17,030
and system image. In this lesson, we're going to learn two more principles,

4
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:21,700
based on the gulf of execution. How do I know what I can do?

5
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:25,390
And the gulf of evaluation. How do I know what happened? This leads to

6
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:31,860
two concepts. Discoverability and feedback. Then we're going to take all

7
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:35,020
six of these concepts, and put them together. So in the

8
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:38,130
very last project of this lesson. You're going to actually build

9
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:40,620
something. Something useful. Incorporating all

10
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:41,810
that you've learned in the course.
