>> I know perpendicular lines have slopes that are opposite in sine. And they're

00:00:05,032 --> 00:00:09,738
reciporical of one another. This is negative 3 halves. So I know my slope must

3
00:00:09,738 --> 00:00:14,392
be positive. And it must be the reciprocal of 3 halves. So it must be 2 3rds. If

4
00:00:14,392 --> 00:00:16,545
you put positive 2 3rds, nice work.
