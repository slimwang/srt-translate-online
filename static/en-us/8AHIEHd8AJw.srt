1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Let's go through the possibilities.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Let's imagine for now that halts (tsif) is true--

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
that tsif terminates.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
This means that after a finite number of steps, tsif must return a value.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Well, let's go through and see what that value is.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
We go in here, and if halts (tsif),

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
well actually, we were just assuming that was true,

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
so we'll definitely take this then branch.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Uh-oh, we loop forever.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
So we assumed that tsif halted,

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
but now we seem to be looping forever.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
That is a contradiction, and it makes me super unhappy.

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
By the way, cutely, sometimes people in mathematics--

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
rarely, but sometimes--draw crossed swords

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
to show a contradiction.

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
That's of course near and dear to my heart, so we'll use that.

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
So when we thought the procedure halted,

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
its source code made it loop forever.

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
So if it's not one, it must be the other.

20
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Let's try the other approach.

21
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Let's say that we think that tsif does not halt,

22
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
so it should loop forever.

23
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
So let's run it and see it looping forever.

24
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
We get in here, is halts (tsif) true?

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
No, we just assumed it was false.

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Okay, so we go down to the else branch and we--oh--immediately return.

27
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
That's kind of annoying because we were assuming

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
that it doesn't halt--that it loops forever.

29
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Neither of those options are possible.

30
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
This is also tricky.

31
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
There is no possible value for halts that works out.

32
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
No matter what you do, it ends up being wrong.

33
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
And this is why we could never

34
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
have a procedure like halts that worked in the real world.

35
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Even if you thought it worked on some cases,

36
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
there's one evil case, at least, where it doesn't.

37
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
tsif--This Sentence is False.

38
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
It's a paradox,

39
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
and the essence of a paradox like this is self reference.

40
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
This sentence talks about itself.

41
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
This sentence asserts its own falsehood.

42
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Similarly, the source code for tsif

43
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
talks about whether or not tsif halts.

44
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
This is the computer programming equivalent

45
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
of a natural language paradox

46
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
like this sentence is false.

47
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
If I ask you, is this sentence true?

48
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Well, that can't be right because then it would truthfully be asserting that it's false,

49
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
so that's a contradiction.

50
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
If I ask you, is this sentence false?

51
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Well, then we'd invert it and have it be

52
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
asserting that it was true.

53
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Oh, another contradiction--none of these work.

54
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
It's the same problem in natural language

55
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
or in computer science.

56
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
You may have heard a similar version of this called the Barber Paradox,

57
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
which is typically phrased as something like

58
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
the barber cuts the hair of each person in this village

59
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
who does not cuts its own hair.

60
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
The question is does the barber do a self haircut or not?

61
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
It's a lot like this sentence is false,

62
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
but one level removed.

63
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
You may also have heard Epimenides Paradox--

64
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
"All Cretans are liars. I'm a Cretan."

65
00:02:55,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Just like this sentence is false, but one step removed.
