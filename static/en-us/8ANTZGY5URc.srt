1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,630
Let's try to build the data
frame professor outline.

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:07,770
Starting with the things we need to
populate the data frame with, r,

3
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:09,150
firstly dates.

4
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:13,662
We used pandas date range method
which takes two parameters,

5
00:00:13,662 --> 00:00:15,665
that is start and end date.

6
00:00:15,665 --> 00:00:20,660
For this code,
we will take a small date range that is

7
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:25,442
from 22nd Jan 2010 to 26th Jan 2010.

8
00:00:25,442 --> 00:00:29,130
We then call the date range
function as I mentioned before,

9
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:32,540
passing two parameters,
start date and the end date.

10
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:36,960
Let's run this code to see
what variable dates has in it.

11
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:41,530
The output you see is not
the list of strings, but

12
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:45,280
the list of date time index objects.

13
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,760
Now, what do you mean by
date time index object?

14
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:52,160
Let's extract the foremost
element of this list.

15
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,565
You can get the forced element
of the list by writing

16
00:00:55,565 --> 00:01:01,640
dates[0] Let's go ahead and
run this code.

17
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:06,852
This is the first element of the list
which a date/time index object.

18
00:01:06,852 --> 00:01:12,950
The trailing zero zeros for
each object is the default time stamp.

19
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:17,310
The index for
a stock data only consists of dates.

20
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:19,240
We can ignore the time stamps for now.

21
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:26,360
Next we define an empty dataframe
df1 with these dates as index.

22
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:30,030
We use the parameter index
to supply the dates.

23
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:34,756
Note that without this parameter the
dataframe will have an index of integers

24
00:01:34,756 --> 00:01:37,800
0,1,2 as seen before.

25
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,610
Let's print this now.

26
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:42,470
So here's your DataFrame, DF1.

27
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:46,000
It's an empty DataFrame with no columns.

28
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,900
However, as we pass the index parameter,
we have an index as dates.

29
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:55,030
And you can see that it's
a date time index object.

30
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:57,180
Two major steps have now been completed.
