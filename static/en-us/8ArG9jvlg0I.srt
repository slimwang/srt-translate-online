1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:04,570
So here in the order_dinner.xml
layout file, you should have button,

2
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:05,939
Start checkout.

3
00:00:05,939 --> 00:00:09,800
Notice that initially we set
the visibility to "invisible,"

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:14,780
because we don't want the button to
show up until after the user presses

5
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:16,810
the Add to cart button.

6
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:21,620
Now looking at the order_dinner_activity
java file, we need to import the button,

7
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:23,666
because we are going to be hiding and
showing buttons.

8
00:00:23,666 --> 00:00:26,830
We added the startCheckout() method.

9
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:31,311
We show a toast instead of actually
implementing the checkout process, and

10
00:00:31,311 --> 00:00:34,190
then we call
the sendStartCheckoutHit method.

11
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:39,240
And then in the sendStartCheckoutHit
method, we're going to send a hit to

12
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:44,400
Analytics to report that
the user started checkout.

13
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,030
And for
this we're going to fake the cart and

14
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:50,560
just assume that the currently
selected dinner is what's in the cart.

15
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,340
So we create the product.

16
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:55,620
We set the ProductAction
to ACTION_CHECKOUT.

17
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:56,690
Set the category.

18
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:58,250
I'm setting mine to Shopping steps.

19
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:02,990
We set the action, the label,
we build a hit, and we send it.

20
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:07,030
So one other thing we need to do is
to update the addDinnerToCart method

21
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:11,880
to show the button for checking out,
and to hide the button for

22
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:12,830
adding the dinner to the cart.
