00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:04,508
Here's your chance to build a stairway to, well, not heaven, but at least to a

2
00:00:04,508 --> 00:00:08,733
gold cup, a virtual gold cup. This exercise gets you familiar with how most of 3

3
00:00:08,733 --> 00:00:13,466
JS's, geometric objects work. You'll be spending your time working inside the

4
00:00:13,466 --> 00:00:17,805
create stairs function. We're going to use the cube geometry method to create 2

5
00:00:17,805 --> 00:00:21,932
pieces for steps, a vertical piece and a horizontal plank. Cube geometry's not a

6
00:00:21,932 --> 00:00:26,027
perfect name since a cube is defined as having all its dimensions be the same

7
00:00:26,027 --> 00:00:29,826
size. Box geometry would have been better but no big deal. Here's the code for

8
00:00:29,826 --> 00:00:34,448
defining the geometry for two steps. The way cube geometry works is that you

9
00:00:34,448 --> 00:00:38,266
provide it a size in x, y and z. It then creates a set of triangles for you

10
00:00:38,266 --> 00:00:43,192
forming a box with these dimensions. Once you have this geometric object, you

11
00:00:43,192 --> 00:00:47,068
can use it as many times as you wish to create 3JS meshes, each of which

12
00:00:47,068 --> 00:00:51,282
consists of geometry and a material. You can use the position parameter on the

13
00:00:51,282 --> 00:00:54,878
mesh class to re-position the box, and in fact you'll need to do this for the

14
00:00:54,878 --> 00:00:58,234
exercise. When you create a box, it is centered around the origin. For our

15
00:00:58,234 --> 00:01:02,894
vertical part of the step, we want this piece to be resting on the ground. To do

16
00:01:02,894 --> 00:01:07,606
so we take half of the height of the piece and move it this distance upward so

17
00:01:07,606 --> 00:01:11,951
that the bottom is now at ground level. The horizontal piece making up the flat

18
00:01:11,951 --> 00:01:15,510
part of this step is created with this code. In this case, we first push the

19
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:19,290
step up half its thickness so it rests on the plane, then push it up the rest of

20
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:23,510
the height up the vertical piece, so that it rests on top. The z position has

21
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:27,937
also changed. Pushing the plank so that one edge is at the origin and that pulls

22
00:01:27,937 --> 00:01:32,378
back a bit so that it rests firmly on the vertical piece that's shown here. Got

23
00:01:32,378 --> 00:01:36,435
all that? Once you run the program, you'll see the two step pieces with the

24
00:01:36,435 --> 00:01:40,738
vertical piece resting on the ground plane. You'll also notice a cool program

25
00:01:40,738 --> 00:01:45,100
feature. There's some controls available. The grids can help you get a sense of

26
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:50,272
distance along each axis. They have lines every 100 units. Each is labeled with

27
00:01:50,272 --> 00:01:54,759
the axis that are in that grid plane. For example, since the y axis is up for

28
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:59,364
this scene, the x, z grid is on the ground plane. Your goal is to build a number

29
00:01:59,364 --> 00:02:03,270
of steps, one on top of the other going forward that just reaches the gold cup.

30
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:06,486
Here's what things will look like when you're done. Don't build any more steps

31
00:02:06,486 --> 00:02:10,198
than are necessary or we'll charge you for extra time and materials, plus you

32
00:02:10,198 --> 00:02:14,050
won't pass the problem. I recommend that you first play around with the position

33
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:17,811
parameter and see its effect on the model. Setting the position to zero shows

34
00:02:17,811 --> 00:02:21,764
what the block looks like centered at the origin. You should also consider using

35
00:02:21,764 --> 00:02:25,854
a loop as its a lot easier in the long run than brute force. Being a smart

36
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:29,668
programmer can save you a lot of groundwork. Using programs to generate geometry

37
00:02:29,668 --> 00:02:33,560
such as a number of stairs is called procedural modeling. Personally, I'm pretty

38
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:36,949
bad at using modelers so I like modeling this way. It's great that with a few

39
00:02:36,949 --> 00:02:41,026
lines of code you can generate pretty complex models. Here's a procedural model

40
00:02:41,026 --> 00:02:45,148
called sphere flake that made more than 25 years ago. Around the same time Pixar

41
00:02:45,148 --> 00:02:49,328
created a short film called Red's Dream. Primarily using procedural modelling,

42
00:02:49,328 --> 00:02:52,925
since there simply weren't great modelling tools easily available back then. See

43
00:02:52,925 --> 00:02:56,390
the additional course materials to download the program for this model and

44
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:59,855
others, along with pointers to many of the related resources, but don't get

45
00:02:59,855 --> 00:03:02,613
distracted right now. Go ahead and build the steps.
