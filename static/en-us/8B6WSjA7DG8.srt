1
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:03,167
So now I really went to art school. I

2
00:00:03,167 --> 00:00:06,366
thank Amy for the Greece drawing. So what does it

3
00:00:06,366 --> 00:00:08,300
take to make a network like this work? So

4
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:11,470
let's suppose we wanted to send a message from Rhodes

5
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:16,440
to Sparta, and we have many points along the

6
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,010
way where we can send smoke signals. So we'd start

7
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:21,510
by sending a smoke signal from Rhodes. This would be

8
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:26,620
visible from a few other points. And to reach Sparta,

9
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:28,890
the one at Noxos would need to resend it,

10
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:33,700
would need to also submit it as smoke signal

11
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:37,210
that would be visible at some other points. The

12
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:39,950
one at Melos would need to see it and

13
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:44,360
resend it. And maybe that's already visible at Sparta.

14
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,740
So we need several different things in order to

15
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:49,260
make a network like this work. The first thing

16
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:51,690
we need is a way to encode messages. We need

17
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:53,910
to be able to convert the message that we want

18
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:56,900
to send, say it's a message that says the Trojans are

19
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:00,090
arriving. We needed to be able to send that message and

20
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:03,580
encode that in a smoke signal. We need a way to

21
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:06,130
do routing. We need to figure out where the message should

22
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:08,350
go. If we want to send it to Sparta, we need to

23
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:12,980
know that it should be forwarded by these nodes. The node

24
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:16,790
that sees it from Miletus does not need to resend it.

25
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:19,890
Probably the way the ancient Greek network worked, all the

26
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:23,290
nodes resent every message. They didn't have a way to do

27
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:27,390
routing selectively. But that's very wasteful. What we'd like is

28
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:30,020
a way to only send the message to the destination it

29
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:32,580
goes to. For the kinds of messages the ancient Greeks

30
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:36,080
were sending that says things like the enemy's arriving, well, it

31
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,720
was okay. You wanted to send it everywhere, that's called

32
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,950
flooding the net. But if we want to send messages just

33
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:45,185
between two points, we've got to know which nodes should

34
00:01:45,185 --> 00:01:48,960
resend the message or which direction to send it in. And

35
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,080
the final thing we need to worry about is, we need

36
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,950
to decide who gets to use the network. So it might

37
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:56,810
be that there are more than one enemy arriving at once

38
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:59,340
or maybe, the enemy is arriving, it might be at the

39
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:03,510
same time. Achilles, say Achilles is in Mellitus, and he wants

40
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:07,210
to send a message back to Medea in Delphi. So maybe

41
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:10,630
Achilles wants to send a message that would go like this at

42
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:14,370
the same time as the army needing to send this important message

43
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:17,810
that's saying the Trojans are arriving. So we need to figure out

44
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:20,840
who gets to use the network and what they get to send.

45
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,490
So, these are all things the ancient Greek network would have had

46
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:26,590
to deal with if it was sophisticated enough to worry about them.

47
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:28,680
If it was just sending the message that says the troops are

48
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:32,960
arriving, well, that's one smoke signal and it didn't necessarily need that.

49
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,700
All of these are the same things that we need to

50
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:39,480
worry about if we want to send messages on the internet. So

51
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,726
these are the things that we need to make any network.

52
00:02:41,726 --> 00:02:44,200
We need some way to take the messages that we want to

53
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,630
send and encode them in a way that they can be

54
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:50,446
transmitted, and interpret them when they get to that other end. For

55
00:02:50,446 --> 00:02:54,538
the Greeks, the message was something like, Agamemnon is arriving, get the

56
00:02:54,538 --> 00:02:58,080
ships to a safe place. And they needed to encode that in

57
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,450
a smoke signal. We need a way to route messages.

58
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:05,790
We need a way for the receiver of this smoke

59
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:08,310
signal to know the next place to send it. And

60
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:12,490
for the Ancient Greek network, since smoke signals are not directional,

61
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:14,870
they just go up in the air, there wasn't much

62
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:16,930
to do here. Everyone could see the message and they

63
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:19,420
wanted to send the message everywhere. If we want to send

64
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:23,430
messages just between two points, this becomes a much tougher problem.

65
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:26,540
We need rules for deciding who gets to use resources.

66
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:29,160
If there are two messages that want to go through the

67
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,810
same place, well, only one of those can be sent at

68
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:34,490
a time. We need some way to decide when. For the

69
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:37,220
Greeks, well, I don't know what their rules were, but let's

70
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:40,920
assume their rule was, if you're a general, your message has

71
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:46,650
priority. We needed all these same things for the Internet. Before

72
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:48,650
we talk about how they are done on the Internet, I

73
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:51,630
am going to introduce the two main ways that we measure networks.
