1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:04,420
And in this problem, a would equal 3. Way to go if you got that one correct.

2
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:08,830
Since a varies inversely with b, we want to make sure that we put the b quantity

3
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:13,618
in the denominator. But for c, a varies directly with it. So we want to put that

4
00:00:13,618 --> 00:00:17,272
straight across in the numerator. This is perhaps the trickiest part about

5
00:00:17,272 --> 00:00:20,746
setting up variation problems. And you want to make sure you get it right each

6
00:00:20,746 --> 00:00:24,723
time. Remember, with inverse relationships. They'll appear in opposite

7
00:00:24,723 --> 00:00:29,054
positions, whereas with direct relationships, the variables will appear directly

8
00:00:29,054 --> 00:00:34,409
across from one another. So in my first case, a is 12, b is three, and c is

9
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:38,882
eight. So I plug in those values. In the second case, we don't know the value of

10
00:00:38,882 --> 00:00:43,588
a, so I leave that written as a in the denominator. But I do know that b2 is

11
00:00:43,588 --> 00:00:48,808
equal to six. And c2 is equal to 4. These are the values of b and c in our

12
00:00:48,808 --> 00:00:53,287
second case. Now that we have this equation, we multiply these two fractions

13
00:00:53,287 --> 00:00:58,844
together to get 48 divided by 12. We cross multiply to get 144 equals 48a, and

14
00:00:58,844 --> 00:01:03,374
finally we divide both sides by 48 to get a is equal to 3.
