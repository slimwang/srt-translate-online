1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
What's the time of sunset tomorrow? For sure, we can answer that by simulation.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
We already simulated the motion of the moon around the earth

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and in the similar way, we can simulate the motion of the earth around the sun

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
and the rotation of the earth.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Are dolphins more intelligent than elephants?

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:24,000
To answer this question by simulation which we try our model of how intelligence develops

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
and depends on biology, that is pretty hard to do and may be impossible.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Can neutrinos travel faster than light? That's something that physicists have to measure.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
You could imagine the model that contains more fundamental objects than neutrinos

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
super strings for instance and the neutrinos could be simulated using super strings,

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:52,000
but that's again far from the current state of the art and may be impossible.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Who invented the telephone?

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
To answer that question, you would have to model all of human history inside the computer

14
00:01:00,000 --> 99:59:59,999
That doesn't sound plausible.
