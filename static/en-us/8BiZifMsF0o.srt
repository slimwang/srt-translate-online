00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:04,129
Many problems in artificial
intelligence are exponential in time or

2
00:00:04,129 --> 00:00:06,089
space, or both.

3
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:08,240
In fact, NP hard problems are so

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,970
common in AI that researchers joke,
half seriously,

5
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:17,250
that AI is the study of finding
clever hacks to exponential problems.

6
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:21,480
Often when a clever hack is finally
found, or when computers finally get

7
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,429
fast enough to address that particular
problem successfully, the world

8
00:00:25,429 --> 00:00:29,789
no longer thinks of the problem as one
belonging to artificial intelligence.

9
00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:32,259
How many people think about the system

10
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:35,609
that helps consumers choose
plane flights as an AI?

11
00:00:35,609 --> 00:00:38,829
Or the system that helps determine
when to deploy an airbag on an SUV?

12
00:00:38,829 --> 00:00:40,890
Yet at one point,

13
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:44,000
these types of problems were
considered to be part of AI.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,230
That idea leads me to another
joke definition of AI.

15
00:00:48,229 --> 00:00:52,299
Artificial intelligence consists of all
the NP hard problems that have not yet

16
00:00:52,299 --> 00:00:52,799
been solved.

17
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:58,189
What matters to me are the problems
that the field of AI tackles.

18
00:00:58,189 --> 00:01:01,659
On the way here, I was practicing
this lecture with my taxi driver,

19
00:01:01,659 --> 00:01:06,079
Dilbur, when I realized he was
using AI while we were talking.

20
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:10,569
To get me to Udacity headquarters,
the navigation program on his smartphone

21
00:01:10,569 --> 00:01:14,629
had plotted a path that was better
than the one I would have told him.

22
00:01:14,629 --> 00:01:17,420
And was communicating with him
in a way that he was getting

23
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:18,609
the information as he needed it.

24
00:01:18,609 --> 00:01:22,989
That's what is exciting about AI,
you get a chance to work on

25
00:01:22,989 --> 00:01:25,609
everyday problems that can
improve people's lives.
