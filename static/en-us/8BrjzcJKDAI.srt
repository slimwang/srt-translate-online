1
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:03,400
So we're sitting here with Urs HÃ¶lzle, Senior

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:07,220
Vice President of Infrastructure here at Google. Urs, could

3
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:09,580
you briefly describe your role here at Google

4
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:13,510
and why Google has all of these data centers?

5
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:16,219
>> I am responsible for technical infrastructure at Google

6
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:18,370
and that's the team that builds all the data

7
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:23,250
centers, network servers, software systems that runs our internal

8
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:26,490
cloud and we built that a long time ago

9
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:28,220
for our own needs. And we have very large

10
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:31,820
scale applications and so we needed a very capable cloud.

11
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:35,130
And now we're making that cloud available to everyone

12
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:40,070
through App Engine, Compute Engine, and our Cloud Platform overall.

13
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:43,358
>> Urs, so what excites you about Google Cloud Platform and

14
00:00:43,358 --> 00:00:47,570
App Engine in particular, which is the focus of this course?

15
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:49,392
>> What's great about the Google Cloud Platform

16
00:00:49,392 --> 00:00:52,060
is, is really, one, that we can make our

17
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:56,430
great internal infrastructure accessible to every developer out there.

18
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:59,170
And then, in the Cloud Platform, App Engine is

19
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:02,220
really the, that, that one system that makes it

20
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:05,379
really easier for you to start very small. And then

21
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:09,560
scale to a very large user base. So that

22
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,990
if you have a game that suddenly becomes popular,

23
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:14,970
our back-end and our front-end is going to scale with

24
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:17,190
you. And you don't really have to change your application

25
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:20,080
very much. And that's rare to see in infrastructure. Usually

26
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,310
you have to do the hard work up front. Now, with

27
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:24,440
App Engine, you kind of don't really have to do the

28
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:26,660
hard work at all because we can do it for you.
