1
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:03,890
The next model we're going to discuss, is the Yerkes-Dodson Law. So the

2
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:08,974
Yerke-Dodson Law states that moderate levels of arousal, lead to optimal

3
00:00:08,974 --> 00:00:13,110
performance. So think back to our lesson on consciousness, where we talked

4
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:17,490
about our levels of awareness. At one side of the continuum, we were

5
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:22,422
unconscious, so in a coma, and we had zero awareness. And at the other end of

6
00:00:22,422 --> 00:00:26,454
the continuum. We are fully awake and aware. So, the idea here is somewhat

7
00:00:26,454 --> 00:00:31,151
similar. Except, instead of having awareness on a continuum, we have our level

8
00:00:31,151 --> 00:00:36,447
of arousal on a continuum. Like you see here, we go from low levels of arousal

9
00:00:36,447 --> 00:00:41,080
to high levels of arousal. And we also have quality of performance from low to

10
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:45,836
high. So the idea here, is that we prefer to be in situations that are neither

11
00:00:45,836 --> 00:00:50,469
over-stimulating or under-stimulating. For example, over here when you're

12
00:00:50,469 --> 00:00:55,260
highly aroused, you'd be panicked. And you probably wouldn't perform very well.

13
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,612
And around here you'd probably have a lot of anxiety and again, your

14
00:00:57,612 --> 00:01:01,600
performance wouldn't be that great. And a little higher up, we'd see stress

15
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,620
where often the level of performance would still be decreasing when we're under

16
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:11,520
stress, but we are highly aroused. Here we'd be mildly aware. You're awake, but

17
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,381
not really into whatever we're doing. A little farther down, we'd see boredom

18
00:01:15,381 --> 00:01:20,400
and finally towards the bottom is where we'd find sleep. So we really want to

19
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:25,384
be in this central area, for the optimal level of performance. We see these as

20
00:01:25,384 --> 00:01:28,910
important not only for things like academics. This could even be like for

21
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:32,193
playing sports. So say you're playing hockey or soccer. You don't want to have

22
00:01:32,193 --> 00:01:35,231
too high of a level of arousal because then you're going to be panicked to have

23
00:01:35,231 --> 00:01:40,208
a lot of anxiety. Which will decrease your performance. But, you also don't

24
00:01:40,208 --> 00:01:44,890
want to be really bored or kind of tired and not really there. You want to be

25
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:48,120
in this middle zone. That way, you can perform your very best.
