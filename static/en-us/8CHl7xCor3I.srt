1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:04,750
This was our final answer. Excellent work if you found it. We start by finding

2
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:08,290
the lowest common denominator, which means that we have to factor this

3
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:12,871
denominator and this one first. Factors of 24 that sum to positive 10 are

4
00:00:12,871 --> 00:00:18,613
positive 6 and positive 4, while the factors of negative 12 that sum to positive

5
00:00:18,613 --> 00:00:24,246
1 are positive 4 and negative 3. This means that our lowest common denominator

6
00:00:24,246 --> 00:00:28,644
would be y plus 6 times y plus 4 times y minus 3. Next, we multiply each

7
00:00:28,644 --> 00:00:33,197
fraction by the missing factors of our lowest common denominator. For the first

8
00:00:33,197 --> 00:00:38,441
denominator, it's missing the factor y minus 3. So we multiply the numerator and

9
00:00:38,441 --> 00:00:43,274
denominator by y minus 3, since we're really just multiplying by 1. For the

10
00:00:43,274 --> 00:00:47,872
second fraction, we need to multiply by y plus 6 divided by y plus 6. When we

11
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:52,492
multiply each of these fractions by a form of 1, we get two new equivalent

12
00:00:52,492 --> 00:00:58,510
fractions. We multiply these two numerators together, or these two binomials

13
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:03,740
together, to get y squared minus 6y plus 9. And then here again, we multiply

14
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:08,630
these two binomials together to get y squared plus 12y plus 36. We multiply

15
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:12,768
these out, since we're adding our numerators in the end. The denominators,

16
00:01:12,768 --> 00:01:17,276
however, we can just leave in factored form since these won't change. When we

17
00:01:17,276 --> 00:01:22,622
add the like terms of our numerators together, we get 2y squared from 1y squared

18
00:01:22,622 --> 00:01:29,155
and 1y squared. We get positive 6y, from negative 6y and positive 12y. And we

19
00:01:29,155 --> 00:01:34,550
get 45 from positive 9 and positive 36. And finally, we want to check to see if

20
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:38,208
this is factorable, to see if we can cancel a factor in the numerator and

21
00:01:38,208 --> 00:01:43,952
denominator. We find factors of 90 that sum to positive 6. When I look at the

22
00:01:43,952 --> 00:01:48,299
positive factors of 90, these are the factor pairs. None of these add to

23
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:52,839
positive 6. So I know this numerator is not factorable. Since we cant factor

24
00:01:52,839 --> 00:01:57,650
this numerator, we actually have our final answer. None of these add to positive

25
00:01:57,650 --> 00:01:57,813
6.
