1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:03,060
Location and
context are vitally important for

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:05,340
building the best possible mobile app.

3
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:08,780
The mobile nature of the platform is
that it is designed to be operated

4
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:12,410
anywhere, from sitting on a bus,
to sitting in your office, or beyond.

5
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:17,840
As such, the behavior of your app may
need to change based on your location.

6
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,440
For example, for a weather app such as
Sunshine, that you might have worked on

7
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:24,400
in the developing Android
app scores here at Udacity.

8
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,920
Should you really have to
type in your current zip code

9
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,530
in order to get a forecast?

10
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:30,820
Shouldn't the phone know where you are?

11
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:33,790
Indeed, if you take a look at
Android Fundamentals Part Two,

12
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:35,810
you'll learn how to do just that.

13
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:37,670
Or, for example, a music app.

14
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:40,650
It's usually great to have a detailed
UI that allows you to search for

15
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:43,240
your music, but
what happens when you're driving?

16
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:47,290
Shouldn't there be a less distracting
UI or perhaps voice operation?

17
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:51,140
In these scenarios, along with countless
others, how your device should behave

18
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:54,510
is determined by the location and
context of your phone.

19
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:57,800
You'll learn about the powerful APIs
that allow you to determine this

20
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:00,620
information for
your phone in a battery friendly way.
