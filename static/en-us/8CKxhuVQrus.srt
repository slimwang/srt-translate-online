1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
The exact same algorithm works beautifully for planning the shortest path

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
to a single mission goal from any possible start location,

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
and the only difference here is in this graph over here of an actual road graph

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
we are also incorporating the heading direction as measure of distance.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Green corresponds to nearby to large values, red to far away.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
The reason why the area below the mission goal is green is because we expect

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
the car to point up, to point north, at the time it reached the mission.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
So if it came from the north, it would point in the wrong direction.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
The state space is augmented correspondingly.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Where if it comes from over here, it points in the correct direction.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
If you look at the circle over here, it's interesting.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
If we came from the left side over here, it could do a right turn,

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
but over here it's forced on this one-way circle to do the entire loop to go around,

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
and that increases the value as it comes over here.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
This is value iteration applied to the road graph where we keep track of heading

16
00:01:03,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and where the circle over here is a one-way circle.
