1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,420
Alright Michael. Tell me the answer. Lets go across.

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:08,740
>> Alright. Across. So. The first row it's all left, left,

3
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:11,830
but the second left doesn't matter because that's in state four. Oh

4
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:15,230
it might matter. I take it back. So left, left you

5
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:21,280
did was seven. Left and then, player two goes to medium, middle.

6
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:21,740
>> Middle.

7
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:24,080
>> That would be three, so then the pay off is three.

8
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:24,700
>> Mm hm.

9
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:25,660
>> If

10
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:30,580
the first player does left, left and the second player does right, right;

11
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:34,940
then we're going to go left, right, left again, or for a minus one.

12
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:38,510
>> Mm hm. Oh wait, hang on. Left, right,

13
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:42,200
left. Yes, huh, yeah. The next row should be

14
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,210
exactly the same as this one, except for in

15
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:46,860
that third case. So it should be seven, three.

16
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,820
And the r, the difference there. The r in four

17
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:54,790
only matters in this case where we've gone to the

18
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:58,624
right state in [INAUDIBLE], sorry, right action from state two.

19
00:00:58,624 --> 00:01:01,490
And so that should give us a plus four, so four.

20
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:02,050
>> Correct so far.

21
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:05,150
>> All right half way there, so, all right now, now, we've

22
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:07,980
got something different so now player one is going to the right,

23
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:12,410
so now actually player one's choice in state four never matters, so

24
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:14,410
the next two rows are going to be identical to each other.

25
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:18,604
And so in the first case, oh, actually

26
00:01:18,604 --> 00:01:21,080
[LAUGH] all of these numbers are going to be

27
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,850
identical to each other, so player one goes

28
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:26,020
right, player. Or, sorry, player A goes right, player

29
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:28,290
B has to go right. There's no choice.

30
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:30,646
So we're going to get 2s, no matter what now,

31
00:01:30,646 --> 00:01:32,878
so it's going to be two, two, two, and then

32
00:01:32,878 --> 00:01:35,470
the second row will repeat that two, two, two.

33
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:37,940
>> Okay. So there you go. Michael, you are correct. You can feel very

34
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:41,430
good about yourself. Very good, very good. So you're right, Michael, we do have

35
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:42,790
we do have this nice little matrix and we

36
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:44,760
have these numbers, and you know what's really interesting about

37
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,870
this? That we can figure out what the payoffs

38
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:49,070
are for B without having to do any additional work.

39
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:52,250
>> That's true. But it's even more interesting than that. Which is, now that

40
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:54,350
I've written down this matrix, nothing else

41
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:58,070
matters. This whole tree, all these rules.

42
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:00,120
>> None of it matters. It's irrelevant.

43
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,310
>> Wait, wait, but. Okay.

44
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:07,340
>> Because everything about the game is captured here in this matrix.

45
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:08,710
This is actually called the matrix form of the

46
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:11,450
game, and it comprises everything you need to know about

47
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:14,080
it. It doesn't matter ha, what it means to go

48
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,140
left or right or what it means to go middle

49
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:19,350
or whatever. The point is by following this strategy and

50
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:22,160
this strategy, you end up with seven for a. This

51
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,880
strategy and this strategy, you end up with two for

52
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,710
a, period. And how you got there does not matter.

53
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:28,990
>> But it does creep me out a little bit that

54
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:31,570
what your saying is that all that matters is the matrix.

55
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:32,400
>> You know

56
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,690
we should write a movie about that.

57
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:35,860
>> I think it's been done and it's scary.

58
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:37,430
>> Well, not the first one.

59
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:39,710
>> It was kind of scary. Like people are

60
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:42,720
trapped in this big box and their slurpyness.

61
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,890
>> But their happy.

62
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:45,370
>> But they don't know their happy.

63
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:47,630
>> What do you mean they don't know their happy?

64
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:48,924
>> [LAUGH]

65
00:02:48,924 --> 00:02:51,560
>> What is means to be, Michael, Michael, Michael.

66
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,100
>> Speaking of which now how do we, how do

67
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:56,030
we figure out. What do we do with this now?

68
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:57,300
>> So that's the big question right?

69
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:00,000
So, what was the whole point of doing reinforcement learning? The whole point

70
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,980
of doing reinforcement learning was to

71
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:05,460
optimize your long term expected reward right?

72
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:06,080
>> Yeah.

73
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,700
>> And so you pick the policy that would get you to the best place

74
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:14,470
possible, so here's a question I have for you. Give that this is everything we

75
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:18,370
need to know, this little matrix of values. These are all the policies A could

76
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:20,130
choose from. We're calling them strategies here.

77
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:22,560
But, you know, strategies, policies. There are four

78
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,590
A can choose from. And there are three B can

79
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:28,720
choose from. What will you think A and B actually do?

80
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:33,620
>> Okay, so, you know? A wants the rewards to be high.

81
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:38,780
So, seven is the highest, so A should choose the upper left corner.

82
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:40,350
>> But A can't choose the upper left corner.

83
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:41,130
>> Why?

84
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:44,770
>> A can only choose a strategy. B gets to choose some strategy.

85
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:47,760
>> I see. So A is choosing the row and then B

86
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,740
gets to choose the column.

87
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:48,830
>> Yeah.

88
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:51,410
>> So then B should choose that also because that's what A wants.

89
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:55,620
>> No, B wants to maximize what B gets. And remember, B always gets the

90
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:58,687
opposite of A because. Because it's a two-player,

91
00:03:58,687 --> 00:04:02,390
zero-sum, finite game of perfect information, deterministic something.

92
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:05,780
>> So, so you're saying that if we, if A chooses the first row.

93
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:06,180
>> Say. Mm-hm.

94
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:09,640
>> Which is the left, left strategy, and B now has

95
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:13,340
a choice between three values and will choose the one that

96
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:15,450
is worst for A, which would be the minus

97
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:16,990
1, so that would be a terrible thing to do.

98
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:17,610
>> Yep.

99
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:25,950
>> Okay then, so then what if A chooses the second row?

100
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:27,640
>> Okay if A chooses the second row?

101
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:32,050
>> So now again B is not going to let them have that seven which is kind of

102
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:35,430
sad, but still cant make it to bad for

103
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:39,180
A so B would choose the middle right. Strategy.

104
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:39,210
>> Mm-hm.

105
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:41,920
>> And then get, and then that would be a 3 for A, a minus 3

106
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:45,930
for B. But wait, hang on. So that was done thinking of it as A move,

107
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:47,710
A kind of making the choice first.

108
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:48,683
>> Mm-hm.

109
00:04:48,683 --> 00:04:49,650
>> That doesn't seem fair.

110
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:51,080
>> Okay, well then do it the other way.

111
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:54,460
>> Alright, so if B chooses first, then B could choose

112
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:57,520
the far right column because that's where the minus 1 is.

113
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:57,845
>> Mm-hm.

114
00:04:57,845 --> 00:05:00,190
>> That's where it's going to be happiest. See,

115
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:02,160
B seems kind of, kind of mean. It's like

116
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,000
it's happiest when others are suffering. Well, but

117
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,090
A is also happiest when others are suffering.

118
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:11,190
>> I see. So, if B chooses that column

119
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:15,020
then A wants to choose the second row and get the four, so

120
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:18,830
B could choose the middle column, which then A would choose the two.

121
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:21,860
>> A would choose what?

122
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:23,700
>> One of the twos. One of the bottom two rows.

123
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:24,450
>> No he wouldn't.

124
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:27,810
>> Oh, right. A is trying to maximize, so A would choose

125
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:29,620
one of the top two rows. Oh, yeah, that makes more sense.

126
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:29,940
>> Right.

127
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:33,730
>> Then choose a three which is better for B

128
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:36,340
than having chosen the far right, and B could choose

129
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:38,680
the far left column, but then A would choose one

130
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,760
of the sevens, and B would be unhappy with that.

131
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:43,670
So we'd end up with B choosing the middle column

132
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:47,540
and A either choosing the top or the second row. Mhm.

133
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:50,120
>> So that's kind of the same answer we got the other way.

134
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:50,640
>> Yep.

135
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,360
>> Huh.

136
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,160
>> That's exactly right.

137
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,160
>> And is that, was that just luck, or

138
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,110
did you make this example to make that happen?

139
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:58,520
>> No, I didn't make this example to make that happen.

140
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:01,700
In fact, the process you went through is exactly the process

141
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:04,510
you would expect to go through, and you will always end up with the, with the

142
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:08,150
same answer. For a two player zero sum

143
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:11,760
game. You know, deterministic, finite, all those other words.

144
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,225
>> [LAUGH]

145
00:06:13,225 --> 00:06:16,040
>> The process you just went through, is exactly the

146
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,780
process you would expect to go through. So let's see

147
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:18,980
if we can, if we can be a little bit

148
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:22,570
more, you know, explicit about the process you went through.
