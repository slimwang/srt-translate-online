1
00:00:00,877 --> 00:00:03,121
Once you have the content
down on your resume,

2
00:00:03,121 --> 00:00:05,030
it's time to do some quality control.

3
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:06,051
Make sure it looks nice.

4
00:00:06,051 --> 00:00:09,541
There are a lot of templates online
which are linked to in the classroom and

5
00:00:09,541 --> 00:00:12,315
available in the career resource
center that you can use.

6
00:00:12,316 --> 00:00:13,222
You can also design your own.

7
00:00:13,221 --> 00:00:19,670
A nice resume design lets the reader
focus on the content of the resume.

8
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:23,707
When there are inconsistencies, such
as misalignment, and weird colors, or

9
00:00:23,707 --> 00:00:27,806
formatting, the reader's eye is instead
focused on these design errors rather

10
00:00:27,806 --> 00:00:29,452
than on the words on the resume.

11
00:00:29,452 --> 00:00:33,442
The same logic goes to making
sure your links are clickable and

12
00:00:33,442 --> 00:00:35,443
there are no spelling errors.

13
00:00:35,444 --> 00:00:35,926
Typos and

14
00:00:35,926 --> 00:00:39,852
design errors give the impression that
you don't have attention to detail.

15
00:00:39,851 --> 00:00:43,387
And you never want an employer
to think you don't pay attention

16
00:00:43,387 --> 00:00:44,595
to the small things.

17
00:00:44,595 --> 00:00:49,330
Submitting a resume as a PDF will ensure
your formatting is preserved regardless

18
00:00:49,331 --> 00:00:50,803
of the document reader.

19
00:00:50,802 --> 00:00:53,967
Make sure your resume is one page.

20
00:00:53,968 --> 00:00:56,579
Employers will not read
past the first page, so

21
00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:00,380
if you have anything important on
a second page, it will be ignored.

22
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:04,468
There are certain cases where a job
candidate can have a second page on

23
00:01:04,468 --> 00:01:09,347
their resume because they have years and
years of relevant industry experience.

24
00:01:09,346 --> 00:01:11,618
If you don't have that
extensive experience,

25
00:01:11,618 --> 00:01:13,046
keep your resume to one page.

26
00:01:13,046 --> 00:01:15,841
The best way to know if your
resume design is good and

27
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,896
that you don't have any errors
is to have other people,

28
00:01:18,896 --> 00:01:22,739
such as your friends and family,
read it and give their perspective.
