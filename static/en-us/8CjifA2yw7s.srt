1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:04,910
And one policy, that tries to more
closely approximate the PLRU is the so

2
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:07,740
called pseudo PLRU policy.

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,020
So it's really trying to
approximate the PLRU but

4
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:12,600
sometimes it doesn't exactly match it.

5
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:15,610
So let's look at an eight
way set associative cache.

6
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:19,610
And with a pseudo LRU policy
what we keep is one bit.

7
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:23,390
Per line in the set, so
in an eight place set associative cache,

8
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:27,810
we will have a one bit
associated with each line

9
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:32,570
as opposed to three bits that we
would need for our LRU counting.

10
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:34,750
So how does pseudo LRV work?

11
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:38,450
All of the bits start at zero and
what we will do is,

12
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:42,790
every time a line is accessed,
we will set its bit to one.

13
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:43,370
So for example,

14
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:47,570
this one becomes one, this one becomes
one, then this one becomes one.

15
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:52,870
As long as there is at least one
zero bit here, we keep doing this.

16
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:54,950
And if we ever need
to replace something,

17
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:57,990
we pick among the blocks
whose bits are zero.

18
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:01,900
So all the recently accessed blocks
will have the bits at one and

19
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:03,990
thus safe from replacement.

20
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:07,750
Eventually, however, if we have
a lot of hits, so for example,

21
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:12,860
in this particular state, we will pick
the least recently used block because it

22
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:15,010
is the only one that has a zero bit.

23
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:17,920
Eventually however,
all of the bits will be set.

24
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,000
So evnetually we will
have this become one.

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,220
And now, we cannot replace anything.

26
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:27,870
So we detect the situation where
all the bits have become one.

27
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:34,600
And when we set the last zero bit to
one, we zero out the remaining bits.

28
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,740
So now,

29
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:40,910
we have state that is similar to what
not most recently use would tell us.

30
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:43,880
We only know what was
the most recently used block.

31
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:44,930
For the rest of them,

32
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:47,950
we need to pick it randomly if
something needs to be placed.

33
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:52,570
But as we start accessing some other
blocks, we get a better idea of

34
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:55,730
which ones are the more, and
which ones are less recently used.

35
00:01:55,730 --> 00:02:00,110
So at any given point in time the pseudo
LRV policy is somewhere between

36
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:02,790
the NMRU and the LRU policy.

37
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:06,010
We have seen that when one bit is set

38
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:10,090
we are effectively
implementing the NMRU policy.

39
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:11,949
When more than one bit is set.

40
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:17,070
But not,
almost all of them were in between and

41
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:21,540
when all but one are set,
we're implementing the true LRU policy

42
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:25,570
because we know exactly which one
block is the least recently used.

43
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:30,405
So, this policy behaves
somewhere in between LRU and

44
00:02:30,405 --> 00:02:33,820
NMRU in exchange for using more bits.

45
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,360
But it's also very
simple because on a hit,

46
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:40,320
all we have to do is set the bit
that corresponds to the block.

47
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,960
Which can be done very quickly and
efficiently.

48
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:47,980
So as far as activity on a cache hit
is concerned, both pseudo LRU and

49
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:51,730
NMRU have much less activity than LRU,

50
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:54,870
which helps us with both power and
also hit time on the cache.
