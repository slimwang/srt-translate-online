1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,510
Now that we know each phase must
increase the length of the shortest

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:05,870
augmenting path by at least two.

3
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:08,850
We are now ready to bound
the number of phases.

4
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:12,450
Specifically, the number of
phases used by Hopcroft- karp

5
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:14,720
is Order square root of V.

6
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:17,800
Note that the trivial bound saying
that there can be only one phase

7
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:21,000
per possible augmenting path
link isn't good enough.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,260
That would still leave us
with an order V bound.

9
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:28,840
In reality, we will have a phase for
length 1, for length 3, probably for

10
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:32,880
length 5, maybe not for
length 7, and so forth.

11
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,360
But as we consider greater and

12
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:37,370
greater possible phase lengths,
the ones for which for

13
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:41,670
which we will actually have augmenting
phases gets sparser and sparser.

14
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:47,340
The key argument will be that after
roughly square root of V phases,

15
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:50,500
the path length will be at
least square root of V.

16
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:53,900
And that then will imply that we only
have square root of V phases left.

17
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:55,950
To fill out the argument,

18
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:59,440
we'll let M prime be the matching
found by Hopcroft- karp.

19
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:03,470
And we'll let M be the matching after
the ceiling of the square root of the V

20
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:04,840
phases.

21
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:07,850
Because each phase increased
the shortest augmenting path by 2,

22
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:11,670
the length of the shortest
augmenting path in M

23
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:15,017
is at least twice the square
root of V plus 1.

24
00:01:15,017 --> 00:01:18,620
And hence, no path in the symmetric
difference between M and

25
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:24,130
M prime that is augmenting for
M can have shorter length.

26
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:28,270
This implies that they're at most the
size of V divided by this shortest path

27
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:33,360
length, augmenting paths for
M in this symmetric difference here.

28
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,270
We just run out of vertices,

29
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:39,810
there aren't enough left to fill
out any more paths than this.

30
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:43,250
And if there can be only so
many augmenting paths in the difference,

31
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:46,960
then M can't be too
far away from M prime.

32
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,150
Certainly, at most the square root of V.

33
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:54,810
Hence, M will only be augmented
square root of V more times,

34
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:59,030
meaning that there can't be more than
the square root of V more phases.

35
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:03,910
We have square root of V phases to make
all the augmenting paths long enough.

36
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:08,270
So that there can be only square root
of V possible more augmentations,

37
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:10,449
and that completes the theorem.

38
00:02:10,449 --> 00:02:14,450
Overall then, we've just shown that
Hopcroft- karp finds a maximum matching

39
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:16,760
in time Order E times
the square root of V.

40
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,600
We only had square root of V phases.

41
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:24,150
And each phase, because of the clever
way we were able to reuse the level

42
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:27,620
graph, only ends up using Order E time.

43
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:29,240
And this result is
actually the best known.
