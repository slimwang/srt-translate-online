1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,400
I think the only correct answer here can be

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:04,000
the last one;

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,250
it's some combination of the above criteria,

4
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:09,100
because there's always counter examples if you just take a single one of them.

5
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:12,640
So for example, if software does something that the user doesn't want,

6
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:15,070
if the software enforces copyright protection,

7
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:17,620
some people might call that malware, actually,

8
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:19,510
but there are of course cases where

9
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:21,780
software does something that the user doesn't want

10
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:23,810
and it's still for a good purpose.

11
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:26,160
Software that deletes files, no way,

12
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,920
because you can delete files on your computer using

13
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,410
the normal delete command,

14
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:32,310
and that is not malware.

15
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:34,740
Gathering information from your computer, not as a stand-alone criterion,

16
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:37,390
because there might be software that you actually want to

17
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:39,230
gather information from your computer.

18
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:41,170
Disrupting other programs;

19
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:43,130
well, sounds like malware, but on the other hand,

20
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:46,540
if for example you have an anti-malware program

21
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:49,480
that disrupts malware, that will definitely disrupt,

22
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:51,840
or hopefully disrupt the computer virus

23
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,680
that is trying to infect your system.

24
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,010
It doesn't have to be malware

25
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:57,160
just because it interrupts other programsl.

26
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,500
Installs without asking; well, with most software

27
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,110
having automated updates,

28
00:01:01,110 --> 99:59:59,999
I don't think that classifies as malware alone.
