1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,290
For this quiz you'll be wrapping
set.Timeout with a Promise.

2
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:06,350
There won't be any error handling yet

3
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:09,440
because I want to keep
this first quiz simple.

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,625
I'm giving you a sample
page to work with,

5
00:00:11,625 --> 00:00:14,990
and inside of it you'll find
a function called wait.

6
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:19,229
Wait should simply wait a set number
of milliseconds before resolving.

7
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:23,950
That means that you'll need to
call resolve when setTimeout

8
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:26,000
executes its callback.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,480
While you're working on this function,

10
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:31,670
I want you to console.log(this)
inside the Promise.

11
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:33,680
The reason is that I have a question for

12
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:39,150
you about the scope of this inside
Promises when you finish working on it.

13
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:43,056
I also want you to return
the Promise from wait.

14
00:00:43,056 --> 00:00:45,792
The reason is that,
after you finish your work,

15
00:00:45,792 --> 00:00:49,342
you will be able to uncomment
these two lines to test your code.

16
00:00:49,342 --> 00:00:52,105
If there are no errors,
and this text changes,

17
00:00:52,105 --> 00:00:54,257
you'll know you've done it right.

18
00:00:54,257 --> 00:00:57,450
And like I said, when you're done,
I have a question for you.

19
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:00,960
What is the scope of
this inside the Promise?

20
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,780
Type your answer into this box.

21
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:05,420
Don't forget, you can find
a link to more quiz instructions

22
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:07,090
in the instructor notes, and good luck.
