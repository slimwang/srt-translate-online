00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,200
To solve this and compound inequality, let's solve each and inequality

2
00:00:04,212 --> 00:00:08,720
separately. For the first inequality, we add 4 to both sides, then divide by

3
00:00:08,732 --> 00:00:13,070
negative 3, to isolate x. Remember, we divided by a negative so we need to

4
00:00:13,082 --> 00:00:17,655
reverse the inequality sign. So, for this inequality sign, x needs to be less

5
00:00:17,667 --> 00:00:22,354
than negative 3. For the second inequality, we add 1 to both sides, then we

6
00:00:22,366 --> 00:00:26,323
divide by 5. So x is less than or equal to negative 4. We have an AND

7
00:00:26,335 --> 00:00:30,982
inequality, so I want both of these solutions to be true. x needs to taken a

8
00:00:30,994 --> 00:00:35,773
value that works for this inequality and this inequality. So I want to find the

9
00:00:35,785 --> 00:00:41,236
overlap of these 2 regions. Let's look back at our number lines. Here are two

10
00:00:41,248 --> 00:00:46,041
solution regions. x could be less than or equal to negative 4, or x could be

11
00:00:46,053 --> 00:00:50,773
less than negative 3. We have an and inequality, so we want the region of

12
00:00:50,785 --> 00:00:55,847
overlap. So, it's any number, less than or equal to negative 4. That would be

13
00:00:55,859 --> 00:00:59,213
this number line. Nice job if you got that one right.
