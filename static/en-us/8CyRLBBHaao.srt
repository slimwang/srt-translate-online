00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:03,310
The answer is, purchase tickets. The reason for

2
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:05,939
this, is that when you purchase tickets, you probably

3
00:00:05,939 --> 00:00:08,580
want to immediately see the confirmation that you are

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:11,720
registered. To guarantee this, we need to have strong

5
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:14,200
consistency. And in order to have the term strong

6
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:18,017
consistency, we need to establish an ancestor relationship. The

7
00:00:18,017 --> 00:00:22,150
other two, add social components and conference venus. Are

8
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:24,860
probably not so sensitive to be up to date.

9
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:28,110
So there may not be, any need for strong consistency.

10
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:31,480
So eventual consistency is probably a better choice for those.
