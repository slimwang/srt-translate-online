00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,880
In the forecast fragment class, we modify the

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:08,134
onOptionsItemSelected method. When the Refresh menu item is selected,

3
00:00:08,134 --> 00:00:11,129
we create a new FetchWeatherTask and then we call

4
00:00:11,129 --> 00:00:13,489
execute on it. While the call is no longer

5
00:00:13,489 --> 00:00:16,487
blocking the UI thread because it's an AsyncTask, the

6
00:00:16,487 --> 00:00:19,390
app will still crash. If we check the logs,

7
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:21,920
we see that the app crashed. This time though,

8
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,030
with a security expression. It says Permission denied and

9
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:29,810
ask if you're missing the INTERNET permission or not. And indeed,

10
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:32,670
we are missing the INTERNET permission, so we need to request it.
