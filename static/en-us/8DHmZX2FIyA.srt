00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:03,230
Now there are a number of different
ways to solve this quiz, so

2
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:05,350
don't worry if yours doesn't
match up exactly with mine.

3
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:08,470
I set up the event
tracker function here.

4
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:11,070
Each object keeps track
of a list of events and

5
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:12,580
a list of other objects to notify.

6
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,530
Then I extend the function's prototype.

7
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:18,320
Just like backbones on,

8
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,190
this function add the callback to
the event's list of callbacks.

9
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:23,810
Very similar to on,

10
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:27,410
notify adds a list of objects it
needs to notify for each event.

11
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,220
Trigger loops through all of
the callbacks and invokes them.

12
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:35,180
It also loops through the list of
objects it needs to notify and

13
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:36,010
triggers them too.

14
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:38,680
And that's it.

15
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:40,840
So, an event tracker object
can manage its own events.

16
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:45,270
It can also let other objects register
with them to get notified when an event

17
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:46,490
happens.

18
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:47,050
Pretty neat?
