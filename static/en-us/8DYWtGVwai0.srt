1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,880
You can add jQuery to any website using script tags, like so.

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:09,250
You can host this file on your own server with a path like this one,

3
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:12,960
but it's actually recommended to use a version of jQuery hosted on

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,290
a content delivery network or CDN.

5
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:19,700
CDNs are usually much faster than your own server,

6
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:23,290
plus it allows you to take advantage of the browser's caching feature.

7
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:26,480
jQuery and Google both host jQuery.

8
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,270
Given the sheer number of websites using jQuery, you're definitely safe using

9
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:34,095
either Google or jQuery's official host to host for your production builds.

10
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:39,050
And don't forget to use the minified version of jQuery in production.

11
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:42,260
The minified version of jQuery is considerably smaller, so

12
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:43,940
it's going to lead to faster page loads.
