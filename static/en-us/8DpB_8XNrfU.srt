00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,609
Complementary angles sum to 90 degrees. So, if I know the compliment of 30

2
00:00:04,621 --> 00:00:09,431
degrees is 60 degrees, what do you think the complement of x is? How do we find

3
00:00:09,443 --> 00:00:14,454
the complement of any unknown angle? Write an expression in this box here. Think

4
00:00:14,466 --> 00:00:17,878
about how you found the complement in the last problems.
