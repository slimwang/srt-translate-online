00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:04,750
Here's our final answer. Excellent work if you figured that one out. We know

2
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:09,220
that a square or an exponent of two means that we write this out twice. We're

3
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:13,830
multiplying this binomial by itself. Next we want to distribute 3 root 3 to our

4
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:19,570
second binomial. So for the first term we'll have 3 root three times 3 root 3.

5
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:25,802
For the second term we'll have 3 root 3 times 5. Once we've distributed that 3,

6
00:00:25,802 --> 00:00:30,653
3 now we want to distribute this positive 5, well that positive 5 times 3, 3 or

7
00:00:30,653 --> 00:00:35,504
the 3rd term and positive 5 times positive 5 for a 4th term, we multiply these

8
00:00:35,504 --> 00:00:40,355
two terms together to get 9 times 3, when were at the square root of any number

9
00:00:40,355 --> 00:00:45,129
times itself is just that number For these two terms, we'll 15 root 3, and 15

10
00:00:45,129 --> 00:00:55,462
root 3, and on the end we have a positive 25. We can combine these terms

11
00:00:55,462 --> 00:00:59,890
together, since they both have a radical of square root of 3. So we have 30

12
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:03,902
square roots of 3, 9 times 3 is 27, and I move this 25 over here, so I can add

13
00:01:03,902 --> 00:01:12,430
my like terms together to get the final result. Great thinking if you got here.
