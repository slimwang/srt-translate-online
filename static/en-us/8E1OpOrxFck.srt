1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,960
Fill in the values of this
three player game tree,

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,879
which alternates levels between players.

3
00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:07,839
The values of each
node are in the order,

4
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:12,039
player one score, player two score,
and player three score.

5
00:00:12,039 --> 00:00:14,179
Each agent tries to
maximize their own score,

6
00:00:14,179 --> 00:00:17,489
so we'll propagate up the values
based on which agents move it is.
