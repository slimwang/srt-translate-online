00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:04,200
Here are our solutions. 1.5 times 10 to the 11th meters is the distance from

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:09,069
the earth to the sun. 2.4 times 10 to the 22nd meters is the distance to the

3
00:00:09,069 --> 00:00:14,276
Milky Way's nearest neighboring galaxy, Andromeda. 1.7 times 10 to the 1st

4
00:00:14,276 --> 00:00:19,079
meters is the height of a human. 8.8 times 10 to the 5th meters is the distance

5
00:00:19,079 --> 00:00:23,830
from San Francisco to Paris. And 2 times 10 to the negative 4 meters is the

6
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:25,549
size of an ant.
