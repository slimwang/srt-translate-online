00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:03,400
Okay, you should be getting the idea now that the state charts are quite

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:08,660
powerful. There's lot's to them, like the class, diagrams, you don't have to

3
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:13,830
necessarily use all those features in every diagram that you do. How, in fact,

4
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:18,380
do these state charts relate to the class model diagrams? Well the way to think

5
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:23,700
about it is, that each of the classes. In the class model diagram,

6
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:28,260
has attributes, and those attributes form a state space. But

7
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:32,659
each of the classes in the state diagram could have it's own, state chart. And

8
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:34,810
that doesn't mean you're going to be building state charts for

9
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:39,460
each of the classes because, most of the classes have relatively simple states,

10
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:44,160
and are, perfectly well described by the methods manipulating the attributes of

11
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:49,490
that class. In th state charts, there's references to attributes.

12
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:53,930
Those are the attributes of the class. There's also

13
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:58,840
references to actions and activities, and those are the methods of the class.

14
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:05,489
The events in the state chart diagrams are going to correspond to signals.

15
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:11,350
A signal is a dependency in the class model diagram. You can use a stereotype,

16
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:17,360
in this case the stereotype is send, indicate that the move,

17
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:23,280
movement agent class, is going to send a signal, called the collision signal.

18
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,470
There's a dependency between those two two classes. So what this is saying is

19
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:33,500
that, as you're doing your state chart modeling, you have to make sure,

20
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:37,380
that it's consistent with respect to the class model diagram. That is,

21
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:40,640
the events have to be named, the attribute names have to be,

22
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,990
correct, the method names have to be correct, and so on.
