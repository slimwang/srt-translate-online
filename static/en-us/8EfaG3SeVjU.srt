1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:03,430
So, now we can build levels
that are as large as we want.

2
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:06,380
But it's a bit of a pain that if
we want to check out the bits of

3
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:08,870
the level that are far away
from Gigigal's spawn point,

4
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:12,080
we have to actually walk
Gigigal over there.

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,810
Let's fix that by adding in some debug
camera controls that allow the camera to

6
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:17,310
move independently of Gigigal.

7
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:20,089
We'll also add in a toggle so

8
00:00:20,089 --> 00:00:23,603
that you can snap back the camera
to following Gigagal again.

9
00:00:23,603 --> 00:00:25,670
And then can switch back
to free roaming mode.

10
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:30,630
Check out the to do's in the course code
to add in some debug camera controls.
