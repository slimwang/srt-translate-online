00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,290
In this section we'll move on to simple storm topology submission.

2
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:08,080
Well, you'll submit the program that you just built in Maven.

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,600
The topology you just built takes in a TestWordSpout linked to

4
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:14,790
an ExclamationBolt using a shuffleGrouping linked to

5
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:18,080
the same ExclamationBolt using another shuffleGrouping.

6
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,300
We'll be exploring the design of topologies and

7
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:23,870
the syntax, including groupings, throughout this course.

8
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:28,080
So for now, let's simply submit the storm topology that we just built.

9
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,820
Step one is to view your files by typing ls.

10
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:33,790
And again, all of these directions are in the written directions, and

11
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:36,310
you see the pom.xml file.

12
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:39,270
We'll speak about the POM more in later lessons, but

13
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:41,470
it stands for the project object model.

14
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:45,230
Here's our source files and we see a new class file, target.

15
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:47,930
Again with tree, T-R-E-E, and

16
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:52,760
we see the compiled class including the jar and jar with dependencies.

17
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:55,920
In Storm we will be using the jar with dependencies.

18
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,740
Finally, to submit our first topology,

19
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:01,940
we use this class structure to run our first program.

20
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:06,600
Remember to use the Tab shortcut to help fill in the following command.

21
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,350
Also note the space between storm and

22
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:13,230
jar, and jar and target, and finally target and our ExclamationTopology.

23
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:17,488
And also remember there is no .java after our ExclamationTopology since

24
00:01:17,488 --> 00:01:20,210
we're submitting the compiled class.

25
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:25,030
First type storm jar second target, and

26
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:29,390
again target with a tab we'll find this target directory.

27
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:31,670
Next, we want this jar file.

28
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:37,340
So we can type in udacity tab, and remember that we have two jar files,

29
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:38,570
we actually want.

30
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:41,570
We actually need the jar-with-dependencies, so

31
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:47,460
hit the hyphen, and the hyphen tab will get us the jar-with-dependencies.

32
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:50,780
Finally, we want udacity.storm, and

33
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:55,210
we're going to submit our ExclamationTopology.

34
00:01:55,210 --> 00:02:01,810
Once again, that's udacity.storm.ExclamationTopology.

35
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:04,870
And remember there's no .class when we submit.

36
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:07,950
Hit enter and you'll be running your first storm program.

37
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:10,169
Storm runs for a while and then shuts down.

38
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:11,940
And we can scroll up to see some of the output.

39
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:15,130
We see that there's a word and exclaim1 and exclaim2.

40
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:20,490
And we see that there are names followed by exclamation points.

41
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:22,020
We'll explore this further.

42
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:24,300
But for now, great job on submitting your first Storm program.
