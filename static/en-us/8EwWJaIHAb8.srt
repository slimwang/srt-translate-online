00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,127
No. This equation is not going to cut it. Let's take a peek at the graph to

2
00:00:04,127 --> 00:00:08,820
compare. This is really interesting. Our equation clearly graphs a parabola, and

3
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:12,968
we have numbers in every spot in our quadratic formula, so it looks like we

4
00:00:12,968 --> 00:00:17,447
should be able to get some solutions. The question is what kind of solutions are

5
00:00:17,447 --> 00:00:21,928
they. We can see that the maximum of the graph here is below the X axis. So no

6
00:00:21,928 --> 00:00:26,363
point on this parabola is every going to cross the line Y equals 0. What does it

7
00:00:26,363 --> 00:00:30,664
mean to have a root then? We clearly have some pretty important stuff to talk

8
00:00:30,664 --> 00:00:31,084
about.
