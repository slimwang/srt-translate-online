1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,580
So, so far, we've seen two different types of domain restrictions. Some of them

2
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:09,075
are motivated by common sense, problem solving and real world quantities. So for

3
00:00:09,075 --> 00:00:13,491
example as we saw earlier, Athena needs to design Grant's fun room so that the

4
00:00:13,491 --> 00:00:18,304
dimensions are greater than zero. The other type is domain restrictions that are

5
00:00:18,304 --> 00:00:22,942
motivated by math. So restrictions that we need to impose in order to get only

6
00:00:22,942 --> 00:00:27,234
real or properly defined solutions. So an example of this would be avoiding

7
00:00:27,234 --> 00:00:29,763
taking square roots of negative numbers.
