1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:02,780
So even though things are kind of grim, with regard to

2
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:05,250
solving the general sum games. There are lots of ideas that,

3
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:08,930
that have proven themselves to be pretty useful for addressing this,

4
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:11,570
this class of games. It is not the case that any one

5
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:14,950
of them has, has emerged as the dominant view, but, but

6
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:17,890
these are all really cool ideas. So here's one. You can think

7
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:20,530
about stochastic games as themselves

8
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:22,810
being repeated. So, repeated stochastic games.

9
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:25,347
We're going to play a stochastic game and when it's over, we're going to

10
00:00:25,347 --> 00:00:29,300
play it again. And that allows us to build

11
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:32,159
folk theorem-like ideas at the level of stochastic games.

12
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:32,910
>> Oh, that's cool.

13
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:34,028
>> And so there are some efficient

14
00:00:34,028 --> 00:00:35,880
algorithms for dealing with that. So that's

15
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,820
one idea. Another one is to make

16
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:40,530
use of a little bit of communication side-channel

17
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:46,284
to be able to say, hey, other player. Here's this thing that I'm thinking about.

18
00:00:46,284 --> 00:00:50,364
And it's cheap talk in a sense that, it's nothing that's being said is binding

19
00:00:50,364 --> 00:00:52,224
in any way but it gives the two players

20
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:54,739
the ability to co, to coordinate a little bit.

21
00:00:54,739 --> 00:00:58,219
And you can actually ultimately compute a correlated equilibrium,

22
00:00:58,219 --> 00:01:00,379
which is a, a version of a Nash equilibrium

23
00:01:00,379 --> 00:01:02,659
that you know, requires just a, a little bit

24
00:01:02,659 --> 00:01:05,239
of coordination, but can be much more efficient to

25
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:09,355
compute. And you can actually get a near optimal

26
00:01:09,355 --> 00:01:15,121
approximations of the solution to stochastic games using that idea.

27
00:01:15,121 --> 00:01:15,550
>> Yeah, that's

28
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:17,820
cool. Didn't, didn't I do some work in this space?

29
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,790
>> You did. That's where I got the idea from.

30
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:21,962
>> Oh okay.

31
00:01:21,962 --> 00:01:24,688
>> There's some, some work by Amy Greenwald looking

32
00:01:24,688 --> 00:01:27,646
at how correlated equilibria play into stochastic games and

33
00:01:27,646 --> 00:01:30,372
then your, your student Liam and you developed a,

34
00:01:30,372 --> 00:01:34,450
a really cool algorithm that actually probably approximates, the solutions.

35
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:35,170
>> Nice.

36
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:37,280
>> Another idea that I've heard a lot about lately, that I

37
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,710
really like, is the notion of a cognitive hierarchy. The idea that what

38
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:43,670
you're going to do is instead of trying to solve

39
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:47,140
for an equilibrium, you think about each player as assuming

40
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:50,640
that the other players have somewhat more limited computational

41
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,910
resources than they do. And then taking a best response

42
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:56,840
to what they believe the other players are going

43
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,430
to do. This turns out to be a really good

44
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:00,940
model of how people actually play when, when you

45
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:03,280
ask them to do games like this in the laboratory.

46
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,380
>> Huh.

47
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:05,770
>> Yeah, the good news about this idea is

48
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:07,550
that, because they're best responses, they can

49
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:09,660
be more easily computed. That, that it's more

50
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,930
like, cue learning in MDPs again because you're

51
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:13,980
assuming that the other player is, is fixed.

52
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:15,280
>> Okay. I'll buy that.

53
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,640
>> And, the last idea I want to throw

54
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,760
out is the notion of actually using side

55
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,738
payments so that the players, as they're playing

56
00:02:20,738 --> 00:02:23,270
together, cannot only take joint actions, but they can

57
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:25,510
say, hey, I'll give, I'm going to get a

58
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:27,500
lot, but if we take this action, I'm going to

59
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:30,828
get a lot of reward. I'm going to give some of that reward back to you, and that

60
00:02:30,828 --> 00:02:32,740
will maybe encourage you to take the action that

61
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:34,040
I need you to take so that we'll both

62
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,310
do better. And so there's this lovely theory by

63
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:39,790
a father and son duo that they call coco values.

64
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:44,083
Coco sounds awesome but it stands for Cooperative competitive

65
00:02:44,083 --> 00:02:47,728
values [CROSSTALK] and so it actually balances the zero

66
00:02:47,728 --> 00:02:51,130
sum aspect of games with the mutual benefit aspect

67
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:54,140
of games. So it's, it's, it's a really elegant idea.

68
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:55,870
>> So basically, the problem

69
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:58,560
isn't solved but there are a lot of cool

70
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,710
ideas that are getting us close to solving it.

71
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:03,120
>> That's right. Yeah. So even though the one player and

72
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,450
the zero sum cases are pretty well understood at this point, the

73
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:09,290
general sum case is not as well understood. But there's a

74
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:12,090
lot of really creative ways that people are trying to address it.

75
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:13,310
>> So, that is good news.
