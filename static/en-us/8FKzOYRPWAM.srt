1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:03,480
So the concept of a belief network, sometimes also known

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:07,170
as Bayes Net. Sometimes also known as Bayesian Network. Sometimes

3
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:10,440
also known as a graphical model. And there's other names,

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,371
but it's the same idea over and over again. And

5
00:00:12,371 --> 00:00:14,330
the, and the idea is that what we're going to do

6
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:16,350
is we're going to represent the

7
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:19,870
conditional independence relationships between all

8
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:23,510
the variables in the joint distribution graphically. In terms of

9
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:25,970
of a little picture like this, where there's nodes corresponding

10
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:30,730
to all the variables. And, edges corresponding to dependencies that

11
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:35,010
need to be explicitly represented. So, the way that this

12
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:37,820
works is, what we can do is we can fill

13
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:41,500
in the prior probability of storm, which we can get by

14
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,130
just marginalizing out. So we've, we've already done an exercise

15
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:45,690
like this. So this is a number you should be able

16
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:48,940
to figure out. Then because of vary well, this is

17
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:51,240
also true that that you can figure out what the probability

18
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:54,890
of lightning is, given storm and also given not storm.

19
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:56,930
And these are numbers that you can just get by marginalizing

20
00:00:56,930 --> 00:01:01,230
out. Finally, the probability of thunder, normally you'd have to

21
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:04,870
condition that on both storm and lightning. But as we already

22
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:08,750
talked about, it's actually conditionally independent of storm given lightning.

23
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:11,150
So, all we need to figure out is the probability of

24
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:13,670
thunder given lightning, and the probability of thunder given not

25
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:17,040
lightning. And once we have these, in this case five numbers,

26
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,490
that's enough to work out any probability we want

27
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:24,210
in the joint, just by multiplying corresponding components together.

28
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:29,030
So, what I'd like you to do is actually fill in these boxes as a quiz. And to

29
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:31,220
help you out we copied the numbers over from

30
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:33,935
the previous slides so that you actually have the

31
00:01:33,935 --> 00:01:36,290
[LAUGH] values that you need to fill in this

32
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:37,900
table. because otherwise that would have been kind of mean.
