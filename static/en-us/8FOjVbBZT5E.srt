Now it's your turn to code the Remove Mean Friends method in BlueJ. I'll show

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:07,190
you some working pseudocode, but feel free to try it yourself first, and then

3
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:11,570
come back to look at the pseudocode. We'll create a variable i, which starts at

4
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:16,435
the beginning of the friends list. Now, while i is a valid index of friends, we

5
00:00:16,435 --> 00:00:22,350
either remove the i-th friend or increment i. We remove the ith friend if the

6
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:27,880
ith friend doesn't have this person as a friend. And otherwise we increment i.

00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:31,208
Kai would like you to pay close attention to the answer to this question, even

8
00:00:31,208 --> 00:00:34,964
if you get it right. This algorithm is going to be important again, later in

9
00:00:34,964 --> 00:00:35,830
the course.
