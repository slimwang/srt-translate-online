00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:06,238
To see the Ecommerce data, go to
Conversions > Ecommerce > Overview.

2
00:00:06,238 --> 00:00:10,695
So far, nobody's actually bought
anything in my app so I have no revenue.

3
00:00:10,695 --> 00:00:12,440
Let's look at shopping behavior.

4
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:16,570
Shopping Analysis > Shopping Behavior,
okay, that looks a bit more colorful.

5
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:19,485
I had some sessions where some users,

6
00:00:19,485 --> 00:00:23,715
who are actually all me at this stage,
viewed some products.

7
00:00:23,715 --> 00:00:28,002
Then there was another session where
a user added the product to the cart.

8
00:00:28,002 --> 00:00:30,942
But I still haven't implemented
the checkout code, so

9
00:00:30,942 --> 00:00:36,262
no checkouts, which is confirmed if
I look at the Checkout Behavior page.

10
00:00:36,262 --> 00:00:38,092
Nobody started checkout.

11
00:00:38,092 --> 00:00:40,190
Let's look at Product Performance.

12
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:43,920
I see the product dinner listed, but
it hasn't brought any money in yet.

13
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,304
This report includes products that
got as far as at least being added to

14
00:00:48,304 --> 00:00:48,983
the cart.

15
00:00:48,983 --> 00:00:53,348
If I drill down into the product, I see
a list of the SKUs, which is the same as

16
00:00:53,348 --> 00:00:58,250
product IDs for the products that were
involved in the shopping process.

17
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:02,954
If I set the Secondary dimension
to Ecommerce > Product Variant,

18
00:01:02,954 --> 00:01:06,986
I can see the names of the dinners
as well as the dinner ID.

19
00:01:06,986 --> 00:01:10,380
And feel free to explore what other
Secondary dimensions you can view.
