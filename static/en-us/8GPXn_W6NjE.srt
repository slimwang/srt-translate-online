1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So congratulations!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,000
You've learned about confidence intervals and this is a really cool tool to use

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
when making conclusions from sample data.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
It's much better to say here's the mean and here is how confident I am about

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
indicating the interval than just giving the mean, and you learned that the interval size shrinks

6
00:00:21,000 --> 99:59:59,999
as the sample size increases--so eventually, if you have lots of data, we get more and more confident.
