1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:05,593
So, we just showed that the domain and the range function are both all the real

2
00:00:05,593 --> 00:00:11,190
numbers. But still, from looking at this graph, points B and D seem to stand

3
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:14,976
out. As we saw before, B and D both represent changes in the direction of, of

4
00:00:14,976 --> 00:00:18,496
the slope of the graph. They also kind of look like a peak and a valley. Now,

5
00:00:18,496 --> 00:00:22,863
let's compare this to another kind of peak or valley that we've seen before.

6
00:00:22,863 --> 00:00:26,912
Now, let's say that in addition to this curve, we have a second one on the set

7
00:00:26,912 --> 00:00:30,342
of axes. It's another function, and this time, it's just a parabola, a shape

8
00:00:30,342 --> 00:00:34,454
that we've seen many times before. Now, I'm going to label the vertex on this

9
00:00:34,454 --> 00:00:39,104
parabola, which we know is a special point for it, and I'm going to call that

10
00:00:39,104 --> 00:00:43,226
point G. I've given you four choices to choose from to figure out what is

11
00:00:43,226 --> 00:00:47,450
special about points B, D, and G. Is one of them a global minimum, or a global

12
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:51,891
maximum, or a relative minimum, or a relative maximum? Please pick the proper

13
00:00:51,891 --> 00:00:53,280
letter to go in each box.
