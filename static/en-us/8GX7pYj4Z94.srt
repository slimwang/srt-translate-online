00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:02,140
Your answer should be as follows.

2
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:05,490
Keyboards and
microphones are input devices.

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:08,880
Speakers and
displays are both output devices.

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,970
And all of the remaining devices can
be used both for input and output.

5
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:17,920
In addition to these types of devices,
there are many other types of devices.

6
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,595
And then within each of these categories
there are many concrete examples.

7
00:00:21,595 --> 00:00:22,260
Many different types of microphones.

8
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:28,020
Many different types of speakers or
network interface cards.

9
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:32,150
Operating systems must be designed in
a way that can handle all of these

10
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:36,330
different types of devices efficiently
and in a straightforward manner.
