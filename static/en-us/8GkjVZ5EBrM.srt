1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,140
In the previous quiz questions,

2
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:05,910
you used your intuition to read
through some if else statements.

3
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:09,040
You figured out what different
messages would be printed to the logs

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,870
based on certain conditions.

5
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:13,585
Now let's look into these
statements more formally.

6
00:00:13,585 --> 00:00:16,420
If/else statements are called
control flow statements.

7
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:20,770
It's named this way because instead of
a linear flow of code where one line of

8
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:24,850
code is being executed after another,
the control flow statement actually

9
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:29,490
allows us to jump to different parts of
the code based on certain conditions.

10
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:33,280
So if this condition is true,
meaning the Boolean variable

11
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:38,240
was set to true up here somewhere,
then these statements will be executed.

12
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:40,170
And it will skip this block of code.

13
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:43,970
If this condition is false,
then we execute these lines of code, and

14
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:47,800
then resume the normal linear
flow of code after that.

15
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,560
Looking at our vocab word glossary,

16
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,670
we can look up the phrase
if/else statement.

17
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:54,940
One way to think about this is to
use an analogy of a train track.

18
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:58,370
A train track has a switch so
that given a certain condition,

19
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:00,180
the train will go one way or the other.

20
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:04,510
Similarly in the if/else statement,
if this condition is true,

21
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:06,840
then we'll execute one path of code.

22
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,780
If the statement is false, then we'll
execute a different path of code.

23
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:14,210
And then afterwards, we're going to
resume the normal flow of code.

24
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:17,440
The if statement is the simplest
control flow statement.

25
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,150
Notice the syntax here.

26
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:23,550
We start with the word if, and then we
have parentheses around the condition.

27
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:26,260
And then we have an opening brace, and

28
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:30,680
then a closing brace at the end
of that if block of code.

29
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,820
In this example of a pizza ordering app,

30
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:36,065
if the user wants the order to be
delivered to their home, then we're

31
00:01:36,065 --> 00:01:39,590
going to adjust the price to add five
extra dollars for the delivery charge.

32
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:42,760
Otherwise, if the order is not for
delivery, then we just

33
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:46,420
skip this line of code, and we don't
add the extra charge for delivery.

34
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:48,160
Then in these subsequent lines of code,

35
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:52,108
we can use the totalPrice
variable with the correct value.

36
00:01:52,108 --> 00:01:54,475
Now the if/else statement
is a little more advanced.

37
00:01:54,475 --> 00:01:57,026
If the condition in
the parentheses is true,

38
00:01:57,026 --> 00:01:59,116
then we execute these lines of code.

39
00:01:59,116 --> 00:02:01,880
Then we skip this and
then continue with the rest of the code.

40
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:05,120
So in this game app,
if the user has zero points,

41
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:08,774
then we're going to update
the textView to say Loser.

42
00:02:08,774 --> 00:02:11,570
And we're going to update
the imageView to be a sad face.

43
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:15,922
However, if the condition is false,
the person has, for example, 100 points,

44
00:02:15,922 --> 00:02:18,280
then we're going to skip
this block of code, and

45
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,466
we're going to go down
here to the else case.

46
00:02:20,466 --> 00:02:23,001
We're going to update the textView
to show the word Winner, and

47
00:02:23,001 --> 00:02:25,496
then we're going to update
the imageView to show a happy face.

48
00:02:25,496 --> 00:02:27,656
Then we're going to continue
with these lines of code here.

49
00:02:27,656 --> 00:02:31,642
As you can see, the code inside the if
statement can contain as many lines of

50
00:02:31,642 --> 00:02:34,504
code as we want,
similarly with the else statement.

51
00:02:34,504 --> 00:02:38,890
If we want more than two possible code
paths, we can use an else if statement.

52
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:40,770
You can have as many else
if blocks as you want,

53
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:44,000
and then you could just end
with an else at the very end.

54
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,410
But again, all these else if and
else blocks are optional.

55
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:51,486
In our code here, we can fall into one
of three possible cases depending on

56
00:02:51,486 --> 00:02:54,066
the value of the integer
variable itemCount.

57
00:02:54,066 --> 00:02:58,275
itemCount just represents the number of
items in the shopping cart in our app.

58
00:02:58,275 --> 00:02:59,788
Let's start with the first condition.

59
00:02:59,788 --> 00:03:04,874
If itemCount is 12, then 12 is
greater than 10, so that is true.

60
00:03:04,874 --> 00:03:09,230
And then we would execute the lines
of code within this block of code.

61
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:12,070
We would create a Toast message
that says, You get 20% off, and

62
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:14,580
show it at the bottom of the screen.

63
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:19,090
Since we fell into this case, then we
skip this block and this block, and

64
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:21,480
then we continue with
the rest of the code.

65
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:25,401
What would happen if the shopping
cart only had two items in it?

66
00:03:25,401 --> 00:03:28,686
Well, then itemCount would
not be greater than ten.

67
00:03:28,686 --> 00:03:32,218
So this would be false, and we would
skip this block of code here and

68
00:03:32,218 --> 00:03:34,376
then jump down to the else if statement.

69
00:03:34,376 --> 00:03:37,883
Then we would check if two is
greater than zero, and it is,

70
00:03:37,883 --> 00:03:40,114
so then we would fall into this case.

71
00:03:40,114 --> 00:03:42,868
We would show a Toast message that says,
Thank you.

72
00:03:42,868 --> 00:03:45,610
Since we fell into this case,
we're going to skip this one, and

73
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:48,105
then we can continue with
the rest of the code.

74
00:03:48,105 --> 00:03:50,587
And lastly if our shopping
cart had zero items,

75
00:03:50,587 --> 00:03:54,385
then this condition would be false
because zero is not greater than ten.

76
00:03:54,385 --> 00:03:58,422
This condition would be false because
zero is not greater than zero.

77
00:03:58,422 --> 00:04:01,330
And then we would fall
into this else case here.

78
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:04,250
And we would show a message that says,
You have an empty cart.

79
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:07,610
If you ever need a reminder of
the syntax of any of these statements,

80
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:11,060
you can just check the official
Java documentation.

81
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:14,240
It tells you about the if statement,
and here's an example.

82
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:19,560
And then it also shows you that if
else statement and here's the example.

83
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:23,570
And lastly there is an example
with else if statements.

84
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:25,940
Based on everything that
I've shown you so far,

85
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:31,145
you're probably realizing that Java has
a special use for the words if and else.

86
00:04:31,145 --> 00:04:35,390
They're Java keywords and they're used
to control how the code is executed.

87
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:38,220
So you can't use these
as variable names.

88
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:41,420
From the examples that I showed you, you
also may have started to realize that we

89
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:44,260
put different expressions in
this test condition here.

90
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:47,960
Any expression is valid as long
as evaluates to true or false.

91
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:51,730
So we can put a Boolean variable in
the test condition or, for example,

92
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:53,390
we can compare two values.

93
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:57,995
We can compare two values using any of
these equality and relational operators.

94
00:04:57,995 --> 00:05:00,880
We can test that two images
are equal to each other, or

95
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,400
not equal to each other, or greater or
less than equal to each other.

96
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,570
And here are examples of
different test conditions.
