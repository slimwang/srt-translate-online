1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,680
So what I'm arguing for, is basically that computation photography is

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:07,300
extending any kind of traditional photography, either it be film or

3
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:11,460
digital, and basically, has better specification.

4
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:12,080
Control and

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,180
support for some of the aspects of photography that we've known for a while.

6
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:20,160
For example, dynamic range is excellent on film or traditional cameras, but

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:25,320
now, even with the small handheld cameras, by changing the process on

8
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:30,130
how the sensor and the optics could be changed using a control manner.

9
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:34,280
We can actually generate dynamic range images on our cellphone cameras.

10
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:37,040
Which don't have all of the fancy optics and

11
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,820
controls a traditional camera like this would one, this one would have.

12
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:44,230
Traditional cameras allowed you to do a lot of focus point by

13
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:45,460
point kinds of things.

14
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:46,640
But now we can control them,

15
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:51,122
again, with computation in a much smaller packaging and again to

16
00:00:51,122 --> 00:00:55,120
a lot different types of things directly on board with a non-board computer.

17
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,590
We can play around with, you know, field of view and resolution.

18
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:01,100
Again with a traditional camera or

19
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:04,110
digital camera, you are stuck with it from day one.

20
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:07,490
But, this could be changed approximately and

21
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:10,720
directly on the camera with variety of controls.

22
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,730
Of course similar things like exposure time and

23
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:14,570
frame rate can also be controlled.

24
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:17,900
And these types of control right now are available on most cell

25
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:23,510
phone cameras with camera software associated both on the Androids and IOS.

26
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:25,730
Again, people are using these abilities apps.

27
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:29,600
Another thing that's coming up is burst photography.

28
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,440
Now of course traditional cameras could actually capture a lot of

29
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:36,040
images at one time by just keeping the shutter button down.

30
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:39,900
This kind of stuff is not showing up in your standard cell phone cameras, and

31
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,690
burst photography, and auto gifs are becoming really popular.
