1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:02,110
Okay Charles what do you think?

2
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:03,540
>> About what?

3
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:05,040
>> Let's just go through these.

4
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,620
The ones that don't have names yet
and give them names.

5
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:12,570
Kind of think through what it is
that they are like and label them.

6
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:13,790
>> Okay sure we can do that all right.

7
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:15,900
If the first one is a regular MDP and
and

8
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:19,970
what makes it a regular MDP is
that you're doing an expectation.

9
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:25,390
Over the next best action
that will be taken, right?

10
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:29,380
>> Right,
the best next action I would say.

11
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:31,520
>> Right that's the right
way of saying it.

12
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:33,340
So, here the only difference
between the second one and

13
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:38,340
the first one is that instead of doing
an expectation you're going to only pay

14
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:43,870
attention to the worst possible
state you could get into.

15
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:47,140
>> Mm, okay.

16
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:51,400
So we're taking out the actual
stochastic dynamics of the MDP and

17
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:54,020
replacing it with something
that is minimizing.

18
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:56,150
>> Right and

19
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:59,780
so that means if we were thinking
about the function at the very top,

20
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:04,580
the Q star, is not kind of the value
of taking an action in a particular

21
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:09,750
state given that you are then going to
do the best thing from that point on.

22
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:12,680
But it's sort of the value you would get

23
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:16,165
is you always assumed
the worst thing could happen.

24
00:01:16,165 --> 00:01:16,920
>> Mm-hm.

25
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:20,380
>> And if that were true everywhere,

26
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:25,340
then you would be valuing things
by the worst possible outcome.

27
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:29,180
So that would be a kind of, I don't know
what the right word is, maybe something

28
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:35,450
like a pessimistic MDP, or
a risk-averse MDP, something like that.

29
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:36,510
>> Good.

30
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:38,000
Worst case MDP, maybe.

31
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,330
>> Mm-hm yeah.

32
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:42,390
>> It's also related to,
in control theory,

33
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:44,190
the notion of H infinity control.

34
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:48,840
That H infinity control basically says,
I don't know what's going to happen so

35
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,670
let me assume that the worst
thing's going to happen.

36
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:56,100
>> Okay so pessimistic sort
of describes the outlook

37
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:59,350
on the world of this equation but
is risk averse the right thing?

38
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:03,088
This suggests that I will end up trying
to choose actions that put me places

39
00:02:03,088 --> 00:02:05,155
where the least bad thing could happen.

40
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:11,090
>> Well, I mean,
I wouldn't quite think of it that way.

41
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:13,970
So, it's almost as if
the environment is out to get you.

42
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:17,080
So, instead of just randomly
transitioning you to some state

43
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,710
it's always putting you in a state
that makes you the least happy of all

44
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:20,770
the states that you could go to.

45
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,505
>> Oh, so grad school.

46
00:02:22,505 --> 00:02:26,330
>> [LAUGH] Well,
it depends where you go to grad school.

47
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:28,070
Like, Rhode Island's
a pretty good state.

48
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:31,110
All right, so we're going to be
placed in a state that is worse for

49
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:34,180
us, and once we get there,
then we get to choose an action.

50
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:36,320
We get to choose the action
that's best for us.

51
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:40,870
So it's also almost a kind of game,
where we get to make a move, and

52
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:42,990
then the environment makes a move,
and then we make a move, and

53
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:43,960
then the environment makes a move.

54
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:48,660
>> Okay, I like that, I like that.

55
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:52,040
But that means you would want to
choose the action that would get you

56
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:56,310
to the place where kind of
the least worst thing can happen.

57
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:57,430
>> Yeah, that's right.

58
00:02:57,430 --> 00:03:00,790
Right, so us, the agent,
the ones who's doing the deciding,

59
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:05,490
is trying to be risk averse relative
to what the environment might do to it.

60
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,700
>> Right, sure that makes perfect sense.

61
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,660
So risk averse is not a bad description.

62
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:11,420
>> Good.

63
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:16,250
So other answers I would accept here
include things like adversarial dynamics

64
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:19,610
or two player game, things like that.

65
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:22,690
I guess you could also,
notice the way this is written here.

66
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:25,010
This is the min over all next states so

67
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:28,370
this is really going to always
transition us to the worst state.

68
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:31,840
Not the worst state that makes any
sense, because we didn't do something

69
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:38,420
like for all states in the set
of states that are reachable

70
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:41,620
with probability greater than zero, but
that's a little bit more constrained.

71
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:44,550
We didn't constrain it, so
really it could just be MDP that makes

72
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:49,180
you sit in the worst possible place, and
just pummels you over and over again.

73
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:51,240
But I don't think there's
a nice succinct name for that.

74
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:55,050
>> I thought that was pretty succinct,
what you said.

75
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:55,550
>> All right, good.
