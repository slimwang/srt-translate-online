1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,240
Now, let's share this
prototype with someone.

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:05,390
There are three ways to do this.

3
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:08,230
First, you can select
the Share Link button.

4
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:12,250
This allows you to generate
a unique URL that anyone can view.

5
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:16,190
Your project screens can be viewed
on a desktop or mobile device.

6
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:21,100
Anyone with this link can view, interact
with and comment on your screens.

7
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:27,530
You can email it, SMS it, embed it or
even download it for offline viewing.

8
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:30,650
Simply copy and paste this URL,
and send it to your participant.

9
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:34,900
Second, you can add someone to
your project as a collaborator.

10
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:39,770
Adding a collaborator to your project
effectively gives them full edit access.

11
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:45,730
This enables to view, interact with,
comment on the screens, edit and

12
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:50,110
add and remove screens as well
as edit and add hotspots.

13
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:50,940
To do this,

14
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:54,060
simply click on the plus sign in the
upper right of your project home view.

15
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:59,020
Adding a collaborator will give that
person full access to your project.

16
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:02,380
Third, you can start
an instant LiveShare event.

17
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:05,910
A LiveShare meeting enables you to have
a real time collaborative discussion

18
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:08,780
with anyone with Internet access.

19
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:11,690
Participants of your meeting can draw,
add comments, and

20
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:14,530
view your project in a one-time event.

21
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:16,820
You can have unlimited
participants in your meeting, and

22
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:19,470
you don't need to book
your meetings in advance.

23
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:22,930
Plus, you can have as many
LiveShare meetings as you need.

24
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:25,010
Simply copy and paste this link and

25
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:27,900
send it to anybody you want to
participate in your meeting.

26
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:33,890
You can turn on a VoIP call here
where people can join a VoIP, or

27
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:37,140
you can have them dial into this phone
number for a private conference line.

28
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:40,620
In the bottom left, you'll see
that there's a group chat window.

29
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:45,270
Participants can turn
on the drawing tool,

30
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:51,120
where you can draw over your designs, or
you can turn on a whiteboarding option.

31
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:57,070
Any of your designs can be
saved to a Snaps folder or

32
00:01:57,070 --> 00:02:02,330
emailed to all of your
participants on the fly.
