00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:01,210
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:04,700
Let's get started investigating a professional framework that you'll be able to

3
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:07,660
use to put together some really awesome projects.

4
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:10,680
Along the way, we'll be taking a look at some of the decisions developers have

5
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:13,660
to make to decide which framework they want to use.

6
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:17,190
For the project for this lesson, you'll be using twitters bootstrap framework to

7
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:19,680
put together the portfolio you see here.

8
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,970
In the end, you'll be taking advantage of some of bootstrap's JavaScript

9
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:25,570
features to make your pages really come to life.

10
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:26,330
But don't worry,

11
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:29,250
you don't need to write any JavaScript yourself, we'll be helping you out.
