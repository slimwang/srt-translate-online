00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:04,843
The first cube has a side length of 2, since 2 times 2 times 2 equals 8. The

2
00:00:04,843 --> 00:00:08,869
second cube has a side length of 5, since these three factors multiply together

3
00:00:08,869 --> 00:00:14,154
to give us 125. And finally, this last one has a side length of 7, since 7

4
00:00:14,154 --> 00:00:16,430
cubed equals 343.
