The first thing I'd like you to do in Homework 6 is add some caching to your blog.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Specifically, I'd like you to cache the front page and display on the front page somewhere,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
how long ago you ran that query that generated the front page.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Let me give you a little demo on my site of what this looks like.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
So here we are at udacity-cs253.com/blog.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
If I reload this page--let's go down to the bottom--

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
you will see that this query, this page was generated 159 seconds ago.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
If I were to reload this page again, you could see that it's incrementing every time I reload the page.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Okay. So obviously, I'm storing this in the cache somewhere and that's what I would like you to do.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
When you have this working, submit the URL to your blog here.
