00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,840
We worked with multiplying monomials and binomials, and binomials with other

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,869
binomials, now let's try something a little bit harder. We're going to multiply

3
00:00:07,869 --> 00:00:11,895
a binomial with a trinomial. Let's start with our simple case using numbers, and

4
00:00:11,895 --> 00:00:15,627
then see if you can extend that to figure out something harder. Just like

5
00:00:15,627 --> 00:00:19,653
before, we can split-up each of these numbers, so that way we can make this

6
00:00:19,653 --> 00:00:23,943
multiplication problem more simple, I'll have 13, which is 10 plus 3, and 123,

7
00:00:23,943 --> 00:00:28,901
which is 100 plus 20 plus 3. Now can imagine doing this multiplication using a

8
00:00:28,901 --> 00:00:34,091
rectangle with the appropriate side-lengths. When I find the area of each of

9
00:00:34,091 --> 00:00:39,503
these rectangles and add them up, I get 1,599, the answer to our multiplication

10
00:00:39,503 --> 00:00:40,209
problem.
