1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Now the first plan might fail.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,000
If we go from S to A and attempt to go from A to G, a flood might be in the way,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and the flood will never go away. Therefore this is the correct answer over here.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
The second succeeds.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
We go from S to B, and if the traffic light is red, we wait until it finally turns green.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Then we go from B to G.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
However, we can't say in advance in how many steps the traffic light turns green.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Therefore, the solution will be unbounded. It can't really be bounded it in advance.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The third one also may fail under the same condition as the first.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
We go from S to A. If there is a flood, we just try again.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Finally, if the flood goes away, we go from A to G.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
However, a flood never goes away. Therefore if there is a flood we will actually fail here.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
The fourth one always succeeds in a bounded number of steps.

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
We go from S to A. If there is a flood we go from A to D and then to G.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Otherwise we go from A to G.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
As you can see, the number of steps might be either 3 or 2,

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
but I can bound it by 3.

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
There won't be more than 3 steps in total.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
The same is true for this plan over here.

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:17,000
We go to B. If we find a stoplight, we go back to S, then to A, to D, and then to G.

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
However, if the stoplight is green, we go straight to G,

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
and you can see that this is going to succeed.

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,000
The final plan--[SA, AD, DG]--avoids all the floods and the stoplight

24
00:01:29,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and will therefore always succeed in 3 steps, which is bounded.
