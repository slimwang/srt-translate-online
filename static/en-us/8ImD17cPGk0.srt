00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,994
Of course, these days this whole concept
of video textures is coming back and

2
00:00:03,994 --> 00:00:06,689
it's now coming back as
referred to as cinemagrams.

3
00:00:06,689 --> 00:00:08,470
So here I just show two examples.

4
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:12,720
This is using the Microsoft
Research Cliplets software.

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:13,920
And of course here you notice,

6
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,360
it's a static scene except there is only
one thing moving, and that's the train.

7
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:21,250
All the people are still.

8
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:24,630
This gives a very nice rendition
of kind of showing motion and

9
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:26,910
emphasizing only one bit of motion.

10
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:29,910
You might want to try out the Microsoft
Research Cliplets software, interested

11
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:33,720
in developing these types of things have
provided a nice toolkit for doing this.

12
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:36,936
There is of course a whole lot of
additional stuff also coming up, for

13
00:00:36,936 --> 00:00:38,310
example.

14
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:42,030
There's another example, where basically
if you notice the whole scene is static.

15
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:46,770
The only thing that's moving is
the water from the, from the tap here.

16
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:50,497
Again, showing you the emphasis of
just one specific dynamic motion and

17
00:00:50,497 --> 00:00:51,853
keeping the rest stable.

18
00:00:51,853 --> 00:00:55,340
We'll talk a little about these kind of
things also in one of my other lectures.

19
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:57,524
We're going to talk about video
stabilization, but again,

20
00:00:57,524 --> 00:01:00,090
there are lots of techniques out there
and you can play around with this.
