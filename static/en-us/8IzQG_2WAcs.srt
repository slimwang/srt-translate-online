1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:04,610
Well, if you remember, we stopped execution with the JavaScript debugger,

2
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:07,340
in the original HTML source file.

3
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:13,750
Looking back at the code, here, the debugger in line 19 paused execution.

4
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:19,280
In the web console, we created and appended an new SVG, which we then

5
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:25,290
drew a chart in, all before continuing from the initial debugger statement.

6
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:30,480
So when we stepped past the debugger statement at line 19, the original code got

7
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,930
run, which appended another svg to our page and added a second chart to it.

8
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:42,100
Usually, this isn't too much of an issue, because in practice you don't develop

9
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:46,380
your final chart in this interactive way where you pause execution,

10
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:51,380
write some code in your interactive console and then continue execution.

11
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:55,800
Usually, a visitor comes to your graphic, the HTML gets loaded,

12
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,170
and the JavaScript code gets run once.
