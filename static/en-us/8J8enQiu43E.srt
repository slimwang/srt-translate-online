00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
One of the standard problems that people study in statistics has to do with purchasing decisions.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Suppose you wish to buy a house.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:16,000
There are small houses and big houses, but you really like this one special house

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
build by a famous designer.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
This house has a certain price.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Say in US dollars it's $92,000.00.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
The question you'd like to ask yourself--is this okay?

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Is it too much--you should pay less--or too little?

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Let's go an find out.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
In statistics, the way we find out is by looking at data.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Let's assume there is a database of previous house sales

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
of homes in the same neighborhood.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Just for simplicity, let's assume we know about two things--

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
the size of the home and the cost at which it was sold.

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
There is a house with 1400 square feet that sold at $112,000,

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:06,000
a much larger one with 2400 square feet sold for $192,000,

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
and so on for an entire number of other houses.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Now it's a statistics problem.

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
You have past data, and here is your very first quiz.

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Say the house you wish to purchase has 1300 square feet in size.

21
00:01:23,000 --> 99:59:59,999
How much money should you expect to pay?
