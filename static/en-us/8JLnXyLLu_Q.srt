1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,770
We currently have a main view which
shows nothing, a menu view, and

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:04,490
an item view.

3
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:08,840
Let's say that an item has stats,
like nutrition facts, but

4
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:11,940
we only want to show them if
the user wants to see them.

5
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:15,050
Better yet, what if we want to send
a link to a friend that takes them right

6
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:17,200
to the strawberry
pudding's nutrition facts?

7
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:20,240
We can do all of this with
ember's nested routes.

8
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,010
Ember's nested routes are really
powerful, and make building

9
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:26,540
seemingly complex applications,
well, actually pretty easy.

10
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:31,367
When I think of a template, I think
of just a chunk of standalone HTML.

11
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:35,920
Ember templates can also be
thought of as containers.

12
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,610
The base container is
the application template,

13
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:39,401
and contains all other templates.

14
00:00:39,401 --> 00:00:43,510
Any site-wide HTML should go in here,
like a site's header,

15
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:45,490
navigation, and footer.

16
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:49,160
The menu template is contained inside
of the application template, and

17
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:51,640
the item template also goes
inside the application template.

18
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:56,040
We want to create a nutrition
template that's contained or

19
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,919
nested inside of our item template.

20
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:03,010
Everything starts with a route, and
that will be item, and then the dynamic

21
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:07,210
segment, which will be the menu
item's name, and then nutrition.

22
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:10,640
How does amber know how or
where to insert the item template

23
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,535
into the application template,
or nutrition into item?

24
00:01:14,535 --> 00:01:17,410
We'll look at that after we
generate the nutrition template.

25
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:21,198
Let's create the nutrition route, and
have it nested inside the item route.

26
00:01:21,198 --> 00:01:25,560
Again, ember CLI updates the router, and

27
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:30,130
creates a route file and
a template in a new item subfolder.

28
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:33,400
Notice that nested routes
are created inside a function

29
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:37,150
that's been added as a last
argument to the containing route.

30
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:39,920
Let's add some content to
the nutrition template, and

31
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,450
let's add a link in the item
template to the nutrition view.

32
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:46,600
Fantastic, the app's really
starting to come together.

33
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:51,010
The application template contains item,
and item contains nutrition.

34
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:53,670
Do you see these here?

35
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:56,960
This tells ember to insert
nested templates right here.

36
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,270
You can do anything with this code,
though.

37
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:03,430
Move it anywhere you want,
put it inside HTML, or even delete it.

38
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,670
Careful when deleting them, though.

39
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:11,660
If I delete this one,
then no other templates will show up,

40
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:13,910
since they don't know
where to be nested.

41
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:15,640
So I'll return each
one to the way it was.
