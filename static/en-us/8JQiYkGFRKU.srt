00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,906
>> If we only look at the area surrounding 0, we see that we've shaded to the

2
00:00:03,906 --> 00:00:08,086
right of 0 and also included that point. So, that means x is greater than or

3
00:00:08,086 --> 00:00:12,345
equal to 0. Now, if we only look at the area surrounding 15, 15 is included and

4
00:00:12,345 --> 00:00:16,778
then, we shade to the left. So, x is less than or equal to 15. Every number

5
00:00:16,778 --> 00:00:23,018
within this range that's shaded is both greater than or equal to 0 and less than

6
00:00:23,018 --> 00:00:25,390
or equal to 15. So we pick and.
