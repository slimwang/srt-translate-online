00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:01,890
Continuing the same talk,

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:05,830
let's not talk about the whole concept of how images are focused.

3
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:10,370
Here as I have said, image is being formed at the focal plane of this lens.

4
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:11,550
All light is hitting there.

5
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:13,110
It's converging to a point.

6
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:15,430
And I should get a nice crisp image here.

7
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:20,670
What happens if I was to now try to move the image further backwards?

8
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:24,330
If I move it backwards, what should happen is multiple kind of

9
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:27,250
copies should be available because none of the rays of light that

10
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:29,560
are coming through the lens would converge at that point.

11
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:33,510
They mostly converge, in fact they always converge at the focal point, so

12
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:35,390
you should see a little bit of a blurry image,

13
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:38,135
of course, I'm just simulating that here.

14
00:00:38,135 --> 00:00:41,700
Similarly, if I move the image plane in front of the focal plane,

15
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,120
I should also get a blurry image.

16
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:48,516
So focusing most of the time in a camera is done by moving the sensor, or

17
00:00:48,516 --> 00:00:52,340
sometimes of course the lens, forward and backwards to make,

18
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:56,257
basically make sure that the image is formed at the focal point.

19
00:00:56,257 --> 00:01:01,162
And the distance between the image and the sensor plane where the image is

20
00:01:01,162 --> 00:01:06,230
formed is set to the focal length of the lens that's been given.

21
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:10,380
So the focusing concept basically is where we move the lens in

22
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:15,530
relationship with the imaging plane, which should be on the focus plane.

23
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:19,660
By just moving those two things together, you can now make sure that

24
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:24,770
the image is formed exactly at the image plane, which is now at the focal plane.

25
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:27,380
So image plane has to be at the focal plane to be able to

26
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:30,590
generate a smooth crisp image.

27
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:35,270
If it's after or before the focal plane you will see blurriness.

28
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:39,990
So focusing is done by moving the sensor or the lens in

29
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:45,610
relationship to each other to be able to create a relationship where

30
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:50,360
the distance between the lens and the image plane

31
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:54,400
is exactly aligned to where the focus plane for that lens would be.

32
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:59,500
In doing so, we guarantee that the image is going to be crisp and

33
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,770
focused on the image plane.

34
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:05,590
If it's in front, that is the sensor or the image plane is in front of

35
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:10,570
the focal plane, or after it, it's behind it, you'll get a blurry image.

36
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:12,980
Let's look at another example of this.

37
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,530
Here I'm just showing you three images.

38
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:19,520
Again, for this image here, if all the light is going through my lens, and

39
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,340
of course it's forming on the image plane or the sensor here.

40
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:26,933
Of course, by changing this relationship, if I get this closer,

41
00:02:26,933 --> 00:02:31,118
if the object is farther away from it, you will get to see the smaller object.

42
00:02:31,118 --> 00:02:35,662
But in essence, what I was talking about with focusing is here, this is

43
00:02:35,662 --> 00:02:41,040
the best focus point here and basically how the lens moves with respect to this,

44
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,841
is essential to be able to get a crisp image or

45
00:02:43,841 --> 00:02:46,229
a blurry images as are noticed here.

46
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:50,440
We looked at this whole concept a little bit for pinhole cameras.

47
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:54,790
Again, in that size of course, the size of the pinhole was the reason for

48
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:56,090
creating blurry images or not.
