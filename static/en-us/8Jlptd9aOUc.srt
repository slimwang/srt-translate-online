This equation would just be an ellipse. Now you might have thought that it was

2
00:00:05,224 --> 00:00:08,626
hyperbola since we have a subtraction of y squared but remember we need the x

3
00:00:08,626 --> 00:00:14,650
squared and y squared to be on the same side of the equation. So if we add y

4
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:19,674
squared to both sides of the equation we would get this one. We can see that

5
00:00:19,674 --> 00:00:22,898
there's a plus sign in between the x squared terms and the y squared terms so

6
00:00:22,898 --> 00:00:28,099
we either have a circle or no ellipse. And since we have different amounts of x

7
00:00:28,099 --> 00:00:33,100
squared and y squared we know that the equation represents an ellipse.
