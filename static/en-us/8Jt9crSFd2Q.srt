00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,240
I mentioned also, aggregation and composition.

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:09,550
Using aggregation in particular is very common in UML class diagrams. You

3
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:15,950
often want to say that one class is related to many instances of another class.

4
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:21,100
And you use the aggregation association to do this.

5
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:25,720
It's still an association, it's just adorned with an open diamond to

6
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:29,760
indicate that it's a particular kind of association called an aggregation.

7
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,900
I want to say a word, though, about the difference between aggregation and

8
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:39,450
composition. It's somewhat subtle, and it gets to the point that aggregation

9
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:45,482
doesn't really say much about the semantics of the relationship. In particular,

10
00:00:45,482 --> 00:00:50,890
it doesn't say much about the lifetimes of the participant objects.

11
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:58,600
For example, let's say you had a house class and room classes.

12
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:02,240
Clearly, a house has rooms so you'd expect there to be an aggregation there.

13
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:07,150
But think further, if you destroy the house you're also destroying the rooms.

14
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:12,320
Therefore, instead of using aggregation, we would use composition. That is,

15
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:18,520
we'd fill in that diamond. In compositions, there is a responsibility for

16
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:23,780
managing the lifetime of the constituent objects. That further

17
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:28,710
says that a particular constituent can only belong to one composition.

18
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:35,390
Compositions also have the transitive property. That is, a house can have room

19
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:40,930
and a room can have closets. For aggregations there's no rules like this.

20
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:45,810
Aggregations are general situations. We might say, for example, that a room has

21
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:50,610
a table. Now this is an aggregation situation, because we could certainly

22
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:56,100
destroy the room after taking the table out. They have separate lifetimes, and

23
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,260
therefore we'd use aggregation instead of composition.
