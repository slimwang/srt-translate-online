The answer is a 32x slow down, okay, so since warps only have 32 threads,

2
00:00:04,976 --> 00:00:08,150
you can't have worse than 32-way branch divergence.

3
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:13,396
So, at worst, you'll have to deactivate each thread one at a time, execute some code,

4
00:00:13,396 --> 00:00:17,793
and then activate another thread and deactivate the one you just executed,

5
00:00:17,793 --> 00:00:23,227
and at most you can do this 31 times. So, even if you have a 1024 threads in a thread block,

6
00:00:23,227 --> 00:00:26,162
you won't experience worse than 32x slow down.
