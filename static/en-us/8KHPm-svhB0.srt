00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:02,290
So how do we test out how our

2
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:05,480
desktop application works with a touch interface if

3
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:07,800
we don't have a mobile device handy? Well

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,780
it turns out that Chrome developer tools let us

5
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:13,310
use the mouse to emulate touch event support

6
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:15,900
on a non-touch desktop. Just open up the

7
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:19,470
Chrome developer tools, go down to this gear

8
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:24,680
down at the bottom And under Overrides, select Enable,

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,590
and Emulate touch events. Now, close the overrides, but be sure to leave

10
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:35,470
the dev tools open, you can minimize them to get them out of

11
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:40,735
the way. And now, as you move across your interface you'll see the

12
00:00:40,735 --> 00:00:44,905
cursor represented by a small dot, this is emulating a touch event cursor.

13
00:00:44,905 --> 00:00:48,813
[MUSIC]

14
00:00:48,813 --> 00:00:52,113
And clicking the mouse is the same as pushing your finger down, or

15
00:00:52,113 --> 00:00:55,880
lifting it off. Now, you don't want to rely on this too much, it

16
00:00:55,880 --> 00:01:00,540
isn't perfect and it isn't exactly like having a real touch interface. So be

17
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:03,680
sure to test on a real touch interface and a mobile device as well.
