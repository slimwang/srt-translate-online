00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:03,695
In the Android Fundamentals course,
you learned all about the Android

2
00:00:03,695 --> 00:00:07,390
manifest.xml file and how this is
used to add permissions to your app.

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,430
But before you can access
location on Google Services,

4
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:15,790
you have to add the ability to use
different location sensitivities.

5
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:18,070
You can specify that
you want fine location.

6
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:22,470
Or you can specify that
you want coarse location.

7
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:24,060
Now what are these?

8
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:29,340
Fine location updates involve
using the device's GPS,

9
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:34,890
cell signal, or WiFi to get the most
accurate possible position,

10
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:37,970
but possibly costing
you extra battery life.

11
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:43,120
So alternatively,
you can use the coarse location, and

12
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:47,970
this gets your location using
only the cell signal or WiFi.

13
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:51,640
It won't be as accurate as fine, but
it'll cost a lot less battery power.
