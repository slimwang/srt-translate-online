00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,416
>> The answer is graph E, this reddish curve right here. We can see that it goes

2
00:00:04,416 --> 00:00:08,588
to the point 4, 0, the point 16, 18, and the point 28, 0. All of the other

3
00:00:08,588 --> 00:00:12,935
graphs on here go through at least one of these points, but none of the others

4
00:00:12,935 --> 00:00:17,563
goes through all three. And in fact, remembering that this curve is supposed to

5
00:00:17,563 --> 00:00:22,117
be the trajectory or the path that Grant's ball takes through the air, the curve

6
00:00:22,117 --> 00:00:26,327
really should look like this. The point down here, 4, 0, is where the ball

7
00:00:26,327 --> 00:00:30,729
leaves the slingshot. The point at the top of the curve is where it goes through

8
00:00:30,729 --> 00:00:34,300
the hoop. And the point down here is where it lands on the ground.
