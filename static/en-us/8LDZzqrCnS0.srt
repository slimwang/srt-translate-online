1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,625
These are the frequencies you should have got in and notice that they all add to

2
00:00:04,637 --> 00:00:09,250
50, the total number of observations in our sample. Using a frequency table, we

3
00:00:09,262 --> 00:00:13,875
can easily see that most students are from China. It was probably tedious to do

4
00:00:13,887 --> 00:00:18,240
this by hand and I apologize, but sometimes when you do it by hand, you really

5
00:00:18,252 --> 00:00:23,107
understand how to do it. We do, however, have technology that can tabulate this.

6
00:00:23,211 --> 00:00:27,929
And so, we're going to make use of technology throughout this course. But every

7
00:00:27,941 --> 00:00:31,043
once in a while, we'll have you do something by hand.
