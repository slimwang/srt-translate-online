1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:01,720
Here's the solution.

2
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:05,620
At this point, I hope the steps for
each task are becoming more familiar.

3
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:07,560
I'll start again with the parameters,
which for

4
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:10,700
this request are the API key and
the request token.

5
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:15,470
Then to build the URL, we'll use
the /authentication/session/new method.

6
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:19,900
Next I repeat the steps that we've
been taking to create the task here,

7
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:24,140
then we have this displayError function
and then we check for error cases, so

8
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:28,670
one, two, three different
error cases here, these guys.

9
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:33,500
And here we convert the JSON
data into a useable dictionary.

10
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,560
And then, we grab our session ID,
so we look in the results and

11
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:41,240
we look for
the value of the session ID key.

12
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:45,980
We store the session ID in the app
delegate and then we print it out.

13
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:52,294
And don't forget we need to start
the task using task dot resume.

14
00:00:52,294 --> 00:00:53,449
Now let's go ahead and run this.

15
00:00:58,049 --> 00:00:59,849
I'll enter my credentials again.

16
00:01:02,809 --> 00:01:06,734
And there we go, and there's the value
we've been looking for all along,

17
00:01:06,734 --> 00:01:07,490
a session ID.
