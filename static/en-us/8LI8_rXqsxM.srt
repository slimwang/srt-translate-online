1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
And the answer is smaller than 0. There's a negative correlation.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
When x goes up, y goes down.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I think if you draw out the data, you get something like this for x and y.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 99:59:59,999
And that data perfectly fits in line which makes me believe r = -1 is the perfect correlation down.
