00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,550
Having defined the independent set and
vertex cover problems,

2
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:06,830
we will now show that vertex cover
is as hard as independent set.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,790
In general, finding a reduction
can be very difficult.

4
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:14,600
Sometimes however, it can be as simple
as playing around with the definition.

5
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:17,260
You will notice that in both
these examples here and

6
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:21,340
in the exercises, the set of
vertices used in the vertex cover

7
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:25,310
was the complement of the vertices
used in the independent set.

8
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:27,036
Let's see if we can explain this.

9
00:00:27,036 --> 00:00:32,520
A set S is an independent set
if there are no edges within S.

10
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,000
By within,
I mean that both endpoints are in S.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,110
That's equivalent to saying that
every edge is not within S,

12
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:44,855
or that every edge is incident on V- S.

13
00:00:44,855 --> 00:00:46,070
A-ha!

14
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:49,070
But that just says that
V- S is a vertex cover.

15
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:53,340
So of course the complement
of an independent set

16
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:56,430
was always a vertex cover and
vice versa.

17
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:00,640
Thus, we have the observation
that a subset of the vertices S

18
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:05,470
is an independent set if and
only if V- S is a vertex cover.

19
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:10,490
As a corollary then, G will contain
an independent set of size at least K,

20
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:15,760
if and only if it has a vertex
cover of size at most V- K.

21
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,580
The reduction then is
fantastically simple.

22
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:23,720
Given a graph G and a number K,
the reduction just keeps the same graph

23
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:28,000
G and
changes K to the number of vertices- K.
