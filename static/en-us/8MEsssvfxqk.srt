00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,830
Let's talk about the System UI
elements of Android Wear.

2
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:07,170
When we talk about System UI elements,
we talk about cards and

3
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:10,090
indicators that give the user
the status of the wearable and

4
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:12,850
show notifications from
services on the user's phone.

5
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:16,350
Your job as a designer is to keep these
elements from obscuring your design

6
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:18,160
by placing them carefully.

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,350
Cards here are the notification system
that bridges information between

8
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:23,290
the wearable and a mobile device.

9
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:26,470
Cards are also how most applications
communicate with users.

10
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:30,660
The user will be notified on the
wearable about items such as emails and

11
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:31,720
messages.

12
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:34,780
We also have this concept of
something called a Peek card.

13
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:38,200
The Peek card is the top card in
the stream that's partially visible

14
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,880
over the bottom of the watch face.

15
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:43,600
The API provides the ability to detect
the dimensions of the peek card,

16
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,270
like this red square here.

17
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:47,800
So that your design can
react to this if necessary.

18
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:51,570
You have the ability to request that
peek cards by default are hidden, small,

19
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:53,640
or variable to expand to the contents.

20
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,020
The user also has the ability to force
show or hide a peek card as well.

21
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:59,380
But you need to design for
all possibilities.

22
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:02,210
If you have a watch face with
the time shown right at the top,

23
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:06,300
you can allow a variable peek card
that expands to the full height.

24
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:09,900
This gives the most notification
information to the user when needed.

25
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,830
If on the otherhand you have the time
at a relatively low position,

26
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:15,440
you should leave ridge
a small peek card instead.

27
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,590
If you have a round
face with analog hands,

28
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:20,410
you probably should use
a small peek card as well.

29
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:23,671
However, the system notifies your
watch face when the bounds of a peek

30
00:01:23,671 --> 00:01:25,270
card change like here.

31
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:28,520
So that you can rearrange the elements
of your design, if necessary.

32
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:32,550
Like in this example here where the
clock face has actually resized itself.

33
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:36,590
Indicators tell the user the status
of the wearable, such as charging,

34
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:39,640
airplane mode,
connectivity, and so forth.

35
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:42,360
And the hot word is the phrase,
OK Google, which tells

36
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,570
the user that they can interact with
the watch using voice commands.

37
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:48,670
When a user activates the wearable, the
hot word can appear on the screen for

38
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:49,790
a few seconds.

39
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:52,840
The indicator in the hot word can be
placed in several fixed locations

40
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,860
on the wearable.

41
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:57,630
If you have a large peek card they
should go at the top of the screen.

42
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:01,530
When you position these the the bottom,
the system forces a small peek card.

43
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:05,300
If the edge of the watch face contains
strong visual elements such as ticks or

44
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:06,440
numbers like this one here.

45
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:09,960
Then you should place the indicators
at the center of the screen.

46
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:13,880
Finally, the indicators in hot word are
drawn in the text with no background.

47
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:17,480
So if you have a watch face with complex
details in the background like text,

48
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:21,130
you'll need to draw a field background
like these behind the text,

49
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:22,050
in an appropriate color.
