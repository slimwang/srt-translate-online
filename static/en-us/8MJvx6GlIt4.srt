1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
If you look at the chances of the particles that can end up in a1,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
we find that only this particle can go up here, so let's call this a 1.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
To a2, there's 2 particles that can go to this. Call this a 2.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
There's 2 particles that can end up in b1. This one and this guy over here. Again, a 2,

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
and one that can make it into b2.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Now this is a total of 6. If you normalize, you get extra probabilities.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
a1 is worth 1/6.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
a2, 1/3, which is 2/6ths.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
b1, again 1/3,

10
00:00:30,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and b2 is 1/6.
