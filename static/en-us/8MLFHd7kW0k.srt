00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:05,780
This is a normal distribution, or a bell curve. On the X axis we have the

2
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:11,430
scores. On the Y axis we have frequencies. Frequencies are how often a score

3
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:16,688
occurs. It might help to visualize with something like an IQ. Here The mean IQ

4
00:00:16,688 --> 00:00:22,410
is 100. Now we're going to look at deviations. So here we have one standard

5
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:29,454
deviation. For our IQ, one standard deviation above the mean would be 115. 85,

6
00:00:29,454 --> 00:00:36,830
however, would be one standard deviation below the mean. We see that 68% of the

7
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:42,810
population will fall between one standard deviation above the mean, one

8
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:49,750
standard deviation below the mean. Next we see that 95% of the population will

9
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:53,950
fall with two standard deviations above the mean or two standard deviations

10
00:00:53,950 --> 00:01:00,200
below the mean. Next, we see that 99.7% of the population fall between three

11
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:04,120
standard deviations above the mean and three standard deviations below the

12
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:11,320
mean. We have the 68, 95 and 99.7 rule. That means that 68% of the population

13
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:15,770
is going to fall between one standard eviction below and one standard deviation

14
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:20,850
above the mean. 95% of the population will fall from two standard deviations

15
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:26,880
below two standard deviations above the mean. And 99.7% are going to fall from

16
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:31,200
three standard deviations. Below the mean to three standard deviations above

17
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:31,550
the mean.
