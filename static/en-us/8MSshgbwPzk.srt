1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:04,689
So overall I believe, the field of Computational Photography is exciting and

2
00:00:04,689 --> 00:00:05,800
emerging area.

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:09,100
Which requires a lot of research and development and study.

4
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:13,090
Now, questions that at least, I would like us to think about in the future.

5
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:17,660
But not during the class perhaps, is what will a camera look like in 10 years or

6
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:18,700
20 years from now?

7
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:22,050
What other types of novel images can we capture?

8
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:24,020
And what would their uses be?

9
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:27,860
How will the next billion cameras change the social culture?

10
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:30,700
Again, I show the example of images in news.

11
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:34,065
How availability of the beast with billion eyes is changing our way to

12
00:00:34,065 --> 00:00:35,740
kind of see things.

13
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:37,490
Much more globally.

14
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:41,800
And actually this is playing a real important role in the social context.

15
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,980
Well, this is going to become even more important.

16
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:48,890
One of the bigger questions remains is, of course with, so many images and

17
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:53,200
videos being captured and not put on the network or in a database of some sort.

18
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:56,220
The image search problem is going to be get even bigger.

19
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:59,810
So question is, how can we actually think about changing computational

20
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:02,780
photography pipeline to help with image search?

21
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:06,580
An example of this, of course, is the use of metadata like Geotagging.

22
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:12,790
That is becoming widely used, to search or at least classifying cluster images.

23
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:16,938
Another question comes up, is how will the high-speed chain cameras or

24
00:01:16,938 --> 00:01:20,330
high-resolution cameras change how we use them?

25
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:24,280
Again we should be able to see more, more details, more clarity and

26
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,175
other types of things.

27
00:01:25,175 --> 00:01:29,100
That'll lead us to understand more about, how we visualize things.

28
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:32,050
More and more these days has been a growth of robotic cameras, or

29
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:34,110
autonomous cameras.

30
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:35,760
These are going to also have an impact,

31
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:38,230
on how we perce, how we capture the environment?

32
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:40,754
And how we use that kind of content for a variety of things?

33
00:01:40,754 --> 00:01:44,560
>> [LAUGH] >> Again more and more with, built-on this concept.

34
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,380
Also there's going to be more and

35
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:49,722
more abilities to pervasively capture our environment.

36
00:01:49,722 --> 00:01:54,660
Also capture them from our first person perspective and capture our experiences.

37
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:58,750
Many science fiction stories have written about these types of things.

38
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:00,840
And now actually, you may want to think about them more because as

39
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,930
technology gets better, we are getting closer to those things.

40
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:07,670
And more importantly, again, the availability of these types of cameras is

41
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:14,000
changing how we both have user-generated content showing up on the internet.

42
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,030
And also how is changing how for the videography and

43
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:19,290
photography is done at the professional level.

44
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:21,930
And also impacting the things like, reporting news.
