00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,760
Here is the illustration
of a computer system we

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:06,230
used in our introductory
lesson in operating systems.

3
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:06,990
As you can see,

4
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:11,120
the execution of applications
doesn't rely only on the CPU and

5
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:16,180
memory, but relies on many other
different types of hardware components.

6
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:20,410
Some of these components are
specifically tied to providing inputs or

7
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:22,320
directing outputs.

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,410
And these are referred
to as I/O devices.

9
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:29,580
Examples include keyboards and
microphones, displays,

10
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:34,650
speakers, mice,
also network interface hard disk.

11
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:38,540
So there are a number of different
types of input/output devices that

12
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:42,130
operating systems integrate into
the overall computing system.
