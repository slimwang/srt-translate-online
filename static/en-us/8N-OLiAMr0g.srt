My name is Jeffrey Middleton.

2
00:00:01,510 --> 00:00:04,310
I work at Google On Search, specifically in web ranking, which is how we

3
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:07,478
decide for a given query what results we're going to show in what order.

4
00:00:07,478 --> 00:00:10,590
And I have been using git since I first started programming really for

5
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:11,460
about six years.

6
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:14,090
So for me, the biggest useful thing about version control is when I'm working on

7
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:15,250
something bigger on my own.

8
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:17,770
If I'm just doing a small task,

9
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:20,870
it's kind of okay to be able to do it without any, without any version control.

10
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:23,420
I can just sit there, do the little thing and be done with it.

11
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:25,750
But if it's something bigger I really like to be able to break it

12
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:29,810
up into pieces, to kind of think about my work in terms of a bunch of steps, and

13
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:33,070
to be able to fix all of my mistakes by moving forward and backward.

14
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:37,120
And kind of get everything together in the right way before I'm,

15
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,710
before I'm really ready to share it with other people.

16
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:41,430
The learning curve with version control really varies a lot depending on

17
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:42,240
what you're using.

18
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:46,570
I think some systems that don't offer as much are really fast to pick up, but

19
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:49,550
then more complex version control systems like git.

20
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:51,220
There is a pretty steep learning curve, but

21
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:54,890
I think it's worth it because the power is so great, and

22
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:58,260
once, once you do learn it, once you get past the curve you can really do a lot.

23
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:00,980
And it's things that you couldn't do without having learned that much.
