1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,180
So let us suppose that I go to a number of restaurants, and

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:07,540
have various kinds of meals and sometimes get an allergic reaction.

3
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:10,220
I do not understand why I'm getting this allergic reaction,

4
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:14,620
under what conditions do I get the allergic reaction. So go to an ER agent and

5
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:20,240
say, dear ER agent tell me, under what conditions do I get allergic reactions.

6
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:24,260
And I give all the data, shown in this table, to the AI agent. Note that there

7
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:28,490
are only five examples here, like we mentioned in knowledge-based AI we want to

8
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:32,520
do learning based on a small number of examples because that's how humans do

9
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,770
learning. Note also, that the first example is positive. And

10
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:40,690
that there are both positive and negative examples. That is important so

11
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:45,260
we can, construct both specializations and generalizations. How then,

12
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:50,330
may an AI agent decide the conditions under which I get allergic reaction. So

13
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:53,620
this examples are coming one at a time, and let us see what happens when

14
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:58,420
the first example comes. Here is the first example. The restaurant was Sam's.

15
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:01,940
Meal was breakfast. Day was Friday. The cost was cheap.

16
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:06,760
So from this one example, I can construct both a very specific model, which is

17
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:10,930
exactly this example. Sam's, breakfast, Friday, cheap. You can't have anything,

18
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:14,800
more specific than this. And the AI agent can also construct a more general

19
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:19,710
model. Which of course is, that it can be any restaurant, any meal, any, day and

20
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:23,430
so on. You can't construct a more general model than this.

21
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:27,710
So the most specialized model based on this one example says that, I'm allergic

22
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:32,020
when I go to Sam's and have breakfast on Fridays and the cost is cheap. And

23
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:35,820
the most general model says, I'm allergic to everything. No matter where I go,

24
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:38,941
what meal I have, on what day, and what the cost is, I feel allergic.
