00:00:00,006 --> 00:00:03,951
So, are we happy with our Fried Python? Writing the code that we did, answering

2
00:00:03,951 --> 00:00:07,761
the last question. And if you're becoming a tasteful programmer, which I hope

3
00:00:07,761 --> 00:00:11,301
all of you are, you should be recoiling in horror with what we just did and

4
00:00:11,301 --> 00:00:15,340
smoke should be coming out of your ears. Anytime you see a lot of cutting and

5
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:19,226
pasting or copying code like this. That should raise alarm bells, if not, make

6
00:00:19,226 --> 00:00:22,902
smoke come out of your ears, literally. And it should tell you that there's

7
00:00:22,902 --> 00:00:27,060
something really bad about the abstractions you have. Previously, we've seen

8
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:30,820
this with procedures. If we had a lot of copies of code that were doing the same

9
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:34,788
thing or very close to the same thing, what we should do is take all those, turn

10
00:00:34,788 --> 00:00:38,756
them into a procedure and maybe have a parameter that generates the slightly

11
00:00:38,756 --> 00:00:43,070
different behaviors that we needed. This was procedural abstraction, a way to

12
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:47,510
reuse code by using procedures and to use parameters to specialize the behavior.

13
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:50,755
That's not quite what we need here, what we need is a similar kind of

14
00:00:50,755 --> 00:00:52,469
abstraction that works on types.
