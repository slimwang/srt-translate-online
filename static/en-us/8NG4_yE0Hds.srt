1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,440
What we're going to do is,
we're going to talk about segmentation.

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:05,510
I want to motivate this using a toy
problem, a very simple problem, and

3
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:08,700
then we'll move to slightly
more sophisticated examples.

4
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:11,030
So here's our toy example problem.

5
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:16,010
So we have an image on the left, and
you can see that there not that many

6
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:20,330
gray levels present and in fact there's
a histogram of them on the right.

7
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:23,640
And on the histogram, you can see that
there's this big collection of black

8
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,650
pixels, another collection of gray
pixels, even a little bit bigger and

9
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:28,840
what's this thing on the right?

10
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,250
That's this huge collection
of white pixels.

11
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:31,970
And they're exact.

12
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:32,820
They're black, gray and

13
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:37,400
white which leads to thinking that okay
in this image there are three regions.

14
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,405
And I would label them 1 for the black.

15
00:00:39,405 --> 00:00:42,170
2 for the gray and 3 for the white.

16
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:45,930
So the idea is that we went from
the groups in this histogram

17
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:48,940
to these segments in the picture.

18
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:51,180
But of course that's on
this trivial picture.

19
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:52,910
Here we have that, that clean image.

20
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:54,720
What if you have a noisier image, right?

21
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,900
So here I've just added
a little bit of noise.

22
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:01,620
And now our histogram is not just
these straight lines anymore.

23
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:04,940
But we get these
distributions of intensity.

24
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:06,550
So the question of how
do we break things up.

25
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:08,140
And the question is you know,

26
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:12,570
how do we carve this histogram
into these different groups?

27
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:15,730
In particular,
we refer to this as clustering.

28
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:19,680
So there's a fundamental relationship
between segmentation which is carving

29
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,150
an image up and this notion of
clustering which pixels belong together.
