1
00:00:00,397 --> 00:00:03,668
Within sunshine if you tap on
a list in the main activity,

2
00:00:03,668 --> 00:00:05,588
it opens up the detail activity.

3
00:00:05,588 --> 00:00:09,455
[BLANK_AUDIO]

4
00:00:09,455 --> 00:00:11,560
But the main activity
remains on the back stack.

5
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:14,450
Ready to reappear as
soon as you hit back.

6
00:00:14,449 --> 00:00:18,097
Now in that example both activities
are within the same app.

7
00:00:18,097 --> 00:00:21,439
But as we learned in lesson three,
you can also launch the browser or

8
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:22,679
maps app from sunshine.

9
00:00:22,678 --> 00:00:27,479
[BLANK_AUDIO]

10
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,469
Or for
that matter the user can hit Home.

11
00:00:29,469 --> 00:00:33,395
[BLANK_AUDIO]

12
00:00:33,395 --> 00:00:36,857
Or launch apps from there or
they can use the recent key or

13
00:00:36,856 --> 00:00:39,664
switch to another app
using notifications.

14
00:00:39,664 --> 00:00:42,612
All these options mean you can end up
with a lot of apps on your back stack.

15
00:00:42,612 --> 00:00:50,344
[BLANK_AUDIO]

16
00:00:50,344 --> 00:00:54,820
Now keep in mind that our resources
on devices are extremely limited.

17
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:59,070
So it's not a good idea to have dozens
of apps sitting idle in the background.

18
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:00,685
Android solves this for us, so

19
00:01:00,685 --> 00:01:03,429
you don't have to use those
awful task killer apps.

20
00:01:03,429 --> 00:01:05,066
So how does it do that?

21
00:01:05,066 --> 00:01:09,490
Well it kills low priority applications
that you haven't used in a while.

22
00:01:09,489 --> 00:01:13,219
We'll go into detail on exactly how
it figures out which app needs to die

23
00:01:13,219 --> 00:01:14,109
in lesson six.

24
00:01:14,109 --> 00:01:14,516
But for

25
00:01:14,516 --> 00:01:19,192
now it's important to realize that your
app isn't in control of its own destiny.

26
00:01:19,191 --> 00:01:20,856
It can be killed at any time.

27
00:01:20,856 --> 00:01:25,013
[BLANK_AUDIO]

28
00:01:25,013 --> 00:01:27,000
So you need to know
how to deal with that.

29
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,120
And that means understanding the life
cycle of an activity and the signals we

30
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:33,550
get from the framework to indicate
it's progress through the lifetime.
