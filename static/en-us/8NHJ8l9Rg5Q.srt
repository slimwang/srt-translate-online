00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,219
I know these problems are difficult, and
they take a lot of practice. Remember you

2
00:00:04,231 --> 00:00:08,570
can always go back and review the lessons
if you need some help. The answer to this

3
00:00:08,582 --> 00:00:12,301
problem is negative 28. Let's see how we
got that. The first thing I notice when

4
00:00:12,313 --> 00:00:16,331
I'm looking at this problem is that
there's this inner parenthesis inside the

5
00:00:16,343 --> 00:00:21,039
absolute value. So we have to perform the
operations inside the parenthesis. Before

6
00:00:21,051 --> 00:00:25,830
we do anything else. When I'm looking at
the operations inside these parentheses I

7
00:00:25,842 --> 00:00:30,660
notice that there's an exponent, and we
need to do exponents before multiplication

8
00:00:30,672 --> 00:00:34,978
and before subtraction. So let's do 5
squared. Remember when you're doing

9
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:39,525
problems like this you should always copy
The operations that you didn't perform,

10
00:00:39,617 --> 00:00:43,660
and only perform one or two operations at
each step, so I'm going to copy everything

11
00:00:43,672 --> 00:00:47,575
down. The only think I'm going to do right
here is evaluate this 5 squared, and I

12
00:00:47,587 --> 00:00:51,630
know that 5 squared is 25. The next think
I can do is evaluate multiplication and

13
00:00:51,642 --> 00:00:55,970
division. There's only one multiplication
inside the parentheses, so let's evaluate

14
00:00:55,982 --> 00:01:00,285
that and copy everything else down. 4
times 6 is 24 minus 25, and I have to cube

15
00:01:00,297 --> 00:01:06,031
that, and I still have my absolute value.
Since there's one more operation inside

16
00:01:06,043 --> 00:01:12,057
these inner parentheses, I have to do this
operation before I can do anything else. I

17
00:01:12,163 --> 00:01:17,062
remember to copy everything else down. 24
minus 25 gives me negative 1, and I have

18
00:01:17,074 --> 00:01:21,947
to raise negative 1 to the third power.
Now I can perform the operations inside

19
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:27,231
the absolute value and I can evaluate my
exponents first. So I have the negative

20
00:01:27,243 --> 00:01:32,072
absolute value of 3 cubed is 3 times 3
times 3, which is 27. And then we have

21
00:01:32,084 --> 00:01:37,084
negative 1 cubed which is negative 1,
times negative 1, times negative 1, which

22
00:01:37,096 --> 00:01:42,357
is negative 1. Or you could also remember
that a negative number raised to an odd

23
00:01:42,369 --> 00:01:47,819
power would give me a negative result. Now
we only have one operation left inside of

24
00:01:47,831 --> 00:01:52,428
the absolute value, which is 27 minus
negative 1. So I have negative the

25
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:57,927
absolute value of 27 minus a negative 1,
which is 28. From he re, remember that

26
00:01:57,939 --> 00:02:03,443
this negative out front actually means
negative 1 times, and the absolute value

27
00:02:03,455 --> 00:02:07,879
of 28 is 28. So, I have negative 1 times
28, which gives me negative 28. These were

28
00:02:07,891 --> 00:02:13,427
some good practice problems for both
absolute value and order of operations.

29
00:02:13,546 --> 00:02:15,759
Why don't you try a couple more?
