Summary slides, I love summary slides.

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:08,651
For 2-views and we learned at the beginning, there's a geometric relationship

3
00:00:08,651 --> 00:00:13,279
that defines the relation between rays in one view and rays in the other view.

4
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:16,740
And we were referring to that about the epipolar geometry.

5
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:20,720
These relations can be captured algebraically besides geometrically.

6
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,540
For the calibrated camera case that was referred to as the essential matrix.

7
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:28,360
For the uncalibrated camera case, it's the fundamental matrix.

8
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:32,037
And the math that we've been going through has been talking about how you can

9
00:00:32,037 --> 00:00:33,140
find these matrices.

10
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:36,139
How you can find these relations by just giving me

11
00:00:36,139 --> 00:00:40,099
the correspondences between points from one image to the next.

12
00:00:40,099 --> 00:00:41,039
All right.

13
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:43,200
This ends the lesson on fundamental matrices.

14
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,608
In fact, it ends the entire unit on calibration in stereo.

15
00:00:47,608 --> 00:00:50,060
I hope you realize that from these relationships,

16
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:52,120
you can capture the geometry of the scene.

17
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,088
That is given some camera views,

18
00:00:54,088 --> 00:00:58,880
you can eventually figure out the three-dimensional locations of the points.

19
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,939
So this is not image processing, right?

20
00:01:00,939 --> 00:01:04,779
This is actually vision where we recover a 3D structure.

21
00:01:04,779 --> 00:01:08,228
And if you're taking the OMS version of this, of this class and

22
00:01:08,228 --> 00:01:12,540
you're doing the OMS problem sets, you're going to get to know and love these.

23
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:13,640
Well, you're going to get to know.

24
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,980
I hope you'll love these processes pretty well.

25
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:18,020
That's it for this unit.
