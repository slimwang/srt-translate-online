Congratulations. You're done doing all four challenges. We have one

2
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:06,320
optional challenge, of putting everything

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:08,690
together. Measurement uncertainty and trying

4
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:11,590
to chase an escaping robot with you being just as

5
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:14,480
fast as the robot. There's a reason why I'm not counting

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,000
this, we're making it optional. It turns out when I

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,209
tried to program it, it was actually really hard. Was hard

8
00:00:19,209 --> 00:00:22,440
for our [UNKNOWN], so it is a real challenge. You

9
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:25,200
might want to try it but we didn't want to make it mandatory.

10
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,770
But, try it out and see how far you get.
