1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
I'm trying it out and see what happens.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Before it was a -3, 2, 5, 7, and now the first position is completely unchanged.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I'll explain to you in a second why.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:20,000
The third one went from 5 to 5.5, and the landmark went down from 7 to 6.8.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Graphically, this guy becomes larger than 5, and this landmark even shifts a little bit

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
to the left to make these two things closer together than they were before

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
when they had a separation distance of 2.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Now this picture doesn't really explain it well, because it's a 2D picture,

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
but in 1D that's exactly what's happening.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Also interesting is the initial position is unchanged.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
These are the correct answers.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Now, I would be blown away if you guessed them correctly.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
The reason why the initial position doesn't change is the only information we have

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
about the absolute coordinate location is the very first initial position anchor

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
that we said was to be -3.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
None of the relative rubber bands change the fact that we need this guy to be -3.

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
A relative change between these 2 things over here

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
means the rubber band is different, but it's a relative thing.

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
This is the only absolute constraint we put in.

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Clearly the absolute location of the first position doesn't change.

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
The reason why becomes larger than 5 is--well, think about rubber bands.

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Our landmark is around 7. We believe to be at position 5 in the noise-free case.

23
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
We just put a tighter rubber band between them. It's not 2 anymore; it's now 1.

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
That means we are inclined to move the landmark and this position closer together.

25
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
That's exactly what happens.

26
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:44,000
If you go to this solution over here, the final position becomes 5.5. It's now 5.5.

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
The landmark becomes 6.875 instead of 7.

28
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Now, this is the case where the rubber bands don't add up.

29
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
This is one of the places where Graph Slam is just magical.

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Before everything added up, but we have cycles in these structures.

31
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
These cycles might not added up, because we have noise and motion,

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
noise and measurements

33
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
What our method does by computing this thing--omega to -1 times xi--

34
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
we find the best solution to the relaxation of those rubber bands.

35
00:02:16,000 --> 99:59:59,999
That, to me, is sheer magic.
