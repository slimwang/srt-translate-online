1
00:00:00,006 --> 00:00:04,026
Now we just said that points B and D, are special because they represent a

2
00:00:04,026 --> 00:00:08,640
switch in the direction of the slope of the function. Now speaking of general

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:13,680
behavior of the function, I'd like you to tell me, what its domain is and what

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:18,289
its range is. Now please note that even though I've written y equals this time

5
00:00:18,289 --> 00:00:22,551
instead of F of x equals. This is to remind you that the reason an equation is a

6
00:00:22,551 --> 00:00:27,070
function is not because of what we choose to call the dependent variable. It's

7
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:32,680
because of the way that this expression over here involving x's maps the inputs

8
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:37,118
to the output. This is in fact a function, and we can write that in a more

9
00:00:37,118 --> 00:00:41,951
technical way by saying y equals f of x. In other words the real function of x

10
00:00:41,951 --> 00:00:46,767
is this expression over here. The one that's taking all the inputs of x and

11
00:00:46,767 --> 00:00:50,953
modifying them to create the output which is y. Just on the side to make sure

12
00:00:50,953 --> 00:00:54,115
you understand the notation here, what purpose it serves and how all these

13
00:00:54,115 --> 00:00:58,456
different things are connected. So back to the function itself, please write the

14
00:00:58,456 --> 00:01:02,363
domain and the range using interval notation in these two boxes.
