>> Try solving this mixture problem. You have 10 liters of a chemical mixture

2
00:00:03,807 --> 00:00:07,527
that is 8% water, and you want to add to that a mixture that is 15% water to get

3
00:00:07,527 --> 00:00:11,445
a mixture that's 10% water. How much of the 15% mixture should you use? One

4
00:00:11,445 --> 00:00:15,867
thing that you should notice in mixture problems is that the percentage of your

5
00:00:15,867 --> 00:00:20,290
final mixture must be in between the percentage of the other two mixtures. The

6
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:24,853
10% falls in between the 8% mixture and the 15% mixture. This makes sense

7
00:00:24,853 --> 00:00:29,746
because we can only come up with the percentage that would be between these two.

8
00:00:29,746 --> 00:00:34,044
I couldn't make a 60% solution from an 8% water solution and a 15% water

9
00:00:34,044 --> 00:00:37,250
solution because, well, these two would be too low.
