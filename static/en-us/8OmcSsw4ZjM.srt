1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:03,190
So what is a medium fidelity prototype?

2
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:05,380
And how does it differ
from a paper prototype,

3
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:06,890
like the one you've been working with?

4
00:00:08,048 --> 00:00:09,890
The main difference that is relevant for

5
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:13,590
us at the moment, is the idea of
interactivity and clickability.

6
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:18,090
When we worked with the paper prototype,
we had to indicate to users

7
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:20,570
what happened when they
clicked a given button, and

8
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:23,850
we had to be able to guide them when
they were confused by our layout.

9
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:26,350
For our next iteration,

10
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:29,480
we'll be building a clickable
interactive prototype.

11
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:34,170
That means, that we could hand a user
the prototype, ask them to do a task and

12
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:35,130
then get out of the way.

13
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:39,930
When they click on the screen,
the app will move to the right place.

14
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:42,170
When they reach their destination,
it should be clear.

15
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:47,290
It's important to remember, that this
doesn't mean that we have a beautiful or

16
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:48,796
well designed prototype yet.

17
00:00:48,796 --> 00:00:50,902
We don't have animations.

18
00:00:50,902 --> 00:00:53,000
We don't have perfect lines set up.

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,690
And we don't have a final look for
the app.

20
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:59,710
In fact, for our medium fidelity
prototype, it's possible to simply take

21
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:03,570
your paper prototype, draw it in
marker on a piece of paper, and

22
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:05,440
import it into a prototyping software.

23
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:09,950
The key here is having primary
navigation points, which enable you to

24
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:13,640
get feedback on whether a user can
achieve your intended task of the app.
