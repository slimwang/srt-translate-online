1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:03,040
It's time to work on
our weather app again.

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:05,950
It's time for
you to display some real data.

3
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:08,119
Well, sort of real data.

4
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:10,520
There are two parts to this task.

5
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:15,090
One, simulate the server injecting
the initial weather forecast

6
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:17,420
into the app js file.

7
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:19,930
You can copy the initial
weather forecast data

8
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:22,570
from the instructor notes below.

9
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:28,380
Second, modify the code to display the
weather data as soon as the app loads.

10
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:31,350
When you're done,
the app should load quickly and

11
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:33,900
immediately display
the initial weather data.

12
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:38,840
And, don't forget to try your
app in multiple browsers.

13
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:41,290
How does it work in Firefox,
Safari, etc?

14
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:46,390
Be sure to compare your app to the link
in the instructor notes below,

15
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:48,350
to make sure it works exactly the same.
