1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,870
So you see, even finding formal criteria to tell you if

2
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:04,820
software is doing something malicious

3
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:06,370
that you don't want it to do,

4
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:09,800
that's very difficult, but let's assume you had found those formal criteria.

5
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,240
Now my question for you would be

6
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:14,650
What would be the problem with automated classification of a program as malware

7
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:17,430
from a theoretical computer science perspective?

8
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:19,190
So even if you had formal criteria

9
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:22,400
that defined exactly what malware is,

10
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,140
so are the issues here that

11
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:27,350
automated malware detection is an NP complete problem?

12
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:30,680
Is it automated malware detection undecidable?

13
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:34,330
Or is it that automated malware detection can never be perfect?

14
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:37,900
That means you will always have programs that are not malware

15
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:40,050
that will be classified as being bad

16
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:42,010
or other programs that are malware

17
00:00:42,010 --> 99:59:59,999
but will basically slip through the net or slip by this program here.
