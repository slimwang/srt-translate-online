00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:02,818
The final strategy we'll look at,

2
00:00:02,818 --> 00:00:07,344
is a combination of server side
rendering and making an AJAX request.

3
00:00:07,344 --> 00:00:10,866
Instead of pre-rendering
the data into the markup,

4
00:00:10,866 --> 00:00:14,630
the server injects the data
into the app's JavaScript.

5
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:20,680
Because it keeps the data
separate from the user interface,

6
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:23,140
it works well with the app shell model.

7
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:27,080
We've eliminated the need for
an extra HTTP request.

8
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:32,340
But, we still need to run a little bit
JavaScript in order to display the data.

9
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:34,080
Then when things have cached,

10
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:38,810
we can ignore that bit and easily make
an AJAX request for more recent data
