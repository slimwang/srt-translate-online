00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:03,880
When building an app that uses
location services like this,

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:07,240
there are a number of events that
happen in the app lifecycle,

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:11,140
in addition to the usual
activity lifecycle events.

4
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:14,580
Let's take a look at the entire
set of events, one by one, and

5
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:17,160
specify what we need to do in each.

6
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,970
First of course, is the OnCreate method.

7
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:21,860
We've implemented this already.

8
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:25,170
This is called when our
activity is created.

9
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:28,095
In this we set up the GoogleApiClient.

10
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:33,200
And we tell it to use
location services and

11
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,890
the location of the call backs to call
when stuff happens on the client.

12
00:00:38,172 --> 00:00:41,410
Once OnCreate has done its thing
the app will start running.

13
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:46,810
And because we're using asynchronous
callbacks on the GoogleApiClient

14
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:50,610
more functions are going to fire
while the client is running.

15
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:56,650
So immediately after OnCreate Android
calls the OnStart activity.

16
00:00:56,650 --> 00:00:59,360
And in this we will tell
the GoogleApiClient

17
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:04,260
again to start connecting
to location services.

18
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:08,580
Depending on the relationship
between the client and

19
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:12,030
the location services,
one of three things will happen.

20
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:17,270
If it connects successfully
the OnConnected callback will fire.

21
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:19,720
We'll look at this in a moment.

22
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:24,090
If it fails,
the OnConnectionFailed will fire.

23
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:28,260
If it was previously connected, but

24
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:32,120
something has gone wrong with
the connection causing it to suspend,

25
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,220
then the OnConnectionSuspended
will fire.

26
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:40,980
You need to implement all three of these
functions or your app won't compile.

27
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:44,960
So be sure at the very least to put a
logging line in the ones that you don't

28
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:49,250
want to write detailed code for yet,
for example the OnConnectionFailed and

29
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:51,190
the OnConnectionSuspended.

30
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:53,310
Now let's look at OnConnected.

31
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:57,805
In this method, we'll create
a new LocationRequest object.

32
00:01:57,805 --> 00:02:01,440
We'll set its priority,
we'll set its interval, and

33
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:06,170
then we'll start requesting
updates from Location Services.

34
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:07,980
We'll see what that code
looks like in a moment.

35
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:13,360
Now when the Location Services see
a new location for the device,

36
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,900
they will then give a callback
to OnLocationChanged, and

37
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,970
this will give you a location object.

38
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:24,940
This object, you can parse with
details about the location,

39
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:26,450
such as the latitude and longitude.
