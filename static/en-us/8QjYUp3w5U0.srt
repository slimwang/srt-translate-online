1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,189
Okay. Let's move on and now we're going to

2
00:00:02,189 --> 00:00:04,900
talk about HTTP. If you recall, this was what

3
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:06,490
we described as the main protocol of the

4
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:09,630
Web. This is what your browser uses to talk

5
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:12,860
to the, to Web servers. HTTP stands for

6
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:17,320
HyperText Transfer Protocol. The request from your browser for

7
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:22,850
the URL www.example.com/foo, begins with a request line, it'll

8
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:25,350
look something like this. This is the request line,

9
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:28,360
now HTTP is a, a very simple text

10
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,970
protocol. So, this text is sent over the Internet

11
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:33,020
to the server, just like this, it's human readable

12
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:37,032
too. The request line has three main parts. First

13
00:00:37,032 --> 00:00:42,490
there's the method, next is the path and finally

14
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:45,072
is the version. The method is what type of

15
00:00:45,072 --> 00:00:47,810
requests are making to the server. The most common

16
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:50,380
method by far is GET. And this is how

17
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:53,670
you GET a document from the server. Other popular

18
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:57,080
methods are GET and POST. There are other ones, but

19
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,040
these are the ones we're going to use in the

20
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:01,540
class. Next is the path. In this case, it's /foo.

21
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:04,810
You remember this from the URL. But the path

22
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:08,170
and URL comes here. This is the actual document we're

23
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:11,360
requesting from the server. And finally is the version. It's

24
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,570
always http/ and then a version number. Most browsers and

25
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:18,690
servers these days speak at 1.1, but we'll also

26
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:24,225
touch on 1.0 a little bit in this class. Because

27
00:01:24,225 --> 00:01:26,330
1.0 has, you know, a few uses of its

28
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:30,100
own. Now, you're wondering where the host name is in

29
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:32,720
this request line? It's not here. All that's here

30
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,940
is the path. We're connected to this host, your browser

31
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:38,160
connected to this host. Or, if we're playing around

32
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,570
with HTTP, we made the connection. But that's how we

33
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:42,790
know where we are. So that's, this is used for making

34
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:46,440
the connection, and the path is used for making the request.

35
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,840
Let's have a quick quiz.

36
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:56,300
Given the following URL, example.com/foo/logo.png?P=1#tricky, what

37
00:01:56,300 --> 00:02:02,653
is the request line to get this URL using HTTP 1.1?
