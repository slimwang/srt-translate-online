1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:04,070
Okay, this is getting to be a lot
of stuff about IP addresses,

2
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:06,370
why do we care so
much about them anyway?

3
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:10,640
So, all traffic on the Internet is
split up into messages called packets.

4
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:14,990
And each packet has the addresses of its
source or sender and it's destination or

5
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:17,460
intended recipient on it.

6
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:21,420
When you use Ping, you're sending a
steady stream of packets to a particular

7
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:25,490
destination and hopefully,
you're getting a steady stream back.

8
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:26,480
So each server or

9
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:31,240
other host that you want to talk to,
it needs to have a distinct IP address.

10
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:35,370
Now, that would be fine, but
there aren't enough IP addresses for

11
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:37,140
all the computers today.

12
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:41,890
Remember, there's about 4 billion IPv4
addresses available for hosts, and

13
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:44,420
there's 7 billion people on the planet.

14
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:48,310
To make it worse, big institutions that
have been on the internet since forever

15
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:51,150
are using way more than their
fair share of addresses.

16
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:55,221
And the addresses to people ratio in
the US is actually a lot higher than

17
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:59,368
the rest of the world, especially
Latin America, Asia, and Africa.

18
00:00:59,368 --> 00:01:02,090
At the end of this lesson I'll tell
you more about how we're fixing

19
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:03,260
this problem.

20
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:06,610
But before we get there I have to
confess that I've been lying to you

21
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:07,210
about something.
