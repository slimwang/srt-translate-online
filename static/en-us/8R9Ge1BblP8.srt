1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:04,348
Depending on what address you chose,
you might see some different results.

2
00:00:04,348 --> 00:00:07,770
But for www.udacity.com, or Google,

3
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:11,630
or a bunch of other sites,
it's going to to be the first option.

4
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:15,110
What's happening is that NC
tells the operating system,

5
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:16,367
connect to that address.

6
00:00:16,367 --> 00:00:19,330
And the OS is trying,
trying very hard, but

7
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:21,930
it can't get through because
that port's not open.

8
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:23,970
All that traffic is
just getting dropped.

9
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:27,330
But as it's trying to get through,
it sends these packets slower and

10
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:29,780
slower until finally it gives up.

11
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:33,350
The reason for the slowing down is
because one of the common causes of

12
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:34,830
packet loss is congestion.

13
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:38,380
And the one thing you don't want to do
in case of congestion is send faster.

14
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:40,530
So the answer we observed
here is number one.
