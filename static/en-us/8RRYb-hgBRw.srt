1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
To summarize the correlation coefficient, which you're just about to learn about,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:12,000
is a value between -1 and 1, tells us how related or correlated two variables are

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
and both 1 and -1 stand for perfectly linear data.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
In the case of +1, we know that this line increases in x and y simultaneously

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
whereas for -1, we have the inverse effect.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Let's compute r--my favorite way to compute it is very similar

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
to the way we computed b in linear regression.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
It looks like the sum of all data points and takes the product of (xi-x-bar)

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:46,000
and multiplies for each data point this with (yi - y-bar) and then, we have to normalize.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
This could be any value. It isn't between ±1.

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:01:03,000
We normalize by a √(x-x-bar)² sum of all i's times the same expression for y.

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Now this looks a little bit wild, and this is probably the worst formula

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
you've encountered in this class in terms of complexity but once you dived in,

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
you'll realize this is really related to a lot of stuff you've seen before such as variances and similar.

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
This is the quintessential term that occurs in the variance calculation of x.

16
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
All that's missing is the normalizer.

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Same over here, this is the variance of y--this thing is the normalizer.

18
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
We take the product of the variance of x and the variance of y modally with the normalizers

19
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
and we get something quadratic even in variance space.

20
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,000
This over here is kind of a mixed variance. This is often called the covariance.

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
But notice that there is also a normalizer in this thing over here.

22
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
In fact, the missing normalizers on top and bottom of this bar

23
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
can't see each other out; hence, I just omitted them.

24
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:57,000
But this one is just like the variance calculation but it mixes x's and y's whereas these are x² and y².

25
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
This is called often covariance if you've normalized, because

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
it is the variance calculation of a two co-occuring variables.

27
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
These are the variances.

28
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
So what this really tells you is kind of the ratio how much these two things co-evolve,

29
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:17,000
how much the errors correspond versus normalized by the multitudes of errors individually

30
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
and whether the ratio becomes 1, we have a perfect correlation.

31
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:27,000
When the ratio becomes 0, then the numerator is 0 which means our errors cancel each other out.

32
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
That is very different for x and for y under any linear model.

33
00:02:30,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So this complicated formula is what's called the correlation coefficient r. So let's try this out.
