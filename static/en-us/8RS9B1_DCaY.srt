1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Which of these differential equations should we be using to model heat loss.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
We're introducing two constants here, the ambient temperature of 300 K

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and time constant for the heat loss of say 2 minutes.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Should the rate of change of our temperature be that temperature minus the ambient temperature

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
divided by the time constant or just our temperature divided by the time constant,

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
or the difference the other way around divided by the time constant,

7
00:00:27,000 --> 99:59:59,999
or just the ambient temperature divided by the time constant.
