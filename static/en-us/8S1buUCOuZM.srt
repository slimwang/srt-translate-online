1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,410
Maybe your product requires a physical distribution channel.

2
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:08,010
Let's take a look at all the choices that you might have when you start a company.

3
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:16,710
The first one is you might be an OEM. OEM stands for original equipment manufacturer.

4
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:22,960
You might have a component. Let's say a graphics chip that goes inside of someone else's laptop.

5
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:28,740
So you might be a graphics supplier to Apple or Hewlett-Packard.

6
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:34,500
But it's Apple's and HP's name and their brand that shows up on the outside of the box.

7
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:38,530
And so while you're making money, it is their marketing and brand.

8
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:43,320
So for a system integrator, you might be selling to a company. Let's say you're Cisco.

9
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:47,100
But you're selling to somebody who's building an entire telephone switching network

10
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:51,440
and this system integrator would take your component, your switches and routers,

11
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:57,430
and actually build out a system that includes devices from other companies and they add some

12
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:03,430
value-added software and additional hardware and create an entire system for an end user.

13
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:10,030
A value-added reseller might take a computer system and other pre-packaged softwares

14
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:14,160
from other third-party vendors and maybe some utilities of their own

15
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:19,820
and sell a turnkey solution to an end user and so they build less complex systems

16
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:24,250
with less value added than system integrators but they could be great partners.

17
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:29,240
In a physical channel, a direct sales force are sales people that work for you directly

18
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:33,030
and typically sell directly to the end user.

19
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:38,100
Now if you're delivering a physical product, one of the alternate channels that you might

20
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:42,140
want to consider is the web or online sales as well.

21
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:48,410
So for some industries, distributors play a pivotal role in the distribution of the product.

22
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:51,100
They provide wholesale and warehousing.

23
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:55,320
They provide distribution and accounting, bill collection, etc.

24
00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:01,490
And distributors might sell to dealers. Most dealers are just simply storefronts.

25
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:06,430
Some of them might actually add some service or support but they're essentially an extension

26
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:11,310
of the distribution channel, and they talk to the end users.

27
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:16,900
So dealers might not have a physical storefront for end-user customers,

28
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:22,400
but retailers are all about main street and talking to your customers.

29
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,440
Another form of retailer are mass merchants.

30
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,940
So instead of just small storefronts, they aggregate tens or hundreds of thousands

31
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:31,930
of products under one roof.

32
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:35,100
Retailers and mass merchants often, though not always,

33
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:40,341
get their products supplied through distributors.
