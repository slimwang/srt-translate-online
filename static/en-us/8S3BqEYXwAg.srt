00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,090
Okay, looks like users are making
accounts on our backends, so

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:04,600
that's cool.

3
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:07,130
But, none of them can actually login.

4
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:10,540
Before my roommates start a riot,
let's add some login functionality.

5
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:13,720
Here's a quick overview of what happens
behind the scenes when you login with

6
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:14,860
Firebase.

7
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:17,780
In the code for your app,
you'll call authWithPassword().

8
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:20,800
This sends a message to your
online Firebase database to try to

9
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,180
authenticate the user.

10
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:25,750
The online Firebase database has
a hidden credential data store,

11
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:27,840
which includes hashes of emails and

12
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,620
passwords of users that have
been created in your Firebase.

13
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:34,510
Firebase is doing the hard work of
actually checking the credentials.

14
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:38,630
And if successful, it creates something
called an AuthData object and

15
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:39,650
adjacent web token.

16
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:42,332
This adjacent web token,
also called a JWT,

17
00:00:42,332 --> 00:00:46,365
is a token that is automatically
stored for you by the Firebase SDK.

18
00:00:46,365 --> 00:00:48,497
It gets stored in local storage for
you app, and

19
00:00:48,497 --> 00:00:50,650
this arrives between
between app reloads.

20
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:54,600
It's this token that allows your user to
stay logged in even if they close and

21
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,780
then reopen the app.

22
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:58,560
Then again, this part is
automatically taken care of for you.

23
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:02,382
So you don't really need to worry about
JWTs or doing anything with them.

24
00:01:02,382 --> 00:01:03,690
The AuthData object,

25
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:07,390
on the other hand, is something that's
explicitly returned to your code.

26
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:10,005
And it's an object that contains
basic data about the user.

27
00:01:10,005 --> 00:01:13,125
So then when you get the AuthData
object back in your app,

28
00:01:13,125 --> 00:01:15,860
you can use this data to update your UI.

29
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:19,890
As a developer, from your vantage point,
all you really have to do is call this

30
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:23,080
method here and
then get a AuthData object back.

31
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,580
The rest of this is handled by Firebase.
