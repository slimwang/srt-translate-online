00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
[Thrun] It's really interesting to compare this to the situation over here.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
In both cases I'm happy, as shown over here,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and I ask the same question, which is whether I got a raise at work, as R over here.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
But in one case I observe that the weather is sunny; in the other one it isn't.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
And look what it does to my probability of having received a raise.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
The sunniness perfectly well explains my happiness,

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:41,000
and my probability of having received a raise ends up to be a mere 1.4%, or 0.014.

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
However, if my wife observes it to be non-sunny, then it is much more likely

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
that the cause of my happiness is related to a raise at work,

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:58,000
and now the probability is 8.3%, which is significantly higher than the 1.4% before.

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
This is a Bayes network of which S and R are independent

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
but H adds a dependence between S and R.

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Let me talk about this in a little bit more detail on the next paper.

14
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
So here is our Bayes network again.

15
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
In our previous exercises, we computed for this network

16
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:29,000
that the probability of a raise of R given any of these variables shown here was as follows.

17
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The really interesting thing is that in the absence of information about H,

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
which is the middle case over here,

19
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
the probability of R is unaffected by knowledge of S--

20
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
that is, R and S are independent.

21
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
This is the same as probability of R,

22
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:56,000
and R and S are independent.

23
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,000
However, if I know something about the variable H,

24
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
then S and R become dependent--

25
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:15,000
that is, knowing about my happiness over here renders S and R dependent.

26
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:23,000
This is not the same as probability of just R given H.

27
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Obviously, it isn't because if I now vary S from S to not S,

28
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
it affects my probability for the variable R.

29
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
That is a really unusual situation

30
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
where we have R and S are independent

31
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:50,000
but given the variable H, R and S are not independent anymore.

32
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:58,000
So knowledge of H makes 2 variables that previously were independent non-independent.

33
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Offered differently, 2 variables that are independent may not be in certain cases

34
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
conditionally independent.

35
00:03:08,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Independence does not imply conditional independence.
