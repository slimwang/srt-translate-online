00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,969
The process of configuration is also related to planning.

2
00:00:03,969 --> 00:00:07,780
You can consider a planner that actually generates the plan in this plan

3
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:12,670
obstruction hierarchy. But then for any plan in this plan obstruction hierarchy,

4
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:17,260
then it converts a plan in this plan obstruction hierarchy into a skeletal plan.

5
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:20,670
It drops the values of the variables in the plans and constructs it

6
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:25,540
into a plan it's simply specify the variable without specifying the values.

7
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:29,130
The process of configuration planning then, takes these plans,

8
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:32,740
organizes them into obstruction hierarchy and goes about [INAUDIBLE] shading and

9
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:36,470
refining and expanding them. We already discussed how configuration is

10
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:40,960
connected to a number of other lessons like case based reasoning, planning and

11
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,000
classification. You may also consider this plan to be kind of strict for

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,880
physical object. In addition, this plans have been learned,

13
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:53,260
through learning methods similar to the method of incremental concept learning.

14
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:56,530
In addition, this plan hierarchy might be learned through learning methods

15
00:00:56,530 --> 00:01:00,830
similar to the method for incremental concept learning. One of the things that

16
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:05,129
we are doing in knowledge based AI is, to describe the kinds of knowledge that

17
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:10,210
we need to learn. Before we decide on what is a good learning method, we need to

18
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:15,720
decide on what is it we need to learn? The configuration process tells us

19
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:20,180
of the different kinds of knowledge that then become targets of learning.

20
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:23,480
To connect this lesson back to our cognitive architecture,

21
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:27,110
consider this figure once again. So knowledge of the prototypical chair,

22
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:30,690
as well as knowledge about the radius, plans, and the abstraction hierarchy

23
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:35,190
are stored in memory. As the input gives specification with the design problem,

24
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:40,390
the reasoning component instantiates those plans, refines them and expands them.

25
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:45,080
The knowledge itself is learned through examples of configuration of

26
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:48,927
chairs that presumably, the agent is already encountered previously.
