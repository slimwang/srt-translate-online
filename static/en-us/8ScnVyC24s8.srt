00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,498
This is an African pouched rat. They're particularly good at detecting TNT and

2
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:10,996
landmines. They're trained using something called tea eggs, which have TNT in

3
00:00:11,008 --> 00:00:16,491
them. TNT is an explosive found in many land mines. If the African pouched rats

4
00:00:16,503 --> 00:00:21,702
were able to find the tea eggs. They were given a food reward. But if they

5
00:00:21,714 --> 00:00:26,386
scratched near tea eggs that did not contain TNT, then they did not receive a

6
00:00:26,398 --> 00:00:31,335
food reward. Scratching near the tea eggs was considered the indicator response.

7
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:36,377
The researchers found that the training was very successful in teaching the rats

8
00:00:36,389 --> 00:00:41,265
to detect real landmines in the field. This was measured by the number of meters

9
00:00:41,277 --> 00:00:47,021
of land cleared by explosives. And by the number of landmines that they found.

Based on this study, what can we say is true?
