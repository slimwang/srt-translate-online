00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,810
Physiologically, stimulants can increase your heart rate, your blood pressure,

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:08,984
and your respiration. They can also decrease your appetite. Now, it's important

3
00:00:08,984 --> 00:00:12,798
to know that this increase in heart rate is really dangerous. Some people have

4
00:00:12,798 --> 00:00:15,806
actually died the very first time they've ever used a major stimulant such as

5
00:00:15,806 --> 00:00:21,005
cocaine or methamphetamine. Long-term consequence of using the major stimulants

6
00:00:21,005 --> 00:00:26,162
such as cocaine and methamphetamine also result in formication. And this is the

7
00:00:26,162 --> 00:00:30,342
feeling of little bugs crawling under the person's skin. As a result, people

8
00:00:30,342 --> 00:00:33,938
often pick and scratch at their skin, which results in open wounds and

9
00:00:33,938 --> 00:00:39,830
increased likelihood for infection. Another consequence is called meth mouth.

10
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:42,452
And I recommend that you Google that and you can see some unfortunate

11
00:00:42,452 --> 00:00:47,627
descriptions of what that is. Finally, long term use of these major stimulants

12
00:00:47,627 --> 00:00:53,003
in some people, can result in what is called stimuli-induced psychosis. And

13
00:00:53,003 --> 00:00:56,318
here, the individual thinks and behaves somewhat similarly to somebody with

14
00:00:56,318 --> 00:01:00,935
schizophrenia. Some of the other long term consequences of major stimulant use

15
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:06,003
are hypervigilance, sleep deprivation, anxiety and paranoia. Long-term

16
00:01:06,003 --> 00:01:09,928
methamphetamine use can also dramatically age you. If you Google faces and

17
00:01:09,928 --> 00:01:15,382
meth, you can see just how dramatically meth can affect your appearance. When

18
00:01:15,382 --> 00:01:19,470
people abuse the major stimulants, they often go on what is called a run.

19
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:22,053
Meaning, they'll continuously take the drug and stay awake for maybe two to

20
00:01:22,053 --> 00:01:26,345
three days at a time. Now, we know that our bodies simply can't stay awake that

21
00:01:26,345 --> 00:01:31,140
long and eventually the person will crash. Due to the crash, they're going to

22
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:37,080
experience depression, extreme fatigue, and sometimes even suicidal thoughts.

23
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:40,984
In addition, because the person starts to undergo withdrawal, they usually

24
00:01:40,984 --> 00:01:45,408
begin drug-seeking behavior again. Now, let's go back and take a review of the

25
00:01:45,408 --> 00:01:46,690
major stimulants.
