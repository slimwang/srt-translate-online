00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Here's my answer--we extract the factor and then just take

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
the square root of the variance divided by the length of the list.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
This is exactly the formula I gave you. When you run this you get the desired answer.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Finally, I will add the hypothesis for example h equals 200.
