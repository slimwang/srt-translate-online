>> The last three choices are correct, and they're all really saying the same

00:00:03,608 --> 00:00:07,380
thing. If two equations are equivalent to one another, then they have all the

3
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:11,148
same solutions. And if they have all the same solutions, and if they have all

4
00:00:11,148 --> 00:00:15,042
the same solutions, then they graph all the same points, which means they graph

5
00:00:15,042 --> 00:00:16,274
exactly the same curve.
