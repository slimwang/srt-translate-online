1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:04,210
On the left he puts what most people often think of as the first part of

2
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:07,310
this process, acquiring and munging data.

3
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:11,190
And often this is what takes the most time.

4
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:15,260
On the right, Ben places interactive data visualization,

5
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:18,960
which is typically what people think of as the final product.

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,650
A pretty chart, a graphic once all the hard work has been done.

7
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:28,180
Ben places the domain he thinks most naturally fits above each stage.

8
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:32,189
The first of which being computer science.

9
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:37,180
In the larger context of data visualization, or data science as a whole,

10
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:42,412
the acquire and parsing stages are often concerned with data ingestion

11
00:00:42,412 --> 00:00:48,250
be it web scraping, log collection, database accesses, et cetera.

12
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:54,540
And building scalable extract transform and load pipelines, or ETL.

13
00:00:54,540 --> 00:01:00,810
A second group here of filtering and mining represents what is often most

14
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:05,980
associated with data science, and many people consider it the most exciting.

15
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:11,130
This includes modeling, data mining, and exploratory analysis, and

16
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:15,670
applying statistical and mathematical theory to discover insights.

17
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:16,790
Because of this,

18
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:22,955
Ben Fry labels the second stage as associated with statistics and data mining.

19
00:01:22,955 --> 00:01:25,970
While people often think the second stage is, so

20
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:29,490
to say, where the magic happens and the models are built.

21
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:34,070
I really want to stress the importance of the process as a whole.

22
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:34,780
After all,

23
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:40,300
if you didn't have any data in a readily accessible form, you couldn't model it.

24
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:43,690
And even once you have a model, if you can't present and

25
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:45,470
communicate your results.

26
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:47,610
They might as well never have happened.

27
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:52,070
The third stage here focuses on the visual representation of your data, and

28
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:56,750
how you present it graphically, thus is most associated with

29
00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:00,030
the fields of graphic design and visualization theory.

30
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,670
It is in this third stage that we experiment with different visual encodings to

31
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:07,870
present our data in the most effective manner.

32
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:13,220
And the fourth stage here is concerned with how a reader or

33
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:16,530
your audience might interact with your visualization.

34
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:20,560
Techniques from the field of information visualization and

35
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,580
human computer interaction apply here,

36
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:28,620
to determine how best to design your graphic or visualization such that it

37
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:32,810
enables your user to potentially discover insights for themselves.
