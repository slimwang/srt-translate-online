00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,400
You've arrived at another
practice session.

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:05,100
This time we'll be revisiting
the robot maze application, and

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,740
adding new features that gives
our robot the ability to

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,450
think more intelligently
about the world around it.

5
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:14,250
We'll do this by exercising all the new
things we've learned about control flow

6
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:14,890
and methods.
