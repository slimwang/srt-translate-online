00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,180
Here are the changes that we made
to the makeHttpRequest method

2
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:05,520
in the Tsunami app.

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,050
If the response code is not 200,

4
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:12,300
then we log the error response
code using the log.e method call.

5
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:17,260
Should this happen, we'll see the error
logged in logcat with the log tag

6
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:21,600
main activity, followed by
the message Error response code: and

7
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,300
then the numeric response code.

8
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,260
We also do similar in
the doInBackground method,

9
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:31,460
which may throw an I/O exception when
trying to close the InputStream.

10
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:34,230
We can verify that this log message
statement will be created by

11
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:36,630
intentionally creating
a bad request URL.

12
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,420
Notice these miscellaneous
characters here.

13
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:41,850
When we run the app,

14
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:44,320
we'll get an error when we try
to connect to the invalid URL.

15
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,170
As you can see here,

16
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:50,280
we see a red error message appear in
the logs with the response code 400.

17
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,630
Okay, great,

18
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:55,810
we verified that the log message gets
called when the request is unsuccessful.

19
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:59,167
The second task was to log the error
when we catch an I/O exception.

20
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:03,650
We can verify that this code path gets
executed by putting our phone into

21
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:04,920
airplane mode.

22
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,880
That will definitely cause an exception
when we try to connect to the Internet

23
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,400
to get results.

24
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:12,570
When we run the app,
no earthquake information shows up.

25
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:16,330
However in the logs,
now we see our error message stating,

26
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:18,970
problem retrieving
the earthquake JSON results.

27
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:21,640
So we know that an I/O exception
was thrown and caught.

28
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,313
Great work with logging errors.

29
00:01:23,313 --> 00:01:26,860
It's a good practice to
follow as a developer.

30
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:29,400
If you want to reference the final
state of the Tsunami app code,

00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,610
