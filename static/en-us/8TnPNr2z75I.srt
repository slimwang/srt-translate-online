1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,790
Now the data science and artificial
intelligence have a lot in common.

2
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:05,290
Everything we just heard
from Dave was about

3
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:07,570
building models to understand data.

4
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:09,349
Artificial intelligence as Sebastian and

5
00:00:09,349 --> 00:00:13,410
Ashok described was about intelligently
reacting to incoming data.

6
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:15,930
If you recall the axis that Ashok drew,

7
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:19,380
in machine learning we're interested
specifically in thinking optimally.

8
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:22,420
We don't necessarily want to design
systems that think the way we do.

9
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:24,750
We want to design systems
that think better than we do.

10
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:25,640
At least in some ways.

11
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:28,530
We want to design systems that
can learn from much larger

12
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:31,420
quantities of data much
more quickly than we can.

13
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:34,240
That's why we covered Bayes' Rule
in data science here as well.

14
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:37,190
Machine learning is largely about
looking at the data we have and learning

15
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:41,460
the mechanisms that gave rise to it
are learning the models that explain it.

16
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:43,650
So let's move on to
machine learning itself.

17
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:46,960
Let's start by hearing from Sebastian
Thrun and Katie Malone from

18
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,690
Udacityâ€™s own
machine learning class.
