00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,490
As you're becoming a more discerning programmer, at least a more tasteful one,

2
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:06,890
there's something about this that should still really bother you, in addition to

3
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:10,239
the fact that Dave is not getting eaten any more. We've got a big chunk of

4
00:00:10,239 --> 00:00:13,746
duplicated code here. Well, it's only one line, but it could be a lot more,

5
00:00:13,746 --> 00:00:17,307
depending on what you have to do to actually eat someone. If the victim is not

6
00:00:17,307 --> 00:00:21,455
named Dave, both the Discerning Bear and the regular bear and the regular

7
00:00:21,455 --> 00:00:25,255
Grizzly Bear do the same thing. We had to cut and paste that code to get that

8
00:00:25,255 --> 00:00:29,568
behavior here. What we'd like is a way to be able to access the original eat

9
00:00:29,568 --> 00:00:33,990
method of bear from inside the method we're writing to override that method. We

10
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:37,190
could change the name here, but that wouldn't solve our problem because then

11
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:40,240
inside chase which is defined inside grizzly bear, we would get the wrong

12
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:43,338
method. So we can't change the name of this method. It still needs to be called

13
00:00:43,338 --> 00:00:46,985
eat, but we want a way of accessing the eat method of bear. To do this, we need

14
00:00:46,985 --> 00:00:51,688
a special operator, which is the super operator. What super does is it takes A

15
00:00:51,688 --> 00:00:56,422
class and an object, and it returns a special proxy. This is sort of like an

16
00:00:56,422 --> 00:01:01,786
object, except it ignores the new definitions provided by class. What this means

17
00:01:01,786 --> 00:01:06,466
is we can replace the code here with a call to super, passing in discerning bear

18
00:01:06,466 --> 00:01:11,045
and self, and that will mean We're ignoring the overridden eat method. So now

19
00:01:11,045 --> 00:01:14,231
when we get the eat method, we're going to get the eat method from the

20
00:01:14,231 --> 00:01:18,184
GrizzlyBear class, which turns out, is the eat method it inherited from the Bear

21
00:01:18,184 --> 00:01:22,345
class. And the one requirement is that the object that's passed in must be an

22
00:01:22,345 --> 00:01:23,609
instance of the class.
