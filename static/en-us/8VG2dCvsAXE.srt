00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:01,705
So, here's the next question I want to ask

2
00:00:01,705 --> 00:00:05,890
you, simple true or false question. Does it make sense

3
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:09,530
to repeat an attribute along any given path in

4
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:12,910
the tree? So, if you we pick some attribute like

5
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:16,230
A, should we ever ask a question about A

6
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:19,880
again? Now, I mean something very specific about, by that.

7
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:22,590
I mean, down a particular path of the tree,

8
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:25,690
not just anywhere else in the tree. So, in particular,

9
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:29,000
I mean this. So, I ask a question about A, then

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,870
I ask a question about B, and then I ask a

11
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:34,810
question about A again. That's the question I'm asking. Not whether

12
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:37,890
A might appear more than once in the tree. So, for example,

13
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,470
you might have been the case where A shows up more

14
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:46,440
than once in the tree, but not along the same path.

15
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:49,140
So, in the second case over here, A shows up more

16
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,295
than once, but they really don't really have anything to do with

17
00:00:51,295 --> 00:00:54,200
one another because once you've answered B, you will only ever

18
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,080
ask the question about A once. So, my question to you is,

19
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:01,040
does it make sense to repeat A more than once along

20
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:04,750
a particular path in the tree? Yes or no? Answer the question.
