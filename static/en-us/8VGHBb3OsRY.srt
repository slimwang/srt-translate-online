1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,230
At the end of the previous video, we ended up the following iteration.

2
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:06,770
We proposed reduced feature set that uses only

3
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:10,920
the most influential features on interselection time of Starburst.

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:13,830
We then evaluated how well that new updated model worked out.

5
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:18,060
We were able to refine our model to address the overfitting issue.

6
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:20,990
However the linear regression model we chose clearly was not

7
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:23,800
capturing the spikiness of the behavior that we observed.

8
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:27,450
We can use the diagram depiction of the history of our analysis to

9
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:30,210
more rigorously identify options forward.

10
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:32,259
We might continue using linear regression.

11
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:34,440
And return to the feature selection stage.

12
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,755
We initially chose the complete set of interselection times.

13
00:00:37,755 --> 00:00:39,680
Then used the reduced set.

14
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,460
We can revisit this phase by including terms of higher order thus making it

15
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,230
a polynomial regression.

16
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:48,720
Alternatively we could attempt to represent the regression estimator with

17
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,080
a different model altogether.

18
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:54,290
Specifically we might try neural networks or kernel density estimation.

19
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:57,820
We might find that producing a point estimator is too high a level of

20
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:01,120
precision altogether to be supported by the data we have, and

21
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:05,319
instead try to recast as a different statistical inference problem.

22
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:07,940
For example, we can conduct a hypothesis test for

23
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:10,790
interselection times between Starbursts and Airheads.

24
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:14,580
To provide a degree of confidence that they are not of the same popularity.

25
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:18,490
The thing to notice is, because we've kept track of the decisions we've made

26
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:22,540
along the way, we're able to easily identify new possible paths.
