00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,529
It turns out for this graph, it's impossible to tell. We can see that the

2
00:00:03,529 --> 00:00:07,482
intersection occurs somewhere in this region and it looks like it's about right

3
00:00:07,482 --> 00:00:11,196
here. We're not on a grid line or a certain point, so it's really hard to tell

4
00:00:11,196 --> 00:00:15,121
or determine just from the graph. So we need some sort of other method to figure

5
00:00:15,121 --> 00:00:15,636
this out.
