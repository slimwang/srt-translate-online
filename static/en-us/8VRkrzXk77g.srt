1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,310
Okay David, what did you have for
the first sentence?

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:05,990
>> So for the first sentence, I created
the predicates lays eggs, feathers, and

3
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:08,940
reptile, and
said if the animal lays eggs and

4
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:13,450
the animal does not have feathers
that implies the animal is a reptile.

5
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:16,900
For the second one,
I said if the animal has feathers or

6
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:20,710
the animal has talons that implies
that the animal is a bird.

7
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:25,040
So animal feathers or
talons, feathers or talons.

8
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:27,402
For the third,
which is a longer one, I said,

9
00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:31,099
if the the animal lays eggs and the
animal has a beak and the animal flies,

10
00:00:31,099 --> 00:00:35,270
all three of these all in a chain,
that implies the animal is a duck.

11
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:38,230
And similar for the fourth one, we have
three predicates on the left side.

12
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:40,720
If the animal lays eggs,
the animal has a beak, and

13
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:43,920
the animal does not fly,
then the animal is a Platypus.

14
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,740
This guy shows us why a platypus is
such a strange animal because we need to

15
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:50,050
make a lot of caveats in order to
find what a platypus really is.

16
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:52,240
>> Good David, that looks right to me.

17
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:56,880
So to wrap this part up, let us note
that when we defined what a predicate

18
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:01,790
was, we set up a predicate like
Flies can map into true or false.

19
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:04,670
Well okay,
a predicate can map into true or false.

20
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:08,460
What about complicated sentences like
this, which are multiple predicates,

21
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:10,370
as well as, implications?

22
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:15,950
How do we find out whether the sentence
as a whole maps into true or false?

23
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:17,620
That's what we're going to look at next.

24
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:18,700
We're looking at truth tables.
