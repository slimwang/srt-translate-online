Although the first option of randomly assigning pregnant woman to an

00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:07,500
experimental group. And giving them cocaine would give us excellent

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:12,360
experimental control. We have to remember about ethics and it would be

4
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:17,280
unethical to force woman to take cocaine. It would also be unethical to give

5
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:21,830
cocaine to babies to see what it does. That leaves us with the option of

00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:27,410
finding women. Who used cocaine while they were pregnant. Then, we can study

00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:31,074
their babies. That would be most ethical.
