00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,394
Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is one of the most common childhood

2
00:00:04,394 --> 00:00:09,082
disorders in the United States. And it can continue into adolescence and

3
00:00:09,082 --> 00:00:13,376
adulthood. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, symptoms

4
00:00:13,376 --> 00:00:17,034
include difficulty staying focused and paying attention, difficulty in

5
00:00:17,034 --> 00:00:22,980
controlling behavior and hyperactivity. Let's look at three types of symptoms.

6
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:27,221
First we have inattention. Someone who has symptoms of inattention can be

7
00:00:27,221 --> 00:00:31,486
easily distracted. They may miss details or forget things and they frequently

8
00:00:31,486 --> 00:00:36,135
switch from one behavior activity to another. They can become bored with a task

9
00:00:36,135 --> 00:00:38,925
after only a few minutes, unless they are doing something that they really

10
00:00:38,925 --> 00:00:43,540
enjoy. This means they can have trouble completing or turning in homework

11
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:47,828
assignments. They often lose things needed to complete a task, and they seem to

12
00:00:47,828 --> 00:00:52,455
not listen when spoken to. Furthermore, they may daydream, become easily

13
00:00:52,455 --> 00:00:57,553
confused, and even struggle to follow directions or instructions. A child who

14
00:00:57,553 --> 00:01:02,257
has symptoms of hyperactivity may squirm or fidget in their seat. Someone with

15
00:01:02,257 --> 00:01:06,129
symptoms of hyperactivity may talk nonstop. They may run around touching and

16
00:01:06,129 --> 00:01:09,824
playing with everything in sight. They have trouble sitting still at dinner, at

17
00:01:09,824 --> 00:01:13,660
school. And thus they may get in trouble from teachers as well as parents for

18
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:18,245
their hyperactivity. Now let's look at impulsivity. Symptoms of impulsivity

19
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:23,040
means a person may be very impatient. They may blurt out inappropriate comments

20
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,250
or show their emotions without restraint. And they may often act out without

21
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:31,260
regard for consequences. They may have difficulty waiting for things that they

22
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:35,557
want, and they may interrupt people's conversations or activities. Now as you

23
00:01:35,557 --> 00:01:38,905
can imagine, children experiencing a combination of these symptoms, can

24
00:01:38,905 --> 00:01:42,361
experience great difficulty in managing their day to day behaviors that are

25
00:01:42,361 --> 00:01:45,979
necessary, and needed for doing well in school, or interacting with others, and

26
00:01:45,979 --> 00:01:52,100
completing a daily routine. And not all attention deficit disorders will be

27
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:55,996
exactly the same. You'll see some who are more inattentive rather than

28
00:01:55,996 --> 00:02:01,201
hyperactive, and some who are more impulsive rather than inattentive. In order

29
00:02:01,201 --> 00:02:06,462
to be diagnosed with ADHD, one must meet a set of diagnostic criteria. That is

30
00:02:06,462 --> 00:02:10,550
comprised of a number of symptoms of this disorder. And now the causes of ADHD,

31
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:15,310
or Attention Deficit Hyper-activity Disorder, include a combination of genes,

32
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:21,654
and environmental factors. Now for a long time, people suspected that the

33
00:02:21,654 --> 00:02:27,032
consumption of sugar caused ADHD. However, there's no research that's provided

34
00:02:27,032 --> 00:02:28,679
support for that idea.
