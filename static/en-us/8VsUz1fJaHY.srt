00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,780
Let's fix one of our earlier toy
applications to better work with

2
00:00:03,779 --> 00:00:05,459
the Android life cycle.

3
00:00:05,459 --> 00:00:07,870
Our GitHub query application.

4
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:12,839
Open up exercise 5b, part 1,
and type in the query android.

5
00:00:12,839 --> 00:00:16,105
When we rotate the device the word
android from the added text is

6
00:00:16,105 --> 00:00:20,269
preserved, but the euro and
query results are thrown away.

7
00:00:20,269 --> 00:00:25,719
Because edit text can be edited by
users, they are preserved automatically

8
00:00:25,719 --> 00:00:29,399
by the Android framework during
a configuration change such as rotation.

9
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:32,009
Regular text views are not.

10
00:00:33,649 --> 00:00:35,129
So how can we fix this?

11
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:37,500
We can again use a saved instant state.

12
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:40,759
We'll create a static
final string key for

13
00:00:40,759 --> 00:00:46,619
storing the query URL, as well as a key
to store the raw JSON from the result.

14
00:00:46,619 --> 00:00:51,429
Then we'll override onSave instant
state to store the query URL and

15
00:00:51,429 --> 00:00:54,960
search results into
the saved state bundle.

16
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,870
Finally, in onCreate if the save
state bundle is not null

17
00:00:58,869 --> 00:01:03,140
we retrieve the values and
restore the text to both views.

18
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:04,560
And here's how that app works now.
