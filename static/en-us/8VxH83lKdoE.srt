1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:04,356
Assuming the sample represents the full
distribution well, you might guess that

2
00:00:04,356 --> 00:00:07,535
the asymptotic cost of a sample
sort are similar to a bucket sort.

3
00:00:07,535 --> 00:00:09,941
That is true, but only sort of.

4
00:00:09,941 --> 00:00:11,892
[SOUND] Sort of?

5
00:00:11,892 --> 00:00:13,960
Get it?
Ha-ha.

6
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:16,620
Suppose there are P
processes in the system.

7
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:20,670
With respect to P, what's the largest
asymptotic scaling term in the running

8
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:23,180
time of a distributed sample sort?

9
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:26,460
That is, if you were to compute
the running time of the sample sort and

10
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,580
you looked at all
the factors that involved P,

11
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:31,940
the largest factor will have
which of these options?
