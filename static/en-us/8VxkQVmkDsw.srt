1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:04,410
So when we ran the pipeline,
we saw a number of different colors.

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:07,388
We saw Blue,
which meant a step had not yet been run.

3
00:00:07,388 --> 00:00:10,600
We saw Tellow for
steps that were currently running.

4
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:12,540
Green for ones that had succeeded.

5
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:15,320
And if you saw one that was Red,
that would mean a step that was failing
