1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:06,580
So the, these three conditions that Jared has come up with

2
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:11,830
about whether it's available, whether it hasn't been requested by somebody else

3
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:17,619
and the one that we had before concerning age correspond to three conjuncts.

4
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:22,100
You know, three, three possibilities that all must hold. And

5
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:26,560
as we talked about a minute ago we could have three separate preconditions, or

6
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:31,270
we could have one precondition with three, with, with two ands separating

7
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:37,300
the three parts of it. The other thing to note in the expression of it is.

8
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:44,950
We've use some new operation names, in expressing it.

9
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:50,798
So we said, is available. Now, is available is not one that came

10
00:00:50,798 --> 00:00:55,800
out of the process of building the [UNKNOWN] class diagram. But that's okay.

11
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:01,110
It's like. Breaking the writing of a a method into, into pieces and

12
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:05,390
calling other methods along the way. Okay it's, it's just divide and

13
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:09,580
conquer. So, we're going to assume we can invent the names of these convenient

14
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:15,800
operations. And, that simplifies the, not only the writing here, but

15
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:20,080
the reading as well, if we're trying to show the requirements to the customer.
