00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,390
The set up is simple. All you need is an Android

2
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:06,610
device, a USB cable, and your development machine. Let's take a look.

3
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:12,200
Before you get started you need to turn on the Developer Mode

4
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:15,760
in your Android device. This may be different on any given device

5
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:18,160
and you can check your device's manual on how to do this.

6
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,020
In many cases though, you need to go to your device's settings,

7
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:29,730
click on About Device and then click on Build Number seven times.

8
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:38,800
Seriously. Next you'll want to turn on USB debugging. Again, this varies slightly

9
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:43,110
on your given device, but this is usually located in the developer options.

10
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,080
We also need to make sure we have the right tools installed. On my

11
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:52,440
laptop, I have Chrome Canary and on

12
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,920
my mobile device, I have Chrome Beta installed.
