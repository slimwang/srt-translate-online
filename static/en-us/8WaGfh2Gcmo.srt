1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:02,590
Now, we shouldn't be doing
additional work on the main thread

2
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:04,280
that isn't necessary, right?

3
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:07,210
So, let's leave that thread
only to handle user input and

4
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:08,720
drawing to the screen.

5
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,550
Now this is a good intuition in general,
but for the sake of this example,

6
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:15,890
let's see if we can optimize this
function to run much faster and

7
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:20,040
have less computer overhead using one of
those handy techniques called shared.

8
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:21,950
So let's go ahead and
cache intermediate values.
