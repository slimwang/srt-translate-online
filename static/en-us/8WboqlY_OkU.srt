00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,310
>> So, here's a quiz using this notion of conditional

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:05,020
independence. So, bear with me for a second, because this is

3
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:07,530
a little bit weird the way that I wrote it. But,

4
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:10,440
what I'd like you to do is find a truth setting

5
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:14,444
for thunder and lightning. So like, true/true or true/false or false/true

6
00:00:14,444 --> 00:00:18,590
or false/false. Such that, the following thing holds true. That the

7
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:23,070
probability that thunder takes on that value, given that lightning takes

8
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:26,090
on the value that you give, and the storm is true,

9
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:29,260
ends up equaling the probability that thunder takes on

10
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:31,666
that value given lightning takes on the value that you

11
00:00:31,666 --> 00:00:35,207
gave and storm is false. Right, so a setting

12
00:00:35,207 --> 00:00:37,670
here so that basically the value of storm doesn't matter.

13
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:41,250
>> So, whatever I put in the upper left box

14
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:42,700
has to be what I put in the lower left

15
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:44,340
box. What I put in the upper right box has

16
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:45,610
to be what I put in the lower right box.

17
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:48,090
>> Right and in fact we're just not going to give you boxes for the

18
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:51,100
other ones. We'll just give you the two top boxes and automatically fill in the

19
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:51,540
bottom box.

20
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:52,960
>> Okay, that seems reasonable.
