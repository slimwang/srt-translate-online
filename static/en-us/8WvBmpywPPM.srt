1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,626
So I think this leaves us in a position
where we can actually state the TD(1)

2
00:00:03,626 --> 00:00:04,630
update rule.

3
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:07,830
So it looks a little hairy, but we're
going to be able to go through it and

4
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:11,820
see that it does something very
sensible, or at least somewhat sensible.

5
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,380
So this is the structure of the rule,
of TD(1).

6
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:18,050
So for each time we start a new episode,
we're going to initialize this thing

7
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:21,620
called the eligibility,
e(s) for all the states, to 0.

8
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:25,300
So we just start them off as
ineligible at the start of the episode.

9
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:29,120
And we start off our estimate for
the value function for this episode,

10
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:32,110
to be initialized to whatever it was
at the end of the previous episode.

11
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:32,940
>> That makes sense.

12
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:37,784
>> So then, each time we take a step
within the episode, a step from some

13
00:00:37,784 --> 00:00:43,133
St-1 to some state St, getting reward
rt, what we're going to do is first,

14
00:00:43,133 --> 00:00:46,998
update the eligibility of
the state that we just left.

15
00:00:46,998 --> 00:00:50,997
Then go through all the states, compute
this one quantity which is the same for

16
00:00:50,997 --> 00:00:53,430
all states,
this is the temporal difference.

17
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:57,870
This is the sum of the reward
plus the discounted

18
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:02,260
value of the state that we just got to,
minus the state that we just left.

19
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:06,250
And we're going to use the values that
we had from the previous iteration,

20
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:07,480
previous episode.

21
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:10,060
That's going to be our
temporal difference.

22
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:13,070
And we're going to apply that
temporal difference to all states,

23
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:15,070
proportional to the eligibility
of those states,

24
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:17,200
and of course the learning rate,
because we don't want to move too much.

25
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,880
And we're just going to
update them by that.

26
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,440
We're going to increase them by
this temporal difference times

27
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,490
the eligibility.

28
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:26,860
Then we decrease, or decay,
the eligibility for those states.

29
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:29,280
And then we're back up to the next step.

30
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,437
>> Okay it's got all
the right letters so

31
00:01:31,437 --> 00:01:34,280
I think I can imagine that
this will do something.

32
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:40,750
So, the for all S part, does that
have to be done in specific order?

33
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:44,032
>> No, because the S's are all
being done in parallel here.

34
00:01:44,032 --> 00:01:48,010
So the value at state S is going to be
updated based on this quantity, which is

35
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:52,566
the same for everybody, doesn't depend
on which S we're currently updating, and

36
00:01:52,566 --> 00:01:56,570
this quantity which is specific
to the S that we're looking at.

37
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:59,440
So it's all kind of happening
in parallel without any

38
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,690
dependencies between them.

39
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:01,786
>> Yeah, okay, I see.

40
00:02:01,786 --> 00:02:06,041
So because there's an order to the
states and the way we're going to visit

41
00:02:06,041 --> 00:02:10,270
them, you basically get to see that
value kind of applied everywhere.

42
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:11,875
Okay, okay, I think I understand.

43
00:02:11,875 --> 00:02:12,715
>> Okay, all right,

44
00:02:12,715 --> 00:02:16,715
so let's kind of step this
through in a tiny little example.

45
00:02:16,715 --> 00:02:18,345
And then see the magic of it,

46
00:02:18,345 --> 00:02:21,935
see that it actually produces the same
outcome that we would have gotten with

47
00:02:21,935 --> 00:02:23,995
the update rule that had
talked about previously.

48
00:02:23,995 --> 00:02:24,495
>> Okay.
