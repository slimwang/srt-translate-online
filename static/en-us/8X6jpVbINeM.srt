1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,930
It seems like the simplest thing
we could do from our Android app.

2
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:06,440
Would be to add a single piece of
data to the Firebase database.

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,670
If you remember,
here's my shopping list screen, and

4
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:11,090
I got this floating
action bar button here.

5
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:12,870
It's supposed to add a shopping list.

6
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:15,595
When you press it you've got the nice
dialogue, you can enter a name.

7
00:00:15,595 --> 00:00:18,793
[BLANK_AUDIO]

8
00:00:18,793 --> 00:00:21,380
But when you press
Create it does nothing.

9
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:26,040
Let's have it store the name for the
shopping list I enter here, in Firebase.

10
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:28,060
Whenever we interact
with our Firebase data,

11
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:30,250
we need to create a Firebase object.

12
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:31,040
This object,

13
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:36,210
here, is tied to a specific Firebase
database that's specified by this URL.

14
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:37,020
Right before this,

15
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:41,230
you should have saved your URL in
a constant that we called FIREBASE_URL.

16
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:45,890
So for us, we can use the FIREBASE_URL
constant as a argument, here.

17
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:49,630
Now this Firebase ref object here has a
lot of methods that you can call on it.

18
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:52,010
Many of these methods we're going to
go over in detail and they're all

19
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:54,980
referenced in the Firebase DOCs which
I've linked in the instructor notes.

20
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:57,910
The two that we're interested
in right now are the child and

21
00:00:57,910 --> 00:00:59,465
the .setValue method.

22
00:00:59,465 --> 00:01:03,695
Your online Firebase database stores
everything as key value pairs.

23
00:01:03,695 --> 00:01:07,005
What this code will do is make
whatever is put here the key and

24
00:01:07,005 --> 00:01:08,995
whatever is put here the value.

25
00:01:08,995 --> 00:01:12,835
So, if we were to type "listname"
right here, we'd be making a new

26
00:01:12,835 --> 00:01:16,535
data entry in Firebase, or node,
that had the key of "listname", and

27
00:01:16,535 --> 00:01:18,980
then we'd set it to
whatever value it has here.

28
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:21,170
I'm going to go ahead and
do this in the code.

29
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:25,200
The code that I'm interested in
is inside AddLIstDialogFragment.

30
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,320
Specifically, when you
hit the "Create" button,

31
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:30,840
it calls this addShoppingList method,
which is currently blank.

32
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,870
So, what I'm going to do is
make a new Firebase reference.

33
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:37,640
And I'm going to pass in the constant
that I made for the Firebase_URL.

34
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,290
And then I'm going to
take that reference.

35
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:44,540
And I'm going to say,
go to a child called ListName.

36
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:45,370
That's going to be our key.

37
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:47,390
And I'm going to say
set the value there.

38
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:52,263
And what I'm going to set it to is
what the user entered in the text

39
00:01:52,263 --> 00:01:54,270
view of that dialog.

40
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:55,659
And if I scroll up.

41
00:01:55,659 --> 00:01:58,364
[BLANK_AUDIO]

42
00:01:58,364 --> 00:02:00,317
We already have an instance
variable up here,

43
00:02:00,317 --> 00:02:03,150
storing in reference to
the EditText in that dialogue.

44
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:04,120
So scrolling back down,

45
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:09,150
I'm going to set this string to
what's stored in the EditText.

46
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:11,730
And then I'm going to pass
that string in right here.

47
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:14,650
Okay, let's run this code.

48
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:16,260
Okay, so I've got the code up and
running.

49
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:19,730
I'm also going to go ahead and
open up my Firebase dashboard.

50
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:22,048
Okay, now moment of truth,
I'm going to click the plus button.

51
00:02:22,048 --> 00:02:28,330
And I'm going to type in a list name,
and well, I

52
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:31,200
don't want to ruin the surprise of what
happens when I click that create button.

53
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,000
So go ahead and try this yourself and

54
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,221
tell me, what do you see on
the Firebase dashboard here?
