All species with the genus name, Homo, indicates a form of human. And our

2
00:00:05,464 --> 00:00:10,294
closest human relatives are technically neanderthals or Homo neanderthalensis,

3
00:00:10,294 --> 00:00:16,445
even though they recently went extinct several tens of thousands of years ago.

4
00:00:16,445 --> 00:00:21,065
Homo erectus and Homo habilis, our more distant human relatives, but they went

5
00:00:21,065 --> 00:00:27,356
extinct a long time ago. It turns out that our closest living relatives are in

6
00:00:27,356 --> 00:00:33,224
fact chimpanzees. One of the main ways we know that humans are most closely

7
00:00:33,224 --> 00:00:37,128
related to chimps is that a remarkable amount of our genetic information

8
00:00:37,128 --> 00:00:45,506
between humans and chimps is the same. An amazing 98%. But those few genetic

9
00:00:45,506 --> 00:00:49,660
differences are responsible for the important structural differences,

10
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:56,230
especially with regards to the brain, which is what makes us uniquely human.

11
00:00:56,230 --> 00:01:02,019
This change over time is referred to as evolution. And it's achieved through a

12
00:01:02,019 --> 00:01:07,686
well-established mechanism of mutation and natural selection. Let's learn a bit

13
00:01:07,686 --> 00:01:10,229
more about how natural selection works.
