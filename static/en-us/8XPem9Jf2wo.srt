1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:03,130
If you experimented a lot
with the knock back we added,

2
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:06,210
you may have noticed that while being
flung through the air you could still

3
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:07,800
kind of control your movement left or
right.

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:13,070
You could either slow down or
speed up, how fast you're flung away.

5
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:17,180
Also, if you're so lucky as to be
knocked back in such a way that you

6
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:21,110
landed on a platform,
you just slid right off it.

7
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:23,650
Neither of those behaviors make
much sense, so let's fix them.

8
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:28,520
First, we need to set GigaGal's
horizontal velocity to zero when she

9
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:29,440
lands on a platform.

10
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:32,409
There we go.

11
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:36,210
Second, we need to add a new
jump state called recoiling

12
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:39,810
that disables the left and right
controls while GigaGal is flying through

13
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:41,150
the air after being hit by an enemy.

14
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,329
Check out the to do's in the course
code, first to make sure that GigaGal

15
00:00:46,329 --> 00:00:49,510
doesn't just slide off of
platforms when she lands on them.

16
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:52,350
And second to disable
the arrow keys when GigaGal is

17
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:54,160
flying through the air after
being hit by an enemy.
