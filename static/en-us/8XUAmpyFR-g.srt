1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:04,035
So you have all of these numbers,
strings, and booleans, but

2
00:00:04,035 --> 00:00:06,115
what are you supposed to do with them?

3
00:00:06,115 --> 00:00:10,865
All of this data you've worked with so
far has been for a one time use only.

4
00:00:10,865 --> 00:00:15,280
You define the string, Hello,
it's returned and that's it.

5
00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:16,429
That's the end.

6
00:00:16,429 --> 00:00:18,530
The string Hello is now gone.

7
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:21,520
>> You need a way to be able to store
data, so that you can use it or

8
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:22,989
change it later.

9
00:00:22,989 --> 00:00:25,599
To do this, you can use variables.

10
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,242
You've probably heard of variables
before, maybe in a math class.

11
00:00:29,242 --> 00:00:32,980
Let's say you have a variable called X,
and it's assigned the value 5.

12
00:00:32,979 --> 00:00:36,521
And then let's say we have
the expression X + 1.

13
00:00:36,521 --> 00:00:41,989
Since X has a value of 5, we can
substitute the value of 5 in for X.

14
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:45,902
So the expression becomes 5 + 1 = 6.

15
00:00:45,902 --> 00:00:48,564
>> In JavaScript, variable stored data,

16
00:00:48,564 --> 00:00:52,649
much like how the variable you
just saw stored the value of 5.

17
00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:56,356
And they're not limit to
the storing just numerical values,

18
00:00:56,356 --> 00:00:58,720
you can store any data in two variable.

19
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:03,919
To create a variable, use the var
keyword followed by the variableName,

20
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,670
and the assignment operator.

21
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:08,239
The assignment operator
is the equal sign.

22
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:10,489
And then on the right side
of the assignment operator,

23
00:01:10,489 --> 00:01:13,250
put the value you want to
assign to the variable.

24
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:16,069
As an example, here's my cat Zoe.

25
00:01:16,069 --> 00:01:20,629
We can use a variable called name and
set it equal to the string Zoe for

26
00:01:20,629 --> 00:01:21,819
her name.

27
00:01:21,819 --> 00:01:25,379
And for her age,
we can create a variable called age, and

28
00:01:25,379 --> 00:01:28,000
set that to the number 4,
since Zoe's 4 years old.

29
00:01:29,379 --> 00:01:32,060
Eventually, when Zoe
has her next birthday,

30
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:36,469
I'll be able to use the age variable I
created to increment Zoe's age by 1, so

31
00:01:36,469 --> 00:01:39,819
the variable age will return
Zoe's updated age of 5.

32
00:01:39,819 --> 00:01:41,279
Now, Zoe's 5 years old.
