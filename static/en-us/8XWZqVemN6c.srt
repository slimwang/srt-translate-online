00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,680
There are multiple ways to do this, but here is the one I chose. I chose to

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:07,370
make one printf statement for each row. We want eight spaces with the number of

3
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:12,430
cookies, followed by a vertical bar. Followed by eighth spaces with the number

4
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:17,780
of boxes of cereal. Followed by another bar, followed by the name. I'll need to

5
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:21,056
print all three variables, so I'll include them as parameters separated by

6
00:00:21,056 --> 00:00:26,364
commas. The format string will start with int value, so I'll use a d. And it'll

7
00:00:26,364 --> 00:00:32,780
be eight wide, so I have 8. Then, that vertical bar, then the decimal value,

8
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:38,407
percent f with a width of 8 and 2 decimal places and then the string. The

9
00:00:38,407 --> 00:00:41,543
formatting string will look the same for my row and for cay's row, but I'll use

10
00:00:41,543 --> 00:00:46,098
cay's variables instead of mine. Since I'm using this pattern twice, maybe I

11
00:00:46,098 --> 00:00:49,923
would want to make a variable for it. And call it, Row Pattern or something

12
00:00:49,923 --> 00:00:54,540
like that, but since I'm only using it twice, I'm going to leave it for now. So

13
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:58,923
far it looks like I'm eating all of the cookies on my own. But I haven't

14
00:00:58,923 --> 00:01:02,216
surveyed all of my coworkers yet, the answer could change. Now, if I'm going to

15
00:01:02,216 --> 00:01:04,900
collect more data, I may want to change my program to use a scanner to take in

16
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:10,050
input and put it in the table. We'll leave that for now though.
