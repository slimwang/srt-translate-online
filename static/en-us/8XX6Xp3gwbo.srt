00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,070
So that ends our,
our discussion on direct depth sensing.

2
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:07,490
Probably six, seven years ago,

3
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:10,340
I wouldn't have even mentioned it
anymore because light striping was sort

4
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:14,080
of relegated to sort of
assembly line machine vision.

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,670
But with the advent of the Kinect and
other types of such sensors, and really,

6
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:22,690
robotics putting geometry back as
a first class computer vision problem.

7
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:25,880
Depth sensing has become
a big deal again.

8
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:29,230
And since many of the manipulations
are similar to what we do with images,

9
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:31,220
it made sense to consider
it within computer vision.
