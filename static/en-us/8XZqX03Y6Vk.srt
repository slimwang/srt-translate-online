1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,752
So now, remember that we said approximately 95% of sample means will fall

2
00:00:04,752 --> 00:00:09,478
between this interval. 2 times sigma divided by the square root of n is

3
00:00:09,478 --> 00:00:15,166
approximately our margin of error. But let's now use exact values. So, in any

4
00:00:15,166 --> 00:00:19,918
normal distribution where the mean is mu, we know that approximately 95% of the

5
00:00:19,918 --> 00:00:27,720
data is within two standard deviations of the mean. But what's the exact number

6
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:31,833
of standard deviations that bounds 95% of the data?
