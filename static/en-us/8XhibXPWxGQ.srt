00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,759
Let's see how we got 4. If we know twice a number added to 7, we know how to

2
00:00:04,771 --> 00:00:09,881
write twice a number. Twice a number means 2 times the number. I'm going to use

3
00:00:09,893 --> 00:00:14,419
n as the variable this time. So if I had 2 times the number, or twice the

4
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:19,259
number, added to 7 means plus 7. And it's equal to 5 less When I see 5 less,

5
00:00:19,374 --> 00:00:24,573
that means I'm going to be subtracting 5 from whatever comes after, is equal to

6
00:00:24,585 --> 00:00:29,806
5 less than 5 times the number. So, here we have twice the number added to 7 is

7
00:00:29,818 --> 00:00:35,042
equal to 5 less than 5 times the number. Now that we've translated our words

8
00:00:35,054 --> 00:00:40,695
into an equation, we can simply solve this equation. First thing I'm going to do

9
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:46,040
is subtract 2 n from both sides, and I get 7 is equal to 5 n minus 2 n is 3 n

10
00:00:46,052 --> 00:00:51,435
minus 5. And now, I just add 5 to the both sides and I get 12 is equal to 3 n.

11
00:00:51,561 --> 00:00:57,147
Now I have 12 equals 3 n. So all I need to do is divide both sides by 3 and I

12
00:00:57,159 --> 00:01:02,376
get n is equal to 12 divided by 3, which is 4. That wasn't too bad was it? Let's

13
00:01:02,388 --> 00:01:03,348
try another one.
