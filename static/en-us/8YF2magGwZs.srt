1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:01,510
In this last scenario,

2
00:00:01,510 --> 00:00:05,750
you're creating a mobile web app called
vicarious concerts for people who like

3
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:09,660
to compare concert videos shot by
random people in the audience.

4
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,590
Each video takes a few seconds to load,
so

5
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:15,920
you decide to show a spinning
record icon, like this one.

6
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,100
In place of each video
while it's loading.

7
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:23,200
Should you use an animated .gif or
an animated SVG for this record icon?

8
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,660
And should you inline the spinner, or

9
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:27,140
should you set its srcs
to an external file?

10
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:28,530
Answer both questions to continue.
