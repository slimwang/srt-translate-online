1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,060
We can do the same thing in two dimensions also.

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:05,600
So, here is a different pepper image.

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:06,420
Right?

4
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:09,320
This is a little chunk of the pepper image.

5
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:10,600
Happens to have some garlic in it too.

6
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:11,420
All right.

7
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:13,690
Taken right sort of from here.

8
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:18,180
I could do normalized correlation of this small patch on the whole image.

9
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:19,190
And I can plot that.

10
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:21,950
And when you do you get this answer.

11
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:24,740
All right. You see this little spike here?

12
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:29,550
That's what happens when the filter lands right on the spot in the image that it

13
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:30,700
was taken from.

14
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:33,290
You get this, again, the positives line up with the positives,

15
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:34,820
the negative line up with the negatives.
