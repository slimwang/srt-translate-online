1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:02,730
So here we are on the Jenkins console,

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:05,700
and this is a build pipeline with
a bunch of automatic steps in it.

3
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:09,500
If this build, starts whether
automatically or manually,

4
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,090
it will run each of
these steps in order.

5
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:14,910
But let's say we want to add
a manual step, for instance,

6
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:17,810
this might a be a point at which
a human QA tester will need

7
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:20,540
to approve a particular build for
release.

8
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:23,030
To do that,
we'll need to do a few things.

9
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:27,280
First, we need to decide where that step
will be inserted into this pipeline.

10
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:28,530
We might decide, for instance,

11
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:33,400
that we want it to after tasks
are run but before their release.

12
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:36,078
Second, we need to
write the step itself.

13
00:00:36,078 --> 00:00:41,900
We'll set it up to just echo a message
to the logs, just as a demonstration.

14
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:45,680
So in the new step,
in the build trigger section, well,

15
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,430
we want this to be a manual step,
so it isn't triggered by anything.

16
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:54,364
Then we go to the step that we
want to be before the manual step.

17
00:00:58,902 --> 00:01:01,595
And we set it to have
a post build action,

18
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:04,924
which will build other
projects manual step, and

19
00:01:04,924 --> 00:01:08,745
we specify the downstream
project as being our new step.

20
00:01:09,865 --> 00:01:14,617
Now, in the pipeline view, we can see
the new step, but we want the release

21
00:01:14,617 --> 00:01:18,628
step to be after the manual QA step,
so let's change that too.

22
00:01:24,351 --> 00:01:26,962
Instead of being triggered
by the Test step,

23
00:01:26,962 --> 00:01:29,924
the release will now be
triggered by the ManualQA.

24
00:01:29,924 --> 00:01:30,950
Save that.

25
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:33,000
Go back to the Pipeline.

26
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,660
And now we have them in the right order.

27
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:37,599
And when we run it, well,
let's see what happens.

28
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:43,080
So you can see, the later steps turn
blue and the first one turns yellow,

29
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:47,630
then green, and
the colors change on down the pipeline.

30
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:51,090
And when it gets to the manual step,
it'll wait for

31
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:54,620
us to manually run it,
and it's all green.

32
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:56,030
So, now it's your turn.

33
00:01:56,030 --> 00:02:00,510
In your Jenkins instance, add a step
to a pipeline, set the preceding step

34
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:04,160
to have it as a post-build manual step,
change the following step

35
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:07,970
to have the manual step as a build
trigger, and then run the pipeline.

36
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:10,100
What do you think all those
different colors actually mean?
