00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,746
Up to this point, we've learned many ways to solve quadratic equations. In this

2
00:00:03,746 --> 00:00:08,036
lesson, we'll use those same techniques to solve problems involving area and

3
00:00:08,036 --> 00:00:12,738
perimeter. Now, remember area is the amount of space in square units that a

4
00:00:12,738 --> 00:00:16,573
closed plane figure takes up, whereas the perimeter is the distance measured

5
00:00:16,573 --> 00:00:22,670
around the object in units. We could be measuring in feet, in miles or even in

6
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:26,620
inches. As a quick review, what are the equations for the area and the

7
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:31,852
perimeter for these two rectangles? Write the expression for the area here, and

8
00:00:31,852 --> 00:00:36,090
write the expression for the perimeter here. Also, be sure you use the

9
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:41,000
variables w and l in each of the expressions. Good luck.
