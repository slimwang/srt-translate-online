00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:04,050
In this lesson, I'm going to introduce
the concept of stereo photography.

2
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:06,910
So far,
we've concentrated on individual images.

3
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:09,040
We've learned a lot of
techniques to process and

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,740
merge these images together but now,
we're going to take a specific instance

5
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:17,040
of a pair of images like our two
eyes that look at the same scene.

6
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:20,670
What can we do with this paired,
a stereo pair of images,

7
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:24,200
to extract more information about
a scene and then more importantly,

8
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:26,640
how can we leverage it to do
computational photography?
