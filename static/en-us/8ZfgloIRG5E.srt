The Central Nervous System is responsible for our brain and spinal cord. The

00:00:03,776 --> 00:00:07,208
Peripheral Nervous System is responsible for our cells outside of the Central

3
00:00:07,208 --> 00:00:11,516
Nervous System. And the Peripheral Nervous System is divided into the Somatic

4
00:00:11,516 --> 00:00:16,160
Nervous System, which is responsible for processing our sensory information.

5
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,808
And the autonomic nervous system, which is responsible for our involuntary

6
00:00:19,808 --> 00:00:23,780
systems. And this is divided into the sympathetic nervous system, which is

7
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:29,044
responsible for our fight or flight response. And the Parasympathetic Nervous

8
00:00:29,044 --> 00:00:31,899
System, which helps bring us back to normal.
