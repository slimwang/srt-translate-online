00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:02,480
Now I know we're in
the technology age but

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,885
I don't want you to forget about
offline groups and events.

3
00:00:05,885 --> 00:00:10,220
They're great ways to expand your user
base and to improve your branding or

4
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:12,810
if you do it right, generate some PR.

5
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:16,560
As for industry events, you can have
a booth at a relevant conference.

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,380
You could be active in meetups.

7
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:20,240
You could even host relevant events.

8
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,980
Now, if you have the resources,
hosting events is a great thing for

9
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:25,410
a few different reasons.

10
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:28,140
One, it can help you attract
talent to join your team.

11
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:31,300
Or it can help you find writers
to feature you in an article.

12
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:35,390
If you're a business to business or
B2B company, hosting events in a topic

13
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:39,370
that attracts your potential customers
is also a great way to gain users.
