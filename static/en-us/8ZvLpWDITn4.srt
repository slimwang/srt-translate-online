1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,380
This is a little bit of a judgement call to say exactly which ones you

2
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:05,140
think are low information.

3
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:07,930
because it kind of depends on what you're looking for.

4
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:09,980
But here are a few that are classically just not

5
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:11,110
going to have that much information.

6
00:00:13,586 --> 00:00:16,756
The word the. The word the shows up in almost every message that you're ever

7
00:00:16,756 --> 00:00:17,600
going to see.

8
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,950
So the fact that the word the shows up doesn't really tell you what

9
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:23,110
the message is about, because it's always going to be there.

10
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:27,220
I would say the same thing is probably true of the word will.

11
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:28,312
And in this context also,

12
00:00:28,312 --> 00:00:31,920
where we're looking at emails, I bet the word hi occurs a lot.

13
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,830
And so seeing the word hi doesn't necessarily tell you anything very

14
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:37,240
specific about what the message is about.

15
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:40,850
You could've also said that Katie and Sebastian are low information words,

16
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:43,880
because every message has these two words in them.

17
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:47,250
All the messages are about Katie and/or Sebastian, so

18
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:50,040
knowing that those words are there isn't necessarily telling you anything.

19
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:53,130
But I would argue that usually names are something that you would want to

20
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:53,790
be able to keep.
