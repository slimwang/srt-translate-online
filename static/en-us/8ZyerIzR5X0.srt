1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,990
Next, we prove that
this reduction works.

2
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:08,039
Let f be a 3CNF formula with
n variables and m clauses.

3
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:12,190
And we'll let A and
k be the result of the transformation.

4
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:17,960
First, we show that if f is satisfiable,
then there's a subset of A summing to k.

5
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:20,270
Let t be the satisfying assignment.

6
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:23,280
Then we include yi in our set S,

7
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:28,300
if xi is true under the truth
assignment, and we include zi otherwise.

8
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:30,120
As for the g and h families,

9
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:34,790
if fewer than three literals of
a clause are satisfied, then include g.

10
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:38,310
If fewer than 2, then include h as well.

11
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:41,830
In total, the sum of these
numbers must be equal to k.

12
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:46,120
In the other direction, we argue that
if there is a subset of A summing to k,

13
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,410
then there's a satisfying assignment.

14
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:51,010
Suppose that S is a subset
of A summing to k.

15
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:55,080
Then the impossibility of
carrying the digits in any sum

16
00:00:55,080 --> 00:01:00,170
implies that exactly one of yi or
zi must have been set to true.

17
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:05,500
Therefore, we can define a truth
assignment, t where t of xi is true

18
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:08,580
if yi is included, and
it's false otherwise.

19
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:10,600
This must satisfy every clause,

20
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:14,830
otherwise there would be no way that the
total in the clause places could be 3.

21
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:17,670
All together,
we've seen that subset-Si, is an NP.

22
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,400
And we can reduce 3-CNFSAT,
an NP-complete problem to it.

23
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,690
So Subset-Sum must be NP-complete.
