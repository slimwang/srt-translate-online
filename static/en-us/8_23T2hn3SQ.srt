1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:02,360
And the answer is, the first and the

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:06,190
last. The first case is our original example, by

3
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:09,350
counting how many webpages point to our site. The

4
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:12,260
third, is like our second example. There's no sense

5
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:13,940
in having the process wait on some blocking

6
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:16,850
call, while there's other work to be done. Option

7
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:19,010
two however, merely being able to break code down

8
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:21,630
into procedures, is not a good indication of parallelism.
