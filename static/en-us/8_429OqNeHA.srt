1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:01,730
So to get us started,

2
00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:05,270
let's recall the basic elements
of computational photography and

3
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:09,260
the various stages that we actually
have looked at many times in this class.

4
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:13,060
Basically we have a 3D scene,
which is illuminated.

5
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:14,940
We want to actually
take the illumination,

6
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:18,470
use the optics to focus
it onto a sensor.

7
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:21,260
Sensor gives us information,
allows us to create images and

8
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:23,810
pixels that we can process
to improve the quality,

9
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:26,540
which is sent to a display and
then used by a user.

10
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:28,950
And this has basically been the pipeline
we have been looking at for

11
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:32,159
computational photography
throughout the class.

12
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:33,650
Let's look at it much more pictorially.

13
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:36,180
Again, we're trying to remember
what we have already looked at

14
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:37,710
previously in this class.

15
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:42,720
We can actually take a 3D scene like
this and illuminate it with a projector.

16
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,940
In this case projector
is a light source.

17
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:49,110
And to control this light source we can
put some sort of a controllable aperture

18
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:52,810
or modulator in front of it that,
basically, opens a different

19
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:56,740
regions here, or different regions of
this thing to illuminate the scene.

20
00:00:56,740 --> 00:01:00,880
So, in essence, we can now control how
the light is actually being entered

21
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:03,180
into the scene and
illuminating the scene.

22
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:07,420
On the other hand, we can do the same by
actually having a camera in the scene,

23
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:11,060
which is now capturing the light
illuminated by this light source.

24
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:13,830
And, of course,
we can also put a modulator,

25
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:18,000
a controllable aperture in front of
the camera which only allows a specific

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,850
light to go through in
different parts of this region.

27
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:23,840
Again, both of those
are controllable things.

28
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,680
And this was basically the idea we
had before of how we can control and

29
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,210
computationally control each and

30
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:35,690
every aspect of how light is shining
on a scene and how it can be

31
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:40,360
captured to create an image of different
types, a novel image sometimes.

32
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,280
So this has been something
we've looked at before.
