00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,150
You've already taken a look at the profile class, but so

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:06,470
far it doesn't define an entity. What you're going to be doing

3
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:09,160
now is going in and adding the annotations to make it

4
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:12,275
an entity. You can look for the places marked to do in

5
00:00:12,275 --> 00:00:15,640
profile.java, it's just a couple things you need to do. You

6
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:18,420
need to add the annotation to indicate that the class is

7
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:21,620
an entity, and when you've done that go ahead and write

8
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:26,170
the annotation here. You also need to add the annotation to indicate

9
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:28,940
that the user ID is a property that's

10
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:31,840
going to be used as a unique identifier for profile

11
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,920
entities. When you're done just go ahead and add

12
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:38,790
the annotation for identifying the unique ID field here.
