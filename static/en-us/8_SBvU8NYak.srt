1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:04,700
Now, let's say we have a random sample of ten people who each told us how

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:07,260
many hours they slept the night before and

3
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:10,860
their temporal memory score on the BBC test. Is

4
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:14,690
there a relationship between these two variables? Well,

5
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:17,870
it's very difficult to judge relationships based on

6
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:21,450
just lists of data. So let's visualize it.

7
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:25,800
This scatter plot visualizes the data in the table.

8
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,410
Each point represents one row of the table.

9
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:31,940
Here you can see that the hours slept

10
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:35,190
was about five and the temporal memory score

11
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:39,084
looked to be about 55. That must correspond

12
00:00:39,084 --> 00:00:44,706
to this row here, 56. You can see that hours slept is on the X axis and

13
00:00:44,706 --> 00:00:52,050
temporal memory score is on the Y axis. We call the variable on the X axis

14
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:57,840
the independent variable or the predictor variable. And we call the variable on

15
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,970
the Y axis the dependent variable, or

16
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:04,230
the outcome. We're trying to predict temporal

17
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:07,780
memory score, using hours slept. Now that

18
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:10,740
you've sen this data visualized, what can

19
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:13,130
we say about the relationship between hours

20
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:17,540
slept and temporal memory score? This time

21
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:19,460
this question might be easier to answer.
