1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:02,740
So as we discussed, control data plane

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:05,710
separation can make it easier to manage the

3
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:09,410
data center by monitoring and controlling routes from

4
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:11,730
a central point and allowing virtual machines to

5
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:14,620
be migrated without renumbering host addresses. The

6
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:17,350
control data plane separation does not inherently make

7
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:19,410
it possible to build a data center with

8
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:22,560
few switches nor does it automatically balance load.
