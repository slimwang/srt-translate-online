1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:02,490
So if you've seen any of the other
interviews that I've done here at

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:05,360
Udacity, you'll notice that I'm
now sitting in the other chair.

3
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:07,510
And that's because today we're
talking about a topic that was part

4
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:10,420
of my dissertation research, which is
Exploratory Learning Environments.

5
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:12,590
So Jason has agreed to
give me my questions, and

6
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:13,800
interview me on the topic.

7
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:14,460
So thank you.

8
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:16,263
>> [SOUND] Absolutely,
anything for you David.

9
00:00:16,263 --> 00:00:18,795
I think I've said that
before in another video.

10
00:00:18,795 --> 00:00:22,683
So what makes exploratory learning
environments so powerful in education?

11
00:00:22,683 --> 00:00:24,665
>> So the reason I really like
exploratory learning environments in

12
00:00:24,665 --> 00:00:29,005
education is that they let us build
circumstances, or build situations,

13
00:00:29,005 --> 00:00:30,145
or build opportunities for

14
00:00:30,145 --> 00:00:34,155
students that are pretty hard
to have in a real classroom.

15
00:00:34,155 --> 00:00:38,720
Also in my dissertation research we did
in the context of middle school ecology.

16
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:42,590
And doing scientific inquiry and
scientific modeling in that domain, and

17
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:45,570
when you're really doing
inquiry in ecology.

18
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:47,770
You're usually doing
things that take months or

19
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:52,150
years to gather the data on, you build
models that cover decades of time,

20
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:56,050
or our current climate change models are
covering centuries or millennia in time,

21
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:58,130
it get's the projections out that far.

22
00:00:58,130 --> 00:00:59,920
And our students in the classroom,

23
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,690
they have 45 minutes or
maybe two weeks for a unit.

24
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:05,150
They don't have time to sit around
gathering 12 months of data or

25
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:07,300
24 months of data or anything like that.

26
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:10,890
The real power of exploratory learning
environments is it lets us take those

27
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:15,670
very real, very authentic opportunities
from the real word, take away some of

28
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:18,800
the constraints, or the obstacles
to using them in the classroom and

29
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:22,020
strip them down to only those things
that are useful for the learning.

30
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:26,390
So, in our research we had students
simulate what would happen to

31
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:29,390
a particular ecological system
over a very large time scale.

32
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:31,200
Under different initial circumstances.

33
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,390
So if the system started like this, what
would it look like ten years from now?

34
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:37,090
If it started like this,
what would it work ten years from now?

35
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:39,250
In person, we can't model a system for
ten years for

36
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:40,450
a middle school class project.

37
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:41,300
>> Right.
>> Of course.

38
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:42,840
But we want them to
get that experience of

39
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,240
what it's like to authentically
investigate that problem.

40
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,930
And so the real power in exploratory
learning environments is to

41
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:49,980
open up those opportunities.

42
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:53,690
But more than just opening up those
opportunities as well, the real,

43
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:57,640
the meat of them is also how they give
students ownership over that process.

44
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:00,790
So they're called exploratory
because the student is exploring.

45
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:02,130
The student is driving
what they're doing.

46
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:04,660
The student is going in and saying I
think want to research this today, or I

47
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:08,060
want to go explore this area, depending
on the the nature of the environment.

48
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:08,770
>> Right.
>> And so

49
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:11,250
it's not something that we're telling
them you have to do this, and

50
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:12,020
then this, and then this.

51
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:14,600
And here's your assignment, and
here's your reading for the day.

52
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,360
They get to take charge.

53
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:19,100
And that builds a lot of ownership,
a lot of engagement in it.

54
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,030
Experience or constructing is personal.

55
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:23,230
And it's different for everybody.

56
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:24,510
>> Right.
>> And so that's why I

57
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:27,630
love using them in that,
because it teaches students

58
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:30,210
the skills they need to actually
survive in their eventual real world.

59
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:33,380
That when you're on the job, hopefully
you don't have someone holding your hand

60
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:34,702
and giving you your to do list for
the day.

61
00:02:34,702 --> 00:02:35,202
>> [LAUGH]
>> You might.

62
00:02:35,202 --> 00:02:36,182
But, hopefully, you don't.

63
00:02:36,182 --> 00:02:37,292
You're given some free reign,

64
00:02:37,292 --> 00:02:39,665
and you're trusted to
go forward with it.

65
00:02:39,665 --> 00:02:42,425
And so exploratory learning
environments are a way of opening up

66
00:02:42,425 --> 00:02:46,071
those opportunities, those experiences
to students earlier in their education.

67
00:02:46,071 --> 00:02:48,359
>> Sounds like it's going to build
a lot of confidence for those students.

68
00:02:48,359 --> 00:02:49,525
>> I hope so, yeah.

69
00:02:49,525 --> 00:02:52,295
Actually in our experience
in that class it did, we had

70
00:02:52,295 --> 00:02:55,705
a couple students who didn't consider
themselves very good in science.

71
00:02:55,705 --> 00:02:56,295
>> Right.

72
00:02:56,295 --> 00:02:57,715
>> But it was when they were told,

73
00:02:57,715 --> 00:03:00,890
you have the power to question
certain accepted truths.

74
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:04,760
Based on the evidence that you gather,
that it gave them this idea that,

75
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:08,900
I don't have to necessarily be
a scientist to do research.

76
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:11,520
You need to become one eventually
to do it in the real world,

77
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:15,730
but the idea that beliefs and theories
are constructed based on evidence, and

78
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:17,200
you have the power to gather evidence.

79
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,720
That's a really powerful idea for

80
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,550
students to have that early
in their science education.

81
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:23,120
>> Absolutely.

82
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,670
When designing a learning environment,
what is important to keep in mind?

83
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:29,570
>> So for me, the main thing to keep in
mind when designing these environments,

84
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:32,970
is to preserve the authenticity of
whatever problem you're mimicking.

85
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:36,808
I say that because there's a very strong
tendency among some who would design

86
00:03:36,808 --> 00:03:39,299
some environments like
this to really gamify it.

87
00:03:39,299 --> 00:03:42,467
And I have a strong opposition to
gamifying just because it creates,

88
00:03:42,467 --> 00:03:44,106
creates some nice motivation, but

89
00:03:44,106 --> 00:03:46,632
it's motivation that isn't
rooted in the material.

90
00:03:46,632 --> 00:03:47,258
>> Right.
>> And so, we can

91
00:03:47,258 --> 00:03:49,901
have an exploratory learning
environment where, for example,

92
00:03:49,901 --> 00:03:52,965
you're gathering evidence to explain
why certain species went extinct.

93
00:03:52,965 --> 00:03:53,566
>> Mm-hm.
>> And

94
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:56,250
every time you find a piece of
evidence you get 10 points.

95
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:57,610
And that's not very
often think about it.

96
00:03:57,610 --> 00:04:00,130
>> Right.
>> You're basically just looking around

97
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:01,330
finding clues.

98
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:03,910
What we really want to do when we're
creating these exploratory learning

99
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:07,410
environments, is preserve the
authenticity of whatever activity we're

100
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:08,970
mimicking out in the real world.

101
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:11,360
If scientist use simulations for
example,

102
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,130
we want to our students to use the same
kind of simulations that scientist use.

103
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:17,160
>> Right.
>> We want them to derive value from it

104
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,860
based on what predictions they can make.

105
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:21,740
Not whether or not they achieved
an objective or got an achievement, or

106
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:23,130
got a trophy or something like that.

107
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:24,600
>> Right.
>> So I think it's really important to

108
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,780
preserve what it is you want
to teach in that environment.

109
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:31,470
And make sure it's what you want to
teach that's actually the motivating

110
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:33,570
part of engaging with that environment.

111
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:37,480
>> So you're talking about focusing
on the learning goals as opposed to

112
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:40,560
the gamification of the.-
>> Right, exactly.

113
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,710
>> All right, very good.

114
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:44,090
We talked a lot about learning
environments in the middle school.

115
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:46,660
I'm wondering what sort of
application for high school or

116
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:49,310
the collegiate level exists.

117
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:51,070
>> So you're right.
I think most often we see explored to

118
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:53,040
our learning environments used
in lower and middle school.

119
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,440
And part of the reason is that they,
they make things very engaging.

120
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,950
They are very visually attracted,
they are very interactive,

121
00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:00,430
they're very interesting to look at.

122
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:01,150
>> Right.
>> And so

123
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:03,990
I think that's one of the reasons we
see them a lot at the earlier ages.

124
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:06,120
But I think they have a very
strong place later in life,

125
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,200
that the constraints that we
deal with at the lower and

126
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,720
middle school levels don't go
away when we're in college.

127
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,290
We're dealing with the same kind of
things of when we're learning about

128
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:15,420
ecology, we're learning
about systems and

129
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:18,600
we're learning about systems that take
place over a very long period of time.

130
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:22,780
I think the difference is that
the authenticity actually comes out.

131
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:25,580
Even more strongly than when we're
doing it later in our college career so

132
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:26,780
we don't need to dress up as much.

133
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:28,260
We don't need to make it as colorful.

134
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:31,850
We can actually just sometimes give
students the tools that real people use.

135
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:35,850
And this is especially, I think
the case, in computer science education.

136
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:38,140
The IDEs in many ways are exploratory
learning environments.

137
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:39,180
You're exploring the API.

138
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:41,550
>> Right.
>> You're exploring the different

139
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:43,420
results of different programs and
things like that.

140
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:47,390
So, I think it definitely has a place
later in the educational career.

141
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:50,500
But I think Jason's right that, I think
that exploratory learning environments

142
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,750
are most often used at
the lower middle school levels.

143
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,830
And if your interested in working
with lower middle school students, or

144
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:56,990
even maybe some high school students,
I think it's a really,

145
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:58,650
really nice domain to explore.

146
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:01,080
It lead's itself to some
really fun projects, and

147
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,840
some really interesting projects
that can really motivate students.

148
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,990
But I also encourage you to think
about some of the ways we could use

149
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:08,810
the same kind of principles
in later education.

150
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:11,330
So, thank you for
chatting with me about this.

151
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:11,930
>> Of course Kevin.
