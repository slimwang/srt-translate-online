This diagram is correct. It initially takes d N as it's input and then gives N

2
00:00:05,066 --> 00:00:10,475
of d as an output. Then N of d acts as the input for the second machine, which

00:00:10,475 --> 00:00:15,470
spits out R of N of d. That's pretty cool. I know this notation probably looks

00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:19,279
kind of funny right now but we'll learn all about it, in the next few videos.
