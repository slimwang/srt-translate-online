00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:00,940
So in summary, for

2
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:06,020
this lesson, I've covered basic concepts of cross-correlation, convolution.

3
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:09,640
I've discussed the differences between cross-correlation and

4
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:13,570
convolution, as applied to image filtering, and of course,

5
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:17,400
I've also discussed the properties of convolution, and how we actually now can

6
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:21,520
generalize the whole process of how doing, how we can do filtering with images.

7
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,420
This has just been a foundational types of things.

8
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:27,710
And now we're actually with next lecture, we're going to start finding more

9
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:32,020
information from images, specifically things like edges and images, which

10
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:35,260
then will actually create the foundations for doing something we want to do.

11
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:37,590
That is feature matching.

12
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:41,170
All right? So we will be actually, taking what we've learned about filtering,

13
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:44,710
and now start getting content information out of images,

14
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:47,300
rather than just doing blurring and filtering that we've been doing.

15
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:50,000
And I noted I'd been using MatLab for

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,790
some, some of this stuff, but you should feel free to use whatever you want.

17
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:56,570
And I just always like to thank other people that I've borrowed some

18
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:57,200
concepts from.
