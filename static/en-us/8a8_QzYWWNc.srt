If you're a bit quiz savvy, probably this one was very easy to get,

2
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:05,540
but I'll explain the answer to you of course as well.

3
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:10,660
So, at least one variable must be flipped and the chances of flipping the right variable

4
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:13,559
are at least one-third and I''ll explain it to you.

5
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:19,040
Now, let's say we have one clause and that clause has 3 variables and it's not satisfied.

6
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:22,770
So, if the overall Boolean formula has a satisfying assignment

7
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:28,830
this means that in the satisfying assignment either this variable here, this one here, or this one here

8
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:32,590
must evaluate to true and currently, they all evaluate to false.

9
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:37,760
So, at least one of those variables must be flipped in order to satisfy the clause.

10
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,590
What are the chances that we're flipping the correct variable?

11
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:43,439
Meaning that we indeed choose the variable to flip

12
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:47,760
that would also have a different value in the satisfying assignment.

13
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:53,880
Well, since we select one out of three variables those chances are at least one-third.

14
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,080
So, they are exactly one-third.

15
00:00:55,080 --> 00:01:00,170
If in a satisfying assignment, you have exactly one variable that evaluates to true

16
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:04,660
or a variable set to false with a knot and the chances are even better

17
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:08,180
if in the satisfying assignment you would have two of three variables

18
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:11,760
that would need to evaluate to true, but there are always at least one-third.

19
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,650
We initially can expect to get about half of the variables right

20
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:21,090
and a random change will be successful or a random change and clause that is not satisfied

21
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:23,490
will be successful with the probability of at least one-third

22
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:26,480
and that of course also means that the probability of making a mistake

23
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:30,590
meaning that we flip a variable that we should actually not have flipped

24
00:01:30,590 --> 99:59:59,999
is at most two-thirds.
