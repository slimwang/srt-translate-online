1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:04,340
Before we get started coding, we must
first create a client ID and client

2
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:09,360
secret with Google in order to be able
to communicate with its API libraries.

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:13,880
In your browser,
visit console.developers.google.com.

4
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:16,309
And log into your Google account and
follow along.

5
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:19,320
Once you're logged in, go ahead and
click the Create Project button.

6
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,930
Let's name our project
Restaurant Menu App.

7
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:25,230
Google automatically creates
a project ID for you.

8
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:28,480
You can change this project ID,
but it needs to be unique.

9
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,720
So let's go ahead and
leave it as is for now.

10
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,520
Let's click Create.

11
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:34,240
And when Google's created your project,

12
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,760
it'll automatically take you
to the Project Dashboard.

13
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:39,850
Go ahead and click APIs and
auth on the left-hand menu.

14
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:41,480
Then select Credentials.

15
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:44,980
In the OAuth 2.0 section go ahead and
click Create new Client ID.

16
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:48,850
Make sure Web application is selected
and then click Configure consent screen.

17
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:51,340
The consent screen is the screen
that will be displayed

18
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:54,280
when my app tries to connect
to a user's Google account.

19
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:58,090
I must specify at least my email and
a name for the product.

20
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:00,280
Let's go ahead and
put restaurant menu app.

21
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:04,000
Let's save our changes, and
then click Create Client ID.

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,210
Now that we see that our web application
has a client ID complete with email

23
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:11,570
address, client secret, redirect URIs,
and JavaScript origins.

24
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:13,501
Now let's go ahead and
click Edit Settings.

25
00:01:13,501 --> 00:01:18,034
In our authorized JavaScript origins,
let's go ahead and

26
00:01:18,034 --> 00:01:21,125
add http://localhost:5000.

27
00:01:21,125 --> 00:01:24,720
This is needed for
our local version of code to work.

28
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,448
If you've been using the IP
representation of localhost,

29
00:01:28,448 --> 00:01:33,270
127.0.0.1, this should also
be included in the JavaScript

30
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:35,980
origins if you want that URL to work.

31
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:37,850
Let's go ahead and click Update.

32
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:39,790
And we're ready to use our client ID and

33
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:42,090
client secret to add
OAuth to our application.
