00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,882
We've seen how to simplify radicals, so now let's try adding and subtracting

2
00:00:03,882 --> 00:00:07,466
them. We can use our knowledge of what we learned before to help us add

3
00:00:07,466 --> 00:00:11,600
radicals together. For example, to add polynomials together, we just added the

4
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:15,715
like terms of x squared and x squared. We have three of these things called x

5
00:00:15,715 --> 00:00:19,829
squared, and two of these things called x squared. So if we add them all

6
00:00:19,829 --> 00:00:24,462
together, we'll have 5 of these things that we call x squared. In a similar

7
00:00:24,462 --> 00:00:29,965
way, we added 3 7ths and 2 7ths to equal 5 7ths. And most recently, we learned

8
00:00:29,965 --> 00:00:34,102
how to add rational expressions. If our denominators were alike, then we could

9
00:00:34,102 --> 00:00:38,620
add the numerators to get 5 divided by x plus 1. So based on what you know

10
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:42,000
before, what do you think would be the sum of these two expressions?
