00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,560
In this lesson, you'll use workflow and approvals to

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:05,880
automate manual tasks. You'll learn how to automate sending an

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:10,150
email, updating a field, and creating a task for users.

4
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:12,710
To do that, let's go back with Samantha and Andy.

5
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:15,640
>> We've got this really cool thing. This

6
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,950
dashboard that shows all this data about things like

7
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:21,560
money and the bands playing. And this is

8
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:25,800
interesting. This state about the tickets, the open maintenance

9
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,140
items that need to get fixed.

10
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:28,500
>> Yep.

11
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,080
>> And so, you know, we've thought about how to

12
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:34,140
collect the data? But really, is people doing these things?

13
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:34,890
>> Right.

14
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:36,770
>> We need to tell them, what to do.

15
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:39,240
>> So, we need to automate, actually

16
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,060
notifying the people involved with the maintenance

17
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:42,740
tickets, so they can get. Started you

18
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:44,570
know, fixing those problems right away, yeah?

19
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:46,771
>> I mean, so, can we make it so that you

20
00:00:46,771 --> 00:00:50,818
know, a ticket gets created and then immediately a technician gets

21
00:00:50,818 --> 00:00:53,350
alerted or something like that?

22
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:55,642
>> Definitely. So, what you're describing sounds a

23
00:00:55,642 --> 00:00:58,575
lot like a workflow process. this is taking like

24
00:00:58,575 --> 00:01:02,265
something that's a manual process and automating it

25
00:01:02,265 --> 00:01:04,702
using a set of actions. So, in the case

26
00:01:04,702 --> 00:01:07,138
of maintenance tickets. Maybe you want to update a

27
00:01:07,138 --> 00:01:09,838
field, or send an email to this maintenance worker,

28
00:01:09,838 --> 00:01:11,630
or give them a task. You can do

29
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:15,410
all that using, just point-click configurations on your workflow.

30
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:15,692
>> Cool,

31
00:01:15,692 --> 00:01:16,272
let's do it.

32
00:01:16,272 --> 00:01:16,600
>> Yeah.
