1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,359
Now, that you've wrapped your head
around what the Firebase UI is actually

2
00:00:03,359 --> 00:00:04,830
doing, let's pop it into our code.

3
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:08,690
Here the general steps that I've laid
out to get things up and running.

4
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:11,990
I've taken the liberty of already
doing steps two and three for you.

5
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:15,100
There's already an mListView
object in the code for you.

6
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:19,140
And I've also made an XML layout
called single_ active_ list.

7
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,890
You've actually already used
this layout to display one list.

8
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:25,420
Also, that describes in greater
detail how to do all this stuff.

9
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:29,130
The most complicated slash interesting
part is in the fire-based list adapter.

10
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:33,535
There's this method called PopulateView,
which is meant to be overwritten.

11
00:00:33,535 --> 00:00:37,230
PopulateView is a method that
supplies two key arguments.

12
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:39,930
First is a view that is
the inflated version

13
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:42,650
of the layout that you gave
the adapter upon creation.

14
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:47,710
It also gives you a POJO, which in
this case, will be a Shopping List.

15
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:51,840
It's then your job to take this view,
grab the sub text views,

16
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,100
images views, and whatever else
there is in the layout, and

17
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:58,730
then, appropriately fill
it with data from the POJO.

18
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:00,400
Okay, I'll send over the spec now so

19
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,820
that you can add Firebase UI
to Shopping List Plus Plus.
