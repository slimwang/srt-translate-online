Many science textbooks in middle school or

2
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:07,990
high school explain the atomic structure in terms of the solar system.

3
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:11,050
Here's a representation for the solar system, here's a representation for

4
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:15,570
the atomic structure. Let us see how this model of the solar system helps us

5
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:19,890
make sense of the atomic structure. We'll use this example often going forward.

6
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:26,910
And this representation of the solar system is arrows are denoting causality. So

7
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:29,710
the sun's mass is greater than the planet's mass,

8
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:34,740
which causes the planet to revolve around the sun. Similarly for the atomic

9
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:38,740
structure, there is a force within the nucleus and the electron, and that causes

10
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:42,239
the nucleus to attract the electron and the electron to attract the nucleus.

11
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:46,670
Given these two models, what are the deep similarities between them?
