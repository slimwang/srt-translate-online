1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Use list comprehensions to identify all the TAs

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
who are teaching a 300-level course.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
So that's any course beginning with the number 3,

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
which in this case will be Gundega and Job.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
You may want to use the string.find method to help you out here.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Your variable, ta_300, should look exactly like this.
