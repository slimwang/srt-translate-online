00:00:00,194 --> 00:00:04,735
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:04,735 --> 00:00:07,022
One of the things that people often
do is they'll create a DevOps team.

3
00:00:07,022 --> 00:00:10,679
So suddenly you have a DevOps engineer,
or multiple.

4
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:11,710
And they're like.

5
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:12,600
What do we do?

6
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:15,980
Well I read in the in-flight magazine,
that we need to do the Dev Ops.

7
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:18,200
So I went out and
I hired to DevOps team.

8
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,900
They're going to solve
our DevOps problems.

9
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:22,350
And that team shows up.

10
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:25,950
And the rest of the organization
knows where the pain is.

11
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:31,107
They know how they can how
it came to be in many cases.

12
00:00:31,107 --> 00:00:35,418
And they have ideas about where
they want to try to create value.

13
00:00:35,418 --> 00:00:38,526
And then suddenly someone shows up and
they're preordained.

14
00:00:38,526 --> 00:00:39,828
You're the Neo.

15
00:00:39,828 --> 00:00:40,420
You're the one.

16
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:42,770
You're going to be here,
you're going to fix it, right?

17
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:45,120
And that narrative is
a terrible narrative.

18
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,920
So that's the anti-pattern.

19
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:50,990
Now the language is all of the people
who have been living with the problem

20
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:54,550
are somehow not suited to solve it.

21
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:58,040
And for sure, that's a bad message.

22
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:00,802
Right.
It will create structures that will not

23
00:01:00,802 --> 00:01:03,077
serve to get the value that you want.

24
00:01:03,077 --> 00:01:05,144
So if you find yourself
in that situation.

25
00:01:05,144 --> 00:01:06,624
Where you have completed the class.

26
00:01:06,624 --> 00:01:07,944
You have all these skills.

27
00:01:07,944 --> 00:01:10,400
And then you find yourself in
an organization, where they're like.

28
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,255
Okay little devils bunny.

29
00:01:12,255 --> 00:01:14,710
Go make everything better.

30
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:18,679
The first thing that you want to
do is you want to speak back to

31
00:01:18,679 --> 00:01:20,548
the organization and say.

32
00:01:20,548 --> 00:01:24,599
That's not a thing I can do,
but here are things I can do.

33
00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:26,837
I can partner with your developers.

34
00:01:26,837 --> 00:01:30,730
I can partner with
your operations teams.

35
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:32,650
There are skills that we can train.

36
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:35,520
There our capabilities we can
bring into the organization.

37
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,110
But the first thing I need to know is.

38
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:39,760
Where does it hurt?

39
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,140
And how can I help?
