00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,570
>> Okay, Michael. So you think you know everything, so here's a

2
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:08,970
quiz. So, here are two matrices, matrix prisoner's dilemma and matrix bunch of

3
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:11,290
numbers that look vaguely symmetric but

4
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:13,080
aren't quite. So here's what I'm going to

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:17,770
ask you do do. In each of these cases find the Nash equilibrium.

6
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:20,580
>> Rut-roh. So do, you told me what it was but you

7
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:22,780
didn't tell me how to find them so that seems kind of rude.

8
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:25,250
>> It was implicit. It's intuitively

9
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:27,240
obvious even to the most casual observer.

10
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:33,010
>> Oh, well then, okay. So, and just to remind me now, each row

11
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:36,250
and column is a choice for one of the players or the other player.

12
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:36,708
>> Yeah.

13
00:00:36,708 --> 00:00:41,050
>> And the first number in the pair is the row player,

14
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:43,820
or A's pay off and the second number is B's pay off.

15
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:44,510
>> Yes.

16
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:47,450
>> And we might need probability distributions, or we

17
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:50,261
might not, depending on what it takes to be a

18
00:00:50,261 --> 00:00:51,408
Nash equilibrium.

19
00:00:51,408 --> 00:00:52,230
>> Right.

20
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:55,790
>> okay, I don't [LAUGH] I'm not, it's not like I see the answer yet but it,

21
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:57,820
but I either will be able to find it,

22
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:59,370
or I won't. At least I understand the question.

23
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:00,940
>> Okay. And by the way, just to make it

24
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:05,319
easier for you there are pure Nash equilibria here, okay?

25
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:06,820
>> Hm.

26
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:08,240
>> Alright, so you ready?

27
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:08,730
>> Yep.

28
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:12,800
>> Just circle the one or underline it or whatever it is Pushcar

29
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,858
does to make it so that you can answer this quiz. You ready?

30
00:01:15,858 --> 00:01:16,998
>> Totally.

31
00:01:16,998 --> 00:01:17,328
>> Go.
