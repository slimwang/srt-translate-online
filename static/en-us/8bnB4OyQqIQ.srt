What is a software design pattern?

2
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:06,560
A design pattern is a solution to a problem in context.

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,200
According to GOF, this amounts to a description of communicating objects and

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:14,210
classes that are customized to solve a general design problem

5
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:15,870
in a particular context.

6
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:19,730
Thus, design patterns are a means of capturing and reusing design knowledge.

00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:24,150
We'll look first at an example of a particular simple pattern called

8
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:25,010
the composite pattern.
