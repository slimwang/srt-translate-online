1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,170
So let's assume that we have an unsatisfied clause

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:08,009
then we would pick one of those clauses and randomly flip one of the variables

3
00:00:08,009 --> 00:00:12,040
So, what I would like to know from you is what can we say about the condition

4
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:14,440
that we find ourselves in, in this case over here?

5
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:18,699
Is it true that at least one of the variables of that clause must be flipped?

6
00:00:18,699 --> 00:00:23,299
Is it true that all of the variables of that clause must be flipped?

7
00:00:23,299 --> 00:00:29,820
Is it true that the chances of flipping the correct variable are at least one-third?

8
00:00:29,820 --> 99:59:59,999
Or is it correct that the chances of flipping the correct variable are at most one-third?
