00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,193
Let's consider another system of equations. When we perform substitution, we

2
00:00:04,193 --> 00:00:08,162
need to choose one variable and one of the equations that is easiest to solve

3
00:00:08,162 --> 00:00:12,128
for. For example, in this equation, we want to think, is it easier to get x

4
00:00:12,128 --> 00:00:16,225
alone, or y alone? Also, we could consider the other equation. Do we want to

5
00:00:16,225 --> 00:00:20,482
solve for this x, or this y? We need one of these equations to be in the form, x

6
00:00:20,482 --> 00:00:24,860
equals something, or y equals something in order to perform substitution. So,

7
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:28,557
what do you think in this case? Which of these variables would be easiest to

8
00:00:28,557 --> 00:00:32,037
solve for? Choose the best one. If you actually solve for some of these

9
00:00:32,037 --> 00:00:35,946
variables, you might see that some are better than others. Think about why that

10
00:00:35,946 --> 00:00:42,115
is. Maybe some have negatives. Maybe some have fractions. You want the easiest

11
00:00:42,115 --> 00:00:42,499
one.
