00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Welcome to the first unit of our course on differential equations and simulation.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
In this unit and the next, we'll look into how to bring the crew of Apollo 13 back to earth.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
We start with writing programs that model the orbit of the moon

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and of the spacecraft around the earth.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
This unit contains quite a number of supplementary segments

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
to bring everybody up to speed.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
If you know your way around derivatives and vectors and elementary Python programming,

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,461
feel free to skip directly to the quizzes of those segments.
