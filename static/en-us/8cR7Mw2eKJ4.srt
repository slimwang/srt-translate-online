00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:05,016
Let's discuss the solution for our newest Iron Law quiz. We have 50 billion

2
00:00:05,016 --> 00:00:09,572
instructions with different CPIs, so clearly we need to use our newest version

3
00:00:09,572 --> 00:00:14,604
of the Iron Law of performance. Execution time is a sum of number of

4
00:00:14,604 --> 00:00:20,010
instructions of a particular type times the CPI for the type.

5
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:25,217
In this case, it's 10 times 10 to the 9th,

6
00:00:25,217 --> 00:00:32,202
which is 10 billion, times 4 for branches, plus 15 billion

7
00:00:32,202 --> 00:00:39,580
times 2 for loads plus 5 billion times 3 for stores. And we said

8
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:44,220
the remaining instructions are integer add instructions. We have 30 billion

9
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:50,320
instructions here, so 20 billion are integer adds at CPF1. And all of that

10
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:55,220
times the clock cycle time, which is one over 4 times 10

11
00:00:55,220 --> 00:01:00,450
to the 9th. Again, 4 gigahertz is the clock frequency.

12
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:05,474
The clock cycle time is 1 over that. Now, let's do the math here. This is

13
00:01:05,474 --> 00:01:10,505
40 plus 30 plus 15 plus 20 times 10 to

14
00:01:10,505 --> 00:01:15,407
the 9th divided by 4 times 10 to the 9th,

15
00:01:15,407 --> 00:01:20,309
so 10 to the 9th can be crossed out and we get

16
00:01:20,309 --> 00:01:25,930
105 over 4, which amounts to 26.25. So this

17
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:29,050
is how long it takes to run this 50 billion instructions

18
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:33,450
at 4 gigahertz, assuming these CPIs and this distribution of instructions.
