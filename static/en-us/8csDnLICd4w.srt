1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,746
So the answer is 1 seventh, which is

2
00:00:02,746 --> 00:00:05,640
pretty good. There aren't many things that we

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:09,810
deal with where we can think of them in terms of fractions of the speed of light

4
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:12,558
and fractions above 10%. So our data was

5
00:00:12,558 --> 00:00:17,706
traveling between California and Massachusetts at a speed of

6
00:00:17,706 --> 00:00:23,280
about 43,000 kilometers per second. And most of

7
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:25,340
that time is not the time on the wire.

8
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:27,980
While the data's traveling on the wires, it's traveling pretty close to

9
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:31,825
the speed of light. The speed of light through Optical FireWire is about

10
00:00:31,825 --> 00:00:35,150
50% slower than light travels in a vacuum. But what's taking up

11
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:37,280
most of the time is all the routers that it had to go

12
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,220
through. And we saw that, from the traceroute, that it went through

13
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:43,900
about 20 routers. So each of those routers had to take a packet

14
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:46,950
in, figure out where to send it, and do all that in the

15
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:50,380
time that it had to travel across the country, which was a 100

16
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:53,720
milliseconds total, so the average speed going across the country

17
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,860
was one seventh the speed of light, I can show

18
00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:00,490
you the Python code to compute that. So we have

19
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:04,080
the distance which is 4300, that's the number of kilometers between

20
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,720
Palo Alto and Cambridge. We have the speed of light,

21
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,840
which is approximately 300,000 kilometers per second. And we have the

22
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,520
time it took, which, since we're using seconds as our

23
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,580
unit for the speed of light, we should put in seconds.

24
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:18,164
And so it as 100 milliseconds, which is 0.1

25
00:01:18,164 --> 00:01:20,990
seconds. And so I can compute the time it took

26
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:24,070
light to travel that distance. By dividing the distance by

27
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:26,640
the speed of light and let's see what that is.

28
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:31,730
So if it was travelling at the speed of light it

29
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:36,828
would take 0.014 seconds to get across the country, which is

30
00:01:36,828 --> 00:01:40,670
14 milliseconds. What it actually took was a 100 milliseconds. And

31
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:42,760
if we divide the time it actually took by the time

32
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:45,890
it would take light to travel, we get 6.97. So, it's

33
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:48,960
taking almost seven times as long as it would take if

34
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,950
it was just light traveling in a vacuum for that distance.

35
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:55,010
If you had a vacuum between Palo Alto and Cambridge and

36
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:57,410
no routers and nothing else along the way, well then

37
00:01:57,410 --> 00:02:00,420
you could get your packets across about seven times faster than

38
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:04,110
the internet actually does. Not many people can afford setting up

39
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:06,870
a dedicated vacuum between the two points they want to communicate.
