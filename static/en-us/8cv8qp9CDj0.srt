1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,050
Let's start by looking at a few
characteristics of technical analysis.

2
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:05,280
First, what is it?

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:09,860
One of the most important things to
remember about technical analysis

4
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:14,470
is that it looks only at price and
volume.

5
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:17,600
That's as opposed to fundamental
analysis that looks at fundamental

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:23,500
factors, like earnings, dividends,
cash flow, book value, and so on.

7
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:27,930
Technical analysis is price and
volume only.

8
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:32,299
We look back at historical price and
volume to compute statistics

9
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:37,050
on this time series, and
these statistics are called indicators.

10
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:41,760
Indicators are heuristics that may
hint at a buy or sell opportunity.

11
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:46,720
Now there is significant criticism
of the technical approach.

12
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:51,030
Folks consider that it's not
an appropriate method for

13
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:55,420
investing, because it's not considering
the value of the companies.

14
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:59,130
Instead, maybe you could think about
it as a trading approach as opposed to

15
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:01,060
an investing approach.

16
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:04,379
Still there are reasons to believe that
technical analysis might have value and

17
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:05,930
that it might work.

18
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:09,330
First of all,
there is indeed information in price and

19
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:11,290
information in price change.

20
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:16,520
It reflects sentiments of buyers and
sellers, and especially if we see that

21
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:20,290
the price for a particular stock
is moving in a different direction

22
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:23,870
than the overall market, that might be
a hint that there's something going on.

23
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:29,640
Additionally, we know that in other
domains of artificial intelligence,

24
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:33,820
heuristics can work, and
they work frequently.

25
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:36,730
So even though it's controversial,

26
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:39,270
there are reasons to believe
technical analysis can work.
