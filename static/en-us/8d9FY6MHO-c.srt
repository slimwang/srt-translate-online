1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:06,650
What kind of company is LogicBlox,
what sorts of things they sell?

2
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:11,450
>> So LogicBlox's primary product
is what we call a smart database.

3
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:16,550
It's an active cloud
database that has much

4
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:20,450
of the business logic that one would
normally need to write in a traditional

5
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:24,500
imperative language running on separate
machines down in the database.

6
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:28,050
So that when data
are added to the database,

7
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:31,910
these business rules kick in and
update views automatically.

8
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:36,930
It specializes in doing really
large-scale analytics and

9
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:41,720
applications that are kind of a hybrid
between transactional and analytic, and

10
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:43,310
that's really our sweet spot.

11
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:47,070
>> And
what sort of customers do you have and

12
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:49,460
the kinds of products that they need?

13
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:53,720
>> Yeah, so most of our customers that
are longer-term customers have been

14
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:59,060
customers in the retail domain,
that need to do analysis to decide how

15
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:03,750
many products they should order for a
given promotion, or forecast demand for

16
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:07,860
a given set of products at their stores,
or do financial planning.

17
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:12,788
These tend to be really large,
often multi-terabyte

18
00:01:12,788 --> 00:01:17,670
applications that have years and
years of sales history that we use

19
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:22,100
to try to do a good job of forecasting
or predicting how products will move.

20
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:25,010
And we use our smart database
to analyze that and roll up and

21
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:27,630
roll down those data very efficiently.

22
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:31,450
>> So the terabytes is not
the size of the source code but

23
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:33,040
it's the amount of data that
they have to deal with.

24
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:33,750
>> That's correct.
Yeah,

25
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:36,470
the amount of source code
is meant to be very small.

26
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:41,340
The idea is that you want to declare
your business rules as concisely and

27
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:42,060
compactly and

28
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:45,260
as close to the way you'd want to
just say them in English is you can.

29
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:50,258
And then we install those
business rules into our database,

30
00:01:50,258 --> 00:01:54,090
which then we load with
the terabytes of data.

31
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:55,332
>> And you mentioned in the cloud,

32
00:01:55,332 --> 00:01:57,470
is this what they call softwares and
service?

33
00:01:57,470 --> 00:02:01,340
>> It is, yes, so all of our
applications are sold as a service.

34
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:04,500
So our forecaster, which I think we're
going to talk about in a little while.

35
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:09,570
In particular, our forecast manager,
is a service that

36
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:16,290
big retail customers will pay
us a monthly fee to access.

37
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:18,830
Part of our model is that they
can at any time choose to.

38
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:22,094
They don't have to install
a lot of special hardware and

39
00:02:22,094 --> 00:02:26,130
have IT expertise in house,
they can just subscribe to our service.

40
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:28,250
They access it through
standard web browsers.

41
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:30,440
They can turn it off and
on as they desire.

42
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:33,170
If they decide that they don't like
it anymore, they can just quit.

43
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:34,960
And so it's really nice for customers.

44
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:38,980
Part of our business proposition
is that we can quickly get into,

45
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,660
give access to a customer and
let them see the benefits.

46
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:45,680
They don't have to make a lot of upfront
commitment to use our technology and

47
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,260
they can decide to leave anytime.

48
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:49,420
>> So would you call this
a real time application?

49
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:53,110
>> I'm not sure I'd call
it a real time application.

50
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:56,330
It is an interactive application in
the sense that there will be users who

51
00:02:56,330 --> 00:03:00,580
will be executing queries and
analyzing data

52
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:03,760
in what they would consider to be real
time so they need fast response time.

53
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,680
It's an interactive system.

54
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,660
It doesn't have hard
real time deadlines,

55
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:11,850
the way we normally think about
real time stuff being developed.

56
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:15,820
>> And how does the customer's data,
their sales data or

57
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:18,890
their product data get to you?

58
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:20,770
>> Yeah,
it's actually a little bit complicated.

59
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:26,502
So, customers tend to keep their data in
database systems that they've had for

60
00:03:26,502 --> 00:03:31,430
50 years and
have their own special format and

61
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:32,700
they're very difficult
to integrate with.

62
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:36,710
What we tend to do is get them to export
the data that they need to send to us

63
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:41,440
and usually in just big CSV files or
some kind of delimited tabular file.

64
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,860
And they'll send us these
files at various times.

65
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:48,550
We have servers that will receive the
files and put them off to Amazon's S3

66
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:54,440
storage, it's a nice, very scalable,
very reliable storage system that we

67
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:58,499
use to keep the incoming data and from
that we load them into our databases.

68
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:03,340
>> But,
this data might be periodically updated.

69
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:04,180
>> That's correct.

70
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:06,600
>> Okay.
>> Often, on a daily basis, and

71
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,140
sometimes, for some customers,
even more frequent than that.
