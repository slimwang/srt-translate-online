1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,920
The correct answers are position and
title.

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:08,010
Position contains a LatLong object and
that defines position for you, so

3
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:10,020
you don't need a latitude.

4
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:13,040
Title was the string that was used
just as a friendly text to describe

5
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,930
the actual marker and
there's no elevation settings.
