00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,000
So far we've looked at the state space of cities in Romania--

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
a 2-dimensional, physical space.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
But the technology for problem solving through search

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
can deal with many types of state spaces,

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
dealing with abstract properties, not just x-y position in a plane.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Here I introduce another state space--the vacuum world.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
It's a very simple world in which there are only 2 positions

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
as opposed to the many positions in the Romania state space.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
But there are additional properties to deal with as well.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The robot vacuum cleaner can be in either of the 2 conditions,

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
but as well as that each of the positions

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
can either have dirt in it or not have dirt in it.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Now the question is to represent this as a state space

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
how many states do we need?

15
00:00:51,000 --> 99:59:59,999
The number of states can fill in this box here.
