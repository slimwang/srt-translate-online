00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:04,330
Let's look at the solution to our
not most recently used replacement

2
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:06,010
policy quiz.

3
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:07,760
We have these axises, and

4
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:12,830
now let's see which ones might be
hits and which ones might be misses.

5
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:16,010
This one is definitely a miss because
we have nothing in the cache.

6
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:17,640
And now we have brought
A into the cache.

7
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:20,900
This one is definitely a hit.

8
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:25,450
No we're going to access B,
and this is definitely a miss.

9
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:29,270
And we're going to put B in a separate
place in the cache from where

10
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:32,860
we put A because A is
the most recently used block.

11
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:36,980
So we will put B in one of
the other three blocks.

12
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:40,680
And we definitely will put B in
a line that doesn't contain A.

13
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:44,740
So we will not take out A because
A's the most recently used block.

14
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:50,270
We will choose one of the other
three lines to evict to put B there.

15
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:54,940
So far, if this is our cache,
we have A and B there.

16
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:59,630
Now we will access A and have a hit,
so C is definitely a miss, and

17
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:03,010
at that point A is the most
recently used block.

18
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:07,520
And we will find one of these
three to evict to put C there.

19
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:11,210
In this type of a situation it looks
like B might actually be evicted.

20
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:14,860
But remember that we also have
value bits for all these blocks.

21
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:20,480
So when we have a placement policy,
typically we will first fill

22
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:26,190
all the lines in the cache set before we
move on and start evicting something.

23
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:29,820
So we will put C into one
of the empty slots, and

24
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:33,440
now that is the most
recently accessed line.

25
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:38,630
A is now a hit, and that is now
the most recently accessed line.

26
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:44,369
Now when we access D, it's not in
the cache, so we will have a miss.

27
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:48,770
We will again put D in
an unused place and

28
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:51,310
that will now be the most
recently used one.

29
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:53,940
Then A gets accessed and
we have a hit, and

30
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:57,410
at this point A's the most
recently used block.

31
00:01:57,410 --> 00:02:00,505
Now, we will have a miss on E
because it's not in the cache.

32
00:02:00,505 --> 00:02:03,930
And now the question is,
what will be evicted?

33
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:06,550
We'll definitely not evict A, so

34
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:11,170
we know that the next four
accesses to A will be all hits.

35
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:14,830
E will be replacing one
of these three blocks.

36
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:19,000
So if we replace C or D,
then here we will have a hit.

37
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,910
If we, however, select B for
replacement, and

38
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:25,080
put E there,
then B here will have a miss.

39
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,290
So we have a hit or a miss here.

40
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:33,430
In total, we have one, two,
three, four, five, or six misses.

41
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:35,930
So this is the final
answer to this quiz.
