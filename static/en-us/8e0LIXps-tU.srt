1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,291
Now I'm going to give you some sentences
or axioms in first-order logic.

2
00:00:04,291 --> 00:00:07,359
And I want you to tell
me if they correctly or

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:11,580
incorrectly represent the English
that I'm asking about.

4
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:16,859
So tell me yes or no,
are these good representations?

5
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:22,179
And the first, I want to represent
the English sentence Sam has two jobs.

6
00:00:22,179 --> 00:00:27,609
And the first order logic sentence

7
00:00:27,609 --> 00:00:34,723
is there exists an x and
y such that job of Sam,

8
00:00:34,723 --> 00:00:39,799
x and job of Sam, y and not x=y.

9
00:00:39,799 --> 00:00:45,119
And so tell me yes, that correctly
represents Sam has two jobs or

10
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:46,599
no, there's a problem.

11
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:51,500
And secondly, I want to represent
the idea of set membership.

12
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:56,149
Now assume I've already defined
a notion of adding an element to a set.

13
00:00:56,149 --> 00:00:59,679
Can I define set membership for
these two axioms?

14
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:07,140
For all x and s,
x is a member of the result of adding x

15
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:12,316
to any set s and for all x and

16
00:01:12,316 --> 00:01:17,900
s, x is a member of s implies that for
all y,

17
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:23,300
x is a member of the set that
you get when you add y to s.

18
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:28,906
And third,
I'm going to try to define the notion of

19
00:01:28,906 --> 00:01:32,750
adjacent squares on say, a checkerboard.

20
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:36,022
Where the squares are numbered
with x and y coordinates and

21
00:01:36,022 --> 00:01:40,969
we want to just talk about adjacency in
the horizontal and vertical directions.

22
00:01:40,969 --> 00:01:43,769
Can I define that as follows?

23
00:01:43,769 --> 00:01:48,420
For all x and y, the square x,

24
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:53,442
y is adjacent to the square + x,

25
00:01:53,442 --> 00:01:57,162
1, y and the square x,

26
00:01:57,162 --> 00:02:03,129
y is adjacent to the square x + y, 1.

27
00:02:03,129 --> 00:02:06,658
And assume that we've defined
the notion of + somewhere.

28
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:14,930
And that the character set allows + to
occur as the character for a function.

29
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:16,140
Tell me yes or

30
00:02:16,139 --> 00:02:20,125
no, is that a good representation
of the notion of adjacency?
