1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,160
So water would satisfy our physiological need. Earning a pay cheque would help

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:08,678
give us safety and security. Having a happy and secure relationship would

3
00:00:08,678 --> 00:00:12,885
satisfy the love and belonging level of a hierarchy. Self-confidence would

4
00:00:12,885 --> 00:00:16,481
fulfill the esteem level of the hierarchy and finally having a satisfying

5
00:00:16,481 --> 00:00:21,835
fulfilling career would fulfill the self actualization level of the hierarchy.

6
00:00:21,835 --> 00:00:26,106
So let's take a step back and look at masters hierarchy of needs. It makes

7
00:00:26,106 --> 00:00:29,868
sense that we would need to have our physical needs met before ever considering

8
00:00:29,868 --> 00:00:33,573
realizing our full potential, so to recap we need our physiological needs met

9
00:00:33,573 --> 00:00:39,349
then we can move on to other safety and security needs. And once those two

10
00:00:39,349 --> 00:00:44,090
criteria are met we can move on to our loving and belonging needs. Once we have

11
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:49,790
achieved love and belonging then we move up the hierarchy to our esteem needs.

12
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:54,090
And then finally self-actualization, which is the very top of the pyramid.
