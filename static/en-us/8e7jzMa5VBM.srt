1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,190
So thus far what we have done, is we have

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:05,440
defined the class Movie and then we went ahead and defined

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:09,220
a couple of instances of that class, namely Toy Story and

4
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:12,590
Avatar. Next, what I want to do is I want to

5
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:16,110
run a quick little part experiment which is, what do you

6
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:19,430
think will happen if I remove the keyword self. From in

7
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:21,860
front of one of the instance variables. So let me just

8
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:25,320
go ahead and do that right now. [SOUND] There. Now I

9
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,920
want to think about this question. Here is the code for

10
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,660
the class Movie one more time, and this is the self

11
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,480
I'm wanting to remove from in front of storyline. And I

12
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,060
want you to think about this question especially in the context

13
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:41,110
of running this code, which is print(avatar.storyline). Once you have a

14
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:44,970
hypothesis, I want you to enter it in this box. After

15
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:47,950
you've submitted this response, I want you to make this change

16
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:51,490
on your own computer and see if your hypothesis matches your result.
