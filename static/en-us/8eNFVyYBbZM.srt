1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:04,010
So a lot of really exciting things
are happening in the world of web

2
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:05,060
development right now.

3
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:05,780
We have new API's,

4
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:08,230
new features coming down in
the browsers, that kind of thing.

5
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:12,040
What most excites you about
where things are headed?

6
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:14,950
>> Where things are headed right
now is one is web components.

7
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:21,010
I think it's really cool because when
I was learning like HTML 4, HTML 5.

8
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:24,370
I always had to like kind of
reinvent the wheel of like,

9
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:29,240
all these little components these models
and all these little moving features.

10
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:32,430
Wouldn't it be great if you could just,
in other programming languages,

11
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:36,290
like some sort of GUID framework,
in .net or

12
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:40,870
in our programming language
wouldn't it be great for

13
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:45,630
me to just take a component that's
been fleshed out already and

14
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:49,770
then I just add it on to my site and
make it my own then I can just really

15
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:52,190
concentrate on making
my own application and

16
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:55,083
not have to worry about all the mundane
things that I need to make.

17
00:00:55,083 --> 00:00:59,575
Like, need to make sure that
the JavaScript is working fine.

18
00:00:59,575 --> 00:01:02,545
Need to make sure that the backend's
like communicating fine.

19
00:01:02,545 --> 00:01:04,754
But, that's one of
the most exciting things.

20
00:01:04,754 --> 00:01:09,045
It really will empower me and
other feature developers, you know,

21
00:01:09,045 --> 00:01:11,399
make things quicker, make things faster,
and also, just really.

22
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:16,800
At the end make the experience
a whole lot better for users.

23
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,580
>> Have you had an opportunity yet
to actually play with web components and

24
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:22,870
use them yourself because the browsers
are starting to get there, but

25
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:23,550
not quite.

26
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:25,190
Have you played with that at all?

27
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:28,662
>> Not so much right now, [CROSSTALK]
just excited about what's coming about

28
00:01:28,662 --> 00:01:32,134
cause I was looking at Google IO,
like events, and I was thinking wow,

29
00:01:32,134 --> 00:01:33,157
this is really cool.

30
00:01:33,157 --> 00:01:36,825
And I need to play around with
palmer because that's Google's own

31
00:01:36,825 --> 00:01:39,080
implementation in Chrome so.

32
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:41,609
Because I know right now if
I were to really do it for

33
00:01:41,609 --> 00:01:43,549
a real project it's going to be hard.

34
00:01:43,549 --> 00:01:44,847
>> Right.

35
00:01:44,847 --> 00:01:49,136
Natively right because like I need
to make sure that safari will work,

36
00:01:49,136 --> 00:01:50,372
firefox will work,

37
00:01:50,372 --> 00:01:55,184
mobile tablet I need to make sure that
my web components that I'm using works.

38
00:01:55,184 --> 00:01:56,960
There's a lot more headaches.

39
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:57,691
>> [CROSSTALK] It's not quite there yet.

40
00:01:57,691 --> 00:01:58,553
>> [CROSSTALK] Not quite there yet, but

41
00:01:58,553 --> 00:01:59,683
that's where I'm going
really excited for.

42
00:01:59,683 --> 00:02:00,183
>> Cool.
