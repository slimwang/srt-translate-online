00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,477
Remember, I still have 1 3rd of a cup of sugar that I can use at home to make

2
00:00:04,489 --> 00:00:09,362
brownies. I've drawn it over here, this 1 3rd cup of sugar actually represents 2

3
00:00:09,374 --> 00:00:14,222
fraction amounts. I can see that this 1 3rd cup of sugar actually represents 1/2

4
00:00:14,234 --> 00:00:19,015
of a batch of brownies. So I made one batch of brownies from 2 3rds cup of sugar

5
00:00:19,027 --> 00:00:23,520
and I made a half a batch of brownies from 1 3rd cup of sugar. And all together

6
00:00:23,532 --> 00:00:27,775
I used 1 3rd and 2 3rds which is 1 cup. I can see all together I made one and a

7
00:00:27,787 --> 00:00:32,409
half batches of brownies. I used 2 3rds cup of sugar to make one batch. And then

8
00:00:32,421 --> 00:00:36,875
with the extra 1 3rd cup of sugar I made half of a batch. I saw that, that piece

9
00:00:36,887 --> 00:00:39,552
was a half of a batch of brownies. So one and a half all together.
