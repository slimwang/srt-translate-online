00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,596
Let's look at this study. One group of researchers went to a neighborhood and

2
00:00:03,596 --> 00:00:06,924
knocked on the front doors of people's houses and asked them to put up a large,

3
00:00:06,924 --> 00:00:12,325
somewhat ugly sign in their front yard that said drive carefully. 17% of

4
00:00:12,325 --> 00:00:17,830
homeowners agreed to do so. A second group of homeowners were first asked to

5
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:23,601
sign a petition that was to be submitted to state representatives. They would

6
00:00:23,601 --> 00:00:27,948
promote safe driving after they signed the petition they were then asked to

7
00:00:27,948 --> 00:00:32,226
install the large of the sign and 55% of them actually agreed to put the sign

8
00:00:32,226 --> 00:00:36,504
in their lawn, now why is it that 17% of the first group agreed, but 55% in the

9
00:00:36,504 --> 00:00:45,017
second group agreed and the sign was the exact same sign. This can be explained

10
00:00:45,017 --> 00:00:50,126
by the specific technique of persuasion called foot-in-the-door technique. And

11
00:00:50,126 --> 00:00:55,240
this is asking for a small request first, such as will you sign this petition.

12
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:59,394
And then followed up by a larger request such as, will you put this huge sign

13
00:00:59,394 --> 00:01:05,190
in your front yard. People use this technique quite often. Perhaps you've

14
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:08,440
gotten a request from a charitable organization for a small donation, only to

15
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:13,575
find out that you later receive requests for even larger donations. Those

16
00:01:13,575 --> 00:01:17,064
organizations are using this technique. Or, when I asked you if you liked my

17
00:01:17,064 --> 00:01:20,136
class, and then I asked you to change your profile picture, this is the foot in

18
00:01:20,136 --> 00:01:24,800
the door technique. But let's go to Susan for other techniques of persuasion.
