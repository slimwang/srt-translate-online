1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
And the answer here is no, we cannot.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
And the reason is as follows; so when we simulate nondeterminism

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
on a deterministic RAM, what we have is here--a polynomial--

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and here we have 2 to the power of that polynomial,

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,500
which essentially was needed for trying all possibilities for using the "if better" function

6
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,000
or nondeterminism, if you will.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Now if we tried the same thing over here, what we would have--we would have

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,500
a nondeterministic machine that runs in 2^p(n) time.

9
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,000
Now if you wanted to simulate this on a deterministic RAM,

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,000
what you could have in the worst case is a running time of 2 ^2^p(n),

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
which does not fall into this category here anymore because we said that

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:49,000
exponential time was 2^p(n) and not 2 to the power of some exponential function of n.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
So you must not make the mistake that simply because we can simulate NP

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
in exponential time, we can also simulate

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
nondeterministic exponential time in exponential time.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
But given how bad these running times here are, you will, of course,

17
00:01:02,000 --> 99:59:59,999
not come across them very often in practice.
