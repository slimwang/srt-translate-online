1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,010
Now that we have the order summary,
we need to send it off in an email so

2
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:05,270
that we can actually get our coffee.

3
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:07,650
This is what it would look like
when we hit the Order button.

4
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:11,020
It opens up an email app on the device
with a prepopulated message

5
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:14,270
containing the coffee order and
a custom subject line.

6
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:15,690
In order to accomplish this,

7
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:18,519
we need to understand a new
topic in Android called intent.

8
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:23,580
And intent is a message that requests
some type of action to be performed

9
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:27,120
by another app component,
such as an activity in another app.

10
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,570
This is a powerful part
of the Android framework.

11
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:33,340
Because our app can leverage
functionality that other apps provide

12
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:36,500
like sending an email,
opening the camera, reviewing a map.

13
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:40,260
It lets us be efficient and
smart as developers,

14
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:43,740
because we're not reinventing
what other apps already do well.

15
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:46,750
Think of sending intents like
tossing a ball to someone.

16
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:50,248
In the same way that a person can
toss a ball to another person,

17
00:00:50,248 --> 00:00:53,767
an app component can send an intent
to another app component.

18
00:00:53,767 --> 00:00:56,840
Here are some examples from
apps that you might recognize.

19
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,700
In the Google Keep note taking app,

20
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:01,610
a user can hit the camera
icon to take a photo.

21
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:05,910
While the Google Keep team could have
written their own camera functionality,

22
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:07,000
instead they get it for

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,050
free by sending an intent to open
up the camera app on the device.

24
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:12,940
Similarly, in the Yelp app,

25
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:17,860
clicking on the location of a business
sends an intent to open up a maps app

26
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:21,730
on the device to provide turn by turn
navigation instructions to the user.

27
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:26,300
And lastly, for a restaurant
page in the Google Maps app,

28
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:30,340
clicking on the Call button sends
an intent to launch the Dialer app so

29
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,940
that the user can make a phone
call to the restaurant.

30
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:36,710
The coolest part about sending intents
is that you don't have to know precisely

31
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:39,610
which app is capable of handling it.

32
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:43,140
There could be multiple apps on the
device that could handle the intent, but

33
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,610
ultimately only one needs to handle it.

34
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:48,940
Using our analogy, when you throw
the ball, you don't have to know

35
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:51,920
who you're throwing it at,
as long as someone catches it.

36
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,520
Let me show you what I mean.

37
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,070
For a restaurant listing
in the Google Maps apps,

38
00:01:56,070 --> 00:02:00,160
clicking on Websites sends an intent
to display the restaurant website.

39
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:04,309
Now, the Maps app actually doesn't care
which web browser handles the request.

40
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:08,979
If the user only has one web
browser installed on their device,

41
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:11,920
then that app will automatically
handle the request.

42
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,700
However, if the user has four web
browsers installed on their device,

43
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:20,770
then the Android framework will pop up a
window to ask the user to just pick one.

44
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:22,632
This is what it looks like.

45
00:02:22,632 --> 00:02:26,200
The pop-up window is known
as a disambiguation dialog.

46
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,932
Once the user makes a choice,

47
00:02:27,932 --> 00:02:32,245
then the system sends the intent to
the selected app to handle the action.

48
00:02:32,245 --> 00:02:35,300
And in this case the restaurant
website is displayed.

49
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:38,900
Now let's move on to talking about
what's contained inside this ball

50
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,440
that represent an intent.

51
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:44,520
You can think of an intent as a message
specifying some operation to be

52
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,540
performed.

53
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:49,440
It contains two primary things,
the general action and

54
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,010
some data to act upon.

55
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:55,340
You can also specify additional
information such as category, component,

56
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:58,560
and extras,
which is literally extra information.

57
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,460
All of these things are used
by Android to determine which

58
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:04,040
app component can actually
handle the intent.

59
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:09,030
For example a maps intent would
contain the action ACTION_VIEW,

60
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:10,640
and the data would be the latitude and

61
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,800
longitude coordinates of
the location that we want to see.

62
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,610
The rest of the fields can be blank.

63
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:18,720
Then, any app that's capable
of displaying latitude and

64
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,990
longitude coordinates can be
used to handle the request,

65
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:24,120
which is probably any maps application.

66
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:27,240
Another example is to use
an intent to dial a phone number.

67
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:32,130
In this case, you would compose an
intent where the action is ACTION_DIAL

68
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:34,840
and the corresponding data is
the telephone number to call.

69
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:39,460
Notice that the format is in the form
tel, colon, followed by the number.

70
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:45,080
This formatted string is called a URI,
short for uniform resource identifier.

71
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,580
This is a standardized
way to structure data so

72
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:50,480
that it can be properly
processed on the receiving end.

73
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,780
Think about it like a mailing address,
it follows a structure so

74
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:55,370
that it can be delivered properly.

75
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:58,470
In case of sending an intent,
a URI is needed so

76
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:02,140
that the data can be properly passed
to the receiving app component.

77
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:06,159
Depending on the data encoded in
the intent the scheme may change,

78
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:09,338
such as this case or
the geo case that we saw earlier.
