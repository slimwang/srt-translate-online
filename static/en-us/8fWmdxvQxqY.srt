1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:02,860
If you start to add too many
things to the order form,

2
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:05,370
then the content can get
cut off at the bottom.

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:07,030
Like this could get
pushed off the screen and

4
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:08,680
then you wouldn't be able to see it.

5
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:11,610
A vertical linear layout
doesn't scroll if it extends

6
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:13,420
beyond the edge of the screen.

7
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:16,309
You need to add something specific
in your app to make it vertically

8
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:17,620
scrollable.

9
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:21,610
This is a silly example, but I basically
copied the views that we have in our

10
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:24,650
layout and
then pasted it right after each other.

11
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:27,210
And you can see that even
though there's more content

12
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:29,650
beyond the edge of this screen,
it still doesn't scroll.

13
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:35,578
This is especially a common problem
when you switch your phone to landscape

14
00:00:35,578 --> 00:00:39,444
mode and the screen is shorter
compared to in portrait mode.

15
00:00:39,444 --> 00:00:41,630
That's where it'd be really
convenient if this could scroll.

16
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:45,720
And now I'll leave it to you
to figure out how to do this.

17
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:48,290
When you're done,
you can describe how you did it here.

18
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:51,160
You can write it with your feather
quill, or just use your keyboard.
