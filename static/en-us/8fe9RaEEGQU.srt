00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,207
I'm Eric Haines and I'll be teaching about something I love, computer graphics.

2
00:00:04,208 --> 00:00:08,394
What's not to like? In this area of computer science, you will write code to

3
00:00:08,394 --> 00:00:12,828
create cool pictures. I've been programming computers since 1974 and I've been

4
00:00:12,828 --> 00:00:17,182
working on computer graphics since 1983. With computer chips constantly getting

5
00:00:17,182 --> 00:00:21,068
faster and with graphics accelerators, in particular evolving at a rapid clip,

6
00:00:21,068 --> 00:00:25,106
the rules about what's possible change time and time again. There's always new

7
00:00:25,106 --> 00:00:29,776
things to learn. I guarantee that the computer languages and hardware we will

8
00:00:29,776 --> 00:00:34,016
use will change. The good news for you as a student is that I'm going to focus

9
00:00:34,016 --> 00:00:37,942
on what makes computer graphics tick. The underlying principles I'll cover here

10
00:00:37,942 --> 00:00:42,075
will give you a firm foundation in the field. I'm particularly excited that I'll

11
00:00:42,075 --> 00:00:46,650
be able to teach this class now. A few years ago, such a class would have been

12
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:51,145
extremely difficult. With the rise of a web technology called WebGL, you can

13
00:00:51,145 --> 00:00:55,230
simply click on a link and immediately run a 3D demo for yourself. In some

14
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:58,630
trivial sense, everything you see on your computer screen can be called computer

15
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:03,326
graphics. Word processors, videos, such as this one of me, paint programs, and

16
00:01:03,326 --> 00:01:06,003
much else result in images on your monitor.
