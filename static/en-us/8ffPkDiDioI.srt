00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
[Narrator] So, let me makes this alpha-wise expressive and ask another question.

00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Is it possible that P1 is never sampled

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
in the resampling step? Yes or no?

4
00:00:11,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Please just check one.
