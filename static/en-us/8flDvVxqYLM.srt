00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:03,275
Well, first of all, this prompt doesn't match what we want the user to do

2
00:00:03,275 --> 00:00:07,115
anymore. That's a bit better. We also need to check more things about the

3
00:00:07,115 --> 00:00:12,834
value. If it's too low or too high, we keep asking. Too low would be that value

4
00:00:12,834 --> 00:00:18,892
is less than zero. And too high would be if the value is greater than 100. If

5
00:00:18,892 --> 00:00:22,430
either of those is true, we want to keep going. Let's test this out and make

6
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:26,276
sure that the edge cases work well too. It's asking me to enter an integer

7
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:30,958
between zero and 100 inclusive. If I enter something like 101, it'll keep

8
00:00:30,958 --> 00:00:35,592
asking. That's good. Now, if I enter something like negative one, it still

9
00:00:35,592 --> 00:00:41,079
keeps asking. That's also good. But it should accept zero and 100. Looks like

10
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:46,389
it accepted zero. Let's try running it again. Will it accept 100? Looks like it

11
00:00:46,389 --> 00:00:50,609
accepted it. So this was the correct condition to check the user's input.
