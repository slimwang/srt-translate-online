1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,670
All right, so
here's the solution I used.

2
00:00:02,788 --> 00:00:06,400
So, I have the Select command and
here are the columns that I want.

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:10,220
The name and weight, and I'm indicating
I want it from the pets table.

4
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:14,678
Using the WHERE keyword,
I specify I want the gender,

5
00:00:14,678 --> 00:00:18,870
equal to 1, which indicates male, and

6
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:22,470
I want all this information ordered
by weight in descending order.
