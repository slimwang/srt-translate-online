00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,380
I mention that XFS uses log based

2
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:06,780
striping in software. So let's understand that technology

3
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:11,690
in a little bit more detail. You have clients on the local area network that

4
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:18,090
are writing to files. When a client makes a change to a file. The changes

5
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:24,930
that are made by this client to files are written to an append only log.

6
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:27,410
And this append only log is a data

7
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:30,460
structure. This log segment is a data structure

8
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:33,460
in the memory of the client in the

9
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:36,410
distributed file system and this append only data

10
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:40,230
structure contains ,the changes made to files on

11
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:43,790
this client node. And for instance, this could

12
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:50,170
be a change for a particular file X, this could be a change for another file

13
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:55,070
Z and so on, and so forth. And this is an append only data structure that is

14
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:58,400
residing at this client. Similarly, there is a log

15
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:01,660
segment that is available at this client. For the

16
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:05,080
changes made to files on this node, and when

17
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:08,970
this log segment fills up beyond a certain capacity,

18
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:11,920
you decide on a certain threshold, and once that

19
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,240
threshold number of fragments have been written in this

20
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,320
log segment, then you decide that it's time

21
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,770
now to write to the disk. So you take

22
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:24,010
these log fragments,and compute the parity, which is the

23
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:26,600
check sum or ECC, whatever you may want to call

24
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:32,030
it, and this becomes the log segment that I want to write to the disk.

25
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:36,985
And you take this and stripe it across storage servers. So you take

26
00:01:36,985 --> 00:01:41,840
this,particular log fragment along with its ECC and

27
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,720
stripe it on storage servers so that it is

28
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,670
now available on the storage system and as I

29
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:51,470
mentioned, you want to do this periodically in order

30
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:54,730
to avoid the chance of [INAUDIBLE] Data loss due to

31
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:57,670
failures of a particular node, and that's what you're

32
00:01:57,670 --> 00:02:00,990
doing every periodically. Same thing is happening on this

33
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:03,510
so if you look at the storage server, you

34
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:06,900
see that the storage server has the log segments that

35
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:10,169
have been written by this client, and the log segment

36
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:12,530
that has been written by the log segment that has

37
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:15,460
been written by this client. All of this, gets into

38
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:18,220
the storage servers, and the other thing that you want to

39
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:21,960
do is, you don't want every log segment to be

40
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:25,190
written on all the disks available on the local area

41
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:27,310
network, you don't want to do that. This again is

42
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:32,100
concerned with solving the small rate problem, and therefore, what we

43
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:38,060
want to do is subset the storage servers, and say if, let's say i have 100

44
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:40,890
storage servers available on the local area network.

45
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:43,930
I might decide that every log segment is

46
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:51,240
going to write its log over a small fraction of that maybe 10 servers. And this

47
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:54,790
client may similarly choose a subset of storage

48
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:57,340
servers to write it on. The subset of storage

49
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:00,860
servers that is used for striping a given log segment

50
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:04,160
is called a stripe group, for that particular log segment.
