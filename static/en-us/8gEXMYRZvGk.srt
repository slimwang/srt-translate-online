1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,822
So thinking back to our case study, if
instead of subtracting this quantity 3w +

2
00:00:04,834 --> 00:00:09,292
12n, we wanted to add it, it would
effectively be the same as, for example,

3
00:00:09,396 --> 00:00:14,198
getting another three orders for wiper
blades and another 12 orders for nozzles.

4
00:00:14,302 --> 00:00:19,423
So, we would be adding new orders to the
original number of orders that he had. And

5
00:00:19,435 --> 00:00:24,361
therefore he would make more money in the
end. We know that some of that money would

6
00:00:24,373 --> 00:00:29,390
come from the wiper blade orders, and some
of it would also come from the nozzles. So

7
00:00:29,402 --> 00:00:34,146
we want to add both those quantities to
the original expression. So, that means

8
00:00:34,158 --> 00:00:38,769
that both of the terms, 3w and 12n. Should
be positive. So the answer is 3w plus 12n.

9
00:00:38,862 --> 00:00:43,027
So you can see the difference here between
having a negative sign, or a minus sign,

10
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:47,098
in front of something inside parentheses
versus having a plus sign in front of

11
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:51,088
something inside parentheses. The minus
sign up here ends up applying to both

12
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:55,216
terms that were inside the parentheses,
but down here. We didn't actually change

13
00:00:55,228 --> 00:00:59,058
the sign of either term that is in the
parenthesis. Keep this in mind as we move

14
00:00:58,833 --> 00:00:58,833
forward.
