1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,260
Is it because they are very efficient?

2
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:04,208
Yes.
They are efficient because signature

3
00:00:04,208 --> 00:00:07,850
matching or
matching can be very efficient.

4
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:10,540
Is it because they are effective
against known malware?

5
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:12,480
The answer is yes.

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,510
Known malware means that a malware
that matches a signature.

7
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:19,610
And of course,
signature based approach is effective

8
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:22,760
against these malware that
have signatures already.

9
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:26,770
Is a good first line defense,
yes, because with this approach

10
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:30,120
at least we can detect all
the known malware already.

11
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:32,509
Therefore it is a good
first line defense.
