00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,080
Here is a concrete example of an

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:07,010
extension. It's a fairly standard implementation, let's say

3
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:10,560
of Unix operating system, but it is implemented

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:13,140
as an extension on top of the spin.

5
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:15,540
Here is a more fun example. A client

6
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:19,750
server application that is implemented directly on top

7
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:22,180
of spin as an extension. In other words,

8
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:25,610
there is no operating system. A display client

9
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:28,370
uses an extension interface to implement the

10
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:32,670
functionality for displaying video that is going to

11
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:37,070
be sent by a video server. So both of these are extensions on top of basic

12
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:40,400
spin, and provide exactly the functionality that

13
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:43,530
is needed for the video server application. And

14
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:46,880
the bounding box here is showing spin and

15
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:50,610
the extensions thereof. And similarly the bounding box

16
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:54,320
here is showing spin and the extension thereof. In this case

17
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,715
it is an entire operating system, in this case it is just

18
00:00:57,715 --> 00:01:02,000
the client of the video server. And in this case it is

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,600
just the video server itself as an extension on top of spin.
