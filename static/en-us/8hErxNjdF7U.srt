This equation represents a circle. Nice job if you picked the circle. We know

2
00:00:05,428 --> 00:00:09,649
we have equal amounts of x squared and y squared, and if we move the 3y squared

3
00:00:09,649 --> 00:00:13,937
to the left hand side by adding 3y squared to both sides of the equation, we'll

4
00:00:13,937 --> 00:00:20,884
get this equation. We have equal amounts of x squared and y squared, so we have

5
00:00:20,884 --> 00:00:25,666
a perfect circle. And notice, too, that we could divide each of these terms by

6
00:00:25,666 --> 00:00:30,177
3. When we divide the equation through via factor of 3, we'll get x squared

7
00:00:30,177 --> 00:00:37,237
plus y squared equals 9. This is a circle with a radius of 3 units. And just to

8
00:00:37,237 --> 00:00:41,090
be sure I'll show you that each of these graphs are exactly the same.
