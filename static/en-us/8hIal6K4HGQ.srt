1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,420
When we first open up the Miwok app,
we see this list of categories.

2
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:08,390
Now, there's only a couple of categories
here, and this list is pretty fixed.

3
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:09,330
So in this case,

4
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:13,670
we can stick with using a vertical
linear layout with four text views.

5
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:16,670
Now on the other hand,
when I tap into the Numbers activity,

6
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:19,230
these list items could
get more complicated.

7
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:22,500
We could potentially add a lot more
vocabulary words to this list.

8
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:26,120
For example, deciding to display
the numbers 1 through 1,000.

9
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:30,480
So this list is a good use case for
viewer cycling.

10
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,940
So I'm going to show you
how to modify our code so

11
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:35,630
that we can use the list view and
array adapter.

12
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:38,680
Now, I know there's a lot of concepts
going on right now but it's okay.

13
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:40,670
We'll take it one step at a time.

14
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:44,380
First, I'd like you to get the code
working and running on your phone.

15
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:47,356
And then I want you to make some
observations on how you think it's all

16
00:00:47,356 --> 00:00:48,241
working together.

17
00:00:48,241 --> 00:00:49,200
And then afterwards,

18
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,490
we'll walk through together what's
exactly happening behind the scenes.
