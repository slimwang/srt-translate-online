00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:04,540
Welcome to the first lesson of machine
learning algorithms for trading.

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:07,320
In this lesson we're going to
introduce how hedge funds and

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:11,300
other financial institutions
utilize machine learning.

4
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:14,640
In general, the focus is on creating
a model that can be used to predict

5
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:18,120
future prices for
stocks or other assets.

6
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:20,930
Models like these have been around for
a long time.

7
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:24,810
What's different about machine learning
is that it provides a suite of tools

8
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:28,430
that support a data-centric way
to build predictive models.
