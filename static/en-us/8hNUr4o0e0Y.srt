1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:03,950
In the previous exercise, you practiced querying for all entities

2
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:06,820
of a kind. Magnus has talked to you about querying

3
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:09,420
by kind and by property. So the next step is

4
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,910
for you to write the code and fill the search results

5
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:15,270
by property values. For example, you could find all the

6
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:19,040
conferences whose city property has a value London. To add

7
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:21,030
a filer to a query, you either call up the

8
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:26,050
filter method specifying the property and operate a filter on and

9
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:29,140
the value of the filter on. So, for example, if you

10
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:32,900
need to fill from the city property and the value London.

11
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:35,310
But let's suppose you already created the query and now you

12
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:38,750
want to add filters. After you create a query object you can't

13
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:41,690
change it. In other words, it's immutable. So to make changes

14
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:44,740
to your query you need to reassign the variable and this is

15
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:47,310
how you build up your query. So let's say this is

16
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:51,120
my original query where I'm getting all the conferences ordered by name.

17
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:54,620
So now to add my filter, I just reassign

18
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:57,060
query back to itself really but that makes a copy

19
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:59,310
of it and, in this way, you can keep adding

20
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:02,360
filters. And that's what you're going to be doing now
