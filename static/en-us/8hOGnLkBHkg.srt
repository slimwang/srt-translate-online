1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,172
Since we're thinking about powers, I'd like to backtrack for a second and deal

2
00:00:04,172 --> 00:00:08,467
with an equation involving a real number. Can you tell me what the solution to X

3
00:00:08,467 --> 00:00:12,448
squared equals 3 is? I'd like you to write this as an exact answer, not as a

4
00:00:12,448 --> 00:00:16,724
decimal. And remember to be careful about what happens when you want to get rid

5
00:00:16,724 --> 00:00:20,862
of an exponent. Make sure that you cover all of the possible solutions for X.
