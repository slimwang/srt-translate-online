00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,400
Now are linear equations, the only kind of functions that can make up the

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:07,924
pieces of a piecewise function? Definitely not. We can go crazy and make each

3
00:00:07,924 --> 00:00:13,000
section any kind of function we want. So, how about this graph? How would we

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,016
express the piecewise function that I've shown right here? Please fill in both

5
00:00:17,016 --> 00:00:21,853
the function part in the domain part for each portion of the graph. Now when

6
00:00:21,853 --> 00:00:24,891
you do this, I'd like you to start at the top here with the left-most portion

7
00:00:24,891 --> 00:00:29,132
of the graph, and then work your way right. That way the values we see here in

8
00:00:29,132 --> 00:00:31,040
the domain are going to increase.
