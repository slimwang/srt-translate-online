00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:06,330
When I'm hiring a junior iOS developer,
or just about any junior developer,

2
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:08,930
there are basically two
things that I'm looking for.

3
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:14,020
I'm looking for
a solid foundation and also passion.

4
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:16,760
With a solid foundation I
mean that I'm not looking for

5
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:19,430
quantity of knowledge, but quality.

6
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:25,180
I will never ask questions about a very
specific detail on some framework.

7
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:27,970
That doesn't give me the information
that I'm looking for.

8
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:34,150
I want to make sure that any code that
he brings to our existing code base

9
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:39,600
will work, will be reusable by
the team and won't break anything.

10
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:44,490
So I will try to center on questions

11
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:49,780
that show if he has a solid foundation
on the basics of iOS development.

12
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:54,670
For example I will always
ask the candidate if she

13
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:59,070
understands the model,
view, and controller.

14
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:01,980
How they relate to each other and

15
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:06,900
what are the main responsibilities
of each of these teams.

16
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:11,840
A common mistake that many
beginners make is not using

17
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:16,250
the right method to send information
from one object to the other.

18
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:20,247
I'm talking about things
like the delegate,

19
00:01:20,247 --> 00:01:24,560
notifications, and
target action for example.

20
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,763
So that's something that I always
ask if he has an understanding of

21
00:01:28,763 --> 00:01:32,290
notifications, when you
should use notifications and

22
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:34,840
when you should use delegate instead.

23
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,640
That's a common mistake.

24
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,690
So this is the sort of quality of
knowledge that I'm looking for.

25
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:46,860
Another question that
I will try to ask is

26
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:49,480
try to find out if he's
passionate about what he's doing.

27
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:55,500
It's vital that this is not just a job.

28
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,110
It must be your hobby, too.

29
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:03,860
So a few years ago,
there was an accident in New York where

30
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:10,150
the pilot of the plane managed to do an
unpowered landing on the Hudson river.

31
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:15,100
And a few days later,
his resume became public and

32
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:20,330
it was very obvious why this pilot
was a great hire for US Airways.

33
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:23,490
His job was piloting an airbus and

34
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:28,680
his hobby was piloting a Cessna, so
he was a total nerd about flying.

35
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,580
This is the kind of
people you need to find.

36
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:38,830
If the candidate shows that her hobby
is also programming, that's a hire.

37
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:43,990
So I'll try to find that by
asking if she has any GitHub

38
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:49,160
profile that's a must,
any side projects that he or

39
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:54,050
she is working on by himself and

40
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:57,270
contributions to open source
software that sort of thing.

41
00:02:57,270 --> 00:03:01,340
That shows that he's really
really passionate about coding.

42
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:05,240
So that's what I'm really looking for
in a junior IOS developer or

43
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,530
just about any junior developer.
