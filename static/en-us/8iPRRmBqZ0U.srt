00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,985
And did you guys know that we can further divide the Autonomic Nervous System

2
00:00:03,985 --> 00:00:08,690
into Sympathetic and Parasympathetic? So essentially, the Autonomic Nervous

3
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:11,890
System is our self governing system because what it regulates we have little

4
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:16,323
control over. For example, it controls things like heart rate or blood

5
00:00:16,323 --> 00:00:20,135
pressure, even digestion. But I'm going to bring Susan in to ask her a few

6
00:00:20,135 --> 00:00:23,936
questions. Because I think that the Sympathetic and Parasympathetic, there's a

7
00:00:23,936 --> 00:00:28,010
difference between automatically reving us up or calming us down.

8
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:31,720
>> You're right, Lauren. Under the Autonomic Nervous System, we both our

9
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:36,532
Sympathetic and Parasympathetic. The Sympathetic is often termed our fight or

10
00:00:36,532 --> 00:00:40,958
flight response. When we are encountered with stressful or dangerous

11
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:45,448
situations, this is the nervous system that's going to be activated. That is an

12
00:00:45,448 --> 00:00:50,343
opposite for the Parasympathetic. Here we talk about the normally relaxed

13
00:00:50,343 --> 00:00:54,914
state. So, if you are relaxing, digesting your food, this would be our

14
00:00:54,914 --> 00:01:00,270
Parasympathetic. However, if there is a stressful response, the Sympathetic

15
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:05,388
Nervous System will automatically be activated. Here we'll see that we will no

16
00:01:05,388 --> 00:01:10,330
longer have blood going to our gut to digest our food. Instead that blood is

17
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:15,088
going to go to our muscles, which will allow us to fight or to flee. It is

18
00:01:15,088 --> 00:01:18,932
important to note however, that the Sympathetic Nervous System cannot be

19
00:01:18,932 --> 00:01:24,246
activated indefinitely. There will be a time in which it has to rest, so we can

20
00:01:24,246 --> 00:01:27,744
replenish the neurotransmitters that have been released during this fight or

21
00:01:27,744 --> 00:01:32,934
flight response. We'll talk about neurotransmitters shortly.
