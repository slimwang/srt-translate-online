1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:03,280
Now, another part of the script was the track. And

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:06,689
we really haven't talked a lot about track so far. So let's talk a little bit

3
00:00:06,689 --> 00:00:10,941
more about it. So here are four tracks with the restaurant script.

4
00:00:10,941 --> 00:00:13,070
That really [INAUDIBLE] to going to restaurant, four kinds.

5
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:17,100
Here's a coffeehouse, fast food, casual dining, formal dining. You could add

6
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:21,740
more if you wanted to. Now in restaurants of all kinds, some even so common.

7
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:26,280
You have to go to a restaurant, you have to order some food. You eat that food.

8
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:29,750
You pay the bill. And then you leave. That is common to all of them which is

9
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:32,890
why all of them are part of the restaurant script. On the other hand what

10
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:36,240
happens in a Coffeehouse is quite different from what happens in Formal Dining,

11
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:39,350
which is quite different from what happens in a Fast Food restaurant.

12
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:42,520
So you may have specific cracks that correspond to Coffeehouses and

13
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:46,280
Fast Foods and so on. In effect, we are building a semantic hierarchy or script.

14
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,970
Here is a script for going to a restaurant. Here is a script for going to

15
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:53,270
a coffeehouse, going to fast food. And this can be tracks in the overall script.

16
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:56,780
Of course, we can build a semantic hierarchy of something higher than this.

17
00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:00,156
We could think about going to, for social events and [INAUDIBLE] going to this

18
00:01:00,156 --> 00:01:04,828
restaurant becomes part of going to a social event of various kind. Okay now

19
00:01:04,828 --> 00:01:08,710
that we know something about the [UNKNOWN] representation called script,

20
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:12,659
the next question becomes how many AI agent actually use these scripts? So

21
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:15,196
imagine an AI agent that is hungry has some money and

22
00:01:15,196 --> 00:01:19,220
decides to do something about it. So it may go into its long term memory and

23
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:22,210
find out the script that will be most useful for

24
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:25,980
the current situation. This really becomes a classification problem.

25
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:28,480
In long term memory a large number of scripts, and

26
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:33,550
the agent is trying to classify the current situation into one of those scripts.

27
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:36,950
Let us suppose the agent picks a restaurant script, and decides to execute it.

28
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:40,470
As it enters the restaurant, the scene it observes in the restaurant matches

29
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:44,380
the conditions of a fast food script. So it decides to invoke the fast food

30
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:48,170
script. This way the robot may walk down the semantic hierarchy,

31
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:51,170
first in working the restaurant script, then working the fast food script, and

32
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:54,640
so on. Now a robot could have taken a different stance.

33
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,080
A robot could have decided to do planning. Given some initial conditions, and

34
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:01,780
cold conditions, a robot may have used the operative that is available to it,

35
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:05,780
to generate a plan at one time. While the script is doing it, it is giving it

36
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:10,042
a plan in a compiled form. The robot doesn't have to generate this plan at

37
00:02:10,042 --> 00:02:14,570
runtime. It is already available in memory in a pre stored form. This is very

38
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:17,910
useful because one of the central conundrums that we have been talking about is,

39
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:23,340
how is it possible that AI agents can't address computationally complex problems

40
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:27,495
with limited resources in near real time? In a complex dynamic world,

41
00:02:27,495 --> 00:02:31,610
planning can take a lot of time. But if I already have the store plans,

42
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:34,350
then in working the script and executing it is much faster.
