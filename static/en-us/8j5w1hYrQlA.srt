1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,828
Another key resource are people.

2
00:00:02,828 --> 00:00:05,769
We sometimes use the fancy word of human resources or HR

3
00:00:05,769 --> 00:00:09,609
and I kind of think of people in a start up as two separate categories.

4
00:00:09,609 --> 00:00:13,969
One is finding qualified employees. The other is for you to find them.

5
00:00:13,969 --> 00:00:18,729
How do you find mentors or teachers or coaches or advisers for you.

6
00:00:18,729 --> 00:00:20,799
What's the difference between all of these?

7
00:00:20,799 --> 00:00:22,909
Well let me start with the last first.

8
00:00:22,909 --> 00:00:28,088
Mentors, teachers, and coaches advance your personal career.

9
00:00:28,088 --> 00:00:32,639
If you want to learn a specific subject you find a teacher

10
00:00:32,639 --> 00:00:39,639
but if you want to hone specific skills or reach an exact goal, I suggest you hire a coach.

11
00:00:39,639 --> 00:00:44,569
That is a specific subject as a teacher, specific skills as a coach.

12
00:00:44,569 --> 00:00:48,539
So for example if you want to learn something more about ??? architectures,

13
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:51,698
You can bring in a teacher or take a class

14
00:00:51,698 --> 00:00:54,699
but if you want to hone specific skills like how to create great presentation

15
00:00:54,699 --> 00:01:00,419
or how to manage people, you hire a coach but the one that sometimes founders forget

16
00:01:00,419 --> 00:01:04,679
is that you want to get smarter, better over your career.

17
00:01:04,679 --> 00:01:08,689
You want to find someone who cares enough about you to be a mentor.

18
00:01:08,689 --> 00:01:12,499
Mentors are very different from teachers and coaches.

19
00:01:12,499 --> 00:01:15,690
Mentors are actually a two way street.

20
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:19,479
The only people who tend to want to help you are those who personally think

21
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:23,729
they could actually learn something from you and then they simply liking you.

22
00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:26,788
So most of you in your career would have to go on to be mentors

23
00:01:26,788 --> 00:01:30,949
but think about the type of people who you've encountered in your career.

24
00:01:30,949 --> 00:01:36,778
Implicitly you have been giving something to them while they have been giving something to you.

25
00:01:36,778 --> 00:01:40,579
The last category in mentors, coaches, teachers are advisers.

26
00:01:40,579 --> 00:01:45,589
Now advisers are people you need to help advance your company success.

27
00:01:45,589 --> 00:01:50,919
Mentors, teachers, and coaches know about your personal success as a founder

28
00:01:50,919 --> 00:01:54,728
but advisers really kind of bring generic advise.

29
00:01:54,728 --> 00:01:58,579
Sometimes to you but also to your VPs and your staff etc.

30
00:01:58,579 --> 00:02:01,529
So what you want to have is experienced advise

31
00:02:01,529 --> 00:02:05,488
to help you figure out whether your vision is a hallucination

32
00:02:05,488 --> 00:02:10,779
but getting specific you want to put together as early as possible an advise report

33
00:02:10,779 --> 00:02:18,739
and that's really the idea of expanding your circle of accumulated wisdom as just your investment.

34
00:02:18,739 --> 00:02:26,800
A mistake that founders make the first time is thinking that ??? or ??? investors ???.

35
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,619
Yes they are your advisers but they are also your boss

36
00:02:29,619 --> 00:02:34,679
and so you want to be very careful about limiting your advise to just that circle

37
00:02:34,679 --> 00:02:38,759
and they may not have this specific domain expertise you need.

38
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:42,677
So make sure you're expanding your series of advisers available to your company

39
00:02:42,677 --> 00:02:47,716
and typically that's done by offering them a small percentage of equity

40
00:02:47,716 --> 99:59:59,999
in exchange for some of their time.
