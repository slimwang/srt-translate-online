1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:01,470
Here's my answer.

2
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:03,550
We'll go diagonal by diagonal.

3
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:08,210
The first one is easy since it's just
the cost of the pairwise product.

4
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:13,660
Next we'll consider this entry here
corresponding to the product of ABC.

5
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:17,044
First, consider breaking it up as A(BC).

6
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:23,305
That would be 0 for computing A,
+ 9 for computing C,

7
00:00:23,305 --> 00:00:30,300
+ 6 x 3 x 3 for computing the product,
for a total of 63.

8
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:37,440
The other partition, (A B) x C,
has cost 18 for (A B).

9
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,424
0 for C and 6 x1 x 3 for

10
00:00:40,424 --> 00:00:46,260
combining the products,
for a total of 36.

11
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:50,280
That ends up as the smaller of the two
possibilities, so we'll go ahead and

12
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,980
write that information
in the table here.

13
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:56,990
Now we move on to the other entry
along this diagonal, the one for

14
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:58,910
the product BCD.

15
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:03,150
We'll consider first
computing this as B(CD).

16
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:08,270
That costs 0 for B, 24 for CD, and

17
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:13,700
for computing the product,
3 x 1 x 8, for a total of 48.

18
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:18,660
The other partition,
BC x D, has cost 9 for

19
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:23,203
BC, 0 for just grabbing D and

20
00:01:23,203 --> 00:01:29,470
3 x 3 x 8 for the product,
for a total 82.

21
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:35,150
48 is the minimum cost and the better
partition is B x the quantity CD.

22
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:38,300
So, we'll record that
information in the table.

23
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:40,160
Now, for the last entry.

24
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:44,460
Consider first the partition
A x the quantity BCD.

25
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:47,470
The cost of A by itself is 0.

26
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:51,630
The cost of BCD, was 48 and

27
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:56,950
the cost of the product was 6
x 3 x 8 for a total of 192.

28
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:02,360
The products AB x CD costs 18 for

29
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:06,230
AB, 24 for CD, and

30
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:12,150
6 x 1 x 8 for combining these
products for a total of 90.

31
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:15,960
Lastly, we have this partition
the quantity ABC x D.

32
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:21,290
ABC cost 36, D by itself costs 0,

33
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:26,380
and the product costs 6 x 3 x 8 for
a total of 180.

34
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:31,180
The middle one here is clearly the best,
so we record that fact, and

35
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:35,310
that gives us the partition, which we
can write in these squares like so.
