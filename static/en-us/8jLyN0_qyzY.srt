00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Before getting onto the proof that the one-time pad is secure,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I want to do a brief of probability.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
If you feel very confident that you understand probability well,

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
it's fine to skip this section,

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
but I think for many students it will be helpful to review probability.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
For some this will be new.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
It's not necessary to have a lot of background in probability entering this class,

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
but we will certainly be using it in crytography.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
To talk about probability we need to think of sets of outcomes.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
We'll use omega to represent the set of all possible outcomes.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
This is sometimes known as a probability space.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
For a simple example, if we think about flipping a coin,

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
omega is the set of the outcomes we could get.

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
We could get to land heads, and we'll call that H,

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
or we could get it to land tails, and we'll call that T.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
If our probability space has a uniform distribution,

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
that means each outcome has equal probability.

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
We can write that as a probability using P as our probability function.

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
P is a function that takes as its input some outcome,

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
and it maps that to a real number between 0 and 1.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Zero would mean that event never happens.

22
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
One would mean that even always happens.

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
If we assume a fair coin with a uniform distribution,

24
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
then the probability that we get heads is equal to 1/2,

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
and the probability that we get tails is also equal to 1/2.

26
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
That's how we think of mathematical coins.

27
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
We hope to have mathematical coins to use in our cryptosystems.

28
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Real coins aren't so perfect.

29
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Let's assume instead that there are three possible outcomes.

30
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Now our probability space will be heads, tails, and edge.

31
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
The edge outcome does not happen frequently.

32
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
We'll make the probability distribution.

33
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,000
The probability of heads is 0.4999.

34
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
The probability of tails--we'll assume our coin is still fair,

35
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
that the probability of tails is equal to the probability of heads,

36
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
which is 0.4999.

37
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Is that enough to determine what is the probability of edge, of outcome E?

38
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I've given you two of the probabilities.

39
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Can you determine what is the probability of the third possible outcome,

40
00:02:24,000 --> 99:59:59,999
which is landing on the edge denoted by E.
