1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:04,850
Most things are not, that are shiny are not perfect mirrors, but

2
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:07,340
we can think of them as being glossy.

3
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:12,160
Okay and what the glossy means is, if we have our illuminate here and

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,210
we're coming out some angle.

5
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:17,930
It means I don't have light just at the mirror point, but

6
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:20,680
it's spread out a little bit.

7
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:24,356
Okay. And that's what this lobe here, is meant to show.

8
00:00:24,356 --> 00:00:31,810
Okay, and the more gloss as opposed to being specular.

9
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:35,790
Right? Blurrier, I make that lobe a little bit fatter.

10
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:36,420
Okay.

11
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:39,160
And that's written as this equation which

12
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:43,700
says that basically now instead of doing that delta function.

13
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:47,932
I just take co sign, of the angle between them.

14
00:00:47,932 --> 00:00:51,595
All right, and dot V, raise to some exponent.

15
00:00:51,595 --> 00:00:52,432
Okay?

16
00:00:52,432 --> 00:00:54,970
Cause that's the angle between them and I raise some exponent.

17
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:59,770
Now, if the angle between them is zero, that means it's a perfect mirror angle.

18
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:01,430
Right, then dot product is one.

19
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:04,370
Raised to K it stays one and I get a perfect reflection.

20
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:05,850
But, as the.

21
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:09,160
The angle falls off a little bit, co sign becomes a little bit less than one,

22
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,440
and when I raise a less than one to the K,

23
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:15,930
well as K gets bigger, that falls off faster.

24
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:16,570
Okay.

25
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:20,120
And, in fact, you can see that illustrated here these are some

26
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:23,790
artificially generated images, so here it's just, you know,

27
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:25,440
moving a light source to different directions.

28
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,880
Okay, not so exciting.

29
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:31,995
Here, you can see that the specular component is getting tight and tighter and

30
00:01:31,995 --> 00:01:33,479
tighter, all right?

31
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:38,493
And so it's getting more like a mirror, that's the raising of that K, okay?

32
00:01:38,493 --> 00:01:41,080
And so that's, the specular component.
