1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,286
>> First things first, we square both sides, just like we decided to. Squaring

2
00:00:05,286 --> 00:00:10,432
the left-hand side just gets rid of this exponent of one-half, and we get 2 x

3
00:00:10,432 --> 00:00:15,753
plus 4. 5 squared is 25. So, 2 x plus 4 equals 25. Now, things are super easy.

4
00:00:15,753 --> 00:00:21,135
We keep doing our regular old algebra until we get to a final answer of x equals

5
00:00:21,135 --> 00:00:25,987
21 over 2. This, of course, is equivalent to 10.5, so you could have that as

6
00:00:25,987 --> 00:00:30,472
well, or 10 and one half. Let's check this just to be sure, since this is sort

7
00:00:30,472 --> 00:00:35,252
of a new kind of equation for us. Dealing only with the left hand side of the

8
00:00:35,252 --> 00:00:40,162
equation, I plug in 21 over 2 in the spot of x. We get to the square of 25 which

9
00:00:40,162 --> 00:00:42,225
is, of course, 5. And this works.
