00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,530
Okay. So let's talk about another type of queue

2
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:05,460
called pull queues. This queue solves another kind of

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:08,380
problem. Let's say that you implemented a site that

4
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:11,810
requires humans to review comments. So the users of the

5
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:14,560
site generate comments and these comments need to be

6
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:18,200
reviewed before they are published. Similarly to push queues, you

7
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:21,640
could create a queue. And then insert comments to

8
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:25,700
be reviewed into this queue as tasks. And external people,

9
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:28,700
well in our case robots, could review the comments, perhaps

10
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:31,600
working from home in their spare time. So you have

11
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:35,110
your queue where you add comments as review tasks. Then

12
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:37,970
the different people would pull a review task from the queue

13
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:40,860
and work on it. So let's look at the difference

14
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:43,780
with push queues. Well in this case, App Engine is

15
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:47,380
not executing the tasks. They are instead executed by the

16
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:50,730
external workers. You can say that the task is pulled from

17
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:53,650
the queue by the external worker. That's why they are

18
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:57,950
called pull queues. The tasks that are pulled from the

19
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:01,360
queue are leased by the external workers. The worker must

20
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:04,250
complete the task within the lease time in which case it

21
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:07,130
can be deleted. But if the task is not completed

22
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:09,790
within the lease time, it is automatically returned to the

23
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:12,520
queue. If we compare a pull queues to push queues,

24
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:16,300
the differences are. So pull queues do not have a URL,

25
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:19,860
since your code is not completing the task. Each

26
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:22,100
task is leased by a worker for a certain

27
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:25,750
amount of time. A worker must delete the task

28
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:28,510
when it's completed, otherwise it is returned when the

29
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:32,400
lease expires. External workers pull the queue using a

30
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,540
REST interface. And there is no default queue for

31
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:38,840
pull queues, so you need to explicitly create them.

32
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,040
That's it for pull queues. Let's have a quiz.
