1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:04,170
Let's explain the problem with some of
these problematic instructions a little

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:05,340
more via quiz.

3
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:10,320
So we said that in the earlier
x86 architectures, the CPU flags

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,150
privileged register was accessed
via instructions POPF and PUSHF.

5
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:18,810
And these instructions failed
silently if they're not accessed

6
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:21,430
from the most privileged ring,
ring zero.

7
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:23,730
This is where the hypervisor
would reside.

8
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:27,420
What do you think can occur as
a result of this situation?

9
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:32,255
The options are, the guest VM could
not request interrupts to be enabled,

10
00:00:32,255 --> 00:00:36,016
the guest VM could not request
interrupts to be disabled,

11
00:00:36,016 --> 00:00:40,159
the guest VM could not find out
what is the state of the interrupts

12
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:43,180
enabled/disabled bit,
or all of the above.
