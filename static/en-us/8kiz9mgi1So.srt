1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:01,140
Look.

2
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:05,100
You opened your eyes sometime, you know, when you were really, really small.

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:06,400
kind of fuzzy for a while.

4
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:09,480
But after a while, you just saw.

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:13,060
So you might wonder, you know, why is this hard?

6
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:15,060
Let me give you a couple of examples.

7
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:18,010
So here we have a, what you think of as a simple scene, and

8
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:21,085
this was generated by Ted Adelson up at MIT.

9
00:00:21,085 --> 00:00:21,650
Allright?

10
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:24,950
And you see on this screen, we've got this checker board here.

11
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:28,032
And we've got this cylinder casting a shadow.

12
00:00:28,032 --> 00:00:28,880
All right?

13
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,700
And there are light and dark squares.

14
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:34,680
And you see these two squares, the A square and the B square?

15
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:38,070
Which of those two squares do you think is actually darker?

16
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:41,780
Okay. Well if you're like me you say, well duh, it's the A square.

17
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:44,920
Okay that's, the A is dark, and B is light.

18
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,600
Maybe not so fast.

19
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:47,190
All right?

20
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:49,130
So here I have a gray bar, and

21
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:53,100
this gray bar is the same intensity all the way down.

22
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:54,380
And through the magic of Powerpoint,

23
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:59,066
we're going to slide that grey bar over, and now we have a problem.

24
00:00:59,066 --> 00:01:03,170
There's no edge here, there's no edge there.

25
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:05,480
That's a constant grey bar, right?

26
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:10,730
That means squares A and B are actually the same color on this screen.

27
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:13,210
Really. In fact if I put two of those bars there,

28
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:14,770
you start to be able to see it.

29
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:16,020
Let me go back and forth there.

30
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:16,870
Do you see that?

31
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:17,925
When there is only one bar,

32
00:01:17,925 --> 00:01:22,130
your brain just wants you to believe that that is a checkerboard.

33
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:25,980
And that it, the cast shadow, and that that's the light square.

34
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:29,590
If you actually took a photometer and you measured, you would see that are as

35
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:33,380
many photons coming off of this region, as off of that region.

36
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:35,590
But the photometer doesn't have your brain.

37
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:37,360
It doesn't understand.

38
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,442
No, no. no, no, that's actually a light square in a cast shadow.

39
00:01:40,442 --> 00:01:42,120
All right?

40
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,030
This is why computer vision is hard.
