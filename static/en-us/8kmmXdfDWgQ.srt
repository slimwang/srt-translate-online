1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:03,190
>> Okay, so we talked about, you know, HTML

2
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:05,960
talks, talks about where these different things are on

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:08,780
the page, or actually what's on the page. CSS

4
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:11,320
is the where and the how does it look?

5
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:12,190
>> Yeah, pretty much.

6
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:14,760
>> And the JavaScript just, like, how does this whole thing fit together. How

7
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:18,840
does, when I click this, what machinery does that enact to make that happen?

8
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,330
>> Right, yeah. So, if you wanted a static page you

9
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:24,090
could just have the HTML and CSS, and you wouldn't need JavaScript.

10
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:24,960
>> Like a blog or something?

11
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:25,060
>> Yeah.

12
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:25,800
>> Okay.

13
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,410
>> But if you actually want to be able to interact

14
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:31,760
with things. I mean, you can have some interactions with HTML alone.

15
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:32,772
>> Mm-hm.

16
00:00:32,772 --> 00:00:36,700
>> But if, especially if you want things to, to move without reloading the page.

17
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:37,480
>> You basically want it.

18
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:38,269
>> You want to use some JavaScript.

19
00:00:38,269 --> 00:00:40,982
>> All right. And this together, I mean, I've heard the terms, you

20
00:00:40,982 --> 00:00:44,342
know, front end, back end. This is the front end of a webpage.

21
00:00:44,342 --> 00:00:46,430
>> Yeah, so, so this really doesn't really have a back end.

22
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:50,734
There's no sending information back to a central server or anything like that.

23
00:00:50,734 --> 00:00:50,810
>> Okay.

24
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:53,040
>> This is all run on the client computer.

25
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,200
>> Okay, which means me if I'm working it.

26
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:58,210
>> Yeah. So, when, when you load the page all of these all of

27
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:00,430
these assets get loaded into your browser.

28
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:02,396
You, you basically download all of these files.

29
00:01:02,396 --> 00:01:02,647
>> Mm-hm.

30
00:01:02,647 --> 00:01:04,209
>> And then it just goes on your computer.

31
00:01:04,209 --> 00:01:05,010
>> Okay.

32
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:05,612
>> There's

33
00:01:05,612 --> 00:01:08,620
>> There's no talking back and fourth. It's all, it's all there.

34
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:09,410
>> Right.

35
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:12,897
>> So, good. It's helpful [LAUGH]. I've never had anyone

36
00:01:12,897 --> 00:01:16,320
just to explain this to me before. So, with the index

37
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,170
like HTML. I did have a hard time when I

38
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:22,140
was, you know, browsing this at first. I don't know

39
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:24,788
HTML and it was, it was confusing. So, maybe we

40
00:01:24,788 --> 00:01:27,180
can talk a bit about how to, how to read this.

41
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:27,460
>> Sure.
