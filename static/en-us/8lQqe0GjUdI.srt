1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,616
This matrix is a translation matrix. Because only this fourth column is

2
00:00:03,616 --> 00:00:07,270
different than the identity matrix. These values are the translation amounts.

3
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:11,220
This matrix is a rotation matrix. Because the upper left three by three has been

4
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:15,146
modified, and not in a simple way like a scaling matrix. I should mention that

5
00:00:15,146 --> 00:00:18,794
if the three by three areas change in a arbitrary way you can get what is called

6
00:00:18,794 --> 00:00:22,616
a sheer matrix. I see sheer matrices get mentioned in textbooks, hey, we cover

7
00:00:22,616 --> 00:00:26,596
them in our own book. But personally in the past three decades I've never used a

8
00:00:26,596 --> 00:00:30,306
sheer matrix. This matrix has elements of both translation and rotation and so

9
00:00:30,306 --> 00:00:34,414
is the two of these types multiplied together. This leaves the last matrix as a

10
00:00:34,414 --> 00:00:38,209
scaling matrix, it's a non-uniform scaling along each axis.
