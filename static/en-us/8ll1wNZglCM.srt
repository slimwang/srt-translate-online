1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
We can write some assertions here.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Here we have some letters in my hand, seven letters, and some possible letters on the board,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
and here's a long list of possibilities for plays I could make.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
We can already see that this would be useful

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
for cheating--I mean, augmenting or studying your word game play.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
And to make it even more useful, let's write a function

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
that tells us what the longest possible words are.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Given the definition of word play, write a definition of longest words.
