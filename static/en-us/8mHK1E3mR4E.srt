1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:05,512
So now we have our population parameters and our parameters for the distribution

2
00:00:05,512 --> 00:00:09,914
of sample means. Do you think that this standard deviation for the population

3
00:00:09,914 --> 00:00:13,818
and the standard deviation for the distribution of sample means have any

4
00:00:13,818 --> 00:00:15,483
relationship to each other?
