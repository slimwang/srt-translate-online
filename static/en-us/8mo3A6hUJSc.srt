1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,820
So, you've chosen an app idea, you know
what features you're going to include,

2
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:07,280
and you also know which APIs and
libraries you're going to make use of.

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:10,320
So, now it's time to
make a paper prototype.

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,790
I like to do this using actual paper,
but you can also do it in Storyboard or

5
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:18,825
using Photoshop, or any number
of prototyping software suites.

6
00:00:18,825 --> 00:00:20,740
Link to some in
the instructor notes below.

7
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:25,000
The point of this exercise is to define
how users will flow through your app.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,030
And if you're drawing them by hand,

9
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:29,590
you don't need to be Michelangelo or
Davinci.

10
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:31,860
Just get your ideas down on paper.

11
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:34,150
Will they start with
a login in screen and

12
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:36,800
then move to a custom
set of user information?

13
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:41,310
Or perhaps they'll start
with a list of some kind and

14
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:43,770
then they can log in later to save it.

15
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:46,410
Now, you want to be as
detailed as you can here.

16
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:48,660
I mean,
what happens when a button is pressed?

17
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:51,520
And where are you going to
be pulling information from?

18
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,830
The more information that
you can include here,

19
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:57,350
in this paper prototype,
will help you down the road later.

20
00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:02,830
As you may have noticed, user experience
plays a huge role in this step.

21
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:05,220
And if you'd like to think
a little bit more deeply about it,

22
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:09,480
Udasity has a great course
on user experience design.

23
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:12,590
It's called UX Design for
Mobile Developers.

24
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:16,120
Lessons one to three are what's
most relevant to us in this course.

25
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:19,840
So if you'd like a link to that class is
included in the instructor notes below

26
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,750
if you'd like to work through
some of those exercises.
