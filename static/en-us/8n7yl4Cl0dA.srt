1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
This is what happens when we set the step size to 2 days,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
which look pretty reasonable with the original curves.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:14,000
This is what we get--the numbers explode to 1.4 * 10⁷⁹--that doesn't look too good.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
In case you're wondering about the conservation of the total number,

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
some of these variables get huge in a positive direction

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
and some of these get huge at the negative direction.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Actually, the total number stays pretty much constant

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
at the price of some of these becoming negative.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,000
With a step size of 1.9 days, which is the solution, we don't see an explosion, the number stays limited

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
but the behavior is, of course, highly implausible.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Now, we look into what's going wrong here.
