1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:01,920
All right, Katherine.

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:02,700
This is lesson one.

3
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:04,070
This is lesson two.

4
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:05,580
We've been done with lesson one for
a while.

5
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:06,939
>> Yeah.
>> And we did the Happy Birthday

6
00:00:06,939 --> 00:00:07,910
app here, remember?

7
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:08,630
>> Yeah.

8
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:11,760
>> And in lesson two,
we started to make the Just Java app.

9
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:13,440
>> Yeah, the coffee ordering app.

10
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:18,380
>> So our learner has traversed this
long, arduous journey and is right here.

11
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:19,920
>> At the beginning of lesson three.

12
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:20,830
>> Right.
>> And

13
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:23,680
this is where we need to keep
working on the coffee ordering app.

14
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:24,560
>> Okay.
So before we talk

15
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,280
about that let's just move
all of this aside, so

16
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:28,040
we can focus on lesson three
a little bit better, yeah?

17
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:28,620
>> Sounds good.

18
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:30,720
>> So I'm just going to drag
all of these around here.

19
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,380
>> I'll move this there,
I'll move this here.

20
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:35,220
Here's lesson three.

21
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:37,260
>> Okay, how many big ideas
are there in lesson three?

22
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:40,395
>> I think we can do four big parts.

23
00:00:40,395 --> 00:00:42,375
>> Okay, let's just split
these into four piles then.

24
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:46,243
There Okay.

25
00:00:46,243 --> 00:00:47,120
>> There is is.

26
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,491
And what are these ideas?

27
00:00:48,491 --> 00:00:50,081
>> The first one of its methods.

28
00:00:50,081 --> 00:00:52,090
>> Methods?
Okay Well let's begin here then.

29
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:57,060
>> Here's a look at the different
stages of the app for this lesson.

30
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:00,280
We'll start by adding an order
summary section to the app and

31
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:04,540
understand how methods in Java can
help us write more efficient code.

32
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:06,850
Later, we will add a checkbox for
a topping,

33
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:09,400
like whipped cream,
to add to our coffee.

34
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:12,680
However, we'll need to understand
object-oriented programming

35
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:16,200
to determine the state of the checkbox,
whether the user checked it or

36
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,620
not, and include that information
in the order summary.

37
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:23,310
Within our app, object-oriented
programming allows us to dynamically

38
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:27,150
interact with views, so that we can
read this state from the views, and

39
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:30,990
then change the contents of other views,
while the app is running.

40
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:33,780
We'll add another checkbox for
the chocolate topping and

41
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:36,730
then we'll add a text field, so
that we can ask the user for their name.

42
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:42,010
Again, we'll write Java code to read
in the user input from this field and

43
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:44,440
then display it in the order summary.

44
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,840
We'll also learn about
control flow statements,

45
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,820
particularly something called
if/else statements, so

46
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:53,550
that our app has different behavior,
based on certain conditions.

47
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:56,340
Basically by looking at what
toppings the user wants,

48
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:00,504
we'll be able to adjust the price per
cup of coffee either by $1 or $2.

49
00:02:00,504 --> 00:02:04,300
Now the order summary is not that
useful, if it never leaves the app.

50
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:07,600
So we'll learn about intents in Android,
so that when the user hits the Order

51
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:12,130
button, we can send the order summary
out to an email app like this.

52
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:16,410
Then you can specify a specific
email address to send it to.

53
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:19,800
We'll end the lesson by covering
more topics on Android resources,

54
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:23,860
learning about how to support different
languages in the app such as Spanish.

55
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:27,290
We'll also experiment with changing
the styles and theme of the app.

56
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:27,970
For example,

57
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:31,870
you can change the color of the app bar
by customizing the theme of the app.

58
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:33,530
There's a lot to cover,
so let's get started.
