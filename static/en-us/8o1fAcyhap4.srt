00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Welcome to the machine learning unit.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Machine learning is a fascinating area.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
The world has become immeasurably data-rich.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
The world wide web has come up over the last decade.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
The human genome is being sequenced.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Vast chemical databases, pharmaceutical databases,

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
and financial databases are now available

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
on a scale unthinkable even 5 years ago.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
To make sense out of the data,

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
to extract information from the data,

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
machine learning is the discipline to go.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Machine learning is an important subfeed of artificial intelligence,

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
it's my personal favorite next to robotics

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
because I believe it has a huge impact on society

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
and is absolutely necessary as we move forward.

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
So in this class, I teach you some of the very basics of

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
machine learning, and in our next unit

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Peter will tell you some more about machine learning.

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
We'll talk about supervised learning, which is one side of machine learning,

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
and Peter will tell you about unsupervised learning,

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
which is a different style.

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Later in this class we will also encounter reinforcement learning,

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
which is yet another set of machine learning.

24
00:01:10,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Anyhow, let's just dive in.
