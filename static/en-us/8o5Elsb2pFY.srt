1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:05,418
So, here's the distribution of Klout data and you can see it's bimodal, like the

2
00:00:05,418 --> 00:00:13,126
chief scientist described. The mean is about here at 37.72. So now, let's say

3
00:00:13,126 --> 00:00:18,418
we're able to take all possible samples of size 35 and calculate the mean for

4
00:00:18,418 --> 00:00:23,421
each one of them. And then, graph this distribution of sample means. So, this

5
00:00:23,421 --> 00:00:28,100
distribution should be normal, if you remember from previously. What will be the

6
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:30,203
mean of this distribution?
