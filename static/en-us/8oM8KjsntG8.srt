00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,010
This programming assignment was a way for you to practice creating scatter

2
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:05,560
plots, and to make sure that you knew how to work with our

3
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:08,890
new data frame. We'll use our ggplot function to get our

4
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:11,640
histogram, and we'll pass it the two variables that we had in our

5
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:15,160
data frame, age and friend count mean. And for the data variable,

6
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:19,330
I want to pass it PF.FC by age, instead of PF, since this

7
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:22,180
was the new data frame we're working with. Writing this code I

8
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:25,290
see that I get an error, and that's because I forgot my geom.

9
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:27,800
I needed to add geom point. So adding that as

10
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,920
another layer, I can run my code and get the result.

11
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:33,510
Now we can do slightly better than this plot. Let's

12
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:36,520
connect our dots in order of age by using geom line

13
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:40,240
instead of geom point. This plot immediately makes clear the

14
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:43,495
patterns we mentioned before, as well as the oddness at age

15
00:00:43,495 --> 00:00:47,000
69. We see that through the older ages, our estimates

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,320
are highly variable for friend count mean. They're jumping up and

17
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,400
down, sort of all over the place. And

18
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,390
for our young users, they still have high friend

19
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:57,670
counts, and for the ages between 30 and 60,

20
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:00,993
the mean count is hovering just about over 100.
