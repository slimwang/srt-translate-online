00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:03,460
In a previous unit, you covered
supervised learning, which was a way of

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:06,430
teaching a system to understand
some concept based on some labeled,

3
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:08,070
incoming data.

4
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:10,290
But what about if
the data wasn't labeled?

5
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:13,580
So we use the example of teaching
a system to recognize my face.

6
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:16,470
But that involved having a bunch of
pictures that a person had already

7
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:17,290
gone through and said,

8
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:20,170
these are pictures of David, and
these are pictures of other people.

9
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:21,580
What if we didn't have that?

10
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:24,270
What if we wanted to just teach the
system that understands similar faces

11
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:25,220
without going through and

12
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:28,430
actually coding which ones were
the same person in advance?

13
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:30,300
That's where unsupervised
learning comes in.

14
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,450
Unsupervised learning is helping
a system learn a concept based on

15
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:34,930
the unlabeled data, so

16
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:38,350
it just learns the ideas just based
on the data that's already there.

17
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:40,160
This is very useful in
other domains as well.

18
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,820
In healthcare, for example,
supervised learning can be

19
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:46,600
used to help a system identify
which patients are at risk for

20
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,990
a certain disease early if we
already know what the disease is.

21
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:52,950
But unsupervised learning could actually
help us uncover diseases that we didn't

22
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:56,250
even know existed,
based on patterns of common symptoms.

23
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:59,310
So in unsupervised learning, we're
really going to learn about how systems

24
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:02,430
can learn new and interesting things,
based on unlabeled, incoming data.
