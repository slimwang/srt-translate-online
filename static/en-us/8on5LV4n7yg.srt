1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:04,100
Now let's look at this whole additional
concept of finding panoramas.

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:07,010
One of the restrictions of the way
we've talked about panoramas so

3
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:10,200
far has been that you have to
take a sequence of pictures,

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:13,900
panning left to right and
in different formats.

5
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:17,610
>> Well, that sound rather restrictive.

6
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:21,820
So, what we want to be able to do is
kind of find these panoramas from

7
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:23,500
a collection of pictures.

8
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,470
This actually also has been studied,

9
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:31,060
basic idea is that we want to be able to
find similar you know, find images from,

10
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:36,120
and run RANSAC and find the most
similar types of these patches, and

11
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,870
say okay, these two images
are the most closest to each other.

12
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:41,020
Let's actually build
a panorama on this one.

13
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:44,890
Similarly, find another region that
might have you know, similarities and

14
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:49,380
use that, and keep going that way, and
third one, of course, would be again,

15
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:53,970
similar ones, and in essence,
what we do is we will use RANSAC and

16
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:57,250
other types of matching techniques,
we can find images that are next to each

17
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:59,780
other and
we use that to form a panorama.

18
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:02,920
So we don't really have to worry
about taking pictures in a sequence.

19
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:06,320
This was a method proposed by at Brown
and Lowe and actually it's one of

20
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,010
the papers I would like you to look at
on your own and use that as a method of

21
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:14,410
trying to understand how we can actually
do this kind of stuff with taking

22
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:18,290
pictures that are not actually just in
sequence but can be taken in any order.
