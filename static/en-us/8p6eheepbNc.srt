00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:04,860
In this lesson, we'll use Microsoft's
HealthVault, but there are several

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:09,560
widely used personal health records,
and they mostly do the same things.

3
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:12,420
You should already have a HealthVault
account, but we haven't yet

4
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:15,700
explored it to see how it
stores clinical data and

5
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:20,840
what it can do to help patients use that
data, including sharing it with others.

6
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:25,330
So here's an example of my health
data I manually input in HealthVault.

7
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:29,350
You can see key data such
as patient allergies,

8
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:33,950
immunizations, conditions,
and lab test results.

9
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:38,890
As shown here, users are assisted in
inputting complex information such as

10
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:43,550
their condition by smart lists
that pop up as they type.

11
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:47,700
More recently, as meaningful
use has dictated the export

12
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:50,650
of at least standardized
clinical summaries,

13
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:54,876
the burden on the patient to record
all their data is largely alleviated.

14
00:00:54,876 --> 00:00:57,270
And the PHR can and

15
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:01,680
should import these summaries from all
providers caring for that patient.

16
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,840
Note here that I have a direct email
address provided to me by HealthVault

17
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,090
to help facilitate that.
