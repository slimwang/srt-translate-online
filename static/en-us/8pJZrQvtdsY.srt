00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,380
We've just seen how the fundamental
theorem of linear programming

2
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:05,939
tells us that we can always
achieve an optimum value for

3
00:00:05,939 --> 00:00:08,770
the program with a basic solution.

4
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:11,880
Moreover, basic solutions
come from a choice of m

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,640
linearly independent columns for
the basis.

6
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:19,310
This immediately suggests an algorithm
where we just try all possible bases and

7
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:24,530
take the best generated basic
feasible solution, as outlined here.

8
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:29,330
And my question for you is, why is this
algorithm problematic or impractical?

9
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:30,230
Check all that apply.
