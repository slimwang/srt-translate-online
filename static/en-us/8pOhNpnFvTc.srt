1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:01,790
Here's a way to do it.

2
00:00:01,790 --> 00:00:05,920
Make the classifier take
the pair query and webpage, and

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:10,090
output one of two classes,
either relevant or not relevant.

4
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:13,030
Of course, it would be a lot of
webpages to look at if you ran

5
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:15,080
that classifier on the whole web.

6
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:17,460
But search engines take shortcuts, and

7
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:19,530
only try to classify
promising candidates.
