00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,800
Hello, and
welcome to intro to the Linux shell.

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:06,040
I'm Phillip, and in this course you'll
learn the basic of how to use the Linux

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:08,109
shell or a command line environment.

4
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:08,920
>> And I'm Carl.

5
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:11,850
The goal of this course is to give
you the basic command line tools

6
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:14,470
you'll need to start
working with Linux servers.

7
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:16,800
Now, you might have used
other command lines before.

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,300
If you've used JavaScript,

9
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:21,150
you've probably seen the JavaScript
console in your browser.

10
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:24,540
Or maybe you've used an interpreter
in Python or another language.

11
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:27,290
Or perhaps you've used the command
line on your own computer.

12
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:29,840
>> These are all examples
of command line interfaces.

13
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,400
Command line interfaces all
work in about the same way.

14
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,489
You type in a command then they
system runs those commands and

15
00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:38,772
displays the output then you can
type another command and so on.

16
00:00:38,772 --> 00:00:41,965
>> And the idea of a command line
interface goes back to the mid 20th

17
00:00:41,965 --> 00:00:44,636
century and one of the earliest
ways that people had for

18
00:00:44,636 --> 00:00:48,050
communicating with a computer,
the computer terminal.

19
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:51,240
Now today, terminal usually
means a piece of software.

20
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:53,630
But it originally meant
a physical piece of hardware for

21
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:55,370
interacting with a computer.

22
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:57,640
Before terminals,
people put programs and

23
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,860
data through computers
using punch cards.

24
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:02,730
Loading a batch of data into
the computer all at once.

25
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:07,020
The terminal, by letting a user directly
send commands to a computer program and

26
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:10,759
immediately see responses was a huge
step forward in user interface.

27
00:01:10,759 --> 00:01:14,020
>> And it's an interface that we're
still using today for a lot of reasons.

28
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:15,940
A command line interface
is programmable.

29
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:18,120
It's efficient in terms
of network bandwidth and

30
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,960
you can use the terminal edit files in
the distant system without having to

31
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,110
first copy them to your local machine.

32
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:26,330
In general, you can be much more
expressive with a text based interface

33
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:27,730
than you can by just pointing and
clicking.

34
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:31,260
One of the uses of the shells
is to administer servers.

35
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:33,180
Machines that might be far
away on the network and

36
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:35,500
that probably don't have
a graphical environment.

37
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:36,710
For the rest of this course,

38
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:39,320
you're going to be working on
a system very much like that.

39
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:43,960
>> So first, you'll need to set up your
own virtual Linux server to work on.

40
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,550
Fortunately, that's a lot
easier than it sounds like.

41
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:47,940
So let's get started.
