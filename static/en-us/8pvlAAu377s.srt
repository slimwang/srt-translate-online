00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,060
Great job. Look at how much you've learned. You now know how to make objects

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:06,230
from classes and how to call methods on them to make them do things.

3
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:09,470
>> You've learned how to look up the documentation for classes and methods so you

4
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:11,425
can find out what they can do and how to make them do it.

5
00:00:11,425 --> 00:00:15,440
>> Also you've learned how to store objects and variables so that you can recall

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:16,503
them when you need them.

7
00:00:16,503 --> 00:00:19,970
>> Most importantly you've learned how to combine different objects in order to do

8
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:21,750
more complicated things.

9
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:24,780
>> In the next lesson you will learn how to write your own classes, so you can

10
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:27,591
become a giant that other programmers can stand on.
