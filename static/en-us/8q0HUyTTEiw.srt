1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:04,340
This point you're probably
sick of matrix multiply, but

2
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:07,880
I can't say enough what an important
computational primitive it is to study.

3
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:12,080
Now I say that, not only because I
think it has important applications,

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,219
it's also because you can use it to see
a lot of different analysis techniques.

5
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:19,600
For instance, in this lesson you saw
different algorithmic approaches

6
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,570
like 1-D versus 2-D
versus 3-D distributions.

7
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:27,540
As well as a way to argue about
communication lower bounds.

8
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:31,210
It won't always be easy to do those
sorts of analyses on other algorithms,

9
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:32,409
but I hope you'll try.

10
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,700
Another reason to think about matrix
multiply is that for better or for

11
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:39,510
worse, the machines we build today,

12
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:43,310
if you're a wee bit cynical like me,
are tuned for it.

13
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:45,610
For instance,
you should have noticed something.

14
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:50,430
When the problem is big enough, there's
a lot more work than communication.

15
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:53,790
That means matrix multiply ought
to scale well as systems and

16
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:55,580
problems get bigger.

17
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:59,300
It's in that sense that things like
the top 500 list, which measure peak

18
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:04,319
capability, might not translate to more
communication-intensive applications.

19
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:08,380
Now speaking of big, and I admit this
fact as a bit of a non sequitur.

20
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:14,460
Did you know that a Rubix cube has
43 quintillion 252 quadrillion 3

21
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:22,390
trillion 274 billion 489 million 856
thousand possible configurations?

22
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:25,130
Try telling people that fact at
your next cocktail party, and

23
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:27,240
I'm sure you'll be a really big hit.

24
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:33,634
Just like me, because I'm a huge hit
at cocktail parties with my numbers and

25
00:01:33,634 --> 00:01:37,100
my constants out to ten digits and
stuff.

26
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:38,640
Very cool.
