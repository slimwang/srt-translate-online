1
00:00:00,003 --> 00:00:06,048
The line that runs down the middle dividing all of these even functions in half

2
00:00:06,048 --> 00:00:10,514
is the y axis. So they have symmetry across the y axis. Just by looking we can

3
00:00:10,514 --> 00:00:14,364
tell that they don't have symmetry across the x axis. In fact, none of these

4
00:00:14,364 --> 00:00:18,523
even functions even have any points that lie below the x axis. So that means

5
00:00:18,523 --> 00:00:22,183
that none of the points on them that lay above it, will have corresponding

6
00:00:22,183 --> 00:00:26,020
points that there reflected across from. Now, these last two choices might look

7
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:29,437
a little bit complicated, but taking your time and thinking through them you can

8
00:00:29,437 --> 00:00:33,661
figure out which one's true, if either one. Saying that f of negative x Is equal

9
00:00:33,661 --> 00:00:38,695
to f of x, is basically saying that two points lie on a graph. This is the same

10
00:00:38,695 --> 00:00:43,880
as saying that if we have the point x, y, or x, f of x, then we'll also have the

11
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:48,455
point negative x, y. This is saying that when you plug in the negative version

12
00:00:48,455 --> 00:00:52,550
of some x value, you get the same y value since the value of the function is the

13
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:56,877
same at those two x coordinates. We already saw in the last quiz that this is in

14
00:00:56,877 --> 00:01:02,533
fact true of even functions. So this also applies. The last answer does not,

15
00:01:02,533 --> 00:01:08,422
since having it be true would mean that this third one couldn't be true.
