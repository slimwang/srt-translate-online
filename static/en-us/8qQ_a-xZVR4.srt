00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:05,890
For our first question, our Sunshine
database had two tables which you could

2
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:10,270
see from the fact that they were two
innerclasses with the name Blank Entry.

3
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:14,150
Now here's what we find it in the code.

4
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:18,560
So as a sidenote, this is the same code
that we saw from the GitHub link below.

5
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,390
I've just removed the comments so
that we can more easily see

6
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:25,170
everything on one slide, so
here are the two entry classes.

7
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:29,060
So, LocationEntry and
further down we see WeatherEntry.

8
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:33,060
So, for our second question,
the table that is represented

9
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:38,180
by the WeatherEntry class, the name
of that table is simply weather.

10
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:42,658
In this case, the weather contract
has two tables, a table for

11
00:00:42,658 --> 00:00:45,810
weather data and
a table for location data.

12
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:50,930
So, the weather data table contents
were stored in our WeatherEntry class.

13
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:54,930
In the code here,
here's our WeatherEntry inner class, and

14
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:57,990
inside it, we have a constant name,
table name,

15
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:02,380
and that constant is associated with
the name of the table which is weather.

16
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:07,800
So for the third question of how many
columns does the weather table have,

17
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,470
not including the ID and count columns.

18
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:13,760
Well, that table would
have ten columns and

19
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,460
then for our last question
What's the constant name for

20
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:19,120
the column that's a short description
of the weather condition?

21
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:24,158
Well, we'll see in the code
the name of the constant is

22
00:01:24,158 --> 00:01:30,650
COLUMN_SHORT_DESC, and
here's those two answers in the code.

23
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:37,730
So inside her, weather entry class
we have the name of our ten columns.

24
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:40,150
And to find the name of
the short description constant,

25
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:42,220
well we could see it from here.
