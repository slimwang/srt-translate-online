1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So the mode is a useful statistic

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
if your distribution of data is what is called multimodal.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
In multimodal distributions, you have a curve that has multiple bumps.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
This one is called bimodal

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
because it has exactly 2 bumps.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
The mode is the highest value of the largest bump,

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
which now occurs here with the value of 4.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
So in a situation like this, the mean is usually irrelevant,

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
It falls just between the data.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
as we showed with our house prices example.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
The median may be in the middle or flipped from left to right

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
and really doesn't say much either.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
The mode, too, can flip from left to right.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
At the very least, it corresponds to something that is very frequent in the data.

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
So for bimodal data, or for multimodal data,

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
which is data with even more than two bumps,

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
the mode is something you should really calculate.

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
So let's practice.

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:09,000
So let me give you a list of numbers: 5, 9, 100, 9, 97, 6, 9, 98, and 9.

20
00:01:09,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Compute for me the three Ms: mean, median, and mode.
