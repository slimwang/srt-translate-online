00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,110
That previous video, was really long.

2
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:06,610
Before we continue, I want to share with you this one question a lot of

3
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:11,130
students ask me, when I teach them programming, and that question is,

4
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:13,180
how did I learn all of this stuff?

5
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:18,280
Well, the true answer is, I searched for and read documentation.

6
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:21,870
I Googled for how to create an action, in Xcode.

7
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:27,090
And here, I landed on a help page created by Apple.

8
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:31,730
This page demonstrated how to make a connection between a button, and code.

9
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:36,100
So it is in this spirit of figuring out new things while reading documentation,

10
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:37,970
I want to present a couple of challenges to you,

11
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:40,540
that you can help find the answers for.

12
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,040
Your first question.

13
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:44,380
What does this tiny circle do?

14
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:45,910
You can find the circle.

15
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:48,520
Right next to the action, in the gutter.

16
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:52,000
And your second question, is what does this tiny icon do?

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,320
This icon is called Connections Inspector.

18
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,770
And you can find it in the Utility area.

19
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:58,860
You can enter your responses, in these boxes.
