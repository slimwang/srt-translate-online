00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,545
The first thing that I notice when I look at this version of our term is that we

2
00:00:04,557 --> 00:00:09,315
actually don't need these dots between the variables, and actually we don't need

3
00:00:09,327 --> 00:00:13,810
a multiplication sign between 2 and x either. Inside a term the only place we

4
00:00:13,822 --> 00:00:18,545
really need to explicitly indicate multiplication with the multiplication sign

5
00:00:18,557 --> 00:00:23,366
is between the constants. Factors, the reason that we really had to write them

6
00:00:23,378 --> 00:00:28,137
in between the 5, the 7, and the 2 before, was the dot, this didn't look like we

7
00:00:28,149 --> 00:00:32,698
were writing 572 x, y, z. So to start off, I'm just going to get rid of those 3

8
00:00:32,711 --> 00:00:37,404
unnecessary multiplication signs. Remember if you kept them in, your term is

9
00:00:37,416 --> 00:00:42,983
still mathematically correct. It just contains a couple of extra symbols that

10
00:00:42,995 --> 00:00:48,353
don't necessarily need to be there. So now we have this 5 times 7 times 2 to

11
00:00:48,365 --> 00:00:54,058
deal with. Those are just numbers and we know how to multiply numbers together,

12
00:00:54,177 --> 00:01:02,157
5 times 7 is 35. And 35 times 2 is 70. So we can replace 5 times 7 times 2 with

13
00:01:02,169 --> 00:01:08,255
70, and write the remaining factors afterward, xyz.
