1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The answer is 92,000.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
You can see this because 80 is exactly 4 times as much as 20.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
If you took 23,000 and divided it by 20% and multiplied the result by 80%,

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
That is the same as just multiplying 23,000 by 4.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
You get that number over here.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
What's remarkable about this chart is it's invariant to the total number of votes.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
What it really depicts is the relative number of votes.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
It shows that A got many, many more votes than B.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
It shows it graphically, so you can see this without even studying the numbers.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Let's practice this one more time.
