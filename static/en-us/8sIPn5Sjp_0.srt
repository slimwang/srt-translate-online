00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:02,800
Alright, why don't you try to impute some

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:06,030
values on your own. Pandas dataframes have a

3
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:11,660
method called fillna. Which take in a value and allow you to pass in a static

4
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:17,130
value to replace any NAs that exist in a dataframe or series. You can call this

5
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:21,648
function like so. Data frame column, fillna value.

6
00:00:21,648 --> 00:00:25,810
Using the numpy.mean function, which calculates the mean of

7
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:28,050
an numpy array, why don't you impute any

8
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:30,400
missing values in our Lahman baseball data sets

9
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,000
weight column, by setting the missing values equal

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,650
to the average weight. Your code should go here.
