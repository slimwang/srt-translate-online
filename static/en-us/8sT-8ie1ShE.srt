00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,290
The question about the MVC,

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:08,720
that's to understand how
solid is his knowledge.

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:14,416
I don't expect him to know a lot, but
whatever he knows must be crystal clear.

4
00:00:14,416 --> 00:00:18,735
So the MVC is the base
of any iOS application,

5
00:00:18,735 --> 00:00:22,722
or even OSN and many other applications.

6
00:00:22,722 --> 00:00:27,984
So, I want to be absolutely sure that
he knows where to put those three

7
00:00:27,984 --> 00:00:33,550
types of bricks before letting him
build a house and maybe crumble down.

8
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:36,260
It looks like he has
a pretty good understanding

9
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:41,730
of what are the responsibilities of
the model, the controller, and the view.

10
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:45,820
I was expecting something
of a broad overview.

11
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:47,370
He got into more details.

12
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:52,460
That's not a problem at all, as long
as you don't get lost in the details,

13
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:55,340
and you show that you
understand the big picture.

14
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:55,900
That's good for me.
