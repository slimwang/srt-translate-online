00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,940
Okay, so I trust that you know how to add an image to this button.

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:05,370
What I will do however,

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:08,087
is walk you through how to add constraints to this image.

4
00:00:08,087 --> 00:00:11,280
I Ctrl + drag from the button in this direction and

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,650
selected the option called Top Space, and then Ctrl + dragged from

6
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:20,010
the button in this direction and selected Leading Space as the option.

7
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:22,270
Now I've added two constraints here.

8
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:25,890
If I select any one of them, and then go to the utility area.

9
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:29,770
I can look under Size Inspector to see that the value of this constraint is

10
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:32,710
a constant 50 points from the top.

11
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:35,990
If I select the other constraint I can see that it's value is

12
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:38,900
a constant 30 points from the leading edge.

13
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:41,550
After that I went to the assistant editor and

14
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:45,490
in there I created a new action called Play Slow audio.

15
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:50,430
Now, this function gets executed any time someone presses this button over here.

16
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:53,140
So now, I can write code to play audio in this function.
