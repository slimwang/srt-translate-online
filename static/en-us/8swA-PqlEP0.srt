00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,620
You saw a lot of examples of
data types in lesson one.

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:08,020
It may come as no surprise that data
types are kind of complicated in SQL.

3
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:12,625
Types in SQL often have different names
from types in Python or other languages.

4
00:00:12,625 --> 00:00:13,155
And sometimes,

5
00:00:13,155 --> 00:00:16,475
there are distinctions made in SQL
that other languages don't make.

6
00:00:16,475 --> 00:00:19,655
We'll be working with only a few of
these types in this course though.

7
00:00:19,655 --> 00:00:21,285
For a whole bunch more types and

8
00:00:21,285 --> 00:00:25,855
links to some documentation with
even more types, see the next page.

9
00:00:25,855 --> 00:00:28,635
SQL has several different string types.

10
00:00:28,635 --> 00:00:29,445
In this course,

11
00:00:29,445 --> 00:00:34,830
we'll just use the text type, which is
basically the same as a Python string.

12
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:36,450
Same goes for numbers.

13
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:39,400
SQL has number types for
many different purposes.

14
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:42,460
But in this course,
we'll mainly be using the integer type,

15
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:45,600
which is roughly the same
as Python's int.

16
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,090
And how about our animals' birth dates?

17
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:51,540
SQL has date and time types as well.

18
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:53,200
We'll be using date columns for

19
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:56,100
birth dates since we don't
care about the time of day.

20
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,920
One thing that's really important
to keep in mind about date and

21
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:03,900
time values in SQL is that you have
to put single quotes around them

22
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:05,670
as if they were strings.

23
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:11,230
If you write 2012-11-23
inside single quotes,

24
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:14,800
SQL can interpret that as a date or
as a piece of text.

25
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:20,210
But if you write 2012-11-23
with no quotes around it,

26
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:23,010
it can only interpret it
as an integer expression.

27
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:27,160
It will think you mean
2,012 minus 11 minus 23,

28
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:31,660
which equals 1,978,
which is probably not what you wanted.
