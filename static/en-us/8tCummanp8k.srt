00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,500
Police and law enforcement officers are aware that our memories are malleable.

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:08,019
And they've developed techniques when investigating crimes or accidents to help

3
00:00:08,019 --> 00:00:12,604
diminish the possibility of false memories. One thing they do is to separate

4
00:00:12,604 --> 00:00:16,285
witnesses immediately so they cannot talk to each other. This way, what one

5
00:00:16,285 --> 00:00:19,860
person remembers from an accident is not contaminated by what another person

6
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:24,247
remembers from an accident. Another thing they can do is to be careful with the

7
00:00:24,247 --> 00:00:28,496
types of words they use to ask questions. For example, Elizabeth Loftus

8
00:00:28,496 --> 00:00:32,786
examined how the types of words that people use to ask questions can influence

9
00:00:32,786 --> 00:00:37,957
our memory of an event. For example, in one study participants were assigned to

10
00:00:37,957 --> 00:00:42,494
different groups. Participants saw slides of pictures of cars that collided and

11
00:00:42,494 --> 00:00:45,718
they were asked to estimate how fast the vehicles were going, but they were

12
00:00:45,718 --> 00:00:51,038
asked in different ways. There were five conditions. The participants were

13
00:00:51,038 --> 00:00:55,408
asked to describe the car accident as if they were an eye witness. Participants

14
00:00:55,408 --> 00:00:58,648
were asked how fast a car was going when they hit each other, smashed each

15
00:00:58,648 --> 00:01:03,775
other, bumped each other, collided with each other, or contacted each other.

16
00:01:03,775 --> 00:01:07,185
Depending on which group they were in, they heard a different ending of the

17
00:01:07,185 --> 00:01:11,332
sentence. A week after this, participants were asked if they saw any broken

18
00:01:11,332 --> 00:01:16,121
glass in the pictures on the slides. Participants in the smashed condition

19
00:01:16,121 --> 00:01:20,882
reported the highest speeds. After that came collided, then bumped, then hit,

20
00:01:20,882 --> 00:01:25,115
then contacted. And when they were asked about the glass, participants in the

21
00:01:25,115 --> 00:01:29,993
smashed condition were more likely to say yes they saw glass in the pictures.

22
00:01:29,993 --> 00:01:33,287
So, here we see the type of question or type of word that is used to describe

23
00:01:33,287 --> 00:01:38,490
the accident. Influences the persons memory of the event and may actually

24
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:43,624
modify the persons memory. Again, this experiment demonstrates how easily our

25
00:01:43,624 --> 00:01:47,788
memories can be changed. Our memories can be easily distorted by the type of

26
00:01:47,788 --> 00:01:52,387
question, and information that comes after an event. This can cause inaccurate

27
00:01:52,387 --> 00:01:54,779
recall or reconstructive memory.
