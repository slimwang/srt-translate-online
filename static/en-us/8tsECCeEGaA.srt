1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The answer lies in the numbers I just wiped out.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
If A got 7/12 in total, we know that 1/12 is 20,000.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
So A got 140,000, which is 7 times 20,000.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Party B got 2/12 or a 6th, which is 40,000.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Party C--a disappointing 20,000.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
And party D the same as party B.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
If we look at the diagram, it tell you nothing about the absolute numbers.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
In fact, I can change the absolute numbers.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:38,000
As long as the relative percentages stay the same, it does however tell you a lot about

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
the distribution of the data.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It shows you that A is the dominant party that got more than 50% of the outcome

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
whereas B, C, and D occupies smaller slices with a slice for C

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
being half the size of B or D, respectively.

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Again, this is called a pie chart.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Pie charts are really, really powerful to represent things like election outcomes.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
In any data set we just care about the relative outcomes

17
00:01:07,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and perhaps have more than just 2 classes.
