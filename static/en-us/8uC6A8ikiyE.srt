1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,630
So this is what I've come up with.

2
00:00:01,630 --> 00:00:06,520
I've used the font method on the context and set it to 36 point impact and

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:09,380
I've set the textAlign property on the context to center.

4
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:12,960
You didn't have to do this, but you'll see why this is cool in a second.

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,239
For the internal fillText, I set it to white.

6
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:19,040
Then I set the fillText to CANVAS MEMES!,

7
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:22,350
with an x position starting at half the width of the canvas and

8
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:23,828
a y position of 40.

9
00:00:23,828 --> 00:00:26,590
This x position plus this text alignment of

10
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:29,620
center makes sure that our text is centered on the page.

11
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:32,800
Then for the strokes, I set the style to black,

12
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:37,020
I set the line width to 3, then I finish up with the strokeText method,

13
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:40,760
which takes in the same parameters as the fillText method from before.

14
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:43,420
Let's go ahead and save this and see how it looks.

15
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:46,160
Coming over to the browser, we see our Canvas Memes!,

16
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,690
with white text and a black outline.

17
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:50,590
Looks like we're ready to start making some memes.
