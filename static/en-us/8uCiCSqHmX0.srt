00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,850
To check our understanding of
the Floyd-Warshall algorithm,

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:05,689
let's do an iteration as an exercise.

3
00:00:05,689 --> 00:00:10,794
Suppose that the table d is in the state
below after the k=3 iteration.

4
00:00:10,794 --> 00:00:16,300
Which is where vertex 3 was allowed to
be an intermediate vertex along a path.

5
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:19,560
I want you to fill in the table
on the right with the values of d

6
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:23,119
after the final iteration,
where k is equal to 4.
