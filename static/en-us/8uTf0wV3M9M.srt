00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,383
The x-coordinate of any y-intercept is, by definition, 0. Let's draw some random

2
00:00:05,395 --> 00:00:10,716
line. Here's my lovely line. The y-intercept is where this line intersects with

3
00:00:10,728 --> 00:00:15,680
the y-axis. Remember, we have our x-axis here and our y-axis here. At the

4
00:00:15,692 --> 00:00:21,175
y-intercept right here, that x coordinate is just 0, since we haven't moved

5
00:00:21,187 --> 00:00:27,585
horizontally away from the y-axis. In fact, the equation for the line that is

6
00:00:27,597 --> 00:00:29,995
the y-axis, is just x equals 0.
