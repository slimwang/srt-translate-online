1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,540
Notice that the Android TV home screen
displays games on a separate row

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:05,068
than apps.

3
00:00:05,068 --> 00:00:07,980
To make your game appear here, as well
as to have it listed as an Android TV

4
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:09,410
game on the Google Play Store,

5
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:12,280
there's a couple quick updates we
need to make to your manifest.

6
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:14,330
First, we'll add this line to
indicate your app is a game.

7
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:18,030
Next, declare support for
game controllers.

8
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:21,370
And be sure to always set
the required flag to false,

9
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:23,660
even if your game requires one.

10
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:25,670
This might seem a bit counterintuitive.

11
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:28,170
And the reason is that game
pads are accessories and

12
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:30,840
they might not be connected
at the time of purchase.

13
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,870
So if you accidentally set
the required flag to true,

14
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:37,280
users might actually have trouble
installing your game from the Play Store

15
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,440
if their game controller
isn't connected.

16
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,740
If you actually do require a game pad,

17
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:44,510
instead just check if it's
connected when your game starts up.

18
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:49,140
As a refresher, carefully check your
manifest hardware requirements.

19
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,480
Also pay attention to implied
hardware requirements,

20
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,840
that can come about
because of permissions.

21
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,490
When you find a piece of hardware that's
supported on a mobile device, but

22
00:00:56,490 --> 00:01:00,030
not a TV, like a sensor,
mark it as optional.

23
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:02,420
Then at runtime,
check what device you're running on, or

24
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:05,510
whether your device has a certain type
of hardware, before you try and use it.
