00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:04,320
The answer is that both will be "Hello World", but they won't be upper case.

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:08,780
Let's draw the diagram. Both variables, greeting and greeting2 point to the

3
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:12,980
same string. But since to upper cause isn't a mutator, the string never

4
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:17,240
changes. Instead of changing the original string to upper case returns a new

5
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:21,630
string with upper case letters. I'm going to tell you a little bit of a secret.

6
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:25,480
There's actually no method that can mutate a string. Some methods return a new

7
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,770
different string, but they never modify the original.
