00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:02,910
This completes our lesson on memory systems and if

2
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:05,550
you followed along, you now have an advanced understanding

3
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:08,029
of how memory systems work. This should make you

4
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:09,840
a better programmer and put you in a good

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,390
position to think about some of the complex trade-offs

6
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:16,870
involved in CPU scheduling and maintaining cache coherence, especailly

7
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:19,370
in the context of shared memory machines where there

8
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:22,120
are multiple CPU's. There is always plenty more to learn.
