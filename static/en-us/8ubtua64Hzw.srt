00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,892
>> Well for A, we travel four units to the left and then tjjeree units down, so

2
00:00:04,892 --> 00:00:10,566
negative 4, negative 3. For B, we don't move horizontally, we just move down 3,

3
00:00:10,566 --> 00:00:15,724
so 0, negative 3. For C, we move to the right 3 units and down 3 units, so

4
00:00:15,724 --> 00:00:21,304
positive 3 for the right, negative 3 for down. And finally for D, 5 units right,

5
00:00:21,304 --> 00:00:25,713
3 units down. If you got all of these right, then you really have a strong

00:00:25,713 --> 00:00:27,359
understanding of points.
