00:00:00,426 --> 00:00:03,876
[Wes]So I'm very happy to be here at Mozilla with Brendan Eich,

2
00:00:03,876 --> 00:00:07,393
the CTO of Mozilla, and the designer of JavaScript.

3
00:00:07,393 --> 00:00:11,359
So u could tell us how that language came to be.

4
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:13,876
[Brendan] Sure. So I can say more about how I got ready

5
00:00:13,876 --> 00:00:19,710
to make JavaScript. It was when I wrote Netscape. I didn't have much time to do that,

6
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:21,511
and I had to have the skills already.

7
00:00:21,511 --> 00:00:26,026
And I've been just seated writing programming language implementations for my entire carreer.

8
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:31,742
When I got into Computer Science it was for Physics. First studying theory of formal languages

9
00:00:31,742 --> 00:00:38,893
and automata theory. Regular languages, regular expressions.

10
00:00:38,893 --> 00:00:42,026
This was the early 80ties and I loved the

11
00:00:42,026 --> 00:00:46,344
cleverness of the theory and rather direct way of implementing

12
00:00:46,344 --> 00:00:50,609
theories as algorithms.

13
00:00:50,609 --> 00:00:56,844
So you can make a parser or a lexer , semi-automatically or automatically.

14
00:00:56,844 --> 00:01:00,960
It was strange to me, and it was useful too.

15
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:06,310
I think every practicer in programs should take some time to invent a language

16
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:08,723
at some point. There's often a need you have

17
00:01:08,723 --> 00:01:12,243
that no typical language is perfect for, or you have some leasure time

18
00:01:12,243 --> 00:01:14,093
and you can use that. It's educational

19
00:01:14,093 --> 00:01:15,993
and can often solve your problem

20
00:01:15,993 --> 00:01:17,809
in a better way than any other language.

21
00:01:17,809 --> 00:01:20,260
And so, I encourage that. I did that myself

22
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:23,559
and there is something that helped me to get ready to write JavaScript

23
00:01:23,559 --> 00:01:26,725
because when I got into Netscape and the heat of the moment was there,

24
00:01:26,725 --> 00:01:30,642
with Java looming. Questions about if we needed two languages:

25
00:01:30,642 --> 00:01:34,792
a scripting language versus a big language as Java.

26
00:01:34,792 --> 00:01:36,210
I had to go fast.

27
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:39,871
I had to have all sort... in my muscles I had to have some practice

28
00:01:39,871 --> 00:01:42,393
already on the way.

29
00:01:42,393 --> 00:01:44,489
[Wes] So in this class we will learn a lot of

30
00:01:44,489 --> 00:01:45,760
the things he have just mentioned.

31
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,859
in various points. Regular Expressions,

32
00:01:47,859 --> 00:01:51,607
Finite State Machines, adding a lexer that follows them automatically,

33
00:01:51,607 --> 00:01:54,992
Context Free grammars, parsing, having a parser thet flow through automatically.

34
00:01:54,992 --> 00:01:58,359
And I can only say that I really agree:

35
00:01:58,359 --> 00:02:00,443
I have written a number of little languages

36
00:02:00,443 --> 00:02:02,909
in my time to scratch various hitchies.

37
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:07,550
I think it's a very important tool to have under ones' belt.
