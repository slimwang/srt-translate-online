1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,910
So did you fall into the trap?

2
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:05,580
Let's look at the distribution
again without the clutter.

3
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:10,670
If you were to approximate this with
an ellipse, what would it look like?

4
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:12,890
Well, something like that.

5
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:14,800
Which is the major axis here?

6
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,500
That's right, horizontal.

7
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,340
And that would be the first
principle component.

8
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:20,800
As odd as it may look,

9
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,080
the second principle component would
be orthogonal or perpendicular to this.

10
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:29,900
So, this is one and this is two.

11
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:32,850
Intuitively, this doesn't look right,
does it?

12
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:36,170
But it's exactly what
you told PCA to find.

13
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:39,815
The axis with the most variance
would be the first competent and

14
00:00:39,815 --> 00:00:42,444
the one orthogonal to
it would be the second.

15
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:48,610
PCA is good for characterizing
a single class of instances.

16
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:52,810
It can reduce the effective number
of dimensions need significantly.

17
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:56,830
But, what if your data came
from two classes or sources?

18
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:58,490
If you wanted to characterize two or

19
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:02,910
more classes at the same time
PCA might not be a good choice.

20
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:06,160
This is especially true if
the axis of most variants for

21
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:09,800
the source distributions
are not perpendicular.

22
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:13,680
There are some other approaches for
characterizing multiple non-octagonal

23
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:19,580
classes such as ICA or
independent component analysis.

24
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:23,760
One big difference here is that ICA
does not require the components or

25
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,500
basis vectors to be orthogonal.

26
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:30,450
Anyways, this is probably going off
track from the current discussion.

27
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:34,570
Let's focus back on PCA and
see how we can apply it to images.
