00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,790
When you write code as part of a team, picking good class and method names

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:07,473
makes it possible to work together. When I pick good names for my classes, it

3
00:00:07,473 --> 00:00:10,788
makes it easier for other engineers I'm working with, to read my code, and know

4
00:00:10,788 --> 00:00:16,059
what it does. It also makes it easier for me to remember what I did. So, this

5
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:20,940
process is important, but how do you get good at it? The answer is practice.

6
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:25,408
Lots of practice. Keep writing code, and when you read code, ask yourself, what

7
00:00:25,408 --> 00:00:30,265
patterns does this code follow to make it easier to read. Or, what patterns

8
00:00:30,265 --> 00:00:35,392
could this code have followed to make it easier to read. These questions will

9
00:00:35,392 --> 00:00:38,594
be very hard to answer, at first. But as you critique more examples, it'll

10
00:00:38,594 --> 00:00:43,014
become more natural. We'll talk about a few more patterns in this lesson. But

11
00:00:43,014 --> 00:00:47,889
for now, let's do another example of designing class and method names.
