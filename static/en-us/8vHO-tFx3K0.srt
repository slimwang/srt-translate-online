1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,812
So we said this works for any right triangle. We can square the leg, square

2
00:00:03,812 --> 00:00:08,463
another leg, and add those together to get the hypotenuse squared. But, why

3
00:00:08,463 --> 00:00:13,746
does this work? Well, let's see this by starting off with a square. Here's one

4
00:00:13,746 --> 00:00:17,522
large square, and then this small square has a side length of a, and this

5
00:00:17,522 --> 00:00:22,966
larger square has a side length of b. So, we know that the area of this square

6
00:00:22,966 --> 00:00:28,912
is a squared. And the area of this square is b squared. And now, what I'm

7
00:00:28,912 --> 00:00:33,314
going to do is break this white space up into four congruent rectangles. If

8
00:00:33,314 --> 00:00:37,575
this length is a, then we know that this length is also a. And we know if this

9
00:00:37,575 --> 00:00:43,040
length is b, then this length is also b. If our entire shape is a square, then

10
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:48,650
we know that if this side is a plus b, then this side must also be a plus b.

11
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:54,456
That's how we know that this side length is b. We can use the same reasoning to

12
00:00:54,456 --> 00:00:59,861
say that this side length here, is a. Since we know the entire side must be a

13
00:00:59,861 --> 00:01:04,959
plus b. So, notice that all four of these triangles are identical. They all

14
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:10,105
have a leg of a, a leg of b, and a hypotenuse of c. The four triangles are just

15
00:01:10,105 --> 00:01:14,950
oriented in different ways. Like for this one, here's a, here's b, and here's

16
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:20,506
they hypotenuse across the 90 degree angle c. So now what we're going to do is

17
00:01:20,506 --> 00:01:26,267
take this triangle and fix it at this point. We're going to rotate the triangle

18
00:01:26,267 --> 00:01:30,206
around this point. We're also going to take this triangle here and fix it at

19
00:01:30,206 --> 00:01:35,687
this point. So we can rotate the triangle around this point. So let's move

20
00:01:35,687 --> 00:01:40,619
these two triangles to a different position. We're going to swing this triangle

21
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:43,985
up, around this point, and we're going to swing this triangle down, around this

22
00:01:43,985 --> 00:01:50,442
point. When we rearrange the triangles, we get this new arrangement. Notice

23
00:01:50,442 --> 00:01:54,906
that I have the same four triangles, with legs a and b, and a hypotenuse of c,

24
00:01:54,906 --> 00:02:01,450
and the area inside here is c squared. So, what do we know must be true about

25
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:06,295
this area and this new area? Take some time to think and then fill in the

26
00:02:06,295 --> 00:02:11,342
missing statements to this sentence. Choose one of these statements to make

27
00:02:11,342 --> 00:02:15,169
this sentence true. And then, check any of these boxes that provide the correct

28
00:02:15,169 --> 00:02:16,270
reasoning.
