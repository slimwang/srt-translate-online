1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:04,860
If your app lets people buy things,
it must also let them ask for a refund.

2
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:09,840
Your app has to have the code for
processing refunds.

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,930
Sending a refund hit to analytics
does not execute the refund.

4
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:15,030
It simply reports it.

5
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:19,640
You can read about sending refund
hits in the developer guide.

6
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:23,600
You can report either a partial or
a full refund.

7
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,360
When you send the hit for a refund,
you must provide a transaction ID.

8
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:33,000
See here it says in the Developer Guide,
the matching transaction is not found,

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,490
the refund will not be processed.

10
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:39,510
Your app must keep track of
the transaction IDs for itself.

11
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:43,470
Analytics isn't going to do that for
you.

12
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:48,000
So it's important to note that Analytics
has a six month limit for refunds.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,740
So that doesn't mean that your app can't
issue refunds after six months, but

14
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:54,430
refund hits to analytics won't take

15
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:56,430
affect after six months of
the original transaction.

16
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:01,470
If you're up for the challenge, go ahead
and add a refund button to your app.

17
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:03,349
I leave it to you to do.
