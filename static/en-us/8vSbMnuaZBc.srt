00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:02,300
Welcome back to Computer Vision.

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:04,480
With this lesson, we're actually starting a new unit,

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:06,750
which I've nominally titled Features in Matching.

4
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:14,720
But really, the, the whole idea of this is to find reliably detectable and

5
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:18,070
discriminable locations in different images.

6
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:20,640
That is, I'd like to figure out a way that,

7
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,270
if I have some points in one image of a scene, I'd like to

8
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:29,650
figure out which points are the same points in another image of the scene.

9
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:30,910
Now, you might say wait a minute,

10
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:33,410
we just did that in stereo, but no, you didn't.

11
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:36,120
You see in stereo, the idea was that we

12
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,610
were going to have these epipolar lines along which we would search.

13
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:42,540
But remember we talked about that in order to find those epipolar lines,

14
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:44,710
we need to know the fundamental matrix, and in order to do that,

15
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:49,040
we'd need the correspondences, so this is a way of finding correspondences.

16
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,634
That's one way of thinking about it.

17
00:00:51,634 --> 00:00:53,816
Couple of resources, Forsyth and

18
00:00:53,816 --> 00:00:57,529
Ponce do cover this nicely here in section 5.3 and 4.

19
00:00:57,529 --> 00:01:00,975
And Szeliski, which is that other textbook that we pointed you to,

20
00:01:00,975 --> 00:01:03,099
also does this well in, chapter 4.
