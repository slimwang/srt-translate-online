00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:04,370
I would argue that the global grouping is needed here because we

2
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:09,720
want the entire stream to be sent to a single bolt, the ReportBolt.

3
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:11,840
Because we have a parallelism of one for

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,970
the ReportBolt, technically a shuffle grouping would also work.

5
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:17,640
All streams are shuffled to one ReportBolt, but

6
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:20,440
this adds computational overhead for one bolt.

7
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:23,330
Finally the fields grouping means we hash or

8
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:27,580
bin on a subset of the tuple attributes or fields.

9
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:31,520
For our use case then this is also not the best solution due to

10
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:33,800
computational overhead for one bolt.

11
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,990
Hopefully you chose the global grouping to connect the report bolt

12
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:38,490
to the count bolt.

13
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:38,990
Great job.
