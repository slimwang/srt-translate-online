00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
[Male] For the last question in Homework 1,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
you're going to solve the problem of how to round numbers,

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
and this is going to require using a new Python function we haven't

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
introduced yet in lecture, but you'll be able to figure it out

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
as part of this homework problem.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
But it's a pretty tough question, so that's why it has 2 gold stars.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
The new function that you'll use is the str function.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
The str function takes as input any number,

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
and it turns that number into a string, so the output of str

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
applied to a number is a string that represents the number that was passed in,

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:38,000
so if we evaluated str on the number 89,

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
what that evaluates to is the string containing the characters 8 and 9.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
So it's a string that looks like the number that was passed in,

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
but instead of being a number, now it's a string.

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
If you understand str, you'll be able to solve this question.

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Your goal for this question is given a variable x,

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
so at the beginning of your code, x has been initialized to store the value

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
of any decimal number.

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
What your code should do is print out the nearest whole number to x.

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
So here's a few examples.

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
If the value of x is 3.14159,

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
what your code should print out is 3.

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
If the value of x is 27.63,

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
your code should print out 28.

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
And to keep this a little simpler, you can assume that the value of x

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
is not negative.

27
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
This is going to require you to combine several things

28
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
that you've seen in Unit 1.

29
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The only new thing that you need to solve this is the str function

30
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
that we've just explained.

31
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Everything else that you need to solve this is something that you already know

32
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
from Unit 1.
