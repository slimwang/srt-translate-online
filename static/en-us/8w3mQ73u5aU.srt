1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
For this problem, let M be a two-digit number.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
The value of M is encrypted using RSA and Alice's private key using no padding--

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
like this--given the values of Alice's public key and C the ciphertext

4
00:00:12,000 --> 99:59:59,999
in the instructor's comments below, what is M?
