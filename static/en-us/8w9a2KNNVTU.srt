1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:03,540
The fourth of Kruchtens' views is the physical view, and

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:06,380
this is very close to the previous one.

3
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:11,840
Here however we are concerned with how the processes are allocated

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,360
to the various execution units.

5
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:17,180
And we can use the deployment diagram that we just saw, or

6
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:19,860
we can use a sequence diagram here.

7
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:22,400
Here, as a reminder, is a sequence diagram.

8
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,960
The columns correspond to objects,

9
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,280
which could be running on separate processors.

10
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:33,790
Recall that objects are like classes, except the names are underlined and

11
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:37,750
there's usually a colon separating the name from the class name.

12
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:42,710
Going down a column corresponds to the passage of time.

13
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:46,180
And the lines that cross it indicate messages being sent.

14
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:50,230
So here we have the, the coordination of three

15
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:54,680
particular processes dealing with the handling of a transaction.

16
00:00:55,900 --> 00:01:00,230
Collaboration diagrams had the same content as in sequence diagrams, but

17
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:01,890
they're laid out differently.

18
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:05,319
Here's the corresponding collaboration diagram for

19
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:07,430
the previous sequence diagram.

20
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:11,270
Same objects, same messages.

21
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:13,960
The numbers indicate the orders in which the messages are sent.
