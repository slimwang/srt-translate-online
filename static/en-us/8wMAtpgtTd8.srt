00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,330
So now that we've talked about all the elements of a good experimental study,

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:07,150
let's put it all together into an experiment. So what we're going to do is

3
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:11,040
begin our experiment the way all psychology experiments do. By getting the

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,380
informed consent from our participants. Informed consent means that the

5
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:19,565
participant is aware of all the requirements of the study and agrees to

6
00:00:19,565 --> 00:00:24,120
participate. Once they've given us consent. We decided we're going to randomly

7
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:28,260
put our participants into groups by flipping a coin to ensure that it's

8
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:33,190
randomly assigned. Because this is a single blind study, we know who's going to

9
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:36,390
be in the control group and we know who's going to be in the experimental

10
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:40,625
group. In the experimental group again, is those who get caffeine. In the

11
00:00:40,625 --> 00:00:46,130
control group, they don't get caffeine. Everything other than the independent

12
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:51,000
variable has to be the same in both groups. So, our next step is to measure

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,880
their reaction time. To do this, we use a reaction time test online. When the

14
00:00:55,880 --> 00:01:00,800
screen changes from white to black, the participant has to click. We took the

15
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:05,090
average of five trials from each participant. You can try this test on your own
