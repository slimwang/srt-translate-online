00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,880
When we use numbers as network
addresses, we don't care about adding or

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:04,660
subtracting them.

3
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:07,600
You never multiply one
address by another.

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:11,490
Just like street addresses or
postal codes, they may be numbers but

5
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:14,920
they don't really represent
quantities or amounts.

6
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,000
Rather, IP addresses,

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,980
like these other sorts of addresses,
represent difference.

8
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:25,260
Each address has to be different from
every other address on the same network.

9
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:28,300
With a given number of bits you can
only make a certain number of distinct

10
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:29,900
values.

11
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:34,330
Like with one bit, you can only
make two distinct values, 0 and 1.

12
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:40,570
With two bits you can make four values,
and with three bits, you can make eight.

13
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:44,740
So if you had a network that only
had three bit long addresses,

14
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:48,950
you could only have as many as
eight machines on the network.

15
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:49,750
So okay.

16
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:50,960
How about four bits?

17
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,690
How many distinct four
bit values are there?

18
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:54,450
Put your answer here.
