1
00:00:00,037 --> 00:00:04,673
Block ciphers need to use both
confusion and diffusion operations.

2
00:00:04,673 --> 00:00:09,270
AES uses longer keys and
is more secure than DES.

3
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:11,909
We should use CBC to
encrypt a large message.

4
00:00:11,909 --> 00:00:16,490
We can also use the last CBC block
as the message integrity code.
