00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:04,452
Ideally, we want to test more people. That will give us a better indicator of

2
00:00:04,452 --> 00:00:09,130
whether or not the drugs are effective. We also want to give each drug to very

3
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:14,440
similar groups of people. This is why we randomize. And we also want to test a

4
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:17,860
large dose of the medication, because we really want to see how that will

5
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:23,904
effect the subject rather than other factors. Larger samples result in higher

6
00:00:23,904 --> 00:00:29,580
power. Remember the standard error of the mean? When n increases, the standard

7
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:35,262
error decreases. Lower within group variability also leads to higher power. We

8
00:00:35,262 --> 00:00:39,420
can be more sure of significant differences when the distributions aren't

9
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:45,189
overlapping. However, if the variability increases, Its harder to tell if

10
00:00:45,189 --> 00:00:50,792
there's a signficant difference. And finally, choosing treatments with strong

11
00:00:50,792 --> 00:00:55,837
effects sizes will increase power. To do this you can make treatment conditions

12
00:00:55,837 --> 00:00:59,863
last longer, make them occur more often, the treatments could just have strong

13
00:00:59,863 --> 00:01:06,219
effects. Or you can make the treatment conditions last longer, make them more

14
00:01:06,219 --> 00:01:11,344
intense make them occur more often etc. These are all ways to detect whether or

15
00:01:11,344 --> 00:01:13,640
not theirs a signifcant difference.
