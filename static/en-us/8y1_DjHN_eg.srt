00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,660
The next few lessons will cover internet routing.

2
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:04,810
Contrary to what you might think, the internet

3
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:07,550
is not a single network, but rather a

4
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:11,610
collection of tens of thousands of independently operated networks,

5
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:15,630
or autonomous systems. Sometimes simply called AS's. Networks

6
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:19,240
such as Comcast, Georgia Tech, and Google, are different

7
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:22,060
types of autononomous systems. An autononous system might

8
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:25,620
be internet service provider, a content provider, a campus

9
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:28,940
network or any other independently operated network. Now

10
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:30,580
when you're sitting at home on Comcast and

11
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:32,860
trying to reach content in Google or Georgia

12
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:37,710
Tech, your traffic actually traverses multiple autonomous systems. This

13
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:41,010
process of internet routing actually involves two distinct

14
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:43,890
types of routing. One is intradomain routing, which is

15
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:46,870
the process by which traffic is routed inside

16
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:50,490
any single autonomous system. The other is interdomain routing,

17
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:53,140
which is the process of routing traffic between

18
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:57,130
autonomous systems. So computing a path between a node

19
00:00:57,130 --> 00:01:00,170
in an ISP like Comcast and another node

20
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:03,790
in a network like Georgia Tech's involves computation of

21
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:07,380
both intradomain paths and interdomain paths. In this

22
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:10,190
part of the lesson we'll look at intradomain routing.

23
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:12,380
Then we'll study interdomain routing, as well as

24
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:16,360
the business relationships that make interdomain routing so complicated.

25
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:19,790
So let's jump into our study of intradomain routing and topology.
