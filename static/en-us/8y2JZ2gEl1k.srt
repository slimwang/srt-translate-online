00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,240
Welcome to elementary statistics.

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,000
We're really excited
to have you on board.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,630
My name's Katie, and

4
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:09,230
I'm the one who'll be explaining most
of the concepts throughout this course.

5
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:11,580
I'll also be doing a lot of drawing and

6
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:16,270
a lot of writing to help you understand
the content as much as possible.

7
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:18,640
In each of the 16
lessons in this course,

8
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,910
you'll learn new methods to describe and
analyze data.

9
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:24,570
Each lesson builds on
the concepts you learned before.

10
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:28,520
So as you progress through the course
try to get a good grasp of the material

11
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:30,190
before moving on.

12
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:33,190
But if it turns out you need a review,
no big deal.

13
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:37,840
You can easily go back and re-watch
the videos and redo the exercises.

14
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,110
What do I mean by exercises?

15
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:43,050
Each lesson consists of
short instructional videos

16
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:46,440
where I explain cool step stuff and
guide your thinking.

17
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,780
But we want you to make
breakthroughs on your own.

18
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:52,340
So instead of just telling you a fact or
formula, I'll ask a quiz.

19
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:56,300
A quiz or exercise,
same thing, is not there for

20
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:58,760
us to judge you or to impact your grade.

21
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:01,800
It's there for your own benefit,
to make you think.

22
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,330
At Udacity, we believe that the chance
to think about something from your

23
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:08,400
own unique perspective is
a powerful learning opportunity.
