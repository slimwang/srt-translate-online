00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,208
The color slice in the previous exercise gives a sense of the limits of what

2
00:00:04,208 --> 00:00:08,452
colors can be displayed on your monitor. This is a different kind of color

3
00:00:08,452 --> 00:00:13,426
space. We won't get heavily into this diagram, which shows what is called the

4
00:00:13,426 --> 00:00:18,180
CIE XYZ color space. But I want to point out a few key bits. Along this curved

5
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:22,355
edge are the pure spectral colors. The values here are the wavelengths of light

6
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:27,033
that produce various colors. You can in fact, see the colors of the rainbow as

7
00:00:27,033 --> 00:00:31,530
you move along it. Red, orange, yellow, green, blue and so on. You might also

8
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:37,255
notice a funny artifact along here and here. I find these lines will show up

9
00:00:37,255 --> 00:00:41,595
more strongly if I look at my computer screen from a different angle. These

10
00:00:41,595 --> 00:00:44,829
bands which are called Mach Bands are something you might run into every now and

11
00:00:44,829 --> 00:00:48,952
then in computer graphics. It turns out that the pure spectral colors on this

12
00:00:48,952 --> 00:00:52,882
outer rim are not something a monitor can actually display. The pixels in a

13
00:00:52,882 --> 00:00:56,908
monitor each have a red, green and blue component, and none of these components

14
00:00:56,908 --> 00:01:00,860
is a pure spectral color but rather a mix of differing wavelengths of light.

15
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:04,022
What this means is that our monitors have limits on the colors that they can

16
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:08,580
display. What is happening outside of these dashed lines is that the illustrator

17
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:12,610
is just faking it, by picking the best possible color and repeating it on out to

18
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:17,802
the edge of the curve. What the diagram of displayable colors looks like is

19
00:01:17,802 --> 00:01:22,102
this. This triangle is called the device's color gamma. The vertices are the

20
00:01:22,102 --> 00:01:26,443
same, RGB vertices we used to form our own color triangle. And there's a slice

21
00:01:26,443 --> 00:01:30,734
out of the color cue. This whole area reminds me of seeing advertisements for

22
00:01:30,734 --> 00:01:34,684
TVs on television. The announcer would talk about how their new TV's image was

23
00:01:34,684 --> 00:01:38,319
brighter, sharper and with richer colors. On the screen they chose some bright,

24
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:41,800
crisp video. But of course I was seeing this video with my old TV, so there

25
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:45,722
wasn't much point in them showing me anything in the advertisement at all. The

26
00:01:45,722 --> 00:01:49,232
key take-away in all this is that the RGB color's base is directly connected to

27
00:01:49,232 --> 00:01:54,167
the monitor. And that monitors have limits as to what colors they can display.

28
00:01:54,168 --> 00:01:57,828
The idea of a color gamut is also important in printing. For example, for

29
00:01:57,828 --> 00:02:03,263
high-end printing, custom inks can be used to increase the extent of the gamut.
