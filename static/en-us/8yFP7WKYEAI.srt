00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:04,070
For our first training machine example,
I've chosen one that tests the oddness

2
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:06,420
of a binary representation
of a natural number.

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:10,340
Note that I've cheated here
in the transition function

4
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:13,760
by including only state symbol
pairs in the domain that we

5
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:15,750
would actually encounter
during computation.

6
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:19,930
By convention,
if no transition is specified for

7
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:24,810
the current state symbol pair, then the
program just halts in a reject state.

8
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:27,960
One convenient way to represent
the transition function by the way,

9
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,560
is with a state diagram.

10
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:31,610
Similar to what is often used for
a finite automata,

11
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:34,180
for those familiar with
that model of computation.

12
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:39,550
Each state gets its own
vertex in a multigraph, and

13
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:43,600
every row of the transition
table is represented as an edge.

14
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:48,440
The edge gets labeled with the remaining
information besides the two states.

15
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:52,620
That is it gets the symbol
red followed by an arrow,

16
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:55,840
then the symbol to right, and
the direction to move the head.

17
00:00:57,020 --> 00:01:01,592
Now let's trace through the operation of
this Turing machine on this input 1, 0,

18
00:01:01,592 --> 00:01:03,050
1, 1.

19
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:07,741
The head first reads a 1 from the tape,
and run state q0.

20
00:01:07,741 --> 00:01:10,860
So I go up here and
consult the transition table.

21
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:14,900
And here,
I see that I should follow this edge,

22
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:18,544
since that has state q0,
and we read a 1.

23
00:01:18,544 --> 00:01:21,560
And this transition tells me
that I should write a 1 and

24
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:25,250
leave the tape alone, and
move the head to the right.

25
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:28,182
And change the state to q0.

26
00:01:28,182 --> 00:01:30,580
So let's go ahead and update our figure.

27
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:31,560
We're still in state q0,

28
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:36,370
and the position of the head has
been moved one space to the right.

29
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:38,640
So this becomes our new configuration.

30
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,400
In the next step, we'll read a 0,
consulting the transition diagram.

31
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:47,480
We see that this means that we
should leave the 0 alone and

32
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:51,486
move the head to the right again,
and stay in state q0.

33
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:55,867
We read a 1 from the tape, and that
means we follow this transition here,

34
00:01:55,867 --> 00:01:58,070
and move the head to the right again.

35
00:01:58,070 --> 00:01:59,950
And the next step is similar.

36
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:03,400
Finally, the head reads a blank symbol,
the transition table

37
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:07,230
tells us to write a blank symbol and
move the head to the left.

38
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:10,400
And to switch the state to q1.

39
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:15,290
Now, we read the symbol under the head,
that's a 1,

40
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:19,920
so we follow this transition rule here,
and we end up in an accept state.
