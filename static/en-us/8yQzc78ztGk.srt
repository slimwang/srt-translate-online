00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:03,510
Good morning, or
whatever time it is by you.

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:05,370
Welcome back to Computer Vision.

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:10,750
This our last, general unit on for
Computer Vision.

4
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:14,340
And it's actually we're
going to talk about what's

5
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:17,760
probably the most remarkable
vision system in the world.

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,540
Namely the human vision system.

7
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:24,210
And that's just not me being sort of
arrogant about us, us as a species.

8
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:29,580
But really, we really do have a
remarkably well developed visual system.

9
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:32,330
We'll talk about sort of how much of the
brain that makes use of it especially at

10
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:33,980
high level kinds of structures.
