1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:04,339
Most of the time, we get more than
one result from a geocoding response.

2
00:00:04,339 --> 00:00:09,149
We usually take the best one, the zeroth
option in the array of responses.

3
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:11,109
And we need to get information
from those results.

4
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:16,910
Using the starter code below, see if
you can grab the formatted address and

5
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:20,710
the location of the first
geocoding result.

6
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:23,890
And display them on the page
in the div elements provided.

7
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:28,800
Were you able to show
the formatted address and location?
