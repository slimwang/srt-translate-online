00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:05,516
The corticotropin releasing factor is released from the hypothalamus, which

2
00:00:05,516 --> 00:00:12,308
causes the pituitary gland to release the adrenocorticotropic hormone. Then the

3
00:00:12,308 --> 00:00:18,243
ACTH causes the adrenal gland to release cortisol. And those are the steps

4
00:00:18,243 --> 00:00:22,703
involved in our response to stress via the HPA axis.
