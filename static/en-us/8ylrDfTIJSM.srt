00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,930
BargainMart wants to create
an API to allow third-party

2
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:06,680
developers to create apps that list
out the supermarket's inventory.

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:09,700
However, querying the database
can be resource expensive,

4
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:12,198
especially if a greedy client
is overflowing the server.

5
00:00:12,198 --> 00:00:17,160
This hungry client.py is a perfect
example of one of those greedy clients.

6
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,890
It will try to make requests to
your server as much as possible if

7
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:22,280
no rate limiting is put in place.

8
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:26,210
Add a rate limiting decorator
to the inventory endpoints

9
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:30,320
such that after 60 requests per minute
the hungry client is denied service and

10
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,110
must wait before sending
anymore requests.
