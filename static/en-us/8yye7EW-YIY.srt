00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:05,170
In summary, you should now know how
scheduling works in an operating system.

2
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:07,689
We discussed several
scheduling algorithms and

3
00:00:07,689 --> 00:00:10,810
the corresponding runqueue
data structures that they use.

4
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:14,590
We described two of the schedulers
that are default in the Linux Kernel,

5
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:16,990
the Completely Fair Scheduler and
its predecessor,

6
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:19,050
the Linux Cell One Scheduler.

7
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:21,690
And also, we discuss some of
the issues that come up in

8
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:25,510
scheduling when considering
multiple CPU platforms.

9
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:29,185
This we said includes platforms with
multiple CPUs that's you memory,

10
00:00:29,185 --> 00:00:33,130
multi-core platforms as well as
platforms with hardware level

11
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:33,730
multithreading.
