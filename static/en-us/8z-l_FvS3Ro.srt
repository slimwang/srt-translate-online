00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:04,726
For our patio, the dimensions are 12 by 9. The length is 12 feet long, and the

2
00:00:04,726 --> 00:00:10,744
width is 9 feet long. Great thinking if you found these two numbers. Now, this

3
00:00:10,744 --> 00:00:14,250
required us to solve a quadratic equation. So don't worry if they give you

4
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:18,560
trouble. We haven't even done a problem like this yet. We're going to start by

5
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,400
taking our area equation, and we're going to replace this l with the expression

6
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:28,006
21 minus w. We want to make sure we use parentheses, here, since we're

7
00:00:28,006 --> 00:00:32,695
replacing this l with this expression. We'll need to multiply w to each of

8
00:00:32,695 --> 00:00:39,141
these terms inside the parentheses. So, 21 times w equals 21w, and negative w

9
00:00:39,141 --> 00:00:46,895
times w is negative w squared. We need to set this equation equal to 0. So, we

10
00:00:46,895 --> 00:00:52,140
arrange these two terms and move them to the other side. So, we'll subtract 21w

11
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:58,060
from both sides, and add w squared to both sides. This leaves us with w

12
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:03,517
squared, minus 21w, plus 108 equals 0. Now we're ready to try to factor our

13
00:01:03,517 --> 00:01:08,946
quadratic. We want to find factors of 1 times 108. Or just 108 that sum to

14
00:01:08,946 --> 00:01:15,130
negative 21. Those two factors are negative 9 and negative 12. If we set each

15
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:19,400
factor equal to 0, then we know that w could equal positive 9, or w can equal

16
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:24,560
positive 12. And maybe this is where you might have gotten confused. We have

17
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,811
the width can equal 9, or the width can equal 12. If the width does equal 9, we

18
00:01:29,811 --> 00:01:35,056
know that the entire perimeter should be 42. So doing some mental math, we know

19
00:01:35,056 --> 00:01:38,900
that the length would have to be 12 in order for the entire perimeter to be 42

20
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:44,650
feet. We could get that same result by using our area formula. We know this

21
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:50,412
area is 108. And now we know the width. The width is 9, so we divide both sides

22
00:01:50,412 --> 00:01:56,320
by 9 to get the length, is equal to 12 or 12 feet. Now if we would have let the

23
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,608
width equal 12 feet, we would have gotten this rectangle. It's really the same

24
00:02:00,608 --> 00:02:05,224
exact rectangle, it's just been rotated 90 degrees. The longest dimension of a

25
00:02:05,224 --> 00:02:10,002
closed figure or any three dimensional shape is considered to be the length. So

26
00:02:10,002 --> 00:02:13,215
instead of making the width equal 12, we'll make the length equal 12, and the

27
00:02:13,215 --> 00:02:18,128
width equal 9. Finally it's always best to check your result, to make sure that

28
00:02:18,128 --> 00:02:22,135
the perimeter and the area are what we expect it to be. If we add up all the

29
00:02:22,135 --> 00:02:25,555
sides together, we get a perimeter of 42, just like what was stated in our

30
00:02:25,555 --> 00:02:30,798
problem. And if we multiply the length and the width, we get an area of 108

31
00:02:30,798 --> 00:02:34,970
square feet. This is why we know these two answers are correct.
