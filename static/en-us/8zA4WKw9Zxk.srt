00:00:00,071 --> 00:00:03,040
So to close, do you have any thoughts for students who are taking this class?

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,542
I mean, it's very exciting to get to teach thousands of students about parallel computing.

3
00:00:06,542 --> 00:00:08,559
What should they be thinking about going forward?

4
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:11,730
I think my big advice for students is to get your feet wet.

5
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:16,568
Go out there and write a bunch of parallel programs. The future of the world is parallel.

6
00:00:16,568 --> 00:00:19,456
Serial programs, it's going to be like COBOL programs.

7
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:21,807
I mean, and people used to do those, but they don't do them anymore.

8
00:00:21,807 --> 00:00:27,003
Don't just write the program, but be a critic of your own code,

9
00:00:27,003 --> 00:00:31,393
and go and profile it, understand why it performs the way it does,

10
00:00:31,393 --> 00:00:34,641
and understand that memory is not flat.

11
00:00:34,641 --> 00:00:35,963
If you want to get good performance out of a program,

12
00:00:35,963 --> 00:00:40,861
you have to understand the hierarchy of the memory system and find a compelling application.

13
00:00:40,861 --> 00:00:45,642
I always find that if you really want to make progress on improving your programming skills,

14
00:00:45,642 --> 00:00:47,658
especially parallel programming skills,

15
00:00:47,658 --> 00:00:51,677
it's motivating to say, okay, I've got this really cool computational photography application.

16
00:00:51,677 --> 00:00:53,579
I'm going to make cool pictures.

17
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:57,885
That's actually one reason why graphics is so fun is that you can see your results.

18
00:00:57,885 --> 00:01:01,260
Super. Thanks so much for coming, Bill. I really appreciate your time.

19
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:03,123
Oh, well thank you, John. It's really been a pleasure.
