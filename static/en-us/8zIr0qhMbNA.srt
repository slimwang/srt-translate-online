This problem deals with mailing a package. The price for mailing a package

2
00:00:04,082 --> 00:00:08,538
varies directly with its length and its width. This should make sense, since the

3
00:00:08,538 --> 00:00:12,198
larger something is, the more money and work that it would take to ship it

4
00:00:12,198 --> 00:00:16,388
across the country or even the world. So if it costs $20 to ship a package that

5
00:00:16,388 --> 00:00:20,692
measures 4 feet and weighs 10 pounds. How much would it cost to mail a package

6
00:00:20,692 --> 00:00:24,988
that measures 7 and a half feet, and weighs 15 pounds? Write that price here and

7
00:00:24,988 --> 00:00:28,763
don't worry about putting your dollar sign. I have it written for you.
