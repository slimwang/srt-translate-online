1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:02,440
Now you're ready for
your next challenge app.

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:05,990
And this random color app the colorizer
text field has been changed so

3
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:08,860
that it randomly changes color
every time the text changes.

4
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:13,975
This is achieved with the random
color text field delegate.

5
00:00:13,975 --> 00:00:16,795
I'm going to walk you through the steps
to create the random color text

6
00:00:16,795 --> 00:00:17,705
field delegate.

7
00:00:17,705 --> 00:00:20,535
Then you can run through the steps on
your own to see the random color app

8
00:00:20,535 --> 00:00:21,945
in action.

9
00:00:21,945 --> 00:00:25,982
The first step is to create an empty
random text field delegate class.

10
00:00:25,982 --> 00:00:28,862
To do this just control click on
the folder where you want to put it.

11
00:00:30,242 --> 00:00:31,532
Then go to New File.

12
00:00:33,062 --> 00:00:36,232
Choose swift file and then name it.

13
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:42,810
Next you'll want to import UI kit,
define your class,

14
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:47,840
subclassing NS Object and declare
the UI text field delegate protocol.

15
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,660
Inside your new delegate class,

16
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:52,960
you'll need to create a method
that will return a random color.

17
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,980
If you need some help
writing this method,

18
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:58,230
there are some helpful suggestions
in the next reading node.

19
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:02,390
You'll also want to implement the method
textField shouldChangeCharactersInRange.

20
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:06,050
This is where you'll set
the color of your text.

21
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:10,150
And then the last two steps are in
the viewController.swift file.

22
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:12,160
You'll need a variable for
your new delegate.

23
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:16,760
And then assign that delegate
to one of the text fields.

24
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:20,440
After you've completed those steps, run
the simulator and verify that it works.
