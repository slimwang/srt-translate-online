1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Setting a different value for the mass is obviously

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
something that has to happen in the right-hand side.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
The differential equations, as such, contains our physical model.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Determining the value at one precise instant of time

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
is a job for the output.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Most probably it has to interpolate between values before and after,

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
because there is no step at exactly this instant of time.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
So, this is O.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Stopping at the given time--that's a job for the driver.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
It will stop the stepper.

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Using an implicit method is tricky.

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
That's unclear.

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Somebody would be responsible to solve the equation.

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Who would that be?

15
00:00:36,000 --> 99:59:59,999
There is no explicit right-hand side of that equation.
