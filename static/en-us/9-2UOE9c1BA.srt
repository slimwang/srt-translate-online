1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:05,790
So, we can think about some general principles that one, has to keep in

2
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:08,710
mind as an OS designer in designing

3
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:12,708
operating systems for earlier machines. The first principle

4
00:00:12,708 --> 00:00:15,590
is of course cashe conscious decisions. What

5
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:17,480
that means is, you want to pay attention

6
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:22,510
to locality. Exploit affinity to caches in

7
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:26,100
scheduling decisions for instance. And you want to reduce

8
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:29,640
the amount of sharing of data structures. If you reduce

9
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,270
the amount of sharing of data structures, you're reducing contention. So,

10
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:36,220
limit the amount of sharing to system data structures. We've

11
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:40,830
seen this when we talked about different synchronization algorithms. We talked

12
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:43,810
about how we can reduce the amount of sharing of

13
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:46,320
the system data structure, so that we can limit the amount

14
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,600
of contention, that's important to do, and the other thing that

15
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,470
you want to do is, you want to keep the memory

16
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:56,360
accesses local to every node in the multiprocessor as

17
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:59,230
possible, and basically what that means is you're reducing

18
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:04,129
the distance between the accessing processor and the memory.

19
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:06,580
Already, the distance is pretty big when you go

20
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:09,180
outside the chip, and access the memory over here.

21
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:10,830
But, the distance is even more if you have

22
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:14,210
a traverse interconnection network. And reach into a memory

23
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:17,560
that is on a different node of the multiprocessor.

24
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:20,940
So, keeping memory access local is another important principle that

25
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:25,570
you want to adhere to in designing operating system for, multiprocessors.
