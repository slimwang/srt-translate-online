For the first question, I said that
you should use a vector graphic.

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:05,660
And there are two reasons.

3
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:08,029
One is that this logo's pretty simple.

4
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:12,010
As it relies on text, it shouldn't be
too hard to make as a vector graphic.

5
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:16,110
And two, because you want to
it in small and large formats.

6
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:18,000
Vector graphics scale nicely, so

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,910
small and large versions of the logo
can use the same source file.

8
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:24,910
And then for the second question I said
that it should be an external file.

9
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:27,470
The reason I said it's external
is because it could be

10
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:31,045
use on multiple pages, and if it's
going to be used on multiple pages,

11
00:00:31,045 --> 00:00:32,993
it probably makes sense through
the browser to cache it.
