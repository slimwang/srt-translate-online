00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,020
Let me ask a question now.

2
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:04,470
With hardware support for
virtualization,

3
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:09,960
guest VMs can now run unmodified and can
have access to the underlying devices.

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:13,460
Given this what do you think is
the split device driver model

5
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:14,940
still relevant?

6
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:16,239
Answer either yes or no.
