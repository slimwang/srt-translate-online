00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Here's another particle filter question.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Now we're looking at the state position,

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
beginning with the same state position as before and the same 3 particles--

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
1 over here, 1 over here, 1 over here,

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
and to give the states names, you're going to call this one a1, a2, b1, and b2.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Let's assume we take a single random particle with uniform distribution,

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and we emulate a next state.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,000
The state position works as follows: A particle will move with property 1 to an adjacent state

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
but adjacent is either north, south, east, or west, but not diagonal,

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
because every particle has 2 adjacent states, it'll break ties at random

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
so you're going to pick 1 of the 2 with 50% probability.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
So with this 1 particle that you've drawn random,

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
and it's in the random single position,

14
00:00:47,000 --> 99:59:59,999
what's the probability that finds itself in a1, a2, b1, and b2?
