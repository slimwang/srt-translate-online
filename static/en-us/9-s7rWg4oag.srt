00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,110
Okay. Another protocol I'd like to talk about is SOAP. Actually,

2
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:06,700
I'm just kidding. We are not going to talk about SOAP. SOAP

3
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:09,670
is based on XML. It's another protocol for communicating between two

4
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:12,220
machines. If you ever have to deal with it, you'll know why

5
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:14,860
that I don't even want to bother teaching it. It's very,

6
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:17,880
very complicated. But what I would like to list for you are

7
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:22,530
a bunch of other common protocols and formats for communicating across

8
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:25,230
the Internet. Now SOAP is one of them. We won't be spending

9
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:27,818
any time on any of these. But lots of people use them.

10
00:00:27,818 --> 00:00:31,130
For example, hip monk, a lot of our data sources communicate via

11
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:34,180
SOAP. It was invented by Microsoft to make communication online as complicated

12
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:36,430
as possible. We've got protocol buffers,

13
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:38,920
which are from Google. Similar to concept

14
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:41,800
to json, it's a way of encoding different types of data for

15
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,470
sending it over the wire. And there's another one called thrift. This

16
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:47,740
is by Facebook. Now you've got all sorts of like, plain text,

17
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:50,270
plus some formats. Now, these are not all. You know? SOAP kind of

18
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:53,680
defines a whole protocol. Protocol buffers are really, you know, how to encode

19
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,440
data. Thrift is how to encode data over the wire. These, these compare

20
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:00,620
more to JSON. Soap compares more to HTTP plus JSON. Kind of the

21
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:04,000
whole package. The protocol and the data type. Of course, you can always

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,880
just build your own plain, plain-text, you know, protocol and, and data format,

23
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:10,600
but I wouldn't recommend doing this. It's not that hard to just use

24
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,870
JSON instead. And then, you know, somebody else who comes along and needs

25
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:15,660
to use the service, whether it's, you know, outside of your company or

26
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:17,890
internally, they don't have to figure out, you

27
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:19,826
know, how to, you know, write all this custom

28
00:01:19,826 --> 00:01:22,460
code to parse, parse your custom stuff. Because JSON

29
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:24,420
and Thrift and protocol buffers and SOAP, you can

30
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:26,750
find implementations of these in almost any language. We

31
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:29,010
mention XML and JSON. Those are also in this

32
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:31,670
list. Use something that already exists, it'll save everybody

33
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:33,210
a lot of time. I probably wouldn't use SOAP.
