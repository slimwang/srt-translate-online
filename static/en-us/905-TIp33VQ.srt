00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:03,693
[SOUND] All ready,
it is time for the third and

2
00:00:03,693 --> 00:00:07,983
final opportunity to make
this blog look awesome.

3
00:00:07,983 --> 00:00:10,020
Feel free to use the blog
that you've been working on.

4
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:11,160
Or if you want a fresh start,

5
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:14,250
you can download a clean version
in the downloadable section.

6
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:17,330
And just like before, I'm going to
give you some mandatory changes and

7
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:19,240
some optional changes for the blog.

8
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:22,680
As you set up in the first iteration
of the blog, the images right now

9
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:27,440
are basically just big enough so they
look good on large high DPI displays.

10
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:30,290
The good news is that you're guaranteed
to deliver high quality images

11
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:31,400
to everyone.

12
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:36,110
But the bad news is that these images
are probably too big for most devices.

13
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:38,570
There's also the added issue of artwork.

14
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:42,853
In that, when the view port is small,
users are seeing a wide image, and

15
00:00:42,853 --> 00:00:46,440
they may miss some of
the most important elements.

16
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:50,610
Like for instance here on a phone
with a wide image of the horses,

17
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:51,850
they just look like dots.

18
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:54,040
You can't really make out any detail.

19
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,200
Enter the picture element.

20
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:59,610
For this part of the project, I want you
to use the picture element to deliver

21
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:03,280
different images based
on view port widths.

22
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,960
And for some images, like the horses,

23
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:10,820
I want you to display a different crop
of the image based on browser width.

24
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:15,070
So if the window gets small, crop it
in so we can actually see the horses.

25
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:17,290
It usually makes sense
to show tighter and

26
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:20,530
tighter crops of an image as
the browser gets smaller.

27
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:23,550
And remember,
you can use the source set attribute

28
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:27,640
to change which image is displayed
based on device pixel ratio.

29
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,000
Take advantage of this.

30
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,020
In this solution,
you'll see me set breakpoints at 500 and

31
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:35,940
750 pixels for my picture elements.

32
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:37,760
I'll also set up images for

33
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:42,980
1x and 2x displays when the browser
is larger than 750 pixels.

34
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:45,530
And just like the first time
you worked on the project,

35
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:49,540
I'm giving you a boilerplate
gruntfile to help you get started.

36
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:53,429
And once you're delivering fully
responsive images with picture element,

37
00:01:53,429 --> 00:01:56,793
make sure to add some descriptive
alt tags if the images need them.

38
00:01:56,793 --> 00:02:00,593
As an optional challenge, you can make
this blog look a little bit nicer.

39
00:02:00,593 --> 00:02:01,545
In the solution,

40
00:02:01,545 --> 00:02:05,590
you'll see me use the section tag
to separate pieces of content.

41
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:07,770
I'll add a new font from
Google Fonts as well, and

42
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:10,830
there might be a few other
aesthetic changes to the text.

43
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:14,460
So once you've used the picture tag
with srcset to deliver images based on

44
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:17,870
different browser widths and
display densities, and you've added

45
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:21,895
alt attributes to all of your images,
a code will appear on the screen.

46
00:02:21,895 --> 00:02:23,725
Type that code in here to continue.

47
00:02:23,725 --> 00:02:27,055
But hey, don't forget,
this is your baby and this is an art.

48
00:02:27,055 --> 00:02:30,285
So try a new font and maybe style
the text just a little bit better.
