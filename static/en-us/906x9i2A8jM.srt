1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:02,360
So we use a combination of things.

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:04,440
Over my career I've used
lots of different things,

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:09,080
all the way from itracking to
usability to quantitative analysis.

4
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:12,390
But I think the most important
thing is to be iterative and

5
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:14,700
to be in a process of learning.

6
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:18,590
The worst case scenario you can get
to is what I call the sort of culture

7
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:19,730
of delivery.

8
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:23,290
Which is, your whole processes
are aligned to one ship date,

9
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:24,810
and we redesigned checkout.

10
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:25,990
Okay, what's the next project?

11
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:27,130
And we shipped that, that's done.

12
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:29,050
All right, that's a culture of delivery.

13
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:31,540
A culture of learning is,
hey, we're going to try this.

14
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:33,650
Oh, let's see what we can learn
before we actually build it.

15
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:35,020
Oh, we started to build it.

16
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:37,430
Let's prototype it, and
make it better and better.

17
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:38,050
Hey, we launched it.

18
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:38,680
What happened?

19
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:39,330
Let's measure.

20
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:40,130
We should tweak that.

21
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:40,910
Let's keep measuring.

22
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:42,090
Let's keep learning.

23
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:46,070
When you do that then you find
all of these opportunities for

24
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:50,219
optimization, and for insights,
that you wouldn't have.

25
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:52,987
If all you're doing is
getting to that launch and

26
00:00:52,987 --> 00:00:56,040
then moving on to the next
launch after that.

27
00:00:56,040 --> 00:01:01,360
So internally here I have
a number of different teams that

28
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,630
look at both sides of the equation.

29
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:05,420
We do rapid iterative
prototyping up front.

30
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:08,730
So we'll build a little prototype, we'll
put users through it, and we'll learn,

31
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:10,550
do they understand our intent.

32
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:13,440
Can they actually act on what
we're trying to allow them to do?

33
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:16,930
And then after launch,
we'll go and track the metrics and

34
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:20,920
sometimes with the metrics you'll see,
oh that's weird.

35
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,120
Why is that going on?

36
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:25,500
And then the next natural step is
to actually go talk to people.

37
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,547
There's a case study that Expedia
published a long time ago.

38
00:01:28,547 --> 00:01:31,206
Which was fascinating to me
because they had a check out flow,

39
00:01:31,206 --> 00:01:32,820
standard thing, right.

40
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:35,720
You have booked the trip and
you're going through and they had this

41
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:40,340
optional field called company,
right above billing information.

42
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:43,340
And for whatever reason,
people would enter their company, and

43
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:47,290
then start putting in the address
of their company below company,

44
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:48,910
which kind of makes sense.

45
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:51,750
But what happened is,
they would get these billing errors.

46
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:55,015
Because they put in a billing address
that is not the billing address of

47
00:01:55,015 --> 00:01:56,965
the credit card, instead it's
the company that they work for,

48
00:01:56,965 --> 00:01:58,495
this was an optional field.

49
00:01:58,495 --> 00:02:01,855
So Expedia removed it, and
instantly they got 12 million more

50
00:02:01,855 --> 00:02:06,035
in profit a year overnight just from
dropping this one optional field.

51
00:02:06,035 --> 00:02:08,565
And until you actually see
somebody go through a flow,

52
00:02:08,565 --> 00:02:11,399
how would you ever guess why there's so
many errors?

53
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:15,590
You have to talk to a couple people and
go, oh they think it's their

54
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:18,660
company's address that's why we're
getting all these billing errors.

55
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:21,560
It's not like bad credit cards or
what have you.

56
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:24,260
So that combination of
the quantitative data,

57
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:28,500
hm, lots of errors in billing addresses,
and qualitative,

58
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:32,380
why let's talk to them, really lets
you fix the product and make it work.
