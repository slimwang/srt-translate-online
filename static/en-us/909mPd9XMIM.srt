1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
[Thrun] And surprisingly, the answer is 7.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
You cannot recover the absolute location and orientation of the coordinate system,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
which are 6 of those parameters,

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
but you can also not recover scale.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
For example, take a situation like this where you have 3 points over here

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
and now make this situation twice as large

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
with the points spread out twice as widely.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Because of perspective math, this over here will be the same answer

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
as this guy over here.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
So this is 1 scale parameter that you can't recover,

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
so you can only recover 6m plus 3n minus 7 parameters.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
And as long as this is smaller than 2mn, you have a solution

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
of the structure from motion problem.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
This was entirely nontrivial.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
If you got this wrong, I would have gotten this wrong if I hadn't known the solution.

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
But it's fun to think about these things.

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
A lot of computer vision people care about whether the problem is well posed,

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
and you need a certain number of features and a certain number of images

19
00:00:58,000 --> 99:59:59,999
to make this equation hold true.
