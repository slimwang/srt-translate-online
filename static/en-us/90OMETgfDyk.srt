00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,810
So, we are going to spend a little more time with population parameters and

2
00:00:04,822 --> 00:00:09,690
samples statistics. Let's say that we have these memory scores. And, what if I

3
00:00:09,702 --> 00:00:14,685
pick the sample from this population that consisted of these scores. Now, just a

4
00:00:14,697 --> 00:00:19,630
point of clarification, populations are generally much bigger than this. But

5
00:00:19,642 --> 00:00:24,250
we're just going to pretend that this is the population, and we are choosing

6
00:00:24,262 --> 00:00:29,169
these three scores for a sample. Will the average of the sample be greater than,

7
00:00:29,274 --> 00:00:33,216
equal to, or less than the population average? What do you think?
