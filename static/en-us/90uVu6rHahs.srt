1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,774
In general if you have a person or thing that can do a job in a hours then 1

2
00:00:03,774 --> 00:00:07,680
over a represents the amount of work done by that person or thing in one hour

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:14,364
time. If you have a second person or thing that takes b hours to do that same

4
00:00:14,364 --> 00:00:20,248
job, then 1 divided by b represents the total amount of work done. By that

5
00:00:20,248 --> 00:00:24,085
thing in one hour. So if it takes them x hours to do the job together, then 1

6
00:00:24,085 --> 00:00:29,542
over x is how much they have done together in that one hour. This would be the

7
00:00:29,542 --> 00:00:34,270
fraction of the job completed. Again, this x is the number that represents the

8
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:37,750
total time it takes for the job to be completed by two people or objects

9
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:40,341
working together.
