00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,068
We need to shift the graph down by 10,000, or in other words, the new graph will

2
00:00:05,068 --> 00:00:09,832
be 10,000 lower than the old graph. This is because Grant's profit, the p

3
00:00:09,832 --> 00:00:14,967
values, are all the vertical values on the graph will be each 10,000 lower than

4
00:00:14,967 --> 00:00:19,937
they were in the old graph. Let's take a look at this for a second. Here are the

5
00:00:19,937 --> 00:00:24,739
graphs for our old equation, the one in red. And our new equation, the one in

6
00:00:24,739 --> 00:00:29,707
blue. And we can see that the blue graph is shifted just below the red one. It's

7
00:00:29,707 --> 00:00:34,687
shifted down by 10,000. So the p coordinate of every single point along the blue

8
00:00:34,687 --> 00:00:39,199
curve is 10.000 lower. And the p coordinate of the point with the same c

9
00:00:39,199 --> 00:00:43,878
coordinate on the red curve. So it looks like changing the constants as final

10
00:00:43,878 --> 00:00:48,719
terms out here can shift the graph in vertical direction and we have a parabola.

11
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,421
That's pretty interesting.
