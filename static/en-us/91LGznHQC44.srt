1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:04,730
So, that's all there is to
the algorithm, that's particle filtering

2
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:08,780
using sampling as a,
as a way of representing your densities.

3
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:11,020
There are some details to
mention about how to do that,

4
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:13,720
which we'll talk about later,
when we do if for tracking.

5
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:16,160
But, before we do that, I want to
show you some interesting, sort of,

6
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,990
robot vision applications be,

7
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:22,380
because they they illustrate the use
of particle filters really well.

8
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:25,600
And then we'll revisit
the pure vision tracking but

9
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,630
in the meantime I'm thirsty.

10
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:29,370
I'm going to go get a drink so we'll
be back for the next lesson in a bit.
