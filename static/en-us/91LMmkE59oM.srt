00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,420
It's time to apply what you've learned
about markup techniques to the blog.

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:06,090
You can use the same blog you
were working on in lesson one, or

3
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:08,800
if you want, you can find a fresh
copy in the downloadable section.

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,050
At this point in the project,
your images are looking pretty good, but

5
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:15,249
there are a few opportunities
to use some markup techniques.

6
00:00:15,249 --> 00:00:17,950
First of,
check out this random smiley face.

7
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:19,150
It's a PNG.

8
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:21,200
Just go ahead and
replace it with Unicode.

9
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,000
There's really no reason for
this to be a PNG.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,590
And of course, what's a blog
without social media links?

11
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:30,300
Use Zocial to add some social media
links to the bottom of the page.

12
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,670
I'll be adding them to a footer tag, but

13
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:34,800
feel free to add them
however you'd like.

14
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,620
Also notice this weird flourish here?

15
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:39,926
It separates the main content
from the footer below it.

16
00:00:39,926 --> 00:00:43,180
It's a PNG,
which is obviously pretty unnecessary,

17
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:45,860
so replace it with something
that does make sense.

18
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:48,837
In the solution,
you'll see me just totally remove it and

19
00:00:48,837 --> 00:00:50,798
replace it with some more subtle CSS.

20
00:00:50,798 --> 00:00:52,260
Here's an option for you.

21
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,200
Add a responsive logo.

22
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,720
Check the instructor notes if
you want some inspiration.

23
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:01,290
Once you have replaced this smiley
face with a unicode smiley face, and

24
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:04,989
once you've replaced the flourish
with something else using markup, and

25
00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:09,630
once you've added some social media
icons, a code will appear on the page.

26
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:11,140
Type that code in here to continue.
