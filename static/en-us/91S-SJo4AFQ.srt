1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So the first one is, of course, rather obvious,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
before you even start a search tree algorithm,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
you should always apply pre-processing.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
And the last one, of course, also doesn't make sense,

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
because once the search tree is completed,

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
then you already have your best possible solution

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
so why would you want to start pre-processing again.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
The interesting part is this here,

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
because it could be the case that the assignments that you create

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
during your search tree algorithm

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
actually allow you to do new pre-processing rules,

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
and you have already seen this.

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
For example, for independent set and vertex cover

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
where we had said that during the search tree you come across cases

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
where for other vertices you can already decide if they are

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
going to be in an optimal solution or not, so it does make sense,

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
and there are the names of it misleading to apply

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
this pre-processing also during the search tree.

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Now the question is, how often and when you should you should apply it.

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
You should definitely apply it regularly,

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
because you can regularly gain new

22
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
information during your search tree algorithm.

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Doing it at each level, on the other hand, I think should not be recommended,

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
and the reason for that is although pre-processing requires only polynomial time,

25
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
it still requires time, so if you do the pre-processing too often

26
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
then on the one hand you waste a lot of time,

27
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
and on the other hand, these rules will not be very effective

28
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
because you need to have made a few more decisions each time in the search tree

29
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
until new pre-processing rules might become applicable.

30
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
How often to apply it is almost more of an art than a science,

31
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
but you should definitely not think about pre-processing

32
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
as something that you do only before you start a search tree algorithm

33
00:01:39,000 --> 99:59:59,999
but also something that can help you during a search tree.
