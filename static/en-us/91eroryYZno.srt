1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:04,110
So here, I have just I think this is a figure from Forsythe and Ponds.

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:05,070
Maybe it's from Salinski.

3
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:06,600
I hope their lawyers aren't watching.

4
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:07,500
It's somebody.

5
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:10,220
And basically, it talks about how you can transform an image.

6
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:12,650
And so on the bottom left hand corner, you have a square.

7
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:14,700
And you can see, you could just translate it.

8
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,040
They, they call it Euclidean, but

9
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:19,470
that's just a rigid transformation where you have the rotation translation.

10
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:22,320
You have similarity, affine, and projective, and

11
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,640
we're going to talk about each of those in terms of the mathematics.

12
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,180
So let's take the simplest example.

13
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:31,060
So the simpi, the simplest example here is translation.

14
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:34,910
So we have an x and, and by the way in, in this cool little figure.

15
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:38,670
So the original x and y is the green box, and take our x and

16
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:41,440
we just add some translation vector to it.

17
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,500
And we saw that it was an easy way to describe this using

18
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:49,740
homogeneous coordinates where we just do xy and 1, and we add 1 to the end.

19
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:54,750
And then we can just have a transformation matrix here, which is just made up of

20
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:58,600
an identity plus the translation vector that we add from over here.

21
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:04,280
And to keep the whole thing in homogeneous coordinates, we would just say we

22
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:07,960
would make a, instead of a 2 by 3, would make this a 3 by 3.

23
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:11,230
So that 0 vector now is on the bottom row.

24
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:15,450
And what we do is we get from one homogeneous vector to another.

25
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:15,980
Okay?

26
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:17,610
So that would be translation.

27
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:21,290
By the way, because these are now just matrix multiplications,

28
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:23,030
we could chain these transformations.
