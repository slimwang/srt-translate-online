1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
And the answer is 2.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
There's a cluster over here and a cluster over here.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
And while it might happen that it's as many as 8,

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
if you adjust you're affinity matrix well,

5
00:00:10,000 --> 99:59:59,999
those 2 should correspond with the 2 larger eigenvalues.
