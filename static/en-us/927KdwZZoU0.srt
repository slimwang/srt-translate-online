1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,970
We can understand the importance
of authentication by going back

2
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:09,950
to the discussion we had about what
a trusted computing base does.

3
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:13,580
So we have resources that need
to be protected and we can do

4
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:18,510
that by having a trusted computing
base that is a reference monitor.

5
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:21,900
Every request that comes for
a resource has to be monitored.

6
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:25,270
And when you monitor the request,
the question you have is,

7
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:28,760
should this request be able
to access the resource for

8
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:31,490
which that is the target
of this request?

9
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:34,620
To answer that question we
really have to establish

10
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:36,510
who is the request coming from.

11
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:40,360
The source of the request is,
we're going to be able to identify that

12
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:42,890
because we have
authentication in the system.

13
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:48,660
So let's look a little bit more closely
at what authentication really is.

14
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:53,960
Authentication, we said we have to
establish the source of the request.

15
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:59,890
So we have to ask the question, who
are you, if you happen to be the source?

16
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:02,424
And of course,
you can't just claim to be anybody.

17
00:01:02,424 --> 00:01:07,650
When you're going to claim that
you are Alice, you have to provide

18
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:13,050
some evidence to us that is going to
convince us that you really are Alice.

19
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:17,870
So authentication is knowing the
identity of the source and establishing

20
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:23,670
that it indeed is that person who is
making that claim about the identity.

21
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:29,530
So once we establish the source of
a request, convince ourselves that

22
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:36,040
the user is who he or she claims to be,
the next part is authorization.

23
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:39,380
So in authorization we're
really establishing

24
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:44,140
whether the source of the request does
have the permissions necessary for

25
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:47,090
the resource that they want to access.

26
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:50,650
So this permission check is
the authorization process and

27
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:53,910
once authentication and
authorization is done,

28
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:59,070
of course then we allow access to
the resource when permitted and

29
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:03,450
the source of the request is able
to make use of the resources.

30
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:07,350
So let's dig a little bit deeper
into this question about what is

31
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:08,431
authentication?

32
00:02:08,431 --> 00:02:11,440
We just discussed that
the operating system or

33
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:16,260
the trusted computing base,
OS is that plus more perhaps.

34
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:19,920
So the OS of the trusted
computing base needs to know

35
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:24,720
who is making a request for
the resource that is protected.

36
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,440
So access to that resource
has to be secured.

37
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:32,940
So we know that in a computer system
a request actually comes from a process.

38
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:37,710
This process may be running one of your
services, your browser, a mail client,

39
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:39,180
whatever it is.

40
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:41,630
So processes making the request, but

41
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:45,700
we know that processes
are run on behalf of users.

42
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:49,235
So a given process that is
making a request must be running

43
00:02:49,235 --> 00:02:51,220
on behalf on a certain user.

44
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:55,570
We call the user also a subject or
a principal.

45
00:02:55,570 --> 00:03:00,680
These are the active entities
that actually initiate request or

46
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,810
cause actions.

47
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:07,460
So these terms are used interchangeably,
but we'll stick with user.

48
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:10,810
So process runs on behalf of a user.

49
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:15,350
Authentication, which is our topic,
essentially is going to help us

50
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:20,710
answer this question that we have,
is that if a process is making a request

51
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:25,670
to know who's making the request,
what user is making the request,

52
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:30,530
we must answer the question on whose
behalf is the process running?

53
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:35,160
So the requesting process makes
the request by making a system call.

54
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,330
It comes through the operating system,
but

55
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:40,510
on whose behalf is it making that call?

56
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:44,140
To establish the user on whose
behalf the process is running,

57
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:48,680
of course we have to start
with authentication.

58
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:52,410
In the beginning,
when a user comes to the system,

59
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:55,102
the user is going to
authenticate himself or herself.

60
00:03:55,102 --> 00:03:59,500
So that's how we, for example,
start a login session.

61
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:04,140
You login to the system, or start the
session that's going to launch one or

62
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:06,600
more processes that you need to run, and

63
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,810
then in the end the session
is going to be over.

64
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:12,860
So when you start the login session,

65
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:16,190
prior to launching the process
that is making the request,

66
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:19,589
of course you're going to make
a claim about your identity.

67
00:04:19,589 --> 00:04:24,270
You're going to tell the system, I am
Alice, and then the system is going to

68
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:27,967
ask you, well give me some evidence so
I can believe that you really are Alice.

69
00:04:27,967 --> 00:04:32,390
And when that evidence is
provided we need to verify it.

70
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:37,290
The verification actually tells us that
the user is actually who he or she

71
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:43,220
claims to be, and then that user launch
an application or start a process.

72
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:47,780
And that process is then going to have,
sometimes we say credentials of this

73
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:51,020
user, because this
user was authenticated.

74
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:53,800
In other words, those processes
are going to run on behalf

75
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,380
of that user that just authenticated,
and

76
00:04:56,380 --> 00:05:00,410
whatever resources this user is
able access, those processes

77
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:04,240
will be able to successfully
gain access to those resources.

78
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,790
So really, requests when we talk about,
do come from processes, but

79
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:11,480
processes run on behalf of users.

80
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:16,770
And the system knows what user
a process is running on behalf of

81
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:18,075
because of authentication,

82
00:05:18,075 --> 00:05:22,770
because that comes before the process
gets launched and makes the request.
