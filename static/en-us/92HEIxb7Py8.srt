The answer is, it's the system class. You've been using system.out a lot in

2
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:09,282
this course, probably much more often than Math.PI. But anyway, it is a

3
00:00:09,282 --> 00:00:13,914
variable that doesn't belong to any object of this system class. It just

4
00:00:13,914 --> 00:00:18,546
belongs to the system class itself. Now, Sarah is going to show you another

5
00:00:18,546 --> 00:00:22,452
static variable that she would add to the person class, that gives another

6
00:00:22,452 --> 00:00:26,761
example where static variables can be useful.
