00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,550
Believe it or not, we've just finished our first order

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:05,450
of the Critical Rendering Path. Let's do a quick review.

3
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:07,880
>> Hold on. What about JavaScript?

4
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:12,610
>> Okay. Fair enough So, JavaScript can manipulate both the DOM and

5
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:15,475
the CSS object model. But otherwise, the Render process is the same.

6
00:00:15,475 --> 00:00:19,280
>> Mm-hm. I see So, what kind of performance

7
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:21,950
optimization should I keep in mind when I'm using JavaScript?

8
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:23,820
>> That's a great question. And, we'll get into

9
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,840
a lot of details on how to optimize JavaScript

10
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,610
in one of the future lessons. But before

11
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:29,090
we get to that, let's do a quick review.

12
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,890
>> Try summarizing what we've learned so far

13
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:36,160
about the first path through the Critical Rendering Path.

14
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,270
You don't need to write an essay. Just list

15
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:41,000
the steps in order that they happen, and post

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,510
your answers to the forum, under the post called,

17
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:46,340
Steps to Render a Page. Or, if you don't

18
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:48,520
have access to the forms right now, find a

19
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,930
friend and explain the Critical Rendering Path to them.
