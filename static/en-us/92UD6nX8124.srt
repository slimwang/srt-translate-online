1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:03,010
So looking at the same
stereo system again.

2
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:05,610
So all information that
we are searching for

3
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:08,750
this likelihood of all the points
corresponding would be on the same line.

4
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:12,280
So we actually need to just look for
images on the same line.

5
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:15,110
This can be demonstrated by simply
looking at the same example we have

6
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:16,360
looked at before.

7
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:18,920
Basically find the patch
on the left image.

8
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:22,500
In this case here,
find this polar line constraint.

9
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:27,500
And take this and match it to all
the regions just on that line.

10
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:31,140
One by one, it reduces the computational
complexity quite a bit.

11
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:34,440
And now I can actually come
up with matches on this one,

12
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,670
use that to create a match score value.

13
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:40,430
Again, could be somewhat
square differences, or normal,

14
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:42,080
normalized cross correlation.

15
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:46,080
And if you notice this starts
giving you a very high score,

16
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,890
in this case high being good of a match.

17
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:51,840
And this basically tells
me this is a match to this,

18
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,590
and this gives me correspondence.

19
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:58,230
And of course that could be used to find
the matches that could be used to do

20
00:00:58,230 --> 00:00:59,480
disparity computations.
