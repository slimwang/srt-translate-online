1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,929
Now, let's use a simple two by three
version of isolation to illustrate how

2
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:07,160
to make a game tree that shows all
the moves possible during a game.

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:10,009
We will use this game
tree to select moves,

4
00:00:10,009 --> 00:00:12,199
which give the best
guarantee of winning.

5
00:00:12,199 --> 00:00:14,799
Consider any filled spot on
the game board as unavailable.

6
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:17,760
We will start with one filled spot,

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,970
we'll call the beginning game
level zero in our game tree.

8
00:00:20,969 --> 00:00:23,269
Assume that O is the computer player.

9
00:00:23,269 --> 00:00:27,579
O is the first to move, so the computer
has five choices in the beginning.

10
00:00:27,579 --> 00:00:31,879
We draw out all the possible boards for
level one of the game tree.

11
00:00:31,879 --> 00:00:33,000
X goes next and

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,469
can put its piece anywhere on the game
board that has not been taken by O.

13
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:43,100
So no matter which position O occupied
for it's first move, X has four choices.

14
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:46,179
We can quickly draw the nodes for
level two of our tree.

15
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:49,950
>From then on, the number of choices for
each player becomes smaller

16
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:53,650
as the pieces are limited to
moves like a queen in chess.

17
00:00:53,649 --> 00:00:54,399
O goes next.

18
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:58,170
The left most leaf,
O can move straight down,

19
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:04,250
diagonally down to the right,
but it can't move through X.
