1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:01,690
Of these three packets,

2
00:00:01,690 --> 00:00:04,810
there's one of them that has
two things the others don't.

3
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:05,918
It's this one, the second one.

4
00:00:05,918 --> 00:00:08,992
Here's why.

5
00:00:08,992 --> 00:00:14,330
First, it was sent from
the example dot net IP address.

6
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:20,720
Port 80 to our client IP address and
second.

7
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,690
It has a link that's not zero.

8
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:26,410
In fact, if we count up all the bytes
in the response we got from the server,

9
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:30,330
we'd see that it was exactly 321 bytes
long which perfectly matches what we see

10
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:31,380
here from tcp dump.
