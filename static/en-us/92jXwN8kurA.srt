1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:06,498
We saw before that x minus a is a factor of f of x if f of a equals 0. So that

2
00:00:06,498 --> 00:00:09,519
means we can test the constants that we came up with in the last quiz by

3
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:12,911
substituting them in for x here and seeing which ones of them gives us y equals

4
00:00:12,911 --> 00:00:17,319
0. So that it's clear what we're plugging in, I'm going to switch to function

5
00:00:17,319 --> 00:00:22,296
notation up here instead of using y. Let's make this f of x instead. Great, now

6
00:00:22,296 --> 00:00:25,784
it'll be very clear what numbers we're plugging in. Let's start with something

7
00:00:25,784 --> 00:00:30,350
from down here, maybe one, since that's first in the list. First tell me what f

8
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:34,070
of 1 equals, using this function, and then tell me whether or not that means

9
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:38,003
that x minus 1 is a factor of this function.
