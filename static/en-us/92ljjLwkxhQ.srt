1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:04,070
You know that merging and branching both have to do with commits, but

2
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:07,939
what kind of relationships does each of these ideas have with the commit.

3
00:00:07,939 --> 00:00:10,870
Branches are really just labels that refer to commits, so

4
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:15,790
we have this new kind of relationship, through first year relationship.

5
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:18,010
So this has to be branch.

6
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:19,890
Let's make sure this really makes sense.

7
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:23,560
Does diff really have an operates on relationship with branch?

8
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:24,700
Well, yes.

9
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:26,210
You can diff two commits or

10
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:29,430
you can diff two branches, which is basically just diff into two commits.

11
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:31,360
But they're sort of different ideas,

12
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:35,640
similarly you can run log on a branch or on a commit.

13
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,760
So this must mean that merge goes here.

14
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:42,440
So let's check this one, does merge operate on commits?

15
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,900
Well, yeah, merge takes two commits and

16
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:47,470
sort of smushes them together into a new commit.

17
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:49,700
So I think operates on is a pretty good description there.
