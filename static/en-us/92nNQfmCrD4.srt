00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:05,130
Now we need a way to quantify this and we do that much the same way that we

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:09,970
calculate the standard deviation. We take each residual, in other words the

3
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:16,340
observed minus expected value. We square them to get rid of negatives. That's

4
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:21,710
the same as finding the area of each of these squares. That essentially we find

5
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:26,490
the average square. But we correct for the fact that it's a sample, by dividing

6
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:33,800
by N-2, where N is the number of points. In this case there are six. And then

7
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:39,710
finally, we take the square root to put it back into terms of distance rather

8
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:44,840
than squared values. This is called the standard error of the estimate.
