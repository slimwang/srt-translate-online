00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,624
So here's the answer. We had to make two changes. The first was defining a new

2
00:00:03,624 --> 00:00:08,044
class and we defined a class called about, it provides a get method and all it's

3
00:00:08,044 --> 00:00:12,418
get method does is return the strain, this my udacious project. We also had to

4
00:00:12,418 --> 00:00:16,848
change the way we construct the web application and we added a new tuple. Here

5
00:00:16,848 --> 00:00:21,528
the regular expression 'dMatches just one string, the string slash about and

6
00:00:21,528 --> 00:00:26,280
it's associated with that about class and will call the get method when there's

7
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:30,550
a request to get about. The rest is the same, if this doesn't match, we'll try

8
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:34,580
to match this next pattern which will match any other request and use lucky

9
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:38,474
search. Note that the order of these things does matter. If we had them in

10
00:00:38,474 --> 00:00:42,244
reverse order, we'd never see the about page, because about would still match

11
00:00:42,244 --> 00:00:45,840
this regular expression, and would use the lucky search get method before

12
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,983
getting to about. That's why we need you to have about first.
