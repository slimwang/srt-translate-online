We can solve this problem like our other equations. First, we distribute the 2.

2
00:00:06,262 --> 00:00:11,855
2 times 90 is a 180, and 2 time negative x is negative 2 x. Here, I combine my

3
00:00:11,867 --> 00:00:17,715
like terms, we add 2 x to both sides and we get a 180 plus x equals a 190. So, x

4
00:00:17,727 --> 00:00:19,870
is equal to 10, or 10 degrees.
