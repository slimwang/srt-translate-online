00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,770
The problem with our code is that user
input gets put into a database query in

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:05,270
an unsafe way.

3
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:08,020
Some text submitted in the forum
ended up being considered as

4
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:09,890
SQL code instead of as a text value.

5
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:14,320
But there's another way to
do our query that's safe.

6
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,940
When we execute a query,
we can put a %s in the query text, and

7
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:22,460
then after it,
a tuple parameter to the execute call.

8
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:26,340
The database library will
substitute this into the query in

9
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:28,830
a way that's safe so
this problem will never happen again.

10
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:33,550
Using what you've just learned,
you can now update forumdb.py to

11
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:37,010
execute insert queries safely
using query parameters.

12
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:39,940
Test your work by checking that
you can now make posts with single

13
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:40,950
quotes in them and

14
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:45,140
that the SQL injection attack query
doesn't delete the whole forum anymore.

15
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:48,660
When you're done, press Submit,
then Continue to go on.
