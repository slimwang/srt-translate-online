00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,430
We've covered a lot in this lesson, from a high level view of why

2
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:05,220
a file system is useful, down to

3
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:08,330
implementation details and optimizations used in today's

4
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:11,270
sophisticated systems. If you keep these ideas

5
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:13,330
in mind, you've become a better programmer,

6
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:15,400
and appreciate the complexity behind the systems

7
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,480
we use every day. So long for now.
