1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,180
The first thing I want to do
is create an array of booleans

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:06,570
indicating whether each student
cancelled in the first week.

3
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:10,390
I'll call the array is_paid and it will
contain true for students who remained

4
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:14,050
enrolled for at least seven days before
cancelling and false for others.

5
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:17,580
I can create this array
using vectorized operations

6
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:20,520
by comparing the days_to_cancel
array to the value 7.

7
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,310
Then I'll create an array
called paid_time.

8
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:25,440
Which includes the time spent for
each student, but

9
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,910
only including paid students.

10
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:29,500
To keep only the paid students,

11
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:32,100
I'll us is paid as an index
array into time spent.

12
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:35,990
Finally I'll take the mean of
this array to get the mean time

13
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:38,290
spent by paid students.

14
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:42,140
And this code could actually all be
simplified down to a single line.

15
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:44,540
And again,
once you're used to index arrays and

16
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:48,930
vectorized operations, I think this
line of code is very clear and concise.

17
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:51,720
It says look at the time spent for
each student, but only for

18
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:54,810
students who stayed enrolled at
least seven days before cancelling.

19
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:56,210
And then take the mean of that time.
