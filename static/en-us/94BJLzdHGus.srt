00:00:00,171 --> 00:00:04,542
When you meet with your architects and you talk about, oh, let's design the next generation processor,

2
00:00:04,542 --> 00:00:08,880
what are really the design constraints that you think are at the top of the list?

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,528
Certainly, power's going to be number one for sure.

4
00:00:11,528 --> 00:00:15,438
Energy efficiency is always the number one design constraint.

5
00:00:15,438 --> 00:00:21,236
Very closely behind it, though, is programability and range of applications.

6
00:00:21,236 --> 00:00:23,928
Again, sports re-divergence is a good example of that.

7
00:00:23,928 --> 00:00:28,763
We want to have both a control structure and a memory system that will run diverge codes well

8
00:00:28,763 --> 00:00:31,064
because that'll give us a broader range of applications.

9
00:00:31,064 --> 00:00:36,207
Then we'll look at programability, and it's not just being able to write the program and get it to function.

10
00:00:36,207 --> 00:00:42,120
But to get a large fraction of the absolute performance you can get out of the machines without undue effort.

11
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:46,451
And a lot of this is removing performance surprises from the architecture.

12
00:00:46,451 --> 00:00:50,384
So that if you write the code in the very straightforward way, you'll actually get pretty good performance.

13
00:00:50,384 --> 00:00:52,785
It won't be awful and then you'll have to sit there,

14
00:00:52,785 --> 00:00:55,786
trying to deeply understand some obscure fact in the memory system

15
00:00:55,786 --> 00:00:58,327
to figure out why you've fallen off a performance cliff.

16
00:00:58,327 --> 00:01:01,295
And that's something that's changed really an enormous amount in the last 5 years.

17
00:01:01,295 --> 00:01:05,449
The cliffs for GPUs have historically been steeper than for CPUs,

18
00:01:05,449 --> 00:01:09,449
but they're getting much flatter as a result of the work you guys are doing.
