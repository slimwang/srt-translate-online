1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,050
Paul just showed you something
ridiculously awesome.

2
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:06,180
With the timeline, you can watch how
one piece of work causes another.

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:09,200
I mean, that's just amazing,
and so for this quiz,

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,130
I want you to load a timeline.

5
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:11,770
What?

6
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:13,480
Load a timeline you say?

7
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:14,722
You can do it pretty easily.

8
00:00:14,722 --> 00:00:18,540
Simply right-click in the timeline and
go to Save As to save one, or

9
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:20,420
Load to load a timeline.

10
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:25,040
Loading a timeline is a super easy
way to share and compare timelines.

11
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:27,690
In the downloadable section,
you can find this timeline.

12
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:30,410
Once you've got it,
simply right-click in any timeline and

13
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:32,110
then load it for yourself.

14
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:33,530
Once you've loaded the timeline,

15
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:38,600
see if you can figure out which function
caused initWebGLObjects() to run.

16
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,120
Type it into this box.

17
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:43,350
And finally, if this JavaScript
was called during an animation,

18
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:46,930
would it still be possible for the
animation to reach 60 frames per second?

19
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:47,810
Yes or no.
