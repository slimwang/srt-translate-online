1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:02,800
We want the FetchWeatherTask to return an array

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:05,520
of string forecasts. That means we need to

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,380
modify the return type of the async task.

4
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:12,630
Then in the doInBackground method, after we've read

5
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:15,390
in the input string, we perform this code.

6
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:20,200
We call the helper method getWeatherDataFromJson and we

7
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,660
pass in the forecastJson string as well as

8
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:25,475
the number of forecast days. We also catch

9
00:00:25,475 --> 00:00:30,180
any Json exceptions if there's a problem with parsing. We

10
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:33,080
wanted to verify that the string array of forecast data

11
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:37,960
is correct. So, within the getWeatherDataFromJson method, we added some

12
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:40,720
logging statements to print out each element of the array.
