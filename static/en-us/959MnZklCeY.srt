00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,872
The first property states that if we add 2 logarithm's together that have the

2
00:00:03,872 --> 00:00:09,250
same base then we can just multiply the numbers together. For example if we

3
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:14,180
have log base 2 of 4 plus log base 2 of 8 then we know that equals log base 2

4
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:21,746
of 4 times times, which equals 32. Now, this statement should make sense. We

5
00:00:21,746 --> 00:00:27,940
know that log 2 of 4 equals 2. And we know that log base two of 8 equals three.

6
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:33,795
So if we add those together, we should get 5. And sure enough, the log base 2

7
00:00:33,795 --> 00:00:39,328
of 32 equals 5. So whenever you add logarithms that have the same base, you can

8
00:00:39,328 --> 00:00:44,630
really just multiply these arguments together. We just multiply x times y and

9
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:49,070
then take the log of it. So let's see if you can extend this reasoning. If we

10
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:53,060
have log base b of j, plus log base b of a, plus log base b of m, what would

11
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:59,655
that equal, if we did the log base b of this expression? In other words what

12
00:00:59,655 --> 00:01:04,135
expression goes right here so that way the right-hand side of our equation is

13
00:01:04,135 --> 00:01:08,490
equal to the left-hand side of our equation.
