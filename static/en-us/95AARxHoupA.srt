00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:06,040
I like to think of intents as envelopes,
each one who includes who,

2
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:08,919
or in this case, which component 
you want it delivered to.

3
00:00:09,099 --> 00:00:12,040
And there's room for a small amount 
of data to be delivered,

4
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:14,509
packaged as extras.

5
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:19,540
Primitive tuples that will be 
available to the application component

6
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:22,140
that ultimately receives 
and opens this intent.

7
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:26,660
An explicit intent explicitly specifies 
the name of the recipient,

8
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:28,296
as you can see on this envelope.

9
00:00:28,566 --> 00:00:30,762
Implicit intents are a lot 
more interesting.

10
00:00:32,182 --> 00:00:34,410
Here, we don't specify 
the name of the class.

11
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:36,080
We don't even know what it is.

12
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:38,710
So, how do we indicate 
which activity to launch?

13
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:41,560
You know those stories you 
sometimes hear about letters

14
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:46,970
with fake addresses like these 
that somehow still find

15
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:48,566
their way to the recipient?

16
00:00:49,136 --> 00:00:52,492
Well the intent resolution system 
on Android works the same way,

17
00:00:54,492 --> 00:00:57,040
finding an activity
capable of performing the action

18
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,210
you specify on the associated data.

19
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:03,380
So, rather than specifying 
the name of a class, you indicate

20
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:05,540
an action you'd like 
an activity to perform,

21
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:08,420
and on what data that action 
should be performed.

22
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:13,100
Like this, where we want 
to address an activity

23
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:16,910
that's capable of viewing a website. 
And because intents can cross

24
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:19,890
through application boundaries, 
the activity that started

25
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:24,640
may not be part of your app. 
So, you can include functionality

26
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:30,350
like this, browsing websites 
or making phone calls

27
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:34,840
or choosing a contact 
from your address book,

28
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:38,256
all from within your app, 
without you having to implement

29
00:01:38,256 --> 00:01:39,432
any of it yourself.

30
00:01:41,032 --> 00:01:42,470
You don't even need 
to know about the app

31
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:45,940
that will ultimately service your request.
You can find details

32
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:48,190
of some of the intents 
supported by native apps

33
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:51,120
in Common Intents page 
of the Android developer site.
