00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:03,360
So now that we've decided to go
with a restful architecture for

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:06,200
our development needs,
what about the structure of our data?

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:09,857
XML and
JSON are two very viable options, so

4
00:00:09,857 --> 00:00:12,349
let's compare them side by side as well.

5
00:00:12,349 --> 00:00:15,182
XML was developed in 1997.

6
00:00:15,182 --> 00:00:17,681
It uses identifying tags
similar to HTML and

7
00:00:17,681 --> 00:00:20,120
provides a rigid way
of structuring data.

8
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:26,230
JSON was developed in 2001 and
is derived from the JavaScript language.

9
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:29,200
Similar to HTML,
it is easily human readable, but

10
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,960
can be condensed with less
characters to be very lightweight.

11
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,950
Once again, it seems like these specs
aren't really helping in making

12
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:38,380
a decision if one is
better than the other.

13
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:41,390
But since our APIs are made
to best suit the developer,

14
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:45,070
we should use a data structure that
is most friendly to our end user.

15
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:48,730
Looking at this chart, we can see that
XML started as the data structure of

16
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:52,920
choice, but JSON has been quickly
gaining ground year over year and

17
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,580
is now the more popular data
structure amongst new APIs.

18
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:59,430
By piggy backing off
the popularity of JavaScript,

19
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:02,410
JSON has been readily accepted
by the web development community

20
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:05,319
as the most common way to structure
data sent across restful APIs.

21
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:08,650
So for this course,
it's JSON for the win.
