Here are the answers for this quiz.

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:06,580
First off, the answer for Pipe and Filter is C, increased coupling.

3
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:09,560
This is because some changes, like the format of the data going through

4
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:13,670
the pipeline could affect all of the filters, reflecting their tight coupling.

5
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:19,380
The answer for Blackboard is D, can promote spread of bad data.

6
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:25,240
Because the blackboard is a common repository accessible by all components,

7
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:28,750
if it somehow gets contaminated this bad data could readily spread to

8
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:29,540
other components.

9
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:35,310
The answer for object orientation is A, increased system fragmentation.

10
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:39,490
Object orientation can increase system fragmentation because of

11
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:42,979
the many relatively small independent objects that may exist.

12
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:45,530
And finally the answer for

13
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:49,840
implicit invocation is B, reduced system understanding.

14
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,400
This happens because server components are not aware of clients which can

15
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,360
change dynamically.
