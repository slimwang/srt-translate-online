00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:04,822
What if instead, we wanted a function identical to y equals 1 half to the x,

2
00:00:04,822 --> 00:00:11,100
but we wanted it to contain the point 3, 1? Remember that this function

3
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:16,381
contains the point 0, 1. Which function do you think fits this description? A

4
00:00:16,381 --> 00:00:21,439
hint again. Think about what transformation you would need to do to move the

5
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:27,270
point 0, 1 to the point 3, 1. What substitution would you need to make in this

6
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:30,391
equation to perform that transformation?
