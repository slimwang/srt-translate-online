00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:02,977
When the word texture is used in the real world it is usually used to mean the

2
00:00:02,977 --> 00:00:07,202
feel of cloth or perhaps the roughness of a material. In computer graphics the

3
00:00:07,202 --> 00:00:10,530
word texture refers to any pattern or image applied to a surface to change its

4
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:15,500
color, shininess or just about any other part of its appearance. In one sense

5
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:19,327
adding a texture to a surface is another form of modeling. You're specifying

6
00:00:19,327 --> 00:00:22,267
the color, roughness or reflectivity of the object based on its surface

7
00:00:22,267 --> 00:00:27,130
location. The most popular way to add a texture to a surface is to use images.

8
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:30,920
Any 2D image can be applied to a surface. In these lessons, we'll delve into

9
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:34,592
how these images are attached to objects. And the various ways to control their

10
00:00:34,592 --> 00:00:38,090
display. Another important use for textures is to act as surrounding

11
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:41,620
environments. While it can be expensive to attempt to have objects reflect

12
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:45,322
other objects in a scene. It turns out to be extremely fast to reflect textures

13
00:00:45,322 --> 00:00:49,889
representing a whole environment. There are some limiations, but surfaces can

14
00:00:49,889 --> 00:00:54,010
be made to look much more realistic and visually rich by this simple addition.

15
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:58,372
Even an approximation of refraction can be done with this type of technique. In

16
00:00:58,372 --> 00:01:01,270
this unit I'll provide you with the basics of how various forms of texturing

17
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:04,319
works. I'll also be taking you on a tour of some of the major effects

18
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:08,395
achievable with textures. I won't be explaining all of these in detail. The

19
00:01:08,395 --> 00:01:12,660
good news is, the code for almost all the demos you'll see are part of 3JS.

20
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:15,243
This gives you the ability to easily prod and poke at these various effects,

21
00:01:15,243 --> 00:01:19,774
and see what makes them tick. I strongly encourage you to do so. I did this

22
00:01:19,774 --> 00:01:24,182
myself in creating some of these lessons, and it was a lot of fun.
