1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,786
Now what I'd like you to do is factor our expression X minus 4 squared minus 1

2
00:00:04,786 --> 00:00:09,749
in this way, like we can with all differences of squares. Remembering what A

3
00:00:09,749 --> 00:00:14,429
equaled and what B equaled in the last quiz, write this as A minus B times A

4
00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:14,911
plus B.
