00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:05,860
Before diving more deeply into the modeling and verification process of our

2
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:10,620
connected cars data, let us take a detour and think about

3
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:15,220
the various models that we have talked about in the previous lessons.

4
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:21,950
In models in natural sciences, many simplifying assumptions are made.

5
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:25,430
About the system under investigation, so

6
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:31,190
that it is possible to arrive at some mathematical expression of the phenomenon.

7
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:35,120
This gives us a way of understanding the phenomenon and

8
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:40,970
modeling the observed data in light of this fundamental understanding.

9
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:46,000
Complexity is often introduced as additional layers in terms of

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,610
perturbations or dissipative effects.

11
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:54,900
We will start looking at how to split the data before we do so.

12
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:58,890
Let's investigate what are the characteristics of models.

13
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:01,770
We just talked about mathematical models,

14
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:07,500
such as what are used in the natural sciences, economics, medicine, etc.

15
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,540
Part of what we do in natural sciences or

16
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:14,160
mathematical models, involves point estimation.

17
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:18,420
That is to calculate the value of certain quantity very, very well.

18
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:22,150
Sometimes, we might have a multi parameter model, and

19
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:25,340
we want to make a good fit to the parameters.

20
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:31,170
Often, the generalization of the model is inherently built into the model.

21
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:35,740
The immediate goal of such a model is to fit the data as best as possible,

22
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:39,640
with the underlying assumption that the mathematical structure of the model,

23
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:43,010
in itself, helps to make the model generally applicable.

24
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:45,590
On the other hand we have data driven models.

25
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:49,470
These are models used in statistical and machine learning techniques.

26
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:54,000
And they have very wide applicability in sciences engineering computer

27
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,380
science etc.

28
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:59,970
In this case we train on data from a very complex phenomenon.

29
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:04,110
And the generalization to new data from similar phenomenon needs to

30
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:06,290
be explicit, understanding.

31
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:09,580
So you see, the simplifying assumptions in your model for

32
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:14,400
the data driven case aids in computation, whereas, the simplified assumptions in

33
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,600
a mathematical model aids in understanding of the basic phenomenon.

34
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:23,320
The goal in the data driven models is to learn the underlying patterns of

35
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:27,810
the phenomenon directly from the data using appropriate algorithms.

36
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:30,140
These algorithms are then tuned so

37
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:33,910
that they are useful in general toward solving similar problems.

38
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:38,270
In most cases we want to make sure that the model is not over trained on

39
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:43,320
the data and does not overfit the training data but also generalize the new data
