00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Okay, let's make some changes to this file.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
The first thing we're going to do is we're going to get rid of this Google action

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and replace it with /testform, and now that's going to cause

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
our form when we submit it to submit to /testform instead of to Google.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
And since our application can only respond to slash,

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
we're going to need to add a handler for that as well.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
We'll come down here to our URL handler section,

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and because we only have a handler for slash,

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
we're going to add another handler for /testform.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
/testform will be handled by the handler called TestHandler, which doesn't exist yet.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Let's create that.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Okay, so we've added this new handler called TestHandler.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
This also has a method on it called get, like our other handler,

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
and what this does is it sets a variable called q,

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
which comes from self.request.

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Like response is the object that represents the response

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
we're going to send back to the client, request represents the request

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
that came from the browser, and you can call get on it to get different parameters,

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
so in this case we're going to get the parameter q.

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
And then all we're going to do is we're going to turn on the response

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
self.response.out.write(q).

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
So if we go to our browser,

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
we enter some words, and we hit submit,

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
we see the string hello world!

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
You can see in the URL q = hello World! which is what we answered,

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
so this is hitting the same URL we were hitting before,

27
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
but this time there's a web application on the other end

28
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
listening for requests and returning responses.

29
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
The exclamation mark turned into a %21.

30
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
That was the escaping I was referring to before.

31
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Okay, now I'd like to make another change.

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I'm going to comment out these 2 lines and show you something neat.

33
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'm going to take this content-type line from up here

34
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
because we want to print some text, and we want it to work properly.

35
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,000
This time, instead of writing out q, I'm going to write out self-request itself.

36
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Okay, let's go to our browser and try this out.

37
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Here's our form.

38
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You may have to go back to URL and reload. That's fine.

39
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Type some text in the form and click submit.

40
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
When you click submit, what just happened?

41
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Did you see garbage?

42
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Did you see the HTTP request?

43
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Do you see a message from the future, or nothing happens at all?
