00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,350
There are some cool things that you can do when you

2
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:08,648
find the fundamental matrices that relate different views to each other, okay?

3
00:00:08,648 --> 00:00:09,560
Because essentially,

4
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:12,120
you can figure out which points correspond to which other points.

5
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:17,110
One, which is really kind of interesting, is, suppose I've

6
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:21,460
got a pair of views of a scene, and what I'd like to do is do some stereo.

7
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:25,930
And I know that if I solve for the fundamental matrix, I could, for every point,

8
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:28,780
I could find the epipole that's along and search along that.

9
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:32,240
But of course, every point lands on different epipolar line.

10
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:36,990
What you can do is what's called image rectification or stereo rectification.

11
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:43,150
Where you take your original image and be, if you find the fundamental matrix,

12
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:47,220
you can essentially unwarp, maybe that's not the right word.

13
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:49,030
Just rectify is the right word.

14
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:52,230
So, it's as if the two images were

15
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:56,080
taken with parallel image planes that are aligned.

16
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,414
And why is that good?

17
00:00:57,414 --> 00:00:59,010
Because it makes me happy.

18
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:03,160
No, it's good because you can get publi, no, it's good because then it

19
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:08,400
means your stereo solution now is just moving along the, the horizontal line.

20
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,320
So your search is not just 1D, because it was 1D before.

21
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,780
But it's a particular known one dimensional search.

22
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:17,590
Namely, every point here corresponds somewhere along the corresponding scan line

23
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:18,860
of the other image.

24
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:22,840
And that was done nicely comes from this paper here shown in 1999,

25
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:26,980
showing you a real example that they did that comes from their paper.

26
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:30,510
Here you see two images taken from

27
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:34,320
radically different views of this very weird sculpture.

28
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,250
The lines that are drawn on there are the epipolar lines, and

29
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:40,434
you'll notice they're skewed, and they they go off this way.

30
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:44,810
All right, after you do the stereo rectification by finding the fundamental

31
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:49,360
matrix, you get horizontal epipolar lines, which was the whole point, and

32
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,436
allows you to do the stereo algorithm.
