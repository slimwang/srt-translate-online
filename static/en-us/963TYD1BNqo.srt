1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,860
To get ready for creating the tag,
we first need to create two triggers.

2
00:00:04,939 --> 00:00:06,920
I'll start with the trigger
of the open screen event.

3
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:09,030
So, go to triggers, new.

4
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:12,810
I'm going to call my
trigger open screen, and

5
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:14,510
I want it to fire on an event.

6
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:17,450
So, you choose event from fire on.

7
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:20,540
I want it to fire when the event equals

8
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:23,180
openScreen because that's
what we put in our code.

9
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:27,530
So you see here in the code
it was openScreen, so

10
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:30,270
I want the event to equal openScreen.

11
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:34,820
So the mapOf method
defines the values for

12
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:40,290
DataLayer variables and the name of
the event is the first argument here.

13
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,700
And don't forget to save the trigger.

14
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:45,840
So we've defined the trigger for
the openScreen event.

15
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,450
But we don't have a trigger yet
specifically for

16
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:51,050
the show daily specials screen.

17
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:53,200
So I'm going to create that now.

18
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:56,540
New trigger, I'm going to
call it Daily Special Screen.

19
00:00:56,540 --> 00:01:01,730
And I want it to fire when
the screen name equals,

20
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:06,560
whatever it was I put in my code,
which was Show Daily Special.

21
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,310
And in fact, I'm just going to copy and
paste it from here.

22
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:12,390
Now we could have created one trigger

23
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:16,290
that was fired by the two
separate conditions.

24
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:19,450
But keeping the triggers
separated like this allows for

25
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:22,750
more flexibility when
we're creating our tags.

26
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:28,320
Okay, now we're ready to create the tag
was fired by the open screen event for

27
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,290
the show daily special activity.

28
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:31,120
Create a tag.

29
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,400
New.

30
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:37,750
Okay, we want this tag to
send an Analytics hit, so

31
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:40,390
I'm just going to be fairly
explicit in my name.

32
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:42,400
Call it Send Daily Special Screen Hit.

33
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,720
You can call it what you like.

34
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,610
Choose product, must be Analytics.

35
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:50,740
And then you're going to need the
tracking ID for your analytics account.

36
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:52,550
There's two ways to get it.

37
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:58,240
You can go to the Admin tab in Google
analytics, go to your Tracking Code and

38
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:04,520
then you get your Tracking ID from here,
or in Android Studio in your

39
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:10,144
tracking configuration file for
analytics, you get the ga_trackingId.

40
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:13,640
Assuming you set it correctly that is.

41
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:19,100
Anyway, whichever way you do it, get
the value and go back to tag manager.

42
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:23,428
Now you could just copy it right in
here, but we're not going to do that.

43
00:02:23,428 --> 00:02:25,655
Instead, we're going to
create a variable so

44
00:02:25,655 --> 00:02:28,415
that we don't have to look it
up again next time we need it.

45
00:02:28,415 --> 00:02:33,185
So we click on the building brick,
scroll down to new, choose constant

46
00:02:33,185 --> 00:02:37,710
because this time our variable is
a constant, give it an appropriate name.

47
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:38,380
And set the value.

48
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,600
And then create the variable.

49
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,350
And there, the variable's created.

50
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:47,022
And you notice now here we're back
in the create the tag screen.

51
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:49,910
And you've got the variable
My Tracking ID.

52
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:53,700
And notice that the variable begins and
ends with curly braces.

53
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:58,440
And anywhere you see this
building block, you can insert or

54
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,970
create a variable.

55
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:02,260
Anyway, back to creating our new tag.

56
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:07,300
So the default track type for analytics
is App View and that's what we want.

57
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:10,390
So just make sure that
you see App View here.

58
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:13,340
An App View hit sends
a Screen View hit to analytics.

59
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:17,180
The only parameter it takes is
the screen name, which is required.

60
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:24,000
So you need to click More settings
> Fields to Set > Add Field.

61
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,250
And then click not on the brick but
in the field itself.

62
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:28,970
And select screenName.

63
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:33,330
This is not the variable enclosed in
double braces, it's just screenName.

64
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:38,120
This is required for
App view or screen View hits.

65
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:42,210
And then the value, click on
the brick and choose screenName.

66
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:44,640
This one is the variable
that you defined.

67
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:50,300
And continue and then you need to
decide when you want it to fire.

68
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:53,960
So click Custom and there's two
conditions that we want it to fire.

69
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:57,250
We want it to fire when the event

70
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:02,150
equals open screen which would
be the open screen trigger.

71
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:07,220
And we want it to fire when the screen
name equals Show Daily Special.

72
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:08,490
So we'll choose that one.

73
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:11,610
And we'll save and we'll create the tag.

74
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:16,790
Save the tag and that's it we're done.

75
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:18,550
>> You forgot something.

76
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:20,750
>> What, what did I forget?

77
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,430
Oops, yes it's easy to forget.

78
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:25,950
You have to publish your changes
before they can take effect.

79
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:29,490
Go ahead and create a tag to send the
hits to analytics when someone goes to

80
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:31,980
the daily specials screen in the act.

81
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:35,170
You'll need to create the open
screen trigger and a trigger for

82
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:37,210
when the screen name is daily special.

83
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:41,450
And then you'll need to create
the tag to send the hit to analytics.

84
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:45,390
And while you're creating a tag go ahead
and create a variable to hold your

85
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:51,430
analytics account I.D. Publish your
changes and restart and run the App.

86
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:55,990
So if you've got your phone for your
tablet whatever device you are using.

87
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:57,750
Connected to Android studio,

88
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:00,600
you can look in the logs
to see the hits being sent.

89
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:05,000
And for that you must have bugging for
tag manager enabled.

90
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,780
And search for hits, and here we see
that an, the application name is

91
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:13,300
What's for dinner, cd stands for
content description.

92
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:15,680
In this case it's Show Daily Special.

93
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,640
The language is English,
and t equals appview, and

94
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,500
that's a type of hit that's being sent.

95
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:24,910
And then you should also see the t ID,
which is the account ID.

96
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:27,130
As you try out your app and

97
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:30,510
particularly as you go through the show
daily special activity, you should be

98
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:35,160
able to see the data showing up in
a real-time dashboard in analytics.

99
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,960
You see I've got my top screen
name as Show Daily Special.

100
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,850
So, go ahead and do these things,
create the triggers, create the tag,

101
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:44,940
create the variable, restart and
run the app, check the logs,

102
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:48,110
check real time analytics and
check the boxes as your done.
