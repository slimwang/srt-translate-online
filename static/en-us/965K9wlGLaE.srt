1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:05,730
The steps of putting data in the data
layer are, get the tag manager instance

2
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:09,110
and you do that calling get
instance on the tag manager.

3
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:11,280
Then, get the data layer and

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,880
you do that calling getDataLayer
on your tag manager instance.

5
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:19,570
And then you put a key/value
pair in the Data Layer.

6
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:24,960
And you do that calling push on the Data
Layer, specifying the key and the value.

7
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,450
For example,
if the key is food_pref, And

8
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:31,510
values "vegan",
this is how you would do it.

9
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:32,580
That's all fairly simple.

10
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:39,580
And when the values in the data layer,
you get it out using "dataLayer.get".

11
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:44,290
For example, you just call "get",
specifying "food_pref" as the key.

12
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:47,990
When the values in the data layer can
also be used in tag manager triggers.

13
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:50,810
And we're going to look
into how to do that.

14
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:52,810
In lesson one, we use the what's for

15
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:58,330
dinner button to display the users food
preferences before suggesting a dinner.

16
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:02,390
You're now going to use a similar
menu to set the food preferences.

17
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:03,630
The daily special.

18
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:06,890
Your tasks are in main activity,

19
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:11,810
to find a new method putFoodPref in
Data Layer, which takes a menu item.

20
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:17,460
And this method puts a value for
food pref in the data layer.

21
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:23,360
And this table shows the menu item value
and the data layer value to put in.

22
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,880
And the key is always food pref.

23
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:30,770
And then update the existing
show daily special method

24
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:32,800
to display the food pref's pop up menu.

25
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:36,890
And then you'll need to set
the old click listener to call

26
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:42,350
the putFoodPrefin DataLayer method and
to start the ShowDailySpecialActivity.

27
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:45,350
You can find the code for
creating the PopupMenu

28
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:48,980
in the showFoodPrefsMenu
method in MainActivity.

29
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:52,390
This method pops up
the food preferences menu.

30
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:56,590
And then uses the food preference
to get dinner suggestion.

31
00:01:56,590 --> 00:02:01,210
However, we want to get the daily
special, not the dinner suggestion.

32
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:05,060
So you'll need to copy and
modify the code to suit your needs.

33
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:09,758
So go ahead and do these steps now and
then deploy your app.

34
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:12,590
You won't see any changes in
the way the app behaves yet.

35
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:16,830
Next we'll add triggers in tag manager
to make use of the data layer variable,

36
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:18,690
and that's when you'll see
the changes in your app.
