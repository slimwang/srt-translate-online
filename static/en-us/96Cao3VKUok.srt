1
00:00:00,242 --> 00:00:02,998
And, here’s how I calculate it. These spheres

2
00:00:02,998 --> 00:00:05,832
over here are all of the same volume. Since

3
00:00:05,832 --> 00:00:08,399
they have to add up to 1, each of those has

4
00:00:08,399 --> 00:00:11,246
exactly a third. Now, let’s start with the right

5
00:00:11,246 --> 00:00:14,615
one. If this is a third in terms of area and we

6
00:00:14,615 --> 00:00:18,846
have to cover 12 hours, then B equals to A

7
00:00:18,846 --> 00:00:25,533
third times 12 which is 0.0277. The one on

8
00:00:25,533 --> 00:00:29,391
the left is exactly twice the size, 0.0555

9
00:00:29,392 --> 00:00:33,392
which is two-thirds times 12, it’s 1/18th.
