1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:02,440
So here's a mapping app
that I've already created.

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:05,480
This one is identical to all the others
that you've been using throughout this

3
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:06,440
course.

4
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:09,550
It has a single view and
there's a map fragment on that view.

5
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:14,040
The Gradle file is set up for
the play-services libraries.

6
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:17,830
And the manifest file is set up
in the usual way with OpenGL,

7
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:21,950
with the services libraries, with the
API key, and with the permissions that I

8
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:27,530
want to use, internet access network
state and write external storage.

9
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:29,870
And of course on my
Google Developers Console,

10
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:33,030
as I showed you earlier on,
I've configured this API for

11
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:36,150
access through that API key and
the API key is here.

12
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:38,380
Now let's take a look
at the main activity.

13
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:42,180
So in my main activity class I've just
created a number of local variables

14
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:46,625
of marker options type and I just named
them after the various rinks, renton,

15
00:00:46,625 --> 00:00:49,300
kirkland, everett, lynnwood,
montlake, kent and showare.

16
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:52,660
I've also created a camera
position that I called Seattle,

17
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:55,710
which is just the default
camera position that I'm using

18
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:58,220
when the application actually launches.

19
00:00:58,220 --> 00:00:59,740
Then, in my uncreate function,

20
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:04,050
I called the marker options in the way
that I had demonstrated on the slide.

21
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:07,050
So, for example, Renton is new
marker options with the latitude and

22
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:09,790
longitude of Renton and
the title Renton.

23
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:13,040
I was able to get the latitudes and
longitudes for each of the rinks

24
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,230
using the technique that I showed
earlier on just using Google Maps,

25
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:19,310
dropping a pin and reading
the latitude and longitude from them.

26
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:22,500
So I've set up all of my marker
options for all of my rinks.

27
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,370
And then in my onMapReady function, so

28
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:28,690
remember the onMapReady callback
gets called when the map is ready,

29
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:33,490
because I've implemented onMapReady
callback in my activity.

30
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:38,420
So when the onMapReady gets called,
I simply add all the markers to my maps

31
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:43,240
so, m map dot add marker Renton and
map dot add marker Kirkland, etcetera.

32
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:46,408
I add them all and
then I call fly to Seattle.

33
00:01:46,408 --> 00:01:49,320
And the flyTo function is very similar
to the one you saw in the previous

34
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:52,940
demo except this time I'm just moving
the camera, I'm not animating it.

35
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:54,870
So then I'm just going to
fly to Seattle and

36
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:56,930
I'm just going to jump
into that location.

37
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:59,760
I haven't put any flyTo
to the particular rinks.

38
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,740
The only time flyTo has been
called in this application

39
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:05,550
is right at the beginning,
when I say flyTo(SEATTLE).

40
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:08,008
And the only time that the flyTo
function's called is, of course,

41
00:02:08,008 --> 00:02:10,190
in the on mapReady
when I flyTo(SEATTLE).

42
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:13,065
So that would just give me a default
view, looking at Seattle in

43
00:02:13,065 --> 00:02:16,110
the location where we could see
all of the rinks on the same map.

44
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:19,082
So, I had moved the camera to
the appropriate location to allow me to

45
00:02:19,082 --> 00:02:22,700
do that, and that was the camera
that was defined as Seattle.

46
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:26,240
As you can see here,
with the latitude/longitude, zoom of 10,

47
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:29,460
bearing of 0, so I'm looking straight
down, and a tilt of 45 degrees.

48
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:32,130
That was pretty simple, right?

49
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:34,340
And in the next step here, you're
actually going to build a custom marker,

50
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:36,520
so you're not going to use
the default marker pen.

51
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:39,610
You can create your own marker,
for example, a hockey player.

52
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:42,810
But before we get to that, let's have a
little quiz about using markers on maps.
