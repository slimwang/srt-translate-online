1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,390
So we wanted to find out
what was the highest and

2
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:05,070
lowest ports so
we could listen on using Netcat.

3
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:06,658
Let's start with the lowest.

4
00:00:06,658 --> 00:00:07,780
Let's try 2048.

5
00:00:15,234 --> 00:00:19,260
It looks like listening on
port 2048 works just fine.

6
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:22,181
Let's try a much lower port 100,
permission denied, okay,

7
00:00:22,181 --> 00:00:23,900
that's interesting.

8
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:28,632
If we do a little searching in this
direction, we'll find out that we

9
00:00:28,632 --> 00:00:33,708
can't listen on port 1023 but
we can listen on port 1024, cool.

10
00:00:33,708 --> 00:00:35,730
What happens in the other direction?

11
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:45,550
Suppose we'd heard listening on
port 9999 Looks like that works.

12
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:48,138
How about port 65535?

13
00:00:48,138 --> 00:00:49,218
That works, too.

14
00:00:49,218 --> 00:00:51,170
How about 128000?

15
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:55,950
Says here nc, port number too large,
when we went to connect to it.

16
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:57,806
So regardless of what
happened over here,

17
00:00:57,806 --> 00:01:01,528
it doesn't look like we're actually
able to usefully listen on port 128000.

18
00:01:01,528 --> 00:01:06,269
If we kept on experimenting, we'd find
that actually 65535 is the largest

19
00:01:06,269 --> 00:01:09,300
port number we can listen on usefully.

20
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:12,540
But it's interesting that
the error that we got at 65536 and

21
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:16,940
the error that we got at
1023 were not the same.

22
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:19,022
They didn't even show
up in the same window.

23
00:01:19,022 --> 00:01:24,700
Plus, with this 1023 being too low,
that's kind of odd because we know that

24
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:30,180
the SSH server in the web server listen
on ports below 1024, like 22 and 80.

25
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:33,608
So how come they can but nc can't?

26
00:01:33,608 --> 00:01:34,400
Let's look into that.
