00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,401
So, here are the two equations that we've come up with so far. One equation for

2
00:00:04,401 --> 00:00:08,821
the amount of money that Grant has left after a given amount of time and another

3
00:00:08,821 --> 00:00:13,105
equation for the total amount of money he spent depending on how many months

4
00:00:13,105 --> 00:00:17,638
have passed since he's been in business. One thing that we can notice about

5
00:00:17,638 --> 00:00:22,084
these two equations is that money spent is involved in both of them. Now,

6
00:00:22,084 --> 00:00:27,024
remember that what an equation means is that whatever appears on one side of it

7
00:00:27,024 --> 00:00:32,033
is exactly equal to what appears on the other side. So since we know something

8
00:00:32,033 --> 00:00:36,973
about what money spent is equal to, anywhere we see money spent in any equation

9
00:00:36,973 --> 00:00:41,857
in the system, we can replace it with what we know it's equal to. Which is this,

10
00:00:41,857 --> 00:00:46,746
the number of money spent each month times the number of months. So taking this

11
00:00:46,746 --> 00:00:51,168
idea of substituting in values for other things that we know that they're equal

12
00:00:51,168 --> 00:00:55,414
to. Which answer down here would give us another way of writing out how much

13
00:00:55,414 --> 00:00:59,693
money we know that Grant has left? I know that this is a lot of writing to have

14
00:00:59,693 --> 00:01:04,226
on the screen at one time, so not a problem at all if this looks confusing. Just

15
00:01:04,226 --> 00:01:06,619
give the quiz a try and we'll see what happens.
