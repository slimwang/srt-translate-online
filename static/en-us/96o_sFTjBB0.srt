1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,210
Just as you can create a reflection vector to perform reflection mapping, you

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:06,042
can also create a refraction vector, and use that instead to access the

3
00:00:06,042 --> 00:00:09,900
environment map. This can be combined with the color of the object to get

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:13,562
different variation of a material that looks a fair bit like glass. Snell's

5
00:00:13,562 --> 00:00:17,843
Law's what's normally used for computing the refraction direction. It's named

6
00:00:17,843 --> 00:00:20,992
after Willebrord Snellius, a Dutch astronomer and mathematician from the 17th

7
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:25,338
century. However, it turns out that Ibn Sahl, a Persian mathematician,

8
00:00:25,338 --> 00:00:30,616
discovered this back in 984 A.D. This is an old formula and is as follows. In

9
00:00:30,616 --> 00:00:33,196
this diagram, we have a ray of light traveling through, say, the air, and

10
00:00:33,196 --> 00:00:37,958
hitting a transparent object, say, made of glass. In this equation, N1 and N2

11
00:00:37,958 --> 00:00:42,000
are the index refraction of the air and glass respectively. The index of

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,038
refraction is a physical value for a material that is essentially how much

13
00:00:45,038 --> 00:00:49,661
slower light travels through it compared to light in a vacuum. As examples,

14
00:00:49,661 --> 00:00:53,872
here are some indexes of refraction. Air is just about 1, it's very close to

15
00:00:53,872 --> 00:00:57,904
vacuum. Diamond is very different than glass and so that's one thing that

16
00:00:57,904 --> 00:01:01,940
differentiates them. When the index of the refraction of the second material is

17
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:04,819
greater than the first the effect is that the sine of the angle must be smaller

18
00:01:04,819 --> 00:01:09,932
to compensate. This means the angle from the normal becomes smaller. In other

19
00:01:09,932 --> 00:01:14,275
words, light bends towards the normal when going from air to glass. The effect

20
00:01:14,275 --> 00:01:17,985
is reversed when going in the other direction. Going from glass to air causes

21
00:01:17,985 --> 00:01:22,292
the light to bend at a greater angle. This is what refraction mapping does. It

22
00:01:22,292 --> 00:01:25,790
changes the direction of the light passing through the transparent object.

23
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:28,606
However, real objects have at least two refraction events when light passes

24
00:01:28,606 --> 00:01:32,730
through them, both when entering and exiting the surface. Refraction mapping

25
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:36,503
does just the one refraction. Refraction mapping is not quite as convincing as

26
00:01:36,503 --> 00:01:40,174
reflection mapping, in my opinion. Part of the reason is that the distortions

27
00:01:40,174 --> 00:01:43,832
produced are not as complex as the real thing. More importantly, all that you

28
00:01:43,832 --> 00:01:47,353
can ever see through these transparent objects is the environment map. Nothing

29
00:01:47,353 --> 00:01:50,588
else. Notice that with the spheres demo, lovely as it is, that you can't see

30
00:01:50,588 --> 00:01:54,320
any spheres through any other spheres. It's possible to make this happen, but

31
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,170
it is a lot of extra computation.
