If you got 4x squared plus 12x plus 9, excellent work. We know that first

2
00:00:04,772 --> 00:00:10,212
rectangle is actually a square, each side is 2x, so, 2x times 2x is 4x squared,

3
00:00:10,212 --> 00:00:15,515
this rectangle would be 2x times 3, which should be 6x. The same is true for

4
00:00:15,515 --> 00:00:21,030
this rectangle,, 2x times 3 makes 6x. And finally for this last rectangle, we

5
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:26,504
would have 3 times 3, for each of these sides which makes 9. When we multiply 2x

6
00:00:26,504 --> 00:00:31,846
plus 3 by itself, we end up with this perfect square. This perfect square has an

7
00:00:31,846 --> 00:00:37,094
area of 4x squared plus 12x plus 9, which we know isn't equal to 4x squared plus

8
00:00:37,094 --> 00:00:41,618
9. So to answer our original question, no, these are not equal. All the way back

9
00:00:41,618 --> 00:00:46,440
from unit 1, we said that squares can't distribute over sums or differences. If

10
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:50,594
we only squared the first term and the last term, we miss out on these middle

11
00:00:50,594 --> 00:00:54,547
terms of 6x, these are considered to be linear terms, they only have one

12
00:00:54,547 --> 00:00:58,938
variable with an exponent of 1. I now it's really easy just to think about

13
00:00:58,938 --> 00:01:03,423
squaring each of these terms to get this answer, but in this case, the math goes

14
00:01:03,423 --> 00:01:07,529
against our intuition, it's not true. This is what makes learning math

15
00:01:07,529 --> 00:01:11,702
interesting, and sometimes the patterns aren't exactly what they seem.
