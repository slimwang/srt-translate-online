00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,367
So far, we've been dealing with quadratic polynomials, like x squared plus 5 x

2
00:00:04,367 --> 00:00:08,473
plus 6, to figure out how to factor this. We've been looking for two numbers

3
00:00:08,473 --> 00:00:12,633
that add to equal the middle term coefficient, and multiply to equal the final

4
00:00:12,633 --> 00:00:16,859
coefficient. So, in the case of this polynomial, we end up with 2 and 3 as our

5
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:21,178
two coefficients. What if I told you, though, that this quantity a,b, in other

6
00:00:21,178 --> 00:00:25,402
words, the product of the two numbers that add to equal the middle coefficient,

7
00:00:25,402 --> 00:00:29,771
is also equal to the product of two coefficients from the original expression.

8
00:00:29,771 --> 00:00:34,012
Let's just play around with this for a second, though. I'm going to name each of

9
00:00:34,012 --> 00:00:38,766
the coefficients of each term in this three term expression A, B, and C. So, A

10
00:00:38,766 --> 00:00:44,211
in this case is 1, B is 5, and C is 6. So before we found the two numbers that

11
00:00:44,211 --> 00:00:49,073
add to equal this term, they were 2 and 3. But what if I told you that these

12
00:00:49,073 --> 00:00:54,001
multiply to equal not just this final term, but actually the product of two of

13
00:00:54,001 --> 00:00:59,390
the coefficients in this expression over here. So the two numbers we found to

14
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:05,647
equal this coefficient B, multiply to equal what? Do they multiply to equal A

15
00:01:05,647 --> 00:01:09,536
squared, B squared, C squared, AB, BC, or AC?
