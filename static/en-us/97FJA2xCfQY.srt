00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,228
Now that you've finished coding, let's
take a look at the code that I wrote.

2
00:00:03,228 --> 00:00:06,520
For the multiply_coefficient_and_row
function,

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:09,630
I have to make sure to multiply both
the coefficients of the variables in

4
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:13,327
the equation represented by
the plane's normal_vector and

5
00:00:13,327 --> 00:00:16,560
the constant_term by the same
multiplicative factor.

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,880
Notice that I make a new plane
object here instead of just altering

7
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:23,570
the normal_vector and constant_term
of the current plane object.

8
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:27,540
If I had altered the existing plane,
I'd need to reset the plane's base point

9
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:31,400
attribute as well or
else I would introduce some subtle bugs.

10
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:35,000
Finally, for the
add_multiple_times_row_to_row function,

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,140
I again make sure to add the appropriate
amount to both the normal vector and

12
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:40,280
the constant term.

13
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:44,210
Finally, I make a new plane to
replace the plane currently existing

14
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:46,800
in the slot, row to be added to.

15
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,400
When I scroll down to the test code and
run it, I get no output from the tests,

16
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:54,650
since the tests only output
anything if they fail,

17
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:56,690
that means my code passed all the tests.
