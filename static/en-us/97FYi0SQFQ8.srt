1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,708
So I mentioned earlier, it's this kind of thing that can really make

2
00:00:02,708 --> 00:00:05,300
you want to tear your hair out. As you can see, I've been in

3
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:09,910
lots of these situations. Okay, so we're facing a challenging situation, in that

4
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:12,550
we've got to do some scraping from a site that's really making us work

5
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:16,670
for it. Let's talk about a best practice for screen scraping. So the

6
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:19,040
first thing we want to do here is as I mentioned is, look

7
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:23,060
at how the browser itself makes requests. And with the developer tools, we

8
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:25,530
have quite a few ways in which we can do that. We can also

9
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:27,680
look at the wire traffic if we really needed to

10
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,030
using something like Wireshark. Then we want to emulate that

11
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:33,990
in our code. Now if everything blows up, we're going to

12
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:35,980
need to take a look at our HTTP traffic in some

13
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:39,210
way. And then just return to one and work through

14
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:41,950
this again until we get it right. If we follow this

15
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:45,060
process, we have a pretty effective strategy, for dealing with any

16
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:48,080
problems we have making requests from sites we'd like to scrape.
