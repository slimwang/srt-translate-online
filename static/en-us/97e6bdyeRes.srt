1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:03,630
Okay let's look at the solution for this. So the question is in what cycle is

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:09,315
this instruction dispatched? Well, that instruction is waiting for ROB1.

3
00:00:09,315 --> 00:00:15,370
ROB1 is going to be broadcasting cycle 12, value four will be broadcast then and

4
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:20,540
at that point, we will also dispatch this. Remember that when we capture a value

5
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:23,390
and that's the last value, that's the cycle in which we dispatch and

6
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:27,940
we begin executing in the following cycle. So, the cycle in which we dispatch,

7
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:30,980
the cycle 12 because that's when we captured the result, and

8
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:36,329
this instruction, the ROB4 instruction, begins executing in cycle 13.
