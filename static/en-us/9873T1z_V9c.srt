1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,300
All right, so the first thing to do here is to go to Spotlight and open Xcode.

2
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:05,800
There it is.

3
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:10,090
I will click on the Create a new Xcode project link.

4
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:13,360
Now, on the left hand side here,

5
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:17,210
you will notice that there are two categories, iOS and OS X.

6
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:20,500
These are two different operating systems that Apple makes.

7
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:25,580
iOS is for mobile devices and OS X is for desktop.

8
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,370
Since I'm interested in making a mobile application,

9
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:32,070
I will make sure that application is selected under iOS.

10
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:35,730
All of the options that you see here like Single View,

11
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:39,750
Game, these are templates that we can use to create projects.

12
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:43,290
You can think of them as templates that you can see when creating a presentation

13
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:44,320
for instance.

14
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,260
Single View, is the simplest template around.

15
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:50,320
It is a great place to start for a lot of apps.

16
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,860
It is also somewhat similar to a blank template when you

17
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:55,410
are making a presentation.

18
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:57,720
So I will make sure I select this and hit Next.

19
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:03,766
I will name our app Pitch Perfect.

20
00:01:03,766 --> 00:01:05,170
[SOUND] By the way,

21
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:10,894
this name will also appear just below the apps icon on the user's phone.

22
00:01:10,894 --> 00:01:14,974
I've added a link in the instructor notes that highlights recommendations from

23
00:01:14,974 --> 00:01:18,870
Apple on how to choose an effective name for your application.

24
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:23,430
Under Organization Name, Xcode has already entered Udacity.

25
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:27,620
You can enter either your name or the name of your organization in this box.

26
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:32,550
For the Organization Identifier, Apple recommends that you reverse the address

27
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:36,270
of your personal website or the website of your organization.

28
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:39,940
So here I have added com.udacity.

29
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:43,510
Now the reason for us reversing this address is because we

30
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:47,780
want to make this bundle identifier unique for our app.

31
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:51,780
I am developing this app in Swift so I will pick that.

32
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:54,870
Under Devices I will choose iPhone.

33
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:58,350
Now, the reason why I am picking this value is because I want to

34
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:00,640
focus my teaching efforts for this course.

35
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,260
I could have made an app for both iPad and iPhone.

36
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:06,970
By the way, you can change this setting later on if you choose.

37
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,080
I'm going to hit Next.

38
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,600
And select a folder where I want to save my project.

39
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:16,250
I have a folder called iOS Apps on my desktop.

40
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:17,359
And I will hit Create.

41
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:22,020
And voila, we've made an empty app.

42
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:26,110
Now there's a lot going on here in Xcode.

43
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:27,840
Let's dive into it in the next video.
