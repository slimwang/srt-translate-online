1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:04,480
But let's look at each of these choices, one at a time. The first one says yes,

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:07,385
because in order for a result to be creative, it must be novel,

3
00:00:07,385 --> 00:00:11,840
an output of an algorithm cannot be novel. Well, there are a few problems with

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,640
this particular answer. What if an output of an algorithm for

5
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:18,700
a small, closed-word problem cannot be novel?

6
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:22,890
The output of combinations of algorithms for open ended problem can and

7
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:27,460
indeed sometimes is novel. There are algorithms for example, that do design or

8
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:32,280
that do scientific discovery, whose results are novel. Let's look at the second

9
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:36,910
answer. Yes, because given a set of input, the output will always be the same.

10
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:40,470
Therefore, the product can never be unexpected. The output will

11
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:44,690
depend not just on the input. And not only on the methods of the system, but

12
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:47,770
also the situation in which the methods are situated.

13
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:51,870
The output depends not just on the input under the method the AI agent uses, but

14
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:55,740
also the context in which the AI agent is situated. For example,

15
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:59,840
given the same input but different context or the input, the agent will come up

16
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,840
with very different outputs, very different understandings of

17
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:07,420
that same input as we saw in this section on understanding. The third answer,

18
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:11,180
no because it defines creativity in terms of the output rather than the process.

19
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:15,750
This answer too has problems, because sometimes creativity can be defined simply

20
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:18,880
in terms of the output without knowing anything about the process.

21
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,900
We can think of a black box, that creates very interesting creative music. We

22
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:26,283
would not know anything about the process that it is using. But, if the output's

23
00:01:26,283 --> 00:01:30,660
interesting and creative music, we would consider it to be creative. Personally,

24
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:34,350
my sympathies lie with the fourth answer. But, of course you are welcome to

25
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:37,600
disagree with me. Why don't we continue this discussion on the forum?
