00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:05,890
Here's an example of a UML, state chart that illustrates several other features

2
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:10,790
of, Harel's notation. Once again, there are three outermost states,

3
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:14,810
idle maintenance, and active, and the active state itself is,

4
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:18,500
has nested states inside of it. There are transitions from

5
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:23,180
idle to the boundary of active. Two transitions there,

6
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:28,760
and as, as we saw similarly, each of those transitions is going to go

7
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:35,210
to the default state in the internal machine, which is labeled validating.

8
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:39,570
Another thing to note here is that two of the transitions in the nested machine,

9
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:45,940
in the active state, are labeled with text inside of square brackets.

10
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:51,530
These are data conditions. They are tests, logical expressions on the,

11
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:56,990
the the attributes of the object which is being represented by this

12
00:00:56,990 --> 00:01:02,505
particular state machine. In the transition between processing and

13
00:01:02,505 --> 00:01:05,552
printing on the right hand side of the active state,

14
00:01:05,552 --> 00:01:11,086
there are square brackets and inside it says not continue. Okay,

15
00:01:11,086 --> 00:01:15,300
continue is an attribute, presumably a boolean attribute, and if it's false,

16
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:18,919
then the transition can take place, otherwise it won't take place.

17
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:25,460
Also between processing and selecting, there's a transition labeled continue

18
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:29,920
which will take place if the continue attribute happens to be true.

19
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:38,320
The other thing to notice about this particular example is that in the bottom,

20
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,730
on the left of the active state, there are two lines of text one labeled entry

21
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:48,920
and one labeled exit. These are actions that will take place upon

22
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:55,840
respectively entry and exit from the inner state machine,

23
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,249
that is when a transition from idle goes to active.

24
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:05,370
Before anything else happens, the read card action will be executed.

25
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:11,210
Likewise, upon exit from the printing state,

26
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:18,170
when all the other work is done, the eject card action will take place.
