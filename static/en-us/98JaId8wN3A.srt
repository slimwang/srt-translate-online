00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,393
Excellent work if you got these correct. When I expand each of these, I would

2
00:00:04,393 --> 00:00:09,118
have three 2s, three 2s, and three 2s, That would make nine 2s multiplied all

3
00:00:09,118 --> 00:00:13,963
together, so 2 to the 9th. For the second problem, I have 8 to the 4th raised

4
00:00:13,963 --> 00:00:18,843
the 3rd power, I multiply 8 to the 4th, 3 times then I can expand each 8 to the

5
00:00:18,843 --> 00:00:23,803
4th, so I have four 8s times four 8s times four 8s, So that's a total of twelve

6
00:00:23,803 --> 00:00:29,041
8s multiplied together, 8 to the 12th. We use the same reasoning on this third

7
00:00:29,041 --> 00:00:33,715
one, we have 5 to the 3rd three times, which means we would have nine 5s

8
00:00:33,715 --> 00:00:38,646
multiplied all together, 5 to the 9th. For the final problem, we have x squared

9
00:00:38,646 --> 00:00:43,388
to the 4th, our powers still apply to the variable. Remember, variables are just

10
00:00:43,388 --> 00:00:47,819
numbers, so it would work the same in this case, as it does in these three.

11
00:00:47,819 --> 00:00:52,289
First I multiply x squared by itself four times, then I have x multiplied by

12
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:54,233
itself eight times, x to the 8th.
