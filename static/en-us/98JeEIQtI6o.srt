1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,370
The next module is when we start getting into more analysis of the image itself.

2
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:08,400
Here we'll actually learn more about the digital image representations,

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,440
how you represent images to make them computable objects.

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:15,150
We will learn about pixel and point processes of images.

5
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:19,010
Again, doing some mathematics on these images or computation on them.

6
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:22,270
We will learn things like, how do you smooth and filter images?

7
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:26,010
And again, learn the basic principles, the intuition behind these.

8
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:29,340
We will learn more about how we can extract different types of information from

9
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:31,150
images for analysis.

10
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:34,700
And in this timeframe, we'll actually do experiments where you'll actually learn

11
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:37,040
more about image filtering and also feature detection.
