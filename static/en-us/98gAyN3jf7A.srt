1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:04,880
Well all this talk about
memory protection and pages,

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:08,130
and read write execution informations,
and things like that.

3
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:13,270
Probably a good point when we can
revisit this Stack Overflow quiz we did

4
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:16,030
when we talked about software security.

5
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:19,820
So Stack and
we exploited in a variety of ways.

6
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:25,080
So the first question here in this quiz,
is go back and think through

7
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:30,095
how we could exploit the Stack if we
don't have memory for protection.

8
00:00:30,095 --> 00:00:34,595
And then we're going to come back and
see how memory protection mechanisms

9
00:00:34,595 --> 00:00:39,705
that we just discussed can actually
help you stop that kind of exploit.

10
00:00:39,705 --> 00:00:42,375
So the first one is just how
do you exploit the Stack.
