I want you to calculate how
wide the viewport is for

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:05,920
the four devices you see here.

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:09,490
And remember, the viewport width
is generally calculated by

4
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:14,800
dividing the number of physical pixels,
by the device pixel ratio.

5
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,480
Type your boxes into the answers here.
