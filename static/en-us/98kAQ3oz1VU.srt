1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,993
This equation tells us that 2 is a number that is 1 greater than n. So that

2
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:10,111
means that n is a number that is 1 less than 2, so n must be equal to 1. We can

3
00:00:10,123 --> 00:00:15,797
check this by plugging 1 back into our equation, or using substitution. If we do

4
00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:21,335
that, we get 1 plus 1 equals 2. Since 1 plus 1 does equal 2, that checks out.

5
00:00:21,455 --> 00:00:23,265
And our answer for n must be correct.
