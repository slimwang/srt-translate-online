00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:03,220
For developers, if you've already
built an Android app for your phone,

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:07,130
you're just a few enhancements away
from it working on your tv as well.

3
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:09,400
Let's start with the Creative Vision for
Android TV.

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:12,310
Which will help you understand
the difference between building on

5
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:14,740
something like a phone and
building for the TV.

6
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:16,960
Now, sum this up quickly.

7
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:22,440
You want to create an experience
that's Casual, Cinematic and Simple.

8
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:27,280
By Casual we mean that it should
be easy going, TV is not work.

9
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:30,780
Picture yourself hanging out with your
friends in the living room watching

10
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:34,430
a movie, playing a game, or
just listening to some music.

11
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:37,350
For example, you don't want to have to
pick up the remote every five minutes to

12
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:40,540
play the next video,
the TV should just handle this for you.

13
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:41,830
In the Cinematic App,

14
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:46,790
the interface should just fade away,
putting the content front and center.

15
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:50,950
Tell your story with pictures and
sound instead of text and menus.

16
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:55,270
And finally, everything should be so
simple that it feels magical.

17
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:59,110
Minimize steps, avoid text entry,
just get the user to their content.
