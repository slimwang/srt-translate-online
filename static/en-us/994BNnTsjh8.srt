00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:05,130
We have discussed that for two parties
to communicate securely, they typically

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:10,230
need to use a security protocol that
performs mutual authentication and

3
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:13,450
key exchange for two end hosts or

4
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:19,000
two gateways to use IPsec for
secure communications over the Internet.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,510
The security protocol is
the internet key exchange protocol.

6
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:27,140
This protocol allows the two parties
to decide the security policies for

7
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:28,800
the traffic between them.

8
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,910
This protocol also allows the two
parties to agree on a set of security

9
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:37,838
parameters, for example,
which algorithms to use for

10
00:00:37,838 --> 00:00:39,450
encryption or hashing.

11
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:43,060
We will discuss shortly
how security associations

12
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:45,610
encapsulate these parameters.

13
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:49,820
The protocol also establishes shared
keys between the two parties.
