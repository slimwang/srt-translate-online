Let's talk a bit more
about Setting Good KPIs.

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:10,200
A Key Performance Indicator or KPI is
a measurable value that demonstrates

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:14,460
how effectively a company is achieving
their key business objectives.

4
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:19,230
Organizations use KPIs to evaluate
their success at reaching targets.

5
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:20,370
As opposed to metrics,

6
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:23,580
which simply demonstrate the current
state of events of a company.

7
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:27,280
How much money they're making,
how many customers that they have.

8
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:31,190
KPIs clearly indicate where actions for
change should be taken.

9
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:31,940
For example,

10
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:37,555
you could set KPIs to measure
increases in customer satisfaction.

11
00:00:37,555 --> 00:00:43,805
You could also look at app installations
per whatever days, ten, 15, 30, 100.

12
00:00:43,805 --> 00:00:49,102
You can also look at the number
of active users after 30 days.

13
00:00:49,102 --> 00:00:53,492
The important aspect when selecting KPIs
is to ensure that they're tied to your

14
00:00:53,492 --> 00:00:55,232
own business objectives.

15
00:00:55,232 --> 00:00:58,092
It's a good idea to be agile here and

16
00:00:58,092 --> 00:01:01,242
to customize your KPIs as you
progress with your startup.

17
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:06,680
So take a minute and think about some
of the KPIs that you might set for

18
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:07,240
your product.

19
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:10,340
And then,
how might you evaluate whether or

20
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:14,420
not the KPIs that you've
selected are the right ones?
