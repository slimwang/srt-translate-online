1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,725
There is something called
the CIE Lab space.

2
00:00:03,725 --> 00:00:08,050
Sometime called Lab space but L a b
actually, where L is luminance, and

3
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:12,320
then, as you change the a and the b,
you end up with different colors.

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,100
I'm going to use the work color now,

5
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:17,300
instead of the more technical words
later which, which we'll use.

6
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:20,770
So here, you have a luminance of 25%,
so it's kind of darker.

7
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:24,050
And you see the greenish, reddish and
blueish things as you move around.

8
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:26,334
And then the middle is kind of gray,
right?

9
00:00:26,334 --> 00:00:30,255
And as this, as luminance gets brighter,
the middle gets brighter, and

10
00:00:30,255 --> 00:00:33,260
you get these lighter
variations in color.

11
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:35,520
And so
that's called the Lab color space.

12
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,870
And the idea is that
you've got luminance, and

13
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:41,070
you've got sort of how
saturated the color is.

14
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:44,020
And actually, what the,
what we call the color, but

15
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:46,890
what is ty,
typically referred to as the hue.

16
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:50,800
And that sometimes defined
you can think of the color

17
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,740
as a three-dimensional volume
of one sort or another, and

18
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:57,260
you'll see there's a whole bunch
of ways of representing it.

19
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:02,180
But the idea is that one way of thinking
about it is that down here is dark,

20
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:03,640
up at the top is brighter.

21
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:08,780
And as you move around this circle, so

22
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:13,860
it goes through 360 and around again,
is what's referred to as the hue, okay?

23
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:18,600
And as you move outside,
things become purer in color, all right?

24
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:23,120
So two systems that people use a lot
to talk about these things are called

25
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:28,690
sometimes hue saturation and lightness,
or sometimes hue saturation and value.

26
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:31,390
There are all different
kinds of color spaces.

27
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:34,810
These two can be drawn as sort
of these thick cylinders.

28
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:37,390
So down here again at the bottom,
things are dark.

29
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:39,100
Up at the top, things are light.

30
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:43,370
In hue saturation and lightness,
the whole top is white, which I think by

31
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:46,570
the way is an awful representation,
I'll tell you why in a second.

32
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:49,440
Down the whole thing in
the bottom is all black.

33
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,670
And as you go around,
you'd get different colors.

34
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:53,450
That's what you can see around here,
different hues.

35
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:57,180
And as you go from the middle to the
edge, you get more and more saturated.

36
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,650
So in the middle, everything is gray.

37
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:00,365
It goes from black to white through gray
