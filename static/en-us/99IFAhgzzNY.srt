1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So what I'd like you to do is update the play_pig function

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
so that it looks at the result that comes back from the strategy function,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
and make sure that it's either hold or roll

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and if it's not one of those, then let's decide that what we do

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
is that that strategy automatically loses a game.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So if you make an illegal move, you lose the game right there.
