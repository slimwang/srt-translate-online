1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,611
This code makes a reference
to R.drawable.bg and

2
00:00:04,611 --> 00:00:09,310
this references a bg.png
file in res/drawable-hdpi.

3
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:12,570
So what we'll do is we're just
going to copy our new dog.jpg into

4
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:14,360
the same directory.

5
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:17,225
So here we're going to
copy the image over and

6
00:00:17,225 --> 00:00:20,180
now we can see it here
in the project viewer.

7
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:23,870
This here shows that I used
a 320 by 320 jpeg image.

8
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:26,330
I changed bg to dog here in the code.

9
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:30,110
Now if you look at where the drawBitmap
call is made, it draws it all the time.

10
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:33,080
We need to only draw the bitmap
when not in ambient mode.

11
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:35,980
So we add this if statement
to check the ambient state.

12
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:39,700
Also, we need to clear the canvas to
black if we don't draw the background.

13
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:42,360
If you forget to do this then
the canvas will show the previous one

14
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,730
before ambient mode and you will
incorrectly see the second hand.

15
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:47,830
So that's it.
We're done with the changes.

16
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:49,860
When we run the watch
face in interactive mode,

17
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:52,270
we can see the dog picture
in the background.

18
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:55,560
When we go into ambient mode,
the background is black.

19
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,710
Congratulations!

20
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:59,470
You now have your own customized
Android Wear watch face.
