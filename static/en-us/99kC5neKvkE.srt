00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,790
The results of correlational studies give us what is called a correlation

2
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:08,350
coefficient. Correlations tell us two things, the strength of the relationship

3
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:13,080
as well as the direction of the relationship. Here, we have our X variable,

4
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:17,920
which is our predictor variable. And our Y variable, which is our criterion

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,760
variable, or what is to be explained. In our study the X variable was the

6
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:27,500
number and type of chores, whereas the Y variable was the number of sexual

7
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:32,090
encounters. For the strength of relationship, we can have a positive

8
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:37,040
relationship. We can also have a negative relationship. Here, in a negative

9
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:42,560
correlation, as scores increase on the X variable, they decrease on the Y

10
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:47,760
variable. In a positive correlationship, as scores increase on the X variable

11
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,920
they also increase on the Y variable. This would be an example of a perfect

12
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,488
positive correlation: plus 1. Here, we have an example of a perfect negative

13
00:00:56,488 --> 00:01:01,290
correlation: minus 1. In the middle, we can see that our data points are

14
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:06,050
randomly distributed. This would indicate no relationship. In our example,

15
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:09,820
there would be no relationship between the number of sexual encounters and the

16
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:15,060
type of chores. Here, we see a moderate positive correlation. Here, we see a

17
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:20,320
moderate negative correlation. Again strength and direction of relationships

18
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,539
are explained in correlational studies.
