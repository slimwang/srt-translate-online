1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The answer is the second one.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Here we're using conditional probability.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
The event that we saw was the cipher text.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
That's the encryption of m.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
What we want to know whether the message is equal to m*.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Both of those are drawn from the set of all possible messages.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:24,000
In order for the attacker to know nothing is the same as the probability that the message is m*

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
without knowing the cipher text.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
The first answer would be correct if, a priori, the attacker knew nothing about the messages.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
All the attacker knows is each message is equally likely.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
In that case, the probability that the message is m*

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
would be 1 over the number of possible messages not depending on the cipher text.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The problem is the attacker might know something more.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
They might know that some messages are more likely than others.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
In most realistic scenarios this is the case.

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
The attacker knows that the message is likely to be a valid sentence in English.

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Very few possible bit sequences correspond to that, so all messages are not equally likely.

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
That's why choice 1 is not the definition we want.

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
We want choice 2 where whatever the attacker already knew about

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,000
the probability of the message as m* is not affected in any way by seeing the cipher text.

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
That's our definition of a perfect cipher.

22
00:01:16,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Now the question is can we prove that the one-time pad has this property.
