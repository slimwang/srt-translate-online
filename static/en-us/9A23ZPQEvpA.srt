00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:02,770
Now that you have completed
your professional profile,

2
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:03,930
we get to craft the headline.

3
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:07,310
Your headline appears in search
results beneath your name and photo.

4
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:11,630
With one simple title, you'll harness
the power to craft your personal brand.

5
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:15,430
When I first created Ellington Presence,
I didn't realize that this

6
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:18,430
headline didn't necessarily need
to be my current job title.

7
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:21,009
Luckily, I discovered that
you can customize it.

8
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:25,350
Your headline is a great place to use
positive language to your advantage.

9
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:29,360
For example, rather than using
a phrase like seeking employment,

10
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:33,510
which might be read as unemployed,
you can use a positive phrase like

11
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:38,060
web development professional or
builder, creator, and web developer.

12
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:41,300
This is an extremely helpful way to take
control over your professional career

13
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:42,910
path and story.

14
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:44,540
Wherever you are in a job search,

15
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:46,970
you can create a headline that best
of aligns with your target jobs.
