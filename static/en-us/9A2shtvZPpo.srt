1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:03,719
Hopefully, you had a chance to
experiment with using different intents

2
00:00:03,719 --> 00:00:06,110
from the Common Intents guide.

3
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:10,090
For example, I showed you earlier that
I modified the submitOrder method.

4
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:15,000
I commented out all the existing code
and then, added the maps intent code.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
When I run the map on my device, when I
click on the order button, instead of

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,510
uploading the order summary, it'll
actually send an intent to the maps app.

7
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:28,250
The Google Maps app receives the intent
and then updates the map to show

8
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:31,270
the location that we
requested in the intent.

9
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:34,700
Even if using these intents doesn't
make sense in the context of our coffee

10
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:38,795
ordering app, It's a good place
to practice creating intents.

11
00:00:38,795 --> 00:00:41,765
Let's undo this change and
then get back to our real tasks.

12
00:00:42,765 --> 00:00:44,645
In order to add this feature to our app,

13
00:00:44,645 --> 00:00:48,495
we need to use an intent to send
the order summary to an email app.

14
00:00:48,495 --> 00:00:52,445
If you had no idea how to accomplish
this, you could do a web search.

15
00:00:52,445 --> 00:00:55,345
I did a search for email intent android.

16
00:00:55,345 --> 00:00:59,500
A bunch of useful links pop up like
a Stack Overflow post and a tutorial.

17
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:02,550
But the common intents guide pops up and
says it's from the official

18
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:05,349
Android Documentation,
I'm going to click on that.

19
00:01:05,349 --> 00:01:08,870
In the side by here there's a link
on how to create an email intent,

20
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:11,560
so I'm going to click on that,
this shows you how to send

21
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:14,900
an intent to compose an email
with optional attachments.

22
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:18,140
Looking through the documentation
there are two code examples.

23
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:22,230
After reading this comment we
want this second code example.

24
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:25,750
This is because we want our intent to
be handled only by an email app and

25
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:28,760
not by a text messaging or
social media app.

26
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,550
Let's select this code and copy it,

27
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:32,390
and then we're going to
paste it into our app.

28
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:34,520
Looking at the code for

29
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:38,505
our just Java app where should we
actually paste this code snippet?

30
00:01:38,505 --> 00:01:42,005
Well, we want to send the order
summary off to the email app

31
00:01:42,005 --> 00:01:44,695
as soon as we have
the complete order summary.

32
00:01:44,695 --> 00:01:48,175
And the place that we have the complete
order summary is after this line of code

33
00:01:48,175 --> 00:01:49,965
here which creates the order summary and

34
00:01:49,965 --> 00:01:53,060
then stores it in a string
variable called priceMessage.

35
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:56,880
So I'm going to add a new line here,
and then insert our code.

36
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:00,420
Notice how we're creating
a new intent object

37
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:03,680
using the constructor with
the new keyword in java.

38
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,090
We're passing in one argument
as input into the constructor

39
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:09,470
to initialize this intent object.

40
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:14,710
The argument is this constant
called Intent.ACTION_SENDTO.

41
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:18,510
Remember the convention is that when
you see something in all caps in Java

42
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:20,140
it means it's a constant.

43
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:24,750
A constant is a variable who's contents
should never change once it's set.

44
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:27,220
In this case when we're
creating our intent

45
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:29,370
we're using official intent action.

46
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:34,460
ACTION_SENDTO which is defined as
a constant in the intent class.

47
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:38,080
Then we call some methods on this
newly created intent object.

48
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,650
We set the data to be
a URI of this format,

49
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:46,010
"mailto:", that way all the email
apps will handle this intent.

50
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:49,120
Then we add some extra
data into the intent.

51
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,700
We don't need to specify
the two field of this e-mail so

52
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:55,000
I'm just going to delete that line.

53
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,800
We do, however, want to specify
the subject of the e-mail message.

54
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,680
So I'm going to replace this
with actual subject line.

55
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:08,440
Just Java order for, and
then add the persons name.

56
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,950
Then these next couple of lines of
code check if there's an activity

57
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:15,140
on the device to handle this intent.

58
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:18,980
If there is then it's safe
to send the intent and

59
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:22,400
recall start activity using this intent.

60
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,330
If there's no activity on
the device to handle the intent,

61
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:28,970
then we skip this block of code and
we skip sending the intent.

62
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:31,900
Now, let's run the app on our device.

63
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:34,890
Now when I click on the order button,

64
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:38,190
it sends an intent to
an email app on the device.

65
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:42,060
By default, the Gmail app is
going to handle this intent.

66
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:46,620
In a code since I specified a custom
subject line, it shows up here as just

67
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:51,900
Java order for Kaptain Kanal, which is
the name that I entered into the app.

68
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:55,850
Now, the original quiz question asked
us to populate the email subject line,

69
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:58,490
as well as the message body
with the order summary.

70
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:00,350
So let's go do that now.

71
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:02,090
Looking back the the documentation for

72
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:06,330
the email intent, I'm going to scroll
up to look at the intent extras.

73
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:09,520
We need to add an intent extra for

74
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:12,930
each additional piece of information
we want to provide about the email.

75
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:17,709
For example, we could have an intent
extra about the recipients of the email

76
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:20,820
And we can have an Intent.EXTRA
about the subject line of the email.

77
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,350
But this is what we really want.

78
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:28,200
We want to add an Intent.EXTRA to
specify the body of the email.

79
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:34,320
Again, Intent.EXTRA_TEXT is a constant
defined in the intent java class.

80
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,050
If I click on it you'll
see more information.

81
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:40,730
It's defined as a string
in the intent class.

82
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:43,480
And the constant value is
this string right here.

83
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:48,670
In the Just Java app when we create the
intent And we're going to populate this

84
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:52,540
extra, containing the body
of the email message.

85
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:55,740
When the email app receives the intent,
they'll know to check for

86
00:04:55,740 --> 00:05:00,410
this intent extra to find the body of
email and then they can populate that.

87
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:02,440
Into the user interface.

88
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,650
Let's make that code change now.

89
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:06,540
I'm going to select this line of code,

90
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:11,440
that puts one extra into the intent for
the subject of the email.

91
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,870
On the next line,
I'm going to paste the code.

92
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:16,870
Now we're putting a second
extra into the intent.

93
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:25,530
The extra is going to correspond
to Intent.EXTRA_TEXT so

94
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:28,810
that we know that it's for
the body of the email.

95
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:32,360
The second argument to this
method is going to be the actual

96
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,490
body of the email.

97
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,780
The body of the email should just
contain the order summary and

98
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:42,190
that's sorted in price message so I can
just copy this variable over to here.

99
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:45,980
To recap, for

100
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:50,890
the intent object we're calling a method
putExtra to specific the email subject.

101
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:55,890
In the same intent object we're
calling the put extra method again

102
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:57,720
to specify the body of the email.

103
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:01,490
And the body of the email
is the order summary.

104
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:02,670
Now let's run the app on our device.

105
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,610
once I complete order,
I can click the button to submit.

106
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:11,190
We send an intent to the email app
with the email subject populated and

107
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:12,270
the summary shows up now.

108
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:13,380
Woo hoo!

109
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:18,110
For the third step of this task we're
going to remove the code that displays

110
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:20,760
the order summary in
the Just Java app because

111
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:23,070
now it's going to show
up in the email app.

112
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:26,604
I'm going to start by modifying the
activity main layout to remove the order

113
00:06:26,604 --> 00:06:28,510
summary text views.

114
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:31,360
At the bottom of the layout,
I'm going to delete the header

115
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,970
as well as the TextView that would
show the actual order summary.

116
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:36,760
I'm going to save that and
switch to the Java file.

117
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:42,276
In the main activity Java file, I no
longer need this display message method,

118
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:46,463
which would update the order summary
text view because this view with this

119
00:06:46,463 --> 00:06:48,101
ID doesn't exist anymore.

120
00:06:52,323 --> 00:06:55,970
Since I deleted the display message
method, Android studio now gives me

121
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:59,870
an error saying that this method doesn't
exist, so I'm going to delete this.

122
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:04,100
Looking back at our code, this makes
sense because when we click on the order

123
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:06,680
button, It's going to call
the submit order method,

124
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:11,610
we're going to do all this code, which
also sends an intent to the email app.

125
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:16,030
There's no need to display the order
summary within our app any more.

126
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:18,400
Let's verify that the app still works.

127
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,090
When you delete large amounts of code,

128
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:22,710
it's easier to check
immediately that it works and

129
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:26,480
undo the changes if there's a mistake,
rather than trying to find it out later.

130
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,890
And the app still works.

131
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:31,810
Nice job.

132
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:34,880
You added an intent
to the just Java app.

133
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,560
Intents are one of the core parts of
Android, but there are still many more

134
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,250
Android components that can
help you build better apps.

135
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:44,570
I recommend that you check those out on
your own after you finish this course.
