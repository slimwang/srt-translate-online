1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:05,290
Before 1994, addresses was divided into a Network ID

2
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:07,570
portion and a Host ID portion. So if we

3
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:09,970
take our 32-bits, suppose the first bit is a

4
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:13,990
0. Note that, that's half of all IPv4 address

5
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:16,710
space. Anything that starts with a 0 is going

6
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:19,100
to be known as a class A address and

7
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:22,750
the next 7 bits will represent the network ID

8
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:25,800
or the network that owns this portion of address space.

9
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,640
The remainging portion Of the address space is

10
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,920
dedicated for hosts on that network. In this case,

11
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,810
any class A network can support up to

12
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:37,940
two to the twenty-fourth posts. Addresses that started with

13
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:41,630
one zero were designated as class B networks,

14
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:44,700
where the first 16 bits signified the Network ID

15
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,040
and the remaining 16 bits signified the Host

16
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,880
ID for that network. Note here that each class

17
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:56,120
B address range represents about one sixty-five thousandth of of

18
00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:00,770
all internet address space. So, discounting the first two bits which indiciate

19
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:06,430
that this is a class B network, we have about 2 to the 14th, unique class B's.

20
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:11,326
Each of which can have two to the sixteenth, or 65,000

21
00:01:11,326 --> 00:01:16,140
hosts on each network. Class C's use the first

22
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:22,790
24 bits for the Net ID and a remaining eight for a Host ID. So each class C

23
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:29,810
network essentially can only have 255 hosts on it. This plot shows the BGP

24
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:35,510
routing table size as a function of the year, starting in 1989, and going up to

25
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:37,225
1994. You can see that at this time,

26
00:01:37,225 --> 00:01:41,260
the internet routing table is quite small. It started,

27
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:44,390
at less than 5,000 prefixes. By comparison now

28
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:47,940
we have about 500,000 IP prefixes in the internet

29
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:49,630
routing table. But we can see in this

30
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:54,440
period, that internet routing table growth began to accelerate,

31
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:57,120
in particular the growth rates were exceeding the

32
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:00,950
advances in hardware and software capabilities. And, in particular,

33
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:03,080
we began to run out of the class

34
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:06,560
C address allocation. There were far more networks that

35
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,008
needed just a handful of IP addresses, such

36
00:02:10,008 --> 00:02:13,080
as a class C address space could provide. And

37
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:16,220
yet because only a certain range of the IP

38
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:19,040
address space could be used for class C addresses

39
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,330
we began to run out fairly quickly. So there

40
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:25,050
began to be a need for more flexible allocation.

41
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:28,240
The solution to this problem is something called classless

42
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:31,850
interdomain routing, or CIDR. Something that we'll cover in

43
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:32,450
the next lesson.
