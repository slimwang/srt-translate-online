1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:04,300
So it seems that the recording label needs to be somewhere here on

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:09,920
the screen, which means that it needs to be centered horizontally and

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,660
a fixed distance away from the microphone button.

4
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:14,690
Let's add these constraints to the label next.

5
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:19,930
So what I'm going to do is hold down the Control key on my keyboard,

6
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:22,660
click on the label, and then drag.

7
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:25,510
And when I let go, I am presented with this dialogue.

8
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:29,299
And I will select the Center Horizontally option here,

9
00:00:29,299 --> 00:00:32,207
which will center my label horizontally.

10
00:00:32,207 --> 00:00:36,440
And then I will hold down the Control key one more time, click on the label, and

11
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:40,739
then drag towards the microphone button, and then create a vertical spacing in

12
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:44,480
between the button, the microphone button that is, and the label.

13
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:46,660
There.

14
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:49,070
Now at this point, if I open the document outline,

15
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:54,180
I can see that I added a couple of new constraints here.

16
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:57,320
There's the constraint for the vertical space between the microphone button and

17
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:01,330
the label, and there is the horizontal alignment for the label.

18
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:02,020
Okay.

19
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:05,930
Let me go ahead and close the document outline and run this project again.

20
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:09,190
Aha.

21
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:12,110
The label is showing up in the correct location.

22
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:17,500
Although this label is showing up by default, the correct behavior would be for

23
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:21,210
this label to be hidden when the app first launches.

24
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:26,020
So to fix this, I will go back to Xcode, select my label, and under

25
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:31,650
Attributes Inspector, I will scroll down to find this option called Hidden.

26
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:35,300
This will make sure that my label is hidden by default.

27
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:39,180
You can actually see a faint representation of it on the storyboard.

28
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:40,480
Let me run this app one more time.

29
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:45,260
All right, the label does not show up by default.
