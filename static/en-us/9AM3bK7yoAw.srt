00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,380
Alright, Sam. So chatter's cool. I'm into the social

2
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:06,270
thing, but I want to make this thing mobile.

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:06,970
>> Alright.

4
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:08,039
>> You promised me that I can.

5
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:09,290
>> You already did.

6
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:12,240
>> So I have this thing called an iOS simulator, and it

7
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,640
lets me show you what this would look like on an iPhone.

8
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:15,300
>> Sweet.

9
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:17,570
>> And right now it's not that impressive.

10
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:18,970
It looks like a crappy website on an iPhone.

11
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:20,890
>> What is this? A website for ants?

12
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:20,890
>>

13
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:21,950
[LAUGH]

14
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:24,880
And that's bad. The main ten ants maybe.

15
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:25,545
>> No.

16
00:00:25,545 --> 00:00:25,880
[LAUGH]

17
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:29,530
>> I can zoom in, but still this is kind

18
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,630
of, you know, not that impressive, so what can I do?

19
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:36,870
>> All right, so you could install an app right off,

20
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:39,460
you know, the app store into your phone. Or you could just

21
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:43,280
navigate to a new URL, that will pull up all of

22
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,070
this data and all of your applications in a mobile web app.

23
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:48,210
>> Okay, what.

24
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:48,480
>> So.

25
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,290
>> What is this mystery URL?

26
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:50,835
>> Sales

27
00:00:50,835 --> 00:00:52,470
Force One, yow.

28
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:52,940
>> Okay.

29
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:57,170
>> Alright so, don't delete everything, just at the end of this URL, we'll

30
00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:01,730
delete everything back to dot com, so just keep going back.

31
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:09,648
>> Okay. Yep, and then, there you go and then /one/one.app.

32
00:01:09,648 --> 00:01:13,573
>> w, I mean, o-n-e?

33
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:14,479
>> Yep.

34
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:16,890
>> One.app?

35
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:17,796
>> Yep.

36
00:01:17,796 --> 00:01:20,000
>> Oh man, that is cool. Okay.

37
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,820
>> Alright, so first what we're looking

38
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:24,550
at right now is. That's our chatter feed.

39
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:24,930
>> Okay.

40
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:27,200
>> But this whole thing is pulling up SalesForce one, which is.

41
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,480
>> I'm going to like this, sorry.

42
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,880
>> You're going to like your own post?

43
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:30,070
>> Yeah.

44
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:30,840
>> Wow.

45
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,640
>> Is it, is it lame?

46
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:34,380
>> It's okay. It's socially acceptable in the corporate world.

47
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:35,310
>> Okay.

48
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:38,010
>> All right, but, what this is, is it's a

49
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:42,720
mobile representation of all of your Salesforce data in one application.

50
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,090
And so maybe you didn't realize this the whole time we

51
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:47,920
were going through all of our app building, but you simultaneously

52
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,320
built a mobile app that's completely functional with everything that you've

53
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:54,170
already done. And you can see its service in a phone.

54
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:58,010
>> Yeah. That is really cool. So, let me poke around a bit.
