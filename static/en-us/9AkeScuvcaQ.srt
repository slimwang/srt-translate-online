General tessellation won't help. Adding vertices will just mean more triangles

2
00:00:04,491 --> 00:00:09,497
to join these up. The answer is 4 triangles in fact the rule is a polygon with n

3
00:00:09,497 --> 00:00:14,391
edges will need n minus 2 triangles to represent it. We don't care all that much

4
00:00:14,391 --> 00:00:18,370
in interactive rendering which triangulation is used. Here I've made a fan of

5
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:22,806
triangles, all radiating from 1 vertex but there are other ways to do it. The

6
00:00:22,806 --> 00:00:26,712
shape of the triangles is important in other fields such as stress analysis

7
00:00:26,712 --> 00:00:30,742
program that use meshes but isn't so important in interactive rendering. If

8
00:00:30,742 --> 00:00:35,164
you're a puzzle buff here's a bonus question for absolutely no credit and little

9
00:00:35,164 --> 00:00:39,133
use in computer graphics itself rather just for the sake of it. How many

10
00:00:39,133 --> 00:00:44,070
different unique triangulations of this hexagon are there? Once you solve that,

11
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:49,213
is there a general rule for polygons? Feel free to discuss this on the forums.
