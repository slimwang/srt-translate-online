For one hour we can see that both the car companies would cost $15, so this

2
00:00:04,452 --> 00:00:09,276
one's correct. For ten hours, it's not on my graph, so I have to think a little

3
00:00:09,276 --> 00:00:13,864
bit harder. I could plug in the value of ten in for x. If x were equal to ten,

4
00:00:13,864 --> 00:00:18,940
Carz-to-Go would cost $60, and Numerator Cars would also cost $60. That's pretty

5
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:24,028
simple because, well, they have the same equation. The same would be true for 15

6
00:00:24,028 --> 00:00:28,447
hours and 20 hours and it turns out, this is true for every hour. We know the

7
00:00:28,447 --> 00:00:33,030
equations are identical so their cost should always be the same. This question

8
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:37,450
was pretty tricky so don't worry if you didn't get it right on your first try.
