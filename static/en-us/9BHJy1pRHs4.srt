Well it turns out that most of the different kinds of UML diagrams could be so

2
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:09,740
used. Of the 14 diagrams I've listed here nine of them that might be,

3
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:13,780
might be appropriate. Of course a given diagram, like a class model diagram,

4
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:18,780
might be useful at a very low level that we wouldn't even call architectural.

5
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:23,150
What it also could be used for lending out what the major classes of a system

6
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:28,300
are. As with some of the other diagrams they can convey the structural elements,

7
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:33,270
but also some of the UML diagrams can convey the behavioral aspect. For example,

8
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:35,805
sequence diagrams and communication diagrams. And

9
00:00:35,805 --> 00:00:40,900
at a most abstract level in terms of dealing with a systems overall usage and

10
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:44,970
how its going to be broken out into different aspects of functionality,

11
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:47,790
use case diagram could be useful for those circumstances.
