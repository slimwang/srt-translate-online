1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:05,350
So LibGDX provides us a with a way to
talk to the GPU without needing to

2
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:07,500
actually use OpenGL.

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:10,300
LibGDX also provides
us with a rectangular

4
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:12,420
area of the screen we can draw to.

5
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:15,960
On a mobile device that's
generally the entire screen.

6
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,610
Now we need to thing about how we're
going to position stuff on that screen.

7
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:22,068
We clearly need an x, y pair.

8
00:00:22,068 --> 00:00:25,886
And the easiest way to position stuff is
by having the x value be the number of

9
00:00:25,886 --> 00:00:28,128
pixels from the left edge of the screen,
and

10
00:00:28,128 --> 00:00:31,660
have the y value be the number of
pixels from the bottom of the screen.

11
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:34,270
That's the approach we
are going to stick with for

12
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:37,040
the rest of this level, but
next level we'll start using

13
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,940
a much more flexible system
called an orthographic camera.
