00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:03,670
Now, we've talked a lot about algorithms, set-ups, and equations, but what we

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:06,550
haven't really talked about is how to get your assets into the game in the

3
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:10,565
proper way. And that's what we're going to talk about in this unit, proper

4
00:00:10,565 --> 00:00:14,090
asset loading. Which, by the way, is the dark art of high performance

5
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:17,630
programming. If you get it right, your games load quickly and you get happy

6
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:20,564
users. If you get it wrong, you get bad load times and then all of a sudden

7
00:00:20,564 --> 00:00:22,996
people are starting flame wars on the internet about how long it takes for you

8
00:00:22,996 --> 00:00:27,290
to load your level. Choice seems kind of obvious to me.
