1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,815
Since these functions aren't inverses of each other, let's find their actual

2
00:00:03,815 --> 00:00:08,982
inverses. What is the inverse of f? And what is the inverse of g? Once you

3
00:00:08,982 --> 00:00:12,454
think you've found them, make sure that you check your work by finding f of f

4
00:00:12,454 --> 00:00:17,890
inverse of x, and all these other compositions down here. Remember what they

5
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:20,545
all need to equal in order to verify that these actually are the inverse

6
00:00:20,545 --> 00:00:22,679
functions we're looking for.
