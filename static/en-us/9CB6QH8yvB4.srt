1
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:07,730
>> That's clearly the door handle, but there's no perceived affordance.

2
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:10,350
So it's a signifier that this is a handle, but it's only

3
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:13,520
half a signifier. It tells where the handle is, but not

4
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:17,310
what to do, so, I don't know, how do you open it?

5
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:21,970
>> Hi, Don. How are you? What are you doing with my car?

6
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:27,550
>> Trying to understand

7
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:30,810
how to open it. The hell, what did you do?

8
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:32,390
>> Well I have the key, so it

9
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:34,650
knows that I'm coming, so it automatically opens.

10
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:39,454
>> Oh, that's clever. This is a really good example of hiding

11
00:00:39,454 --> 00:00:44,770
a perceived affordance. Hiding, the signifier, because you don't need to have it

12
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:48,240
there. The owner of the car knows how to use it, and when

13
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:51,820
the owner of the car comes near with a key, it automatically opens,

14
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:54,110
you can grab the handle.

15
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:57,360
That's very clever design.
