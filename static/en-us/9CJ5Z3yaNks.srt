00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,221
It turns out all of these are true. 5 and 6 sum to 11. 5 and 6 are also used as

2
00:00:05,221 --> 00:00:10,144
the coefficients of x to rewrite 11x. We know 5 and 6 is a factor pair of 30

3
00:00:10,144 --> 00:00:15,953
since they multiply to give us 30. And finally we can see that a positive 5 and

4
00:00:15,953 --> 00:00:18,947
positive 6 up here in our binomials.
