What is a behavioral report?

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:05,750
There are several types
of behavioral reports.

3
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:10,320
They show the performance of our
content, the action visitors took.

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,120
It visualizes the path users
travel from one page to another or

5
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:16,230
from one event to the next.

6
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:18,860
In apps it will be
from screen to screen.

7
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:24,560
These reports can help you discover what
potential content keeps user engaged.

8
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,710
It also can help you
identify potential issues.

9
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:32,950
Okay, let's see how to use it.

10
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:37,760
Here, we just click in
the behavioral pane on Overview, and

11
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,878
we'll get the first report.

12
00:00:40,878 --> 00:00:43,980
The Overview gives you
a high level summary

13
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:48,430
of what users interact with your site or
app.

14
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:50,440
For instance,
here you can see the page views,

15
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:54,790
the unique, time on page,
bounce rate, and many more.

16
00:00:54,790 --> 00:01:00,275
If you want to see the full report, just
go to the bottom and click, and you'll

17
00:01:00,275 --> 00:01:05,364
get all the detailed scenarios and
data of what happened with your site.

18
00:01:05,364 --> 00:01:10,704
Another very useful report
is the behavioral flow.

19
00:01:10,704 --> 00:01:12,310
If you clicked on it,

20
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:18,560
you'll what are the paths that users
took when they traveled your site?

21
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,580
This report could help you
identify potential problems or

22
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:26,340
where are the pages that
the users are most engaged with
