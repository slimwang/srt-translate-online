1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,660
Let's take a closer look
at each round of AES.

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:08,189
Again, in AES,
data is represented as state array.

3
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:11,460
The first operation is substitute bytes.

4
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:17,370
This involves using S boxes to
perform byte by byte substitution.

5
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:20,910
And again,
the result is stored in the state array.

6
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:23,820
The second operation is shift rows.

7
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,960
And this is permutation
that's performed row by row.

8
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,060
Again, the result is in the state array.

9
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:36,140
MixColumns is a substitution that
alters each byte in a column

10
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:39,400
as a function of all
the bytes in the column.

11
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:42,140
Again, the result is in the state array.

12
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:44,480
And then we XOR with the round key.

13
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:50,030
The result is in the state array, and
this feeds to the next round of AES.

14
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:56,380
As you can see, each round of AES
involves substitution, permutation,

15
00:00:56,380 --> 00:01:01,330
which represent confusion and diffusion,
and also use the encryption key.
