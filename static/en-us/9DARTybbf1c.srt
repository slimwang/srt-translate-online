00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,650
The answer, if this were true, is that the more you sleep, the better your

2
00:00:04,662 --> 00:00:09,435
memory. People who didn't sleep for very long got lower scores. People that

3
00:00:09,447 --> 00:00:14,320
slept for longer, more than 6 hours, got better scores. So, if all the data

4
00:00:14,332 --> 00:00:19,455
followed this pattern, we could reasonably conclude that the more you sleep, the

5
00:00:19,467 --> 00:00:20,662
better your memory tends to be.
