1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:01,240
In this example,

2
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:05,939
we're going to be graphing school attendance over days of the school year.

3
00:00:05,939 --> 00:00:09,710
You can see here our data represented as dates and

4
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:15,240
attendance in a tabular form, and if we try to apply the grammar of graphic and

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:20,350
apply a line plot aestethic to this data, we get the green line we see here.

6
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:23,850
Can you think of an advantage of using a visual representation of

7
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:26,770
data as opposed to a tabular representation of data.
