00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,840
Here's a solution to that example with three titles.

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,010
And note that we have in doing this, we have left out

3
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:11,870
unimportant words like and, and of, which are sometimes called stop words.

4
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:13,980
And that we have rotated the output so

5
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:16,390
that all the key words line up in a column.

6
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:20,290
Okay. And when quick indexes are actually published, you can see them

7
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:24,680
look like this and you can just go down the column to find the appropriate word.

8
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:29,080
And so we have, in this case, six lines in our output.

9
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:33,240
We've removed the stop words from the, from the index list and, and

10
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,080
then alphabetized according to the key word.
