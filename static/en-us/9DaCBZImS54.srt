Okay, the answer, of course, is HTML is rendered by

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:06,110
the browser. Let's go ahead and see that in practice.

3
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:10,440
When I click add here, pizza gets added very largely

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,710
to our shopping list, of course this is probably not what

5
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:15,275
we intended, and we can even put better HTML in

6
00:00:15,275 --> 00:00:19,200
here. Potatoes, the marquee tag is always fun for this

7
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,954
sort of thing. And as you can see, we have

8
00:00:21,954 --> 00:00:25,240
now totally screwed up our shopping list. Now we discussed this

9
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:27,910
in the previous lesson. This is because we did not

10
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:31,060
escape our HTML when we displayed it allowing the user to

11
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:34,450
enter raw HTML into the page. Now, let's see what,

12
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:37,994
how this happened in practice. When we actually rendered our list,

13
00:00:37,994 --> 00:00:40,640
we're just sticking the raw HTML directly into the page,

14
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,140
allowing the user to put arbitrary HTML into our page. And

15
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:46,720
in this particular case, it's somewhat amusing. But if they had

16
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:50,480
inserted javascript into our page, which, to be fair, modern browsers

17
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,030
don't allow you do it anymore. They could actually do some

18
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:57,620
really nasty things, like, steal my authentication cookies and send it back

19
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:01,000
home. Which is a common way of breaking into websites that

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,940
I may or may not done a lot of in my youth.
