1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,857
The overall SIFT procedure to recognition was originally defined to

2
00:00:04,857 --> 00:00:07,041
have sort of four components.

3
00:00:07,041 --> 00:00:09,995
The first two were finding these extrema these,

4
00:00:09,995 --> 00:00:14,283
those are those maximums the difference in Gaussians that we looked at.

5
00:00:14,283 --> 00:00:17,785
And to detect, you know, localize exactly where they were.

6
00:00:17,785 --> 00:00:20,532
So, these days as I mentioned this before,

7
00:00:20,532 --> 00:00:24,492
a lot of people use the Harris-Laplace method of doing this instead.

8
00:00:24,492 --> 00:00:27,595
Where you do Laplace in scale and Harris in space, whatever it is.

9
00:00:27,595 --> 00:00:30,676
Use some method to find your keypoints, and

10
00:00:30,676 --> 00:00:35,102
also to determine the scale of the keypoints in the image.

11
00:00:35,102 --> 00:00:38,610
Then what you have to do, there are two more things related to SIFT and

12
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:40,074
we're going to do them today.

13
00:00:40,074 --> 00:00:43,511
The first is, we're going to define an orientation.

14
00:00:43,511 --> 00:00:46,631
That is, we don't know how the image has been transformed and

15
00:00:46,631 --> 00:00:50,418
of our little local neighborhood, we want to know what the orientation is.

16
00:00:50,418 --> 00:00:53,880
And then, once we have an orientation, we can think of

17
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:58,192
that feature with a spectator orientation and build a descriptor.

18
00:00:58,192 --> 00:01:00,361
And by the way, I'm using the phrase here, Keypoint.

19
00:01:00,361 --> 00:01:04,016
Keypoint was the terminology used in SIFT.

20
00:01:04,016 --> 00:01:06,776
What we're talking about is these detected interest points and, and

21
00:01:06,776 --> 00:01:09,737
you're going to use them as keypoints, you're going to use them as features.

22
00:01:09,737 --> 00:01:13,174
Keypoint description is the descriptor we're going to use.

23
00:01:13,174 --> 00:01:13,741
All right.

24
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:17,823
Here is a, a, a picture taken out of again the original SIFT work.

25
00:01:17,823 --> 00:01:20,448
Here is just a, a small image of a house on the left.

26
00:01:20,448 --> 00:01:24,251
And what this incredibly ugly graphic on the right is, is just.

27
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:27,054
And, and we've got better ones in a minute, but this was the original.

28
00:01:27,054 --> 00:01:31,712
Is just there were all these little keypoints, and

29
00:01:31,712 --> 00:01:34,795
you can see these direction arrows.

30
00:01:34,795 --> 00:01:36,063
Okay?

31
00:01:36,063 --> 00:01:39,333
And those directions are going to be the little local orientation that

32
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:40,490
we're talking about.
