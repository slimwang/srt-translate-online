1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,790
This lesson begins by reviewing the two
dimensional linear programming problems

2
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:08,300
that high school students often
solve in their algebra two classes.

3
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:12,620
Then it extends the equations to n
dimensions and captures the essential

4
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:18,290
intuition that optimal solutions are at
the corners of the feasible region.

5
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:20,380
And we state this rigorously,

6
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:23,140
with the fundamental theorem
of linear programming.

7
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:26,270
And then finally, the lesson will
cover the simplex algorithm,

8
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:29,950
a very practical way for
solving these optimizations.

9
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:32,800
There are many good references
on linear programming.

10
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,800
This treatment will follow most closely,
David Luenberger's Linear and

11
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,570
Nonlinear Programming.

12
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:42,110
Before we begin, however, I should
mention that parts of this lecture

13
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:45,680
will use notation and
some ideas from linear algebra.

14
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,210
For notation,
we will use capital letters for

15
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:52,190
matrices, thus A might
be this matrix here.

16
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:58,080
For column vectors, we'll use lower case
letters, so x might be this vector here.

17
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:02,010
Also, we'll often use
the lowercase version

18
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:03,870
of a matrix to indicate a column.

19
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:10,510
Thus, a two here refers to
the second column of the matrix A.

20
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:15,710
We indicate the transpose of the matrix
by giving it a T in the superscript, and

21
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:18,549
this just reverses the meaning
of the rows and columns.

22
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:24,550
This notation, then allows us to use
C transpose X for the dot product.

23
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:30,300
This is a row vector, times
a column vector, which ends up just

24
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:35,090
as a single entry matrix, which, by
convention, we'll interpret as a scalar.

25
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:41,080
As far as concepts go, the ideas of how
to represent a system of equations as

26
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:45,050
matrices of linear
independence of vectors,

27
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:48,810
matrix rank and
matrix inverse should all be familiar.

28
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,740
If these ideas aren't familiar
then it would be a good idea

29
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:56,470
to refresh your understanding before
watching the rest of this lesson.

30
00:01:56,470 --> 00:02:00,440
As always, it is recommended that you
watch with pencil and paper handy, so

31
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:03,950
that you can pause the video and
work out details on your own, as needed.
