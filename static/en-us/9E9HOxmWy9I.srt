00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:04,190
Now that we've learned about placing
objects in 3D space and how to give them

2
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:08,650
color using materials, how we go
about bringing these objects to life?

3
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:11,510
&gt;&gt; Well,
that's where animations come into play.

4
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:16,695
At it's most basic level, we can rotate
the hands of a clock just like this or

5
00:00:16,695 --> 00:00:20,460
at a more advanced level, we can
actually create some 3D characters and

6
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:22,238
animate them just like these guys.

7
00:00:22,238 --> 00:00:26,760
&gt;&gt; Wow, that's cool.

8
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,190
Animations are a great way
to bring your scene to life,

9
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:32,520
and they're also are really good
way the director uses attention,

10
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,768
because as humans we're very sensitive
to movement in our peripheral vision.

11
00:00:36,768 --> 00:00:37,475
&gt;&gt; Absolutely, and

12
00:00:37,475 --> 00:00:41,620
unity action makes it really easy with
the built in tool called mecanim.

13
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:43,220
So, let's learn how to use it.
