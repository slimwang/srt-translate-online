1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,850
And now for the moment you've been waiting for, let's hit this green Run button.

2
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:06,800
It will prompt us to choose a device, without a physical device we

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:10,700
can test the app, using the emulator that comes with the Android SDK.

4
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:13,640
An Android virtual device, should have already been created for

5
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:16,290
you automatically when you set up Android Studio.

6
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:19,010
So you can go ahead and click Ok.

7
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:22,100
While the emulator's booting up, I want to point out that if you ever want

8
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:25,940
to modify your emulator devices, you can click on this purple button, in

9
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:30,420
the Android and open up the AVD manager, to manage your Android virtual devices.

10
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:33,110
It lists out your existing devices, and

11
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:34,720
you can always create another virtual device.

12
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:37,400
You can select the category of device.

13
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,560
And then, a specific device.

14
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:43,650
Then you choose which platform version it should be running on, and

15
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:46,540
this is the only one that's available on this computer now.

16
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:51,010
So Lollipop is good, and we choose the Google's API target, because it

17
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:54,560
will include some Google services already pre-installed on the emulator.

18
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,790
You can choose Next.

19
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:58,998
There's a couple more options and settings that you can, modify.

20
00:00:58,998 --> 00:01:01,449
For example, if you want an SD card or

21
00:01:01,449 --> 00:01:04,610
a camera, and then you can go ahead and click Finish.

22
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:07,370
And it will create a new AVD for you.

23
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:11,300
When it loads up, we see our Sunshine app with the words, hello world.

24
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:14,100
Keep in mind that the emulator is not just a simulator.

25
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:17,820
It's actually running the Android virtual machine, so you can test and

26
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:20,620
debug your app, on different hardware and software configurations.

27
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:24,810
You can interact with the app on the emulator using the screen or

28
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:26,290
with the navigation controls here.

29
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:31,140
You can also invoke other apps, do network calls, play audio or

30
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:33,060
video and much more.

31
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:36,590
It also includes debug capabilities, including log output.

32
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:39,420
And the ability to simulate app interrupts or network it in C.

33
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:43,240
You can also head home and browse around the device to see other apps.

34
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:47,180
For example, you can check out API demos.

35
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:49,080
Feel free to play around with the emulator some more.

36
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:54,410
If you open up Android device monitor, you can go into the emulator control tab.

37
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:55,970
There you'll see different options for

38
00:01:55,970 --> 00:02:00,310
simulating behavior, on your AVD, such as for telephony and location.

39
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:05,230
Now that the Hello World app runs on the emulator,

40
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:08,030
let's see what goes on behind the scenes to make the app run.
