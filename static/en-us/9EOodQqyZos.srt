You may not always be

00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:05,320
I want you to try bootstrapping
an Angular app by hand.

00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:08,170
You need to create a module
with the name legoBuilder and

4
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:11,080
bootstrap the application using
the ng-app on the body tag.

5
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:13,100
A link to this project is
in the instructor notes.

6
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:16,630
When you have completed these steps, the
feedback extension will give you a code.

7
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:17,780
Enter that code on the next page.
