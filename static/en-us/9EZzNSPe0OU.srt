1
00:00:00,201 --> 00:00:04,058
So that sort of talks about the energy and now what we have to do is we

2
00:00:04,058 --> 00:00:08,689
have to talk about what is the relationship between the light coming in and

3
00:00:08,689 --> 00:00:09,977
the light going out.

4
00:00:09,977 --> 00:00:11,086
Because the light going out is

5
00:00:11,086 --> 00:00:13,180
the light that's going to go into your sensor, right?

6
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:14,420
And to model that,

7
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:19,459
we use what's called the Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function

8
00:00:19,459 --> 00:00:20,087
or BRDF.

9
00:00:20,087 --> 00:00:21,188
Okay?

10
00:00:21,188 --> 00:00:26,102
And the idea of the BRDF is that I've got a little surface patch that has

11
00:00:26,102 --> 00:00:26,861
a normal.

12
00:00:26,861 --> 00:00:29,146
And my light comes in at some angle and

13
00:00:29,146 --> 00:00:32,700
I'm going to be viewing it at some other angle, all right?

14
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:36,607
And I want to talk about the amount of, sort of the proportion of

15
00:00:36,607 --> 00:00:41,547
this light that comes in as, as sort of what proportion of this light coming in,

16
00:00:41,547 --> 00:00:45,713
in this direction, goes out in some other particular direction.

17
00:00:45,713 --> 00:00:49,183
By the way, this angle theta here, that's the tilt angle.

18
00:00:49,183 --> 00:00:51,952
That is the amount that you're off of the normal.

19
00:00:51,952 --> 00:00:56,891
And then there's a rotation around the normal that's the Okay?

20
00:00:56,891 --> 00:01:00,694
And for some surfaces, we actually have to worry about both of those angles.

21
00:01:00,694 --> 00:01:01,695
All right.

22
00:01:01,695 --> 00:01:05,695
And so the irradiance is the amount, just like we said before,

23
00:01:05,695 --> 00:01:09,705
it's the light per unit area that's coming onto the surface.

24
00:01:09,705 --> 00:01:14,652
And now it's radiance, because now it's not the radiance from the light source,

25
00:01:14,652 --> 00:01:17,912
it's the radiance back from the reflecting surface.

26
00:01:17,912 --> 00:01:18,412
Okay.

27
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:20,748
Remember, radiance is the stuff coming out.

28
00:01:20,748 --> 00:01:22,983
Irradiance is the stuff landing on it.

29
00:01:22,983 --> 00:01:23,888
So now we have the,

30
00:01:23,888 --> 00:01:27,121
before, the radiance was the stuff coming out of the light source.

31
00:01:27,121 --> 00:01:31,125
Now the radiance is the light coming up off the reflective surface.

32
00:01:31,125 --> 00:01:34,970
So we'll just write this as E of the irradiance of the surface in

33
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:36,665
some particular direction.

34
00:01:36,665 --> 00:01:38,165
The L is, I don't know.

35
00:01:38,165 --> 00:01:40,426
I don't know why we, I guess we use L for radiance sometimes,

36
00:01:40,426 --> 00:01:42,703
because it's the lightness of what you're going to be seeing.

37
00:01:42,703 --> 00:01:47,308
That's the radiance from the surface in some particular direction going out.

38
00:01:47,308 --> 00:01:52,357
And the BRDF, the Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function is

39
00:01:52,357 --> 00:01:54,849
just the ratio of those two things.

40
00:01:54,849 --> 00:01:55,416
Right?

41
00:01:55,416 --> 00:02:00,068
So it's the percentage of the light reflected as a function of

42
00:02:00,068 --> 00:02:02,223
the light coming in, okay?

43
00:02:02,223 --> 00:02:06,844
A couple things about it is that obviously, you can't reflect more light than

44
00:02:06,844 --> 00:02:09,866
came in, so that ratio is going to be less than one.

45
00:02:09,866 --> 00:02:12,863
Now you might get a very bright spot in some direction,

46
00:02:12,863 --> 00:02:16,004
if it were to integrate over all these different lights.

47
00:02:16,004 --> 00:02:20,311
But from one particular direction, the most I can do is send back all the light,

48
00:02:20,311 --> 00:02:22,510
I can't, I can't manufacture light.

49
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:24,419
This is a, a passive system here.
