1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,640
Okay, so here is our picture
of our court counter app, or

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:05,820
at least how we want it to look.

3
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:10,120
Now, I'm going to follow my own
advice and start with the XML first.

4
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:12,640
Let's think about the view
situation right now.

5
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:17,540
So, we still have all these views,
and these views are in vertical and

6
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:18,720
linear layouts.

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:23,270
We have a linear layout for team B and
a linear layout for team A.

8
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:26,574
and you can't just have two
root views so furthermore,

9
00:00:26,574 --> 00:00:30,793
these are wrapped in a linear layout,
which happens to be horizontal so

10
00:00:30,793 --> 00:00:35,200
that these two child linear layouts
can be next to one another.

11
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,230
Okay, now we want to add
a reset button down here.

12
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:40,920
For the sake of your brain not
exploding thinking about all these

13
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,800
different layouts, I want you to
think of everything inside of this

14
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,460
horizontal linear layout
kind of like a single view.

15
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:52,910
And now you're just trying to lay out
this horizontal linear layout right here

16
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:53,910
and this reset button.

17
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:56,850
You're trying to lay out two views.

18
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:01,570
One view is at the top and the other
view is at the bottom of the screen.

19
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:05,680
So the question now is what view
group would allow you to have

20
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,800
a view up here at the top and
a view down by the bottom of the screen?

21
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:13,450
And it turns out that a relative layout
is a pretty good candidate for this.

22
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:17,310
I can have my horizontal linear
layout here, match the parent for

23
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:19,560
the width, and
then wrap content for the height.

24
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:24,490
And I can have my reset button right
here, align with the center and

25
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:26,060
bottom of the pairing.

26
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:28,510
Okay, so you have a Relative Layout, and

27
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:33,340
that Relative Layout has a Button
child and a Linear Layout child.

28
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:36,120
And the Button child is
this Reset button, and

29
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:40,430
the Linear Layout is the Linear Layout
here, the horizontal one.

30
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:44,060
Furthermore, this horizontal linear
layout has two children, and

31
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:46,810
those children are also linear layouts.

32
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:49,870
They are the linear layout for
team A and the linear layout for

33
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:51,670
team B that you see here.

34
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:57,280
The linear layout for team A has
two text views and three buttons.

35
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,170
The same is true of this
linear layout for team B.

36
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:03,160
Five children, two text views,
and three buttons.

37
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,260
This portion of the layout
you've already made,

38
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:08,770
you just need to add this,
all right, let's do it.

39
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:13,035
Okay, I'm here in my XML code and so the
first thing I'm going to do is is I'm

40
00:02:13,035 --> 00:02:18,010
going to make the Root Relative Layout
that you saw in the diagram.

41
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:23,580
So here going to type RelativeLayout,
and I actually want

42
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:28,440
to cut and paste these two lines because
they need to be in the root layout.

43
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:33,920
So I'm cutting them and I'm pasting
them here, in my root layout.

44
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,260
Okay, now I'm going to close
off my RelativeLayout here and

45
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:43,500
I'm going to move this closing
tag all the way to the bottom.

46
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:49,470
Okay, so what I essentially have right
now Is this part of the diagram.

47
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:52,610
All right,
looks like I have some errors as well.

48
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:57,210
Let's see, yes, I haven't defined
a height or a width, so let's do that.

49
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:02,250
Now my relative layout had the button
at the bottom center of the screen.

50
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:05,260
So, to do that, it's probably going to
need to fill the whole screen.

51
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:06,960
So I'm going to do
match parents on both.

52
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:11,530
Okay, now I need to add the button.

53
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:17,587
I'm going to scroll down, right here,
to where the linear layout closes,

54
00:03:17,587 --> 00:03:23,462
but I still am inside the relative
layout, and I'm going to add a button.

55
00:03:23,462 --> 00:03:26,664
And I'm going to go ahead and
wrap content for that button,

56
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:30,398
because it's not a button that
expands to fill the entire bottom of

57
00:03:30,398 --> 00:03:33,150
the screen or
expands to fill the entire screen.

58
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:36,640
And now the parent of this button
is the RelativeLayout, and

59
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,370
we're going to set the text
of this button to Reset.

60
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:43,390
Let's see what this looks like.

61
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:46,960
Okay so my reset button's up here,
that's not exactly where I want it to

62
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:51,730
be, but it's parent is relatively out,
that fills up the entire screen.

63
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:54,240
So I can align it to the parent.

64
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,450
I want to align it to
the parents bottom, and

65
00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:01,170
I want it to be in the center of
the parent, horizontally anyways.

66
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:04,150
Cool, my button seems to
be in the right place.

67
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:06,270
I'm going to select everything here.

68
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:09,560
And I'm going to do
a command option L on Mac.

69
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:14,490
Which is the same thing as Control-Alt-L
on Windows to just reformat the code and

70
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:15,890
get it to look nice.

71
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:18,690
Okay let's go back to our Java code.

72
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:23,190
Now I've got my button but
it's not doing anything.

73
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:25,690
Let's start by making a method for it.

74
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:32,250
I'm going to make this right above
the display methods, here, public void.

75
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:35,100
I'm going to call this
method resetScore,

76
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:38,180
because that's what I intend for
it to do.

77
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:42,860
Scroll up, I'm going to make
it match these other methods

78
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:46,670
with the View v, and then, curly braces.

79
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:50,100
I won't worry about what's
going to go in here for now.

80
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:53,200
I'm going to go back to my XML code And

81
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:57,200
I'm going to do the second part of
the hooking the button to the Java code

82
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:01,970
by adding a onClick attribute here for
resetScore.

83
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:06,310
Okay, so now when I click this button
the code here will be run, but

84
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:08,110
there isn't any code here.

85
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:09,290
Let's figure out what I need to add.

86
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:13,750
Okay, let's go back to this
discussion of pseudoCode.

87
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:17,340
When I hit the Reset button,
what do I want to happen?

88
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:20,950
Well, I want both of these
two scores to show 0.

89
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:24,130
Furthermore, I want the variables for
score team A and for

90
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:26,740
score team B to go back to zero.

91
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:30,330
Remember, when I click on any of
these buttons, I'm adding two and

92
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,060
then displaying the variable.

93
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:33,820
So, if I don't put
the variable back to zero,

94
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:36,160
it's going to show an incorrect number.

95
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,300
So here’s what I came up
with pseudoCode-wise.

96
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:43,380
The first thing I want to do is
set the score for Team A to zero.

97
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:46,440
Then I want to do the same thing for
Team B.

98
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:50,260
Now both of the scores are zero, but
nothing's been displayed yet, which is

99
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:54,570
why in Step 3 I'll display the score for
Team A, which has been set to zero.

100
00:05:55,850 --> 00:06:00,185
And to be a little bit more specific,
I’m going to display the score for

101
00:06:00,185 --> 00:06:04,091
Team A here, and then I'll display
the score for Team B here.

102
00:06:04,091 --> 00:06:07,610
And because in Steps 1 and 2,
I've ensured that they're set to zero,

103
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:10,230
they will display zero here and here.

104
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:14,400
Then when I click any of these
buttons to update ScoreForTeamA or

105
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,389
ScoreForTeamB, it's going to be updating
but starting with a score of zero.

106
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:23,984
Okay, so in reset score I'm going to
type my pseudo code as code, code.

107
00:06:23,984 --> 00:06:28,952
So the first thing I'm going to do is
take score A and set it's value to

108
00:06:28,952 --> 00:06:34,010
zero using a assignment operator
here and the value of zero.

109
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:35,800
Oh and
don't forget the semi colon of course.

110
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,550
I'll do the same for score B.

111
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:48,515
After that, I'm going to display in
the team A spot, the score for team A.

112
00:06:48,515 --> 00:06:53,150
And then I'm going to display in
the team B spot, the score for team B.

113
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:57,289
I'll also go ahead here and
add a comment.

114
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:00,080
Okay, this all seems reasonable.

115
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,750
And it's been a while since I've
run anything on my phone, so

116
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:06,587
I'm going to press the Run button,
okay, cool.

117
00:07:06,587 --> 00:07:08,000
I have a RESET button.

118
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,997
Let's see if it works.

119
00:07:13,339 --> 00:07:14,732
Good, it sets to zero.

120
00:07:14,732 --> 00:07:16,500
Let's click a little bit more,

121
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,457
just to make sure that
everything's still working.

122
00:07:23,961 --> 00:07:28,338
Cool, and it looks like it is, awesome.

123
00:07:28,338 --> 00:07:30,270
Now this was a little
bit of a tricky one.

124
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:33,720
So let me show you what happens if
you were to switch around the order,

125
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,050
do something a little bit differently.

126
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:38,890
What if I switch these two around?

127
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:40,809
Well, let's just see what happens.

128
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:45,710
Okay, so here it is,
let's see what it does.

129
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:47,660
Okay, so I'm going to add some points.

130
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:53,080
Now for the moment of truth,
Reset button.

131
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,850
Huh, doesn't seem to do anything.

132
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:59,090
Let's try clicking, huh, interesting.

133
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:00,520
Well it's kind of hard to see,

134
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:05,470
but the score before said 19,
I hit the reset button nothing changed.

135
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:07,650
But then when I hit free
throw it showed one.

136
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:12,500
Lets try with the other side,
if I hit plus two points.

137
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,220
Oh, it shows two.

138
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:17,600
Lets look at the code again for
why that might be the case.

139
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:21,490
So I switched around displaying and
setting the score.

140
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:24,870
Just to see what kind of error
behavior I might get from that.

141
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:29,732
Let's say TeamA has a score of 30 and
TeamB has a score of 40.

142
00:08:29,732 --> 00:08:33,049
When I say displayForTeamA
it's going to show 30 and

143
00:08:33,049 --> 00:08:37,230
when I say displayForTeamB
it's going to show 40.

144
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:41,490
Only after that, will it actually
set these values to zero.

145
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:45,730
But since it displayed first it's not
going to show the values of zero.

146
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:48,440
But the variable will be zero.

147
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:53,430
So when I press something like
addThreeForTeamB, it's going to take

148
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:59,960
the value of zero that I set down here,
add three, and then display three.

149
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:06,490
So to us, it would look like TeamB
went from having a score of 30 then to

150
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:11,630
after clicking the reset button, a score
of three, which is kind of a weird jump.

151
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:15,490
Now one way I could fix this besides
swapping it back to how it should be

152
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:19,370
Is I could put display zero here.

153
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:22,390
And you can test this out on your own,
but this would actually work.

154
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:24,200
It's just a little bit counterintuitive.

155
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:29,080
I like showing examples like this
because it kind of shows the beauty and

156
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,800
subjectivity of code.

157
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,360
Now, in this case, I happen to think
fairly strongly that the first way that

158
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,290
I had the code was better.

159
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:39,130
But you might start seeing scenarios
where there could be two different

160
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:42,880
ways to write the code, and
both of them are technically correct.

161
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,430
Since there isn't always
one right answer,

162
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:49,140
you shouldn't feel constricted
to do it the exact correct way.

163
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:52,600
Try coding up something that works
your way, see how other people do it,

164
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:57,640
and then compare, who's more efficient,
whose code is clearer.

165
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:00,770
These kind of discussions could be
a really helpful learning experience.

166
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:04,030
Okay, but I'm going to revert the code
back to the state that it was before

167
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:05,390
which was working and

168
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:09,660
now I have all the functionality of my
app but it's not pretty, let's fix that.
