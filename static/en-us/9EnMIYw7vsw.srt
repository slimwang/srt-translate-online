00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I just hope you answered "yes."

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
If you answered "no," please go through the same sequence again,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
because the steps end up to be relatively straightforward

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
even though they're somewhat uncommon.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
But if you understand it, you can now go and implement particle filters

6
00:00:15,000 --> 99:59:59,999
for the great range of robotics applications.
