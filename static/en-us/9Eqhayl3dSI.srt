00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:04,070
We've already spoken to you about
the importance of user feedback.

2
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:07,640
Learning from and responding to
feedback is incredibly important.

3
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:11,390
But now, let's hear from the expert
about their real world experience using

4
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:15,340
feedback to learn about their customer's
needs and to better their product.

5
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:17,327
>> So
I am VP of mobile a UserTesting, and

6
00:00:17,327 --> 00:00:20,870
UserTesting is a company that lets
you get really, really fast turn

7
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:24,431
around videos of normal people
using your application or website.

8
00:00:24,431 --> 00:00:28,238
So you come to us, you define the test
you need, the demographics, and

9
00:00:28,238 --> 00:00:30,940
you get videos back often
in as little as an hour.

10
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:32,560
So it's a really fast turnaround.

11
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,500
So what you can learn on the marketing
side is getting more insights into

12
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:39,340
what's going on in the heads of your
customers and how well are you matching

13
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:42,090
what's happening in what
they're thinking about.

14
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:46,150
So it can be early stages when you're
working on your marketing materials,

15
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:49,980
testing it out on people, finding out
what sorts of things they respond to

16
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:52,060
well and which things they don't like.

17
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:53,060
Or it can be later on,

18
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:55,178
after you've launched when
you're looking at analytics or

19
00:00:55,178 --> 00:00:57,997
things like that and trying to get
more insights on the behaviours that

20
00:00:57,997 --> 00:01:00,210
you're seeing in what
customers are doing.

21
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:05,740
So times when you can use user tests
just alone, there are two categories.

22
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:09,790
One is when you're really interested
just in understanding emotional context,

23
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:11,910
because analytics won't
give you that stuff at all,

24
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:15,830
it's like how are they feeling about it,
are they feeling engaged,

25
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:20,700
are they interested, are they feeling
like they're making progress?

26
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:23,560
And sometimes when I watch the videos,
I actually just look for

27
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,100
tone of voice more than anything else.

28
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:31,321
So for example, if you're testing an app
and at some point during the test,

29
00:01:31,321 --> 00:01:36,717
the user sighs, they do this [SOUND],
you know you're in deep, deep trouble.

30
00:01:36,717 --> 00:01:39,590
I mean,
it could be a in foreign language.

31
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:43,920
If you just hear, or the tone of voice
is, well, you kind of get that trailing

32
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,319
off tone of voice, what that is telling
you is that you are failing to grab them

33
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:52,718
emotionally which means you are not
creating the motivation which will cause

34
00:01:52,718 --> 00:01:55,763
them to come back in the future
to use your app again and

35
00:01:55,763 --> 00:01:59,042
you've really got a problem
that you need to go dig into.

36
00:01:59,042 --> 00:02:02,745
I think the second place where
the user test can stand alone is when

37
00:02:02,745 --> 00:02:07,186
the conclusions are so clear that, hey
we don't need [LAUGH] analysis on this,

38
00:02:07,186 --> 00:02:09,985
it's really obvious what's going on.

39
00:02:09,985 --> 00:02:15,570
And one class of these is when you find
that there's particular language or

40
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:18,930
maybe an icon design or something like
that that just doesn't work for them.

41
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:23,230
And a lot of times, because the team
has been working on the app for

42
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:27,810
a long time, you get this kind
of group think situation where

43
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:31,580
because it's become clear to you over
time that this is how it should work, or

44
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:33,600
this is what the context
of this stuff means,

45
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,580
this phrase is very meaningful to
the team for describing the application,

46
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:40,500
therefore, it's gotta mean
the same thing to the users.

47
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:45,040
And what you'll find very often is it
is not intuitive to them and actually,

48
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,390
you need to step back and
get inside their head and

49
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:50,840
the user test can show you that
sort of stuff very quickly.

50
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,590
If the icon is not intuitive,
they'll just look at it and

51
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:56,290
say, what the heck am
I supposed to do here?

52
00:02:56,290 --> 00:02:59,140
And that's the point where you need to
think about, okay, either redraw it or

53
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:01,950
maybe add a text label,
which is not sexy,

54
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:06,440
it doesn't look beautiful, but we're
after usability more than we are beauty.

55
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,070
I mean,
it's great if you can get both, but

56
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:11,760
I'd rather have it be usable first and
then pretty it up as much as you can.

57
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,660
The user test can be a great way to
very rapidly get those insights, so

58
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:17,110
you can fix them right in the moment.
