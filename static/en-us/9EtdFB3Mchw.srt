1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
I now have a stereo question.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
For a valid calibrated stereo rig, we're given two pinhole cameras

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
whose displacement is B, and we observe a point out in the scene.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:19,000
The distance of this point to the image plane up uppercase Z.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Our cameras have a focal length of f.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Of course, this point is being projected into two different locations

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
for the two different images--x2 and x1.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:36,000
For the sake of this question, we're going to just consider delta x, which is x2 minus x1--

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
the displacement in the corresponding images.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
We measure delta x in millimeters, same with the focal length f.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
B is in meters and so is Z,

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
and I use meters for B and Z so that the units effectively fall out.

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
You don't really have to consider them.

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Suppose the measured delta x is 4 mm

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
with a focal length of 40, and our displacement is 0.1.

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
How far away is the object in meters?

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Suppose we have a displacement of 0.05 mm for a focal length of 50.

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:20,000
We now care about the baseline B, if we happen to know the object is 100 meters away.

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Next we have a displacement of 0.1 mm. We don't know our focal length.

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:32,000
We know that the baseline is 0.2 mm, and the object is 50 meters away.

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Finally we don't know the displacement, but we do know that the focal length is 200 mm.

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
We have a baseline of 1 m and the object is 50 meters away.

23
00:01:44,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Can you fill in the missing numbers?
