00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,910
An agent interacts with the environment
by sensing its properties.

2
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:07,589
This is known as perception and
by producing useful output or

3
00:00:07,589 --> 00:00:11,250
actions that typically change
the state of the environment.

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:14,669
The process by which an agent
decides what action to take

5
00:00:14,669 --> 00:00:18,129
based on its perceived
inputs is called cognition.

6
00:00:18,129 --> 00:00:22,589
Much of our discussion of AI will focus
on cognition, especially reasoning and

7
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:23,839
decision making.

8
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:27,109
Perception and action become more
relevant in systems that react with

9
00:00:27,109 --> 00:00:30,669
the real world, such as robots and
self-driving cars.

10
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:34,429
>> Now some agents directly associate
their actions with what is perceived or

11
00:00:34,429 --> 00:00:36,197
have very simple
pre-programmed behaviors.

12
00:00:36,197 --> 00:00:39,631
>> [SOUND] Like an automated
trashcan that opens when

13
00:00:39,631 --> 00:00:42,148
it senses something in front of it.

14
00:00:42,148 --> 00:00:46,030
>> These are referred to as,
reactive or behavior based agents.

15
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:49,310
Now it's possible to accomplish
surprisingly complex behavior

16
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:52,859
by layering simple reactive
control in a hierarchy.

17
00:00:52,859 --> 00:00:56,454
Now, on the other end of the spectrum,
some agents are more deliberate and

18
00:00:56,454 --> 00:01:00,289
perform some non trivial processing
such as game playing agents, or

19
00:01:00,289 --> 00:01:01,689
path planners.

20
00:01:01,689 --> 00:01:05,030
We can further classify these agents
depending on the kind of processing they

21
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:09,219
do like knowledge based agents, planning
agents, learning agents, and so on.
