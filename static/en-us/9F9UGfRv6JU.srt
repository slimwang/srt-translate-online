1
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:03,940
We've just gone over the essential
things that you need

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:07,220
to be able to train a simple
linear classification model.

3
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:07,810
Now, it's your turn.

4
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:10,690
How well does this work?

5
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:13,170
Pretty well, as you will see
in your first assignment.

6
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:15,375
The first part of it will
have you download and

7
00:00:15,375 --> 00:00:20,130
pre-process an image data set that you
will be reusing throughout the lectures,

8
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:21,970
and that you can use
yourself to experiment with.

9
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:26,710
The second part will have you go
through an exact re-implementation,

10
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:27,870
piece by piece,

11
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:31,330
of all the components of the logistic
classifier that we've discussed so far.

12
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:36,779
Make sure that you carefully step
through the code before coming back to

13
00:00:36,779 --> 00:00:37,542
the videos.

14
00:00:37,542 --> 00:00:40,334
Run it, break it, tinker with it.

15
00:00:40,334 --> 00:00:42,599
We'll be building on top of it for
the rest of the lecture.

16
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:47,610
You'll also quickly see some of
the problems with the simple approach.

17
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:48,870
It can be very slow.

18
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:49,640
Even for

19
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:54,510
a simple model like this linear model on
a very small amount of training data.

20
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:56,950
Scaling this up is what
deep learning is all about.
