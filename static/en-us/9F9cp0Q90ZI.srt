00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,330
Here's a list of the kinds of
data that must be collected.

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:08,130
The reason for some of these should
be clear from our prior discussions.

3
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:12,130
Smoking status, to help prevent
the development of chronic disease.

4
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:17,790
Maintaining an active medication list,
to avoid duplicate or

5
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:20,390
inappropriate medications.

6
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:25,330
Performing a drug formulary check,
to make sure the best

7
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:30,540
available medication is chosen for
each clinical situation.

8
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:33,470
And maintaining a current problem list.

9
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:37,370
So that each provider has
a more complete overview

10
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:40,850
of what's going on in
their patients care.

11
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:44,800
Keep this list in mind,
as we later discuss meaningful use.

12
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,410
The EHR usage requirements
placed on eligible providers.
