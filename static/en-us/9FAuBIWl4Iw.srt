1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,756
So going back to our mani-core challenges, we have

2
00:00:02,756 --> 00:00:05,588
looked at how to handle the increase in coherence traffic

3
00:00:05,588 --> 00:00:08,730
on-chip. We looked at how to deal with the increase

4
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:12,107
in the off-chip traffic. We looked at how to have

5
00:00:12,107 --> 00:00:15,786
a directory on-chip that is not too large. We looked

6
00:00:15,786 --> 00:00:18,142
at how to solve the problem of the splitting of

7
00:00:18,142 --> 00:00:21,304
the power budget among cores even when they're running very

8
00:00:21,304 --> 00:00:25,222
few threads. And finally we looked at the problem of,

9
00:00:25,222 --> 00:00:29,434
what to do in an operating system when there are multi-threaded

10
00:00:29,434 --> 00:00:33,450
cores and maybe multiple chips like that in the same system.
