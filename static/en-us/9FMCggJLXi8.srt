1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,550
Having done this, what we,
let's see, what have we done so far?

2
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:04,920
Well what we've done is,

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:09,560
we've figured out the best possible
line in sort of two dimensions.

4
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:10,610
Okay?

5
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:16,040
Well great except what if, a, suppose
my features are not in two dimensions?

6
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:18,340
Okay.
And also,

7
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:23,830
I've been sort of assuming that
I could actually draw a line.

8
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:27,250
Well, what if my categories
are not linearly separable?

9
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:32,910
All right, and hm, what if I have
more than just two categories?

10
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:33,700
Well, what we're going to do is,

11
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,910
we're going to knock down
those questions one at a time,

12
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:37,220
going forward for SBMs.

13
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:41,680
So we're going to start with, what if
the features are not two-dimensional?

14
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:42,760
Okay?

15
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:44,160
Well actually,

16
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:49,395
nothing about what I showed you in
the math required that it be 2D, right?

17
00:00:49,395 --> 00:00:52,400
W.X. I didn't tell you that
X has to be two dimensional.

18
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,890
No, it can be any dimensional.

19
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:56,460
Or D dimensional, N dimensional,
whatever you want.

20
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:57,600
It just basically,

21
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,310
you're now instead of using a line
you're creating a hyperplane.

22
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:04,935
The math is exactly the same because
remember a plane is set, remember how

23
00:01:04,935 --> 00:01:10,560
a line was defined, in fact so,
in 2D a line was defined by the normal.

24
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,200
Well in 3D,
oh this is going to be priceless,

25
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,270
a plane is defined by the normal, right.

26
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:20,510
So as long as they have this normal W,
I'm getting a plane.

27
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:21,860
In 3D, it's a real plane.

28
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:24,680
In ND, it's an M minus one hyper plane.

29
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:27,910
But other than that all
the math is the same.

30
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:30,780
And in fact, using just that

31
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:33,920
machinery you can actually do some
pretty cool stuff in computer vision.
