1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:01,740
All right, you're done!

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:02,620
Let me show you what I did.

3
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:06,310
So the first thing I did
was create some new themes.

4
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:09,910
I created an AppTheme.Main and
AppTheme.Details.

5
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:11,530
And those are both
derived from AppTheme.

6
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:15,290
And I have put them in the main
styles just so I can keep them there.

7
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:18,260
And I'm mostly keeping this stuff out
just because it's nice to keep all this

8
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:21,855
v21 stuff out of the old,
old Android Stuff.

9
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:25,140
So then we go to v21, and

10
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,160
I have actually created
these styles now with name.

11
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:33,570
Just turning
windowContentTransitions on, and

12
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:37,290
then details referencing these enter and
return transitions.

13
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:39,249
Which look a lot like
the ones that I showed you.

14
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:45,032
So if we look at our transitions we
actually now have transition resources.

15
00:00:45,032 --> 00:00:49,750
As you can see we have two different
kinds of transitions, one for

16
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:53,180
v21 and one for
landscape v21 which is pretty cool.

17
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:58,315
So, in the case that we are in

18
00:00:58,315 --> 00:01:00,530
non-landscape it's
pretty straight forward.

19
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:03,040
It's exactly what I showed you before.

20
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,590
We're ordering them together.

21
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:06,340
It's a half second long,

22
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:10,260
we're going to fade everything that's
not the status bar and nav bar.

23
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:13,680
We're going to slide
the toolbar from the top,

24
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,540
and we're going to slide the additional
pane in from the bottom.

25
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:19,360
So very, very straightforward.

26
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,130
And for landscape, the only difference
is we're going to slide the additional

27
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:24,820
pane in from the right,
because that looks a lot nicer.

28
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:27,720
Then for the return transition,

29
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:32,370
we slide that one out from
the bottom in the case of portrait.

30
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:34,590
And in landscape, we slide it off right.

31
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:37,400
So, very, very straightforward there,
in terms of adding the transition set.

32
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,010
And then the only question really is,

33
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:45,330
where do we actually go to
kick off our animation?

34
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:48,945
And, of course, a good spot for
that is in MainActivity.

35
00:01:48,945 --> 00:01:51,420
MainActivity knows a lot
about what's going on, but

36
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:54,155
it also is a thing that actually
is responsible for launching this.

37
00:01:54,155 --> 00:01:58,040
MainActivity, if we're
not in two pane mode,

38
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:01,180
is actually responsible for
launching that next activity.

39
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:05,050
And we just call ActivityOptionsCompat,
makeSceneTransitionAnimation and

40
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:06,270
then start the activity.

41
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:07,700
And we are done.

42
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,669
And we have a very,
very simple transition.
