1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,830
Before we go on, I actually do want to, throw a little bit of a,

2
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:07,090
a wrench into this, whole analysis method.

3
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:09,906
We're going to use a 1-D example to help us understand this.

4
00:00:09,906 --> 00:00:16,120
Imagine a 1-D signal, basically has a lot of value down here, minus 1,

5
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:22,220
then a ramp up and positive 1, you can imagine this to be a simple signal,

6
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:27,400
that basically could be an image, which has black,

7
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:31,710
here, and white there, and of course, we is counting it this way.

8
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:36,090
And of course, there's some sort of blurry, boundary between them,

9
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:36,720
therefore the ramp.

10
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:43,420
Of course, now the question is, what happens when I actually do a column by

11
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:48,020
column, that is just in this direction a differential of this.

12
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:52,100
There's a lot of noise here, and you can see some of the noise in this, there.

13
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:56,670
The derivative of this signal, just the 1-D signal,

14
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:02,610
in its x will only be kind of capturing the details of the local differences,

15
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:05,280
and in fact, when it gets to this point here,

16
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,880
you can see a little bit of change, but not much, and in fact,

17
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:15,670
by looking at this, you can imagine that, it would be hard to actually look for

18
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:22,440
a sudden change in gradient, just because it's mostly capturing the noise.

19
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:27,410
So the essence, in essence, it's, really gets harder to detect an edge, and

20
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:29,710
there is significant noise in the signal,

21
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:32,300
something we will have to start thinking about how we can avoid.
