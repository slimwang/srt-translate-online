00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Not only would I start using arbitrary debugging statements everywhere,

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I would also try to debug the program into existence. Just change things until they work.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Let me try. The error of this may have something to do with quotes.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
So don't just simply go and remove all these extra quote checks in here.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Let me see whether this makes any difference. Okay. I removed all the quote checks.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Let's see whether it works right now, and we run the program and see--it's foo.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The output is foo. It's almost correct. Only the quotes are missing.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Well, now we can handle the quote--maybe we will just remove this in order to align in here,

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
and may be we can change things until things are proper.

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Let me see whether this works. Same. Oh yeah, great. Let me see. Okay.

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:59,000
And I can run the thing again and--however, I think I removed too much at this point

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:08,000
because if you recall our original example--the one with the greater than sign here in the target URL

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
that we now still get this error in here, the quote is in here which should belong here,

14
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
which is why we introduce quote handling in the first place.

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
So now actually, maybe I should go back to this earlier version,

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
but how do I get back to the earlier version.

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Well, of course, I did never backup my earlier version.

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:33,000
So I don't even know what the earlier version was. This more or less was my state of debugging.

19
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
This is how I debug as a student, which was not the perfect way to do it.
