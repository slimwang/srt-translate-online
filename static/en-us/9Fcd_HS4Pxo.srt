1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:03,649
[SOUND] All right,
we just wrote a lot of lines of code.

2
00:00:03,649 --> 00:00:06,643
So now, I'm actually going to show you
another way we could've written that

3
00:00:06,643 --> 00:00:09,170
clickListener without
writing that many lines.

4
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:12,060
And as developers,
we like to be as concise as possible,

5
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:14,660
which makes the code easier for
other people to read.

6
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:17,130
Now, I here at the MainActivity.java.

7
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:19,920
Notice that we created
the OnClickListener variable here, but

8
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,740
only use it once here.

9
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:25,770
So I'm going to show you a new way that
we can create that object in line.

10
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:28,860
So I'm going to cut that part out and
replace the object here.

11
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:30,340
Nice.

12
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:32,271
Now, I can go ahead and
delete this line.

13
00:00:32,271 --> 00:00:34,647
And now the code is simplified and
looks like this.

14
00:00:34,647 --> 00:00:37,240
So less lines of code,
right, looks better.

15
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,860
I want to show you how we can
make it even more concise.

16
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:43,780
So instead of creating an entirely
new NumbersClickListener class

17
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:47,190
in a completely new file,
we can actually declare it in line

18
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:49,790
when we're calling the set
OnClickListener method.

19
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:52,810
So now I'm going to replace
what I just put in here,

20
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:56,830
this new NumbersClickListener
with OnClickListener and remember

21
00:00:56,830 --> 00:01:00,760
the NumbersClickListener implemented
from the OnClickListener class.

22
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:03,287
Now, I'm going to add an open brace and
go ahead and

23
00:01:03,287 --> 00:01:06,590
implement the OnClick method,
right here in line.

24
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:09,200
So no extra Java class would be needed.

25
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,950
Now I can put anything I
want in the onClick method.

26
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:16,740
I can display a toast or make it open
the numbers activity or anything else.

27
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:20,380
So given that, let's add some code
to open the numbers activity.

28
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:24,418
And if you remember the code from
before, we can create a new intent and

29
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:26,551
call start activity on that intent.

30
00:01:26,551 --> 00:01:30,157
And let's see what that looks like,
remember to pay close attention

31
00:01:30,157 --> 00:01:35,350
to the closing braces, parenthesis and
semicolons at the end of each sentence.

32
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:38,960
So it's very common place to
miss one but luckily in studio,

33
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,662
remember that if you click on a brace,
it'll highlighted its brace partner.

34
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:46,570
Now I'm going to go back and
delete the NumbersClickListener file

35
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:48,110
because it's not going
to be used anywhere now.

36
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:52,250
I've essentially moved that
code into my main activity.

37
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:55,485
What we learned before is equivalent
to this new way of creating click

38
00:01:55,485 --> 00:01:59,740
listeners, and hear the same three steps
in a shorter number of lines of code.

39
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:00,440
For the most part,

40
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:03,320
I always set up my click listeners
this way, in line as they're needed.

41
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:06,440
It makes the code easier to read
because the logic of the click listener

42
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:09,220
is close by the view as
opposed to in a separate file.

43
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:12,180
Of course, there are always cases
when this isn't that ideal.

44
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:15,980
But if you have a click listener that is
used in many places across your code,

45
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:17,110
then you don't have to keep copy and

46
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:20,280
pasting the same block of code
in different files in your app.

47
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,620
Now, it's your turn.

48
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:25,913
Within the main activity file, attach
click listeners to each of the category

49
00:02:25,913 --> 00:02:29,177
views for numbers, phrases,
colors and family members.

50
00:02:29,177 --> 00:02:32,766
The to click listeners in line,
as we showed you most recently, and

51
00:02:32,766 --> 00:02:35,570
we've included the code for
you to use as a reference.

52
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:36,070
Good luck.
