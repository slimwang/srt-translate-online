00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:04,884
Looking back at our work, we can simplify a complex fraction by following these

2
00:00:04,884 --> 00:00:10,547
steps. First we want to find the LCD of the internal fractions, each of these.

3
00:00:10,548 --> 00:00:16,210
Then we multiply our complex fraction by the LCD divided by the LCD. We can do

4
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:21,094
this since this is really a form of 1. We'll change what this fraction looks

5
00:00:21,094 --> 00:00:25,840
like, but we won't change its value. Then we'll distribute the LCD to each term,

6
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:30,910
like we did here, and then we'll simplify to get our final answer. Let's see if

7
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:33,333
you can do the next one in a couple of steps.
