[Norvig] My answer is I think these first 2 are both quite good.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Either of them would work just fine.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:13,000
The set one I think would work great for a regular deck of cards with 52 cards,

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
but it might not work well if you had wild cards

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
or if you were playing with a big shoe of 2 decks.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Then you might have 2 of the exact same card,

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
and then a set can't represent that.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
This string has all the information, and so you could deal with that,

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
but at some point you're going to want to break this string up into 5 individual cards.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
It's just easier to have that done right from the start

11
00:00:34,000 --> 99:59:59,999
rather than have to do the operation on it.
