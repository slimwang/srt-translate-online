1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,980
So our current widget focuses on
one thing, today's weather, and

2
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:05,510
I'm kind of okay with that.

3
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:09,310
However, there are certainly times when
quick access to the entire forecast

4
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:10,380
would be helpful.

5
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:13,080
For that case,
we can build a collection widget.

6
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:17,340
These widgets control full list, grid,
or stack of elements, perfect for

7
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:19,570
showing off the upcoming forecast.

8
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:23,190
Good starting point for
this is a simple list view widget.

9
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:27,810
The top banner can open Sunshine itself,
while below the list offers

10
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:30,940
direct access to the forecast
of each upcoming day.

11
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:33,320
Clicking on one of these will
go directly to the detail

12
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,200
page for that day.

13
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:40,590
So, I'll layout style and header click
behavior the same as our today widget.

14
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:43,650
Filling in the data on our list
here is a different story.

15
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:47,110
For that,
we'll use a remote view service.

16
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:51,860
The remote view service is responsible
for creating a RemoteViewsFactory.

17
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:55,600
Think of it as the equivalent to
a cursor adapter, that's specifically

18
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,610
designed for returning remote views,
suitable for widgets.

19
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:02,560
Note the special permission,
BIND_REMOTEVIEWS.

20
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:05,300
This is what lets the system
bind your service to

21
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:07,060
create your remote views for each row.

22
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:10,900
To tell our remote views to
connect to our RemoteViewsFactory,

23
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:14,060
you'll use
the setRemoteViewsAdaptors method.

24
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:17,650
This method kicks of
the RemoteViewsFactory's life cycle,

25
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:21,900
causing our data to reload and
remote views created for each row.

26
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:25,527
To update our widget based on new data,
we can still use the same

27
00:01:25,527 --> 00:01:29,846
technique as our Today widget,
in receiving the data updated broadcast.

28
00:01:29,846 --> 00:01:34,115
But instead of calling an Intent Service
to update the whole widget,

29
00:01:34,115 --> 00:01:37,944
we can just call the
NotifyAppWidgetViewDataChanged method

30
00:01:37,944 --> 00:01:41,780
to trigger the onDataSetChanged
three queries for new data.

31
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:45,560
So if that's all it takes to
get data into our widget, and

32
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:48,050
get out list populated,
we're done right?

33
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:49,731
In some cases, sure.

34
00:01:49,731 --> 00:01:52,436
But we're trying to make
this production ready.

35
00:01:52,436 --> 00:01:56,348
What we really want is to be able
to tap on a particular day and

36
00:01:56,348 --> 00:01:59,027
go directly to the details of that date.

37
00:01:59,027 --> 00:02:02,758
If your mind is already spinning on
where to add the set on click pending

38
00:02:02,758 --> 00:02:04,656
intent method to get this working,

39
00:02:04,656 --> 00:02:09,190
you'll be happy to know that there's
some tools which make this easier.

40
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:13,240
The idea is that each element
shares some common template for

41
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,560
the click action.

42
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:20,020
That means our app widget provider can
also call setPendingIntentTemplate

43
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:22,960
with the pending intent that
has all the common attributes.

44
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,600
Say, what activity to start.

45
00:02:25,832 --> 00:02:30,290
Our RemoteViewsFactory get you at
method then handles the unique part for

46
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:33,950
each element calling set
on click fill in intent

47
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:35,935
to fill in our template appropriately.

48
00:02:35,935 --> 00:02:38,295
Now of course, for Sunshine,

49
00:02:38,295 --> 00:02:41,165
we have to consider how about tablets,
which have the master and

50
00:02:41,165 --> 00:02:45,565
detail view together and phones, which
have them as separate activities, work.

51
00:02:45,565 --> 00:02:47,925
That complicates things a bit here.

52
00:02:47,925 --> 00:02:49,505
Let's just see how it
all falls together.
