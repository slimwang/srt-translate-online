1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,440
So now that we have seen what storage devices

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:05,210
look like, let's talk about how they and other I/O

3
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:08,945
devices can be connected to the system. We usually connect

4
00:00:08,945 --> 00:00:12,900
I/O devices using some sort of a standardized I/O bus.

5
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,564
It needs to have a standard because we want to

6
00:00:15,564 --> 00:00:18,732
be able to connect for example, hard drives from one

7
00:00:18,732 --> 00:00:22,252
manufacturer to a computer built by another one. And then

8
00:00:22,252 --> 00:00:25,241
possibly even replace the hard drive with another one from

9
00:00:25,241 --> 00:00:28,295
another manufacturer. Or even move our existing hard

10
00:00:28,295 --> 00:00:30,267
drive from one system to a new one we

11
00:00:30,267 --> 00:00:34,551
are buying so that we can access our data without having to spend a lot of time

12
00:00:34,551 --> 00:00:39,868
copying it. Because these buses have standards they have a limited

13
00:00:39,868 --> 00:00:44,905
rate of improvement, and often this improvement goes in steps. So

14
00:00:44,905 --> 00:00:49,900
all of the technology might go up in a relatively smooth fashion.

15
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:58,750
This is where a new standard gets adopted

16
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:02,170
by manufacturers so things suddenly improve. But then for

17
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:04,051
a while you just have the same buses even

18
00:01:04,051 --> 00:01:07,371
though the technology is actually improving. And instead of

19
00:01:07,371 --> 00:01:10,261
having just one type of bus that connects

20
00:01:10,261 --> 00:01:13,916
to all I/O devices, typically we have a hierarchy

21
00:01:13,916 --> 00:01:17,790
of buses. You have a mezzanine bus such as

22
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:21,442
PCI Express. It will be pretty fast and short

23
00:01:21,442 --> 00:01:26,198
so that it can be this fast, and it can be used to directly connect fast

24
00:01:26,198 --> 00:01:31,320
devices to the processor such as for example graphics. Then we will

25
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:36,350
connect storages buses to it. For example, the SATA or

26
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:41,730
SCSI for hard drives, both of these are used usually to connect storages

27
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:47,454
devices. These are somewhat specialized for storage.

28
00:01:47,454 --> 00:01:55,830
And a SATA controller will act as a PCI Express device on the mezzanine bus.

29
00:01:55,830 --> 00:02:01,440
But the controller itself actually controls a SATA bus to which we

30
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:06,918
now connect devices. So the reason why we have these and don't directly

31
00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:12,798
connect our hard drives to the PCI Express, is that although these, for example,

32
00:02:12,798 --> 00:02:15,822
serial ATA buses are slower, there is also

33
00:02:15,822 --> 00:02:19,305
less change in their standards. And there need

34
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:22,725
not be that much change because these devices

35
00:02:22,725 --> 00:02:26,055
are much slower than what the PCI Express can

36
00:02:26,055 --> 00:02:28,890
provide. So, we don't really need all the

37
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:31,931
speed of PCI Express. In exchange, we get

38
00:02:31,931 --> 00:02:34,504
to keep our hard drive standards for a

39
00:02:34,504 --> 00:02:38,073
while longer while PCI Express can improve a little

40
00:02:38,073 --> 00:02:43,818
bit more rapidly. All we have to do is devise new controllers that connect

41
00:02:43,818 --> 00:02:49,773
these storage busses to the newest PCI Express that we have. And then we can

42
00:02:49,773 --> 00:02:56,134
have a USB hub for example, also attached to a PCI Express bus. The USB hub

43
00:02:56,134 --> 00:03:03,414
itself provides a USB bus connection for USB devices that are even slower than

44
00:03:03,414 --> 00:03:09,715
for example, SATA. But again, their standard lives for a lot longer, so we can

45
00:03:09,715 --> 00:03:15,443
use a lot of different devices relatively cheaply and connect them to this. So

46
00:03:15,443 --> 00:03:22,163
overall we can have is a PCI Express bus to which we can attach the processor,

47
00:03:22,163 --> 00:03:28,480
the graphics, the I/O bus control for disks, for USB. And these in turn

48
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,330
provide buses to which we can attach disks

49
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:35,370
here, and also some devices here. So the

50
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:37,682
closer we get to the processor, the more

51
00:03:37,682 --> 00:03:41,218
important it is to keep improving speeds, because, because

52
00:03:41,218 --> 00:03:43,938
some of the devices, like graphics, need that

53
00:03:43,938 --> 00:03:46,722
speed. But for storage, and for many of the

54
00:03:46,722 --> 00:03:49,608
standard USB devices, we really are much more

55
00:03:49,608 --> 00:03:53,567
interested in standardization so that we can exchange these.

56
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:56,583
So that we can interchange these devices and not have them tied

57
00:03:56,583 --> 00:04:00,050
to a particular technology and have to change them every year or two.
