1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,827
Now let's state the general rule for
creating all the transition clauses.

2
00:00:03,827 --> 00:00:09,146
Recall that a tuple k, l,
k prime, l prime, delta, is valid,

3
00:00:09,146 --> 00:00:14,663
if switching to state qk prime,
writing out the symbol sl prime and

4
00:00:14,663 --> 00:00:17,914
moving into action delta is an option,

5
00:00:17,914 --> 00:00:23,745
given that the machine is currently
in state qk and reading symbol sl.

6
00:00:23,745 --> 00:00:28,075
For every step I, position j, and

7
00:00:28,075 --> 00:00:34,220
invalid transition, k, l,
k prime, l prime, delta,

8
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:39,830
we include in the formula a clause like
this, the first part tests whether

9
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:44,210
the truth assignment is such that
the transition rule actually applies.

10
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:49,030
And the next three rules ensures that
this invalid transition wasn't followed.

11
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:51,540
This is just the generalization of
the example that we saw earlier.
