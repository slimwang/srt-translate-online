00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,890
Okay now that we talked about what
we want in a trusted computing base,

2
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:07,350
we want it to be trustworthy,
we want it to be high assurance and

3
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:09,770
we said even in a follow
designed principals.

4
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:15,450
So let's talk a little bit about how
do we build a trusted computing base.

5
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:19,240
Well first of all, if we claim it
to be a trusted computing base,

6
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:22,360
it has to implement certain
key requirements or

7
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:25,540
features that you associate
with a secure system.

8
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:31,200
In other words, it must implement
certain security Relevant functions.

9
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:35,130
Certain functions that are important for
securing access to resources.

10
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:37,860
So, for example,
it has to address authentication.

11
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:41,890
If it doesn't address authentication
we will know who's making a request for

12
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:44,820
a resource that is
protected in the system.

13
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,730
It has to do access control.

14
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:50,130
Access control for whatever resources
that we have, could be files,

15
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:52,170
could be other kind of
objects that we have.

16
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:53,470
When it comes to access control,

17
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:56,170
we talked about two different
kinds of access control.

18
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:58,400
We talked about
mandatory access control.

19
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,500
It may support that.

20
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:04,209
It may support labels that can be
used to implement the BLP model for

21
00:01:04,209 --> 00:01:09,210
example or some of the other mandatory
access control models that we discussed.

22
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:11,780
It has to support
discretionary access control.

23
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:14,780
So somebody who creates a resource
that has some control over

24
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:17,070
who can access it and
who cannot access it.

25
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:21,100
The basic idea here is that
when you say I'm going to build

26
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:24,220
a trusted computing base, the first
question you have to think about is,

27
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:26,920
what are the core functions
I have to provide?

28
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,790
Some core mechanisms that have
to go into the system and

29
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:31,420
these are some examples of those.
