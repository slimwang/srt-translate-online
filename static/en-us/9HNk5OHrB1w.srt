00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:04,370
So here is the example of dual photography we looked at before where,

2
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:07,090
illuminated a scene with the computer controlled projector that

3
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:09,530
basically opened the aperture in different ways, and

4
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:14,080
then we got a modulated aperture in front of the camera to figure out how which

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,920
which light source was related to what parts of the image will be updated.

6
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,500
Now remember again, these are the elements of photography,

7
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:24,130
we have a 3D scene and a user, and these are the five phases in between,

8
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:27,940
where we have Illumination, optics, sensor, processing, and display.

9
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:29,250
In the case of dual photography,

10
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:32,759
what basically we know that we control the illumination, so that's what

11
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:38,060
computational is involved, optics are controlled a bit here and basically how

12
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:42,730
we control the aperture, both sides, but more on the camera side here.

13
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:46,410
Sensor is being used as is right now, but you can control that also, and

14
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:49,670
then of course image that is actually computed from a series of

15
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:53,210
things as process and then displayed to [INAUDIBLE] limit.
