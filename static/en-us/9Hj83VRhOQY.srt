1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The answer is: it's after the HTTP request headers.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Let me show you how to find that out.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
So first we'll go to our Editor

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and we'll switch these lines around again

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
so we can see the actual request.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
So I comment these two guys out,

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
and I uncomment these two guys--this is what we've been doing before.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Let's go back to our browser--okay, let's give it a shot.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
We're going to reload this page,

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
which is going to ask us if we want to resubmit the form.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
We'll do so--aha!

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
And now we see our HTTP request.

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
This time it's a POST instead of a GET.

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
That's because we changed the method to POST.

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
We see more headers--we actually see a couple of these headers twice.

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
That's kind of a side effect of

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
the fact that we're not printing the actual request.

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
We're printing the Python representation of the request,

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
which is a little glitchy--not a big deal.

20
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
We can see here, after all of the headers, we have some data:

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
q=some+words--that's what I typed in my form.

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Remember, spaces get turned into pluses.

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
So one of the big differences

24
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
between GETs and POSTs

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
is that GETs include parameters in the URL

26
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
and POSTs include the data in the request body.
