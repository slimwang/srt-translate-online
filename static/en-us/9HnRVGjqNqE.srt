1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:01,770
Based on the question I want to answer.

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:03,990
At this point the next task
that would make sense for

3
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:06,300
me to do is to split
the data into two groups.

4
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:09,040
Data for students who eventually
pass the first project and for

5
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,340
students who don't.

6
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:13,330
But I have all this data about students'
engagement in the first week, and

7
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:14,310
I'm getting curious.

8
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:15,890
I want to take a look at it.

9
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:19,380
My rule of thumb is when I'm curious
about my data, I investigate.

10
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:22,270
Getting a better sense of your
data is almost always useful.

11
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:22,820
In this case,

12
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:25,860
I'll probably be able to reuse some
of the code I'm writing later.

13
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:29,890
But even if that weren't true, exploring
your data is never a waste of time for

14
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:30,520
a data analyst.
