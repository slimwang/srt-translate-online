1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,320
Okay so we got rid of this form HTML, let's just

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:05,510
get rid of this altogether, and let's see if our basic

3
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:08,810
scaffolding is working. So, instead of doing all that other stuff

4
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:12,800
we were doing down there, let's just say, self.render, that's the new

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,490
function we just added. Shopping_list.html, so this should just render that

6
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:19,410
empty form, and then we'll go ahead and comment out the

7
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:22,790
rest of this. Okay, and we'll take all of this other,

8
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:25,190
other junk that we were doing before, and and we'll comment it

9
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:27,590
out for now. Okay, let's go to our browser and

10
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:30,520
make sure this works. Okay. I reloaded the page, and we

11
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:33,050
have our add food thing again. And if I add

12
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:38,770
foods, we can see them getting added to the URL, but

13
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:41,405
since we don't have any of that that hidden input

14
00:00:41,405 --> 00:00:44,310
trick and we're not pulling things off our parameters anymore, it's

15
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:47,530
just replacing the one item in the URL. But that basically

16
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:50,490
shows our template is working end to end. Okay, so hopefully

17
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:53,095
you were able to follow along with me through that. I

18
00:00:53,095 --> 00:00:55,349
know, I know it's kind of tedious, but now that we have

19
00:00:55,349 --> 00:00:58,630
the scaffolding up, we can actually start using these templates. So

20
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:02,296
let's go ahead and learn a few things about Jinja templates.
