1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:05,410
So we see that the likeness that we perceive at location x, y is a product of R

2
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:10,080
and E, where R is the surface reflectance affected by the color,

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,320
texture of the object, and E is the incoming light energy or

4
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,740
irradiance affected by the brightness of the light source and

5
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:22,080
the angle between the incident ray, and the normal of the surface.

6
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:27,100
Okay, now out of these two, which one do you think varies faster or

7
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:31,720
more frequently with changes in location and which one varies slower or

8
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:32,530
less frequently?

9
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:36,520
Type in your answers in the boxes.

10
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:39,820
You should say more in one and less in the other.
