00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:03,336
For the diffuse component, the angle of the viewer to the surface or light

2
00:00:03,336 --> 00:00:06,817
doesn't matter. The amount of illumination depends on just the angle of the

3
00:00:06,817 --> 00:00:11,095
light to the surface. So the correct answer is to not check any of the boxes.

4
00:00:11,095 --> 00:00:15,900
With specular surfaces, the shininess is brightest in the reflection direction.

5
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:20,105
This can actually vary a bit in real life materials. For example, some

6
00:00:20,105 --> 00:00:24,228
roughened metals can have what are called off specular peaks. Even then, the

7
00:00:24,228 --> 00:00:27,610
eye at location c would still see the brightest reflection off a surface.
