1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Before I explain, let me ask a second related quiz.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Is it possible that 50%, 90% or even 99% of all the people in the world

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
are smarter than the average person.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,000
You now check any or all of those or none of those, so you have four choices.

5
00:00:28,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Check any or all but at least one of those.
