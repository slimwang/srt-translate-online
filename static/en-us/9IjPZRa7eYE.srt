1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:05,930
For the first one, we just get 31,000. For 3.1 times 10 to the 10, we get this

2
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:13,050
much longer number. It's 3, 1, and then 9 0s. This is 31 billion, in fact. For

3
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:17,910
this last one, 3.1 times 10 to the 21, we get a kind of funny answer though.

4
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:24,680
When I type this in, and then press Enter, we get 3.1 I don't know what this

5
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:30,554
means. Well this is actually just how the calculator shows, 3.1 times 10 to the

6
00:00:30,554 --> 00:00:35,550
21st. This e is not the special number that we met in the last lesson. E here

7
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:41,150
just stands for exponent. And it means the exponent of 10 is 21. And if there's

8
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:45,540
a positive sign here, that's just to distinguish this from negative 21. Some

9
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:49,570
calculator show this differently. So check yours to see what it displays, when

10
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:53,940
you enter the same number. Also as a challenge, see if you can guess how you'd

11
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:57,820
write this number in the same format as these other two we already saw. How

12
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:59,449
many digit's do you think it has?
