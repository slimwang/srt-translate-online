1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:05,040
If we compare the code within player
spec.js specifically the describe and

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,390
the it functions,

3
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:10,210
with the content in the spec runner
page we'll start to see a pattern.

4
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:14,100
Which of these statements are true
about the relationship between the code

5
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:15,760
and the page?

6
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:18,830
That describe calls are colored black.

7
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:23,610
That there's no difference
between describe and it calls, or

8
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:25,580
that it calls are colored green.
