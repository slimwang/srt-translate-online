00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,830
So lets see if we understood the impact of branch predictors on performance.

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:10,140
We will consider the old Pentium 4 Prescott processor which has an extremely

3
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:16,620
deep pipeline. It fetches then does 29 stages worth of work and

4
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:21,950
only then it resolves branches. It of course uses branch prediction and

5
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:26,970
is capable of executing multiple instructions per cycle. So that in a program,

6
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:32,229
where about 20% of all instructions are branches, only 1% of branches might

7
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:38,870
be mispredicted, and lets say that that gives us a CP1 program of 0.5.

8
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:42,950
So the question for you is, if we had a slightly worse predictor, so

9
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:47,320
that 2% of branches are mispredicted in the program,

10
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:50,690
how would that change the CPI? What would the CPI be?
