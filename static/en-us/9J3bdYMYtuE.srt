00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,930
Now you've written a lot of code and mercifully the application is nearly done.

2
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:10,160
I'll give you the final piece. Here in the CarShareApp class, you make a

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:17,796
simulation object, we ask it to read it's input. Then we load the passengers,

4
00:00:17,796 --> 00:00:22,889
and drive the cars. Also, so that you see what's going on, I've added a couple

5
00:00:22,889 --> 00:00:28,686
of print statements to the car class. Here in the tryToAdd method, we print out

6
00:00:28,686 --> 00:00:35,014
whenever the driver has picked up a passenger. And in the drive method, we

7
00:00:35,014 --> 00:00:40,879
print out, whenever the driver has dropped off a passenger. Now I would like

8
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:45,714
you to, run the car share app, with these inputs here. So Jane has a car, that

9
00:00:45,714 --> 00:00:50,958
can hold four people including herself, wants to go to destination four. Fred

10
00:00:50,958 --> 00:00:54,762
has a two seater wants to go to destination two. And these are all passengers,

11
00:00:54,762 --> 00:00:58,480
they want to go to these destinations. The minus one signifies the end of

12
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:05,212
input. Go ahead and run the app, and tell me in which order do passengers get

13
00:01:05,212 --> 00:01:07,580
dropped off.
