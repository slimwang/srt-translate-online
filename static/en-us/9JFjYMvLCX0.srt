1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,270
Now I did say that we need to look at what happens at the edges of the image.

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:05,340
So let's look at that specific example.

3
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:09,220
Again, the same image except that this time around I've replaced the zeros with

4
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:11,180
some numeric values.

5
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:13,610
Again just to help us see what would happen.

6
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:16,030
Again, my output.

7
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:17,450
And I've filled it out again,

8
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:19,680
the middle part as we've done in the previous frame.

9
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,590
So now we have to start thinking about how do we fill the edge cases out?

10
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:29,020
Again, doing my filtering using a three by three, which we will rub over.

11
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:29,740
And we did that.

12
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:32,369
Now, of course I still don't have any values here.

13
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:36,340
To achieve that what I need to do is basically pad this image with

14
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:37,248
additional information.

15
00:00:37,248 --> 00:00:40,590
So to achieve that basically what I would do in this instance, as long as I

16
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:45,360
am actually looking at a three by three neighborhood, I need to add one

17
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,500
neighborhood pixel, or one column or one row, and make this image bigger by one.

18
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:55,160
Of course, if my kernel or my size of the filter that I'm looking at is bigger

19
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:59,130
that 3, let's say five by five, then I will have to add three different rows and

20
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:02,150
columns to be able to give it more information so I can fill this out.

21
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:06,990
So once I put this up, I need to also fill it out with values.

22
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:11,690
One thing we can do is basically take these values and copy them over.

23
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:15,770
So, basically, just copying them over actually gives us more information here.

24
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:19,810
This one can also be then copied over, or some sort of simple numerical method,

25
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:24,170
like an average of this could be used to do replace this value here.

26
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:27,250
So now I've actually basically created a new image that's a little

27
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:29,740
bigger than my original image.

28
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:31,830
Now I just mirroring and copying this over.

29
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:32,640
And once I do this,

30
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,730
I can now run the process which allows me to fill in values here.

31
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:40,830
So now basically suggests is that I can take this three by three and

32
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:44,690
when I apply it here, the value would be filling out here.

33
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:49,370
And similarly, this way all of this, this, and this would also be filled out.

34
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:52,460
Of course, there will be degradation of information.

35
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:56,190
Most of the pixel values here would not, of course, be completely correct.

36
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:57,570
Because we're kind of synthet,

37
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:00,890
synthesizing a buffer to be able to do this type of filtering.

38
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:03,850
There are many strategies usually available how we

39
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:06,010
can actually add this information.

40
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:10,280
So some of the options of doing this is we can wrap the information around,

41
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:14,100
as we kind of did, or we can just copy it from one to the other.

42
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:17,770
Or we can reflect information across making this be the axes and

43
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:19,250
take these values and move them around.

44
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:21,380
Again many different methods can be used.

45
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:24,420
What we're really trying to do is figure out how to increase the edge size so

46
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:29,135
we can basically do computation of this and create a newer image from it.

47
00:02:29,135 --> 00:02:33,180
Of course there is significant error accumulated in doing this because

48
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:36,520
the edges will start loosing information as you can start making bigger and

49
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,920
bigger filter kernels.

50
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,150
Of course remember again if I were to do five by five what will have to

51
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:44,080
add two layer, two rows and two columns, and

52
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,020
make a bigger image to be able to then fill in values.

53
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:50,460
We will see examples of that as we do start doing image processing.

54
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:53,140
That some of the information at the edges does start getting to

55
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:54,970
be suspicious and lost.
