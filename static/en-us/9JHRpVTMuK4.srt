00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:06,965
Well, the means should be exactly the same. So here it would be 7.5, and here

2
00:00:06,965 --> 00:00:11,792
8.2. But the standard deviations are the population standard deviation divided

3
00:00:11,792 --> 00:00:17,222
by the square root of the sample size. This is 0.64 divided by the square root

4
00:00:17,222 --> 00:00:23,532
of 20, which is about 0.14. And here, it's 0.73 divided by the square root of

5
00:00:23,532 --> 00:00:29,808
20, which is about 0.16. So, they have almost the same standard deviation. So,

6
00:00:29,808 --> 00:00:34,632
this is about what the sampling distributions will look like, maybe a little bit

7
00:00:34,632 --> 00:00:38,304
skinnier. I can't draw much skinnier than this, though.
