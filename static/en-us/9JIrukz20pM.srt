1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:04,360
Alright, so we've looked at
projected IR versus natural light.

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:07,860
What are the advantages of this
projected light, or projected IR?

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:09,970
Well, yes it works in low light.

4
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:12,730
You're not counting on
having external light.

5
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:15,320
You're not counting on having texture
that you can deal with since I'm

6
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:20,070
projecting this texture, and its okay if
I've got repeated things because I'm,

7
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:22,530
I'm it's not actually repeated
in a speckle pattern.

8
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:24,680
Remember we had this problem
with picket fences in stereo?

9
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:28,700
How all the pickets look alike, to know
which picket it is, is a challenge.

10
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:32,460
Well, if you painted all the pickets
different colors or different speckles,

11
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:35,240
that's not a problem, and
that's what the connect does.

12
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:38,846
And in particular, you can tailor your
algorithms to the actual pattern that

13
00:00:38,846 --> 00:00:41,799
you're producing and
engineer the thing to work really well.

14
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:44,430
What are the advantages
of natural light?

15
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:46,200
Well it's natural light.

16
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,090
So it works outdoors, it works
in sunlight, it works, you know,

17
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:52,240
it just works whenever it's,
the lights are turned on.

18
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:55,865
Doesn't work in the dark, that's okay,
neither do I, but the idea is that,

19
00:00:55,865 --> 00:00:58,075
you know,
you're just basically using the scene.

20
00:00:58,075 --> 00:01:00,485
The other thing is that you don't have
to worry about the resolution of your

21
00:01:00,485 --> 00:01:03,515
projection, you've got the whatever
at your high-resolution sensors.

22
00:01:03,515 --> 00:01:07,085
It's a lot easier to build
high-resolution sensors than

23
00:01:07,085 --> 00:01:09,525
high-resolution projectors.

24
00:01:09,525 --> 00:01:12,045
Both of them have some difficulties,
you know,

25
00:01:12,045 --> 00:01:16,460
they, they if you have very
shiny surfaces, all right, or

26
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:19,830
specular surfaces like a mirror, right,
so your projection is going to go.

27
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:23,480
And, you know, clearly,
if I'm doing stereo and I'm a robot, and

28
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:27,940
I'm looking at a mirror, I see the thing
that's up there and I think oh,

29
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:33,050
I could just reach down here and get
that light that's on this, oh no, okay?

30
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:36,200
It actually, the,
it doesn't see the table.

31
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,670
And my projector, well,
it projects down so

32
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:42,230
it'll also be thinking about
the ceiling, all right?

33
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:43,810
So, doesn't work in any of those cases.
