1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:03,045
In this lesson, we're going to learn about this, our brain. And how the

2
00:00:03,045 --> 00:00:06,595
different areas of the brain are responsible for different things. And how our

3
00:00:06,595 --> 00:00:10,356
brain makes us uniquely human. We're also going to learn about the nervous

4
00:00:10,356 --> 00:00:14,216
system and neurotransmitters, such a dopamine or serotonin. And how they all

5
00:00:14,216 --> 00:00:18,520
come together to help us do the amazing things that humans can do.

6
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:23,700
>> Everything about who we are. What we think, what we imagine, what we dream and

7
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:29,564
even who we like is a function of our brain and it's activity. Damage to the

8
00:00:29,564 --> 00:00:33,843
brain can have some devastating consequences. Too much of some

9
00:00:33,843 --> 00:00:37,107
neurotransmitters can cause problems, too few of some can cause problems as

10
00:00:37,107 --> 00:00:41,353
well. In this lesson we're going to learn about the delicate balance of the

11
00:00:41,353 --> 00:00:44,511
brain and its activity. And it's important important for you to master this

12
00:00:44,511 --> 00:00:47,085
material, because we will be discussing the brain throughout the remainder of

13
00:00:47,085 --> 00:00:48,410
the course.

14
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,860
>> So Susan's right. Now let's start with the basics. Many people know that we

15
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:56,094
inherit genetic information from our parents and this determines things like

16
00:00:56,094 --> 00:01:01,230
hair or eye color. But genetics aren't set in stone. Now the environment can

17
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:05,022
change the expression of our genetics. Now to talk more about how our genetics

18
00:01:05,022 --> 00:01:08,184
makes us who we are today, I want to bring in Matt, our genetics expert here at

19
00:01:08,184 --> 00:01:09,869
Udacity.
