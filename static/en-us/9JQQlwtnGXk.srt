1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,088
The number we need to add here is 1. Likely to be 4, we can get this by dividing

2
00:00:05,088 --> 00:00:10,186
the coefficient of the x to the first term by 2, and then squaring it. 2 over 2

3
00:00:10,186 --> 00:00:12,992
squared is just 1. So that's what we add on
