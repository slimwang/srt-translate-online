1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:03,960
Cross-Site Request Forgery
is another web-based attack.

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:07,580
A user's browser may be running
a script from a good site and

3
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:09,990
also malicious script from a bad site.

4
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:14,620
This can happen when the user has
logged into the good site and

5
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:16,550
kept the session alive.

6
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:21,510
For example, the user has logged
into Gmail and has not logged off.

7
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:24,570
Meanwhile, the user maybe
browsing other sites

8
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:28,460
include the bad site that sends
malicious script to the browser.

9
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:32,390
The malicious script can then
forge a request to the good side

10
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:34,210
using the users cookie.

11
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:38,830
The good side does not know that
the request was not sent by the user,

12
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:40,490
here's an illustration.

13
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:44,570
The user logs in, and establishes
a session with a good site, and

14
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:46,240
keeps the session alive.

15
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:49,810
Meanwhile, the user browses a bad site.

16
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:52,380
For example, because he's phished.

17
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:55,880
And the browser runs a malicious
script from the bad site.

18
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:59,960
The malicious script then sends
forged requests to the good site.

19
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,670
Here's a realistic example.

20
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:05,489
A user logs into bank.com and
forgets to sign off.

21
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:08,150
The session cookie remains in browser.

22
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:12,700
The user then visits a malicious
website which sends an HTML page

23
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:17,620
that contains a hidden I frame that
includes this malicious content,

24
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:24,030
that is when the user's browser displays
the HTML page, actions will be performed

25
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:30,280
on the bill payment form of bank.com
as if users are entering these values.

26
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:34,420
Because the I frame is invisible
the user knows nothing about it.

27
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:38,100
The browser will send a request
on behalf of the user and

28
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,180
without his consent or knowledge.
