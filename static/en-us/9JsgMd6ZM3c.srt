00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,498
A great way to build an audience
is through social networks.

2
00:00:03,498 --> 00:00:07,226
Lots of games have options to link to
Facebook or Twitter and share your high

3
00:00:07,226 --> 00:00:10,787
score with your friends or even invite
them to play the same game as you.

4
00:00:10,787 --> 00:00:14,429
And they'll give you an incentive to
do so, like Candy Crush will give you

5
00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:18,210
powerups if you can invite a new
Facebook friend to play the game.

6
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:19,690
It's like a trade.

7
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:23,620
Some games even rely on an individual
fan to spread the word, people

8
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:28,250
like YouTube stars or Tumblr users whose
reviews can reach a lot of people.

9
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:31,210
So as you build your game,
think about how you'll want to integrate

10
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:34,140
with social media and
create your own gaming community.
