00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,608
Now finally, since we have these last two linear factors, we can write f of x

2
00:00:03,608 --> 00:00:07,262
as the product of four linear factors, which we knew it would have because it

3
00:00:07,262 --> 00:00:13,596
is a function of degree 4. So now we can write that f of x equals x times 2 x

4
00:00:13,596 --> 00:00:19,984
minus 1 times x minus 3 minus 2 i times x minus 3 plus 2 i. This is really

5
00:00:19,984 --> 00:00:23,826
awesome. We've made so much progress since we started off. Now I have one final

6
00:00:23,826 --> 00:00:27,390
question for you, and it's really what we've been working toward for the entire

7
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:33,224
problem. What are all the zeros of f of x? We already know two of them from a

8
00:00:33,224 --> 00:00:37,665
couple of quizzes ago, 3 plus 2 i, and 3 minus 2 i. And so I'd just like you to

9
00:00:37,665 --> 00:00:40,975
fill in the last two. Check in with the linear factors we haven't used yet to

10
00:00:40,975 --> 00:00:44,443
find zeros, but at least haven't used in this quiz yet.
