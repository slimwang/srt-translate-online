1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:01,726
Here's the number I came up with.

2
00:00:01,726 --> 00:00:06,550
3200 gigaops, or
3.2 trillion operations per second.

3
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:07,919
Let's see how I got there.

4
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:10,951
In 10 years there will be 5 doublings.

5
00:00:10,951 --> 00:00:16,370
5 doublings is a 2 to the 5th,
or 32x increase in performance.

6
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:21,176
So a 2025 processor,
relative to a 2015 processor will

7
00:00:21,176 --> 00:00:25,170
run at 32x100 or 3,200 gigaops.

8
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:27,370
Wow, that is fast.

9
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:29,080
I mean really fast.

10
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:30,080
As a point of reference,

11
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,960
suppose I gave you three
trillion pennies, head to tail.

12
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:37,127
Those would go around
the Earth about 30 times.

13
00:00:37,127 --> 00:00:39,360
That's a [BLEEP] ton of pennies.

14
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,060
In fact, you might already know or have
experience with specialized processors

15
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:47,400
that, even in 2015, are capable of
trillions of operations per second.

16
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:50,100
The point of this exercise is to
give you an intuitive feel for

17
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:54,100
peak performance and the rate of
growth that exponential trends bring.

18
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:55,320
When you think about it, the numbers and

19
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,490
scale we're talking about
should really blow your mind.
