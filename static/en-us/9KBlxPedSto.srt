00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:04,670
Now let's take a look at the hardware
security support in iOS devices.

2
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:10,553
Each iOS device has a dedicated AES-256
crypto engine built into the direct

3
00:00:10,553 --> 00:00:16,350
memory access path between the flash
storage and the main system memory.

4
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:19,188
This makes file encryption
highly efficient.

5
00:00:19,188 --> 00:00:24,940
Recall that AES-256 means that
the key length is 256-bit.

6
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:30,081
The device's unique ID or UID,
and the device group ID or GID,

7
00:00:30,081 --> 00:00:36,483
are AES-256 bit keys fused or compelled
into the application processor,

8
00:00:36,483 --> 00:00:40,380
a secure enclave during manufacturing.

9
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:44,320
This means that no software or
firmware can read them directly.

10
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,710
They can see only
the results of encryption or

11
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:50,910
decryption operations performed
by the dedicated AES engines

12
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:55,310
implemented in silicon using the UID or
GID as a key.

13
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:59,760
This is an important feature because
the keys are stored securely in

14
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:00,780
the hardware.

15
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:05,459
The UIDs are unique to each device and
are not recorded by Apple or

16
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:07,170
its suppliers.

17
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:11,030
The GIDs are common to all
processors in a class of devices.

18
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:15,962
For example, all devices
using the Apple A8 processor.

19
00:01:15,962 --> 00:01:20,900
The GIDs are used for tasks such as
delivering system installation and

20
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:22,010
updates.

21
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:26,360
Again, a unique feature of iOS
devices is that the UID and

22
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:29,460
GID keys are directly
burned in the silicon and

23
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:32,590
they can be only accessed
by the Crypto Engine.

24
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:35,230
And the Crypto Engine itself
is part of the hardware.
