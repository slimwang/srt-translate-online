00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:04,379
A key idea to many behavioral therapies is the use of reinforcement to shape

2
00:00:04,379 --> 00:00:09,409
and change behavior. However, other techniques are used, such as extinction,

3
00:00:09,409 --> 00:00:13,063
and this was used in the study I just talked about with the psychiatric nurse

4
00:00:13,063 --> 00:00:18,844
as a behavioral engineer. They used extinction to decrease symptoms of

5
00:00:18,844 --> 00:00:22,561
schizophrenia, but let's look at a different type of therapy that uses

6
00:00:22,561 --> 00:00:27,944
reinforcement. One successful ABA technique that is used by behavioral

7
00:00:27,944 --> 00:00:32,870
therapists, is a token economy. And here desired behaviors are reinforced with

8
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:36,748
a token. That could be something like a sticker, a star on the board or some

9
00:00:36,748 --> 00:00:41,381
type of chip. These tokens are accumulated, and can later be exchanged for

10
00:00:41,381 --> 00:00:46,868
other items or privileges. For example, a child with ADHD may be put on a token

11
00:00:46,868 --> 00:00:50,932
economy. Wherein he gets a token for every homework assignment that he

12
00:00:50,932 --> 00:00:56,077
completes on time. After he accumulates 5 stars, he gets 10 extra minutes of

13
00:00:56,077 --> 00:01:01,048
recess. Moreover, if he earns 10 stars he gets to go on the field trip with the

14
00:01:01,048 --> 00:01:06,109
class. The token economy technique has been found to be especially effective in

15
00:01:06,109 --> 00:01:11,216
treating drug addiction. So, let's look at example of that. Steven Higgins and

16
00:01:11,216 --> 00:01:15,704
his colleagues conducted a series of studies, where they gave cocaine dependent

17
00:01:15,704 --> 00:01:21,830
participants tokens for each drug free urine sample that they provided. In some

18
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:25,610
of the studies, the value of the tokens increased for each consecutive drug

19
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:31,351
free sample. So for example, perhaps the first token was worth $0.25, if they

20
00:01:31,351 --> 00:01:38,156
provided a drug free urine on the next day it would be increased to $0.50. On

21
00:01:38,156 --> 00:01:43,896
the third day if they provided a drug free sample it would go to $0.75. Now

22
00:01:43,896 --> 00:01:47,172
remember these were just tokens, they didn't earn actual money, and part of

23
00:01:47,172 --> 00:01:50,448
this was because they wanted to make sure that the tokens could be exchanged

24
00:01:50,448 --> 00:01:56,344
for appropriate items. Meaning they didn't want to give these individuals money

25
00:01:56,344 --> 00:02:00,856
and perhaps risk them taking that money and going out and buying drugs. So

26
00:02:00,856 --> 00:02:04,762
again, if drugs were found in the urine, the value of the token decreased to

27
00:02:04,762 --> 00:02:11,008
the original starting value. So again if they had consecutive drug free urines,

28
00:02:11,008 --> 00:02:16,311
the token value increased each time. But if drugs were found in the urine, it

29
00:02:16,311 --> 00:02:21,906
went back to the original starting value. In these studies the researchers

30
00:02:21,906 --> 00:02:27,165
found a significant decrease in drug using. Especially compared to other

31
00:02:27,165 --> 00:02:32,906
therapies such as narcotics anonimous. These individuals spent longer time

32
00:02:32,906 --> 00:02:38,510
drug-free, than individuals in those other treatments. Given the success of

33
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:42,110
these types of studies, this behavioral approach has been listed by the

34
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:46,010
National Institute of Drug Abuse as the best option for drug addiction, along

35
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:48,825
with medication.
