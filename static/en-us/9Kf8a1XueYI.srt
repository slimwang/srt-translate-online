In the context of this problem and these equations, finding out that Grant wants

2
00:00:05,378 --> 00:00:10,300
to buy 75 gallons of solution means that we want to set x equal to 75. Now

3
00:00:10,312 --> 00:00:15,666
usually, we just think about something that looks like this as assigning a value

4
00:00:15,678 --> 00:00:20,828
to a variable and that is true. But don't forget, this is an equation of a line.
