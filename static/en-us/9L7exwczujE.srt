1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,642
In lesson three, we wrote
the rock paper scissors app, and

2
00:00:02,642 --> 00:00:05,936
we used three different techniques to
present the ResultsViewController.

3
00:00:05,936 --> 00:00:08,298
One for each of these three options.

4
00:00:08,298 --> 00:00:10,082
For rock it was all in Code,

5
00:00:10,082 --> 00:00:14,440
for paper it was a named
Storyboard Segue, triggered using Code.

6
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:18,387
And for scissors it was a triggered
Segue attached to the button in

7
00:00:18,387 --> 00:00:19,259
Storyboard.

8
00:00:19,259 --> 00:00:23,154
In the Make Your Own Adventure app, the
segues have all been of this third kind.

9
00:00:23,154 --> 00:00:27,059
We've attached the segues directly to
the buttons using a pop-up connections

10
00:00:27,059 --> 00:00:28,174
menu and storyboard.

11
00:00:28,174 --> 00:00:30,544
Automatically triggered
segues are great, but

12
00:00:30,544 --> 00:00:33,665
all three of the segue techniques
are available in navigation,

13
00:00:33,665 --> 00:00:35,934
the same way they are in
mobile presentation.

14
00:00:35,934 --> 00:00:39,635
What would it take to reproduce the
three segues in rock, paper, scissors.

15
00:00:39,635 --> 00:00:43,268
Using a NavigationController
instead of modal presentation.

16
00:00:43,268 --> 00:00:45,732
In this segment,
we're asking you to do just that,

17
00:00:45,732 --> 00:00:48,650
the next reading note will walk
you through the steps to do so.
