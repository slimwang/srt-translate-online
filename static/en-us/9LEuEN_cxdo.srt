1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:03,060
Okay, well, the bands are part of the festival. So maybe we

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:05,090
just want to add a relationship to

3
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:07,840
festivals? Just like with attendees and stages?

4
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:09,840
>> So, that might make sense. But, I

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,240
mean, bands will be playing at stages, and

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,910
stages look up to festivals. So it'd probably

7
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:16,306
make more logical sense to relate it to stages.

8
00:00:16,306 --> 00:00:16,450
>> Okay.

9
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:20,370
>> So we can add multiple levels of hierarchy here, and that's okay?

10
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:21,030
>> Exactly.

11
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:21,400
>> Okay.
