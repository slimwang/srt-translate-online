1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,300
Let's update the view
will appear function so

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:06,390
that the stop recording button is
disabled right from the start.

3
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:09,960
Take out the print line and
now the following to view will appear.

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:13,490
Let's make the stop recording
button disabled by default.

5
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:16,420
Now we need to wait to enable
the stop recording button and

6
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:20,010
at the same time disable
the record button.

7
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:23,810
There are two functions you wrote
earlier that can help us here,

8
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:27,400
in the record audio function,
we can add the following two lines.

9
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:30,270
One line to enable the stop
recording button and

10
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:33,230
the second line to disable
the record button.

11
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:38,800
Finally in the stop recording function,
we can add the following three lines.

12
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:43,010
We can set the record button back to
enable, we can disable the recording

13
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:46,860
button, and we can reset
the text on the recording label.

14
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:47,750
Let's test it.

15
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:50,120
We can run that by clicking
the run button up here or

16
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:52,590
pressing command r on your keyboard.

17
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:56,530
We can see right away that the stop
recording button has been disabled

18
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:58,330
when the view loads.

19
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:01,800
If you click record we can
see the label has changed and

20
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,160
now the stop recording buttons enabled.

21
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,580
At the same time the recording button

22
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:09,630
is disabled because we're
actually recording.

23
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:13,270
If we hit stop this button
is unable to get in and

24
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:15,281
the label has changed
back to Tap to Record.
