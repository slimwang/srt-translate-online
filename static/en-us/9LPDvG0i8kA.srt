00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:03,640
Let's make our hit detection a little
bit more dramatic by allowing our

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:06,840
level to create, manage,
and dispose of explosions.

3
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:11,570
Then we'll have our bullets create an
explosion every time they hit an enemy,

4
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:13,890
and have our enemy create
an explosion when it dies.

00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:17,980
Check out the to-dos in the course
code to make some stuff blow up.
