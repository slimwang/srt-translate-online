1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:04,660
So now, you've defined the code in your
application class to start tracking.

2
00:00:05,939 --> 00:00:08,857
But so far, there's nothing that
triggers the startTracking method.

3
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:13,296
But, all you need to do to activate
tracking is to call the start tracking

4
00:00:13,296 --> 00:00:15,090
method that you just wrote.

5
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:21,045
You can call it in
onCreate in MainActivity.

6
00:00:21,045 --> 00:00:26,610
And, Activity can call getApplication
to get the application singleton for

7
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:27,140
the running app.

8
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:31,410
However, since you're using your
own subclass of application,

9
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:33,390
you need to cast the result
to your subclass.

10
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:37,429
Once you've got
the application instance,

11
00:00:37,429 --> 00:00:42,420
it's a simple matter of calling
startTracking to kick off tracking.

12
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:43,750
And, you have to get your parens right.

13
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:45,870
So, go ahead and

14
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:50,790
add the code to onCreate in MainActivity
to start analytics tracking.

15
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:52,440
And, make sure your project compiles.
