1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,070
So yes, one way to create the index

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:05,490
configuration file is to actually manually edit it.

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:08,119
And another way to get the indexes correct

4
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:11,320
is to run the queries on local host before

5
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:16,420
you update the app to appspot. This one here, annotate the property at AutoIndex

6
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:21,910
is incorrect. I just made this up this at AutoIndex, however

7
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:27,180
you do have to annotate your properties as @Index,

8
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:31,300
if you want them to be indexed at all. And actually yes, you don't have

9
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:34,500
to worry about single property queries because index

10
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,480
are automatically created for ever property that is

11
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:42,400
marked with at Index. So the only thing you have to worry about for your

12
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,480
single property queries is to make sure that

13
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,897
the property itself has got the @Index annotation.
