00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Let's look at this equation for just the growth and constant harvesting

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and let's take care of the fact that we cannot harvest any longer once the fish become extinct.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
At which amount of fish do we find an equilibrium? All of these are given as multiples of 1 million tons.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 99:59:59,999
0, 0.33, 0.50, 0.55, 1.0, 1.21, 1.45 and 2.0.
