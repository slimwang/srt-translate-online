00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,775
We simply distributed or multiplied the c to each of the exponents. So that

2
00:00:04,775 --> 00:00:09,660
would be this choice. For the base of 7, we had an exponent of 2. And 2 times 5

3
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:14,824
makes 10. For x, the exponent was also 2. So, 2 to the 5th was x to the 10th. We

4
00:00:14,824 --> 00:00:19,616
were simply multiplying each exponent by 5. The same was true in the second

5
00:00:19,616 --> 00:00:24,422
case. 1 times 2 is 2. 3 times 2 is 6. And 2 times 2 is 4. That's how we got 3

6
00:00:24,422 --> 00:00:29,820
squared. M to the 6th times n to the 4th. This was a pretty tricky pattern so,

7
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:32,604
great job if you found the correct answer.
