1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,860
So the first we're
going to look at is Load.

2
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:05,850
Whatever it is,
users want it to load quickly, and

3
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:09,038
it's super important that we optimize
for the critical rendering path.

4
00:00:09,038 --> 00:00:13,760
Earlier in Cam's course, and this is
the fourth plug I've given it now,

5
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:15,610
oh I should be on some kind
of commission, seriously.

6
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:17,910
Anyway it's linked in
the instructor notes and

7
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:20,360
it will take you through
the fine details of that.

8
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:23,990
I took you through a quick tour of the
rendering process in the first lesson,

9
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:27,730
but essentially you want your initial
load to be done in one second.

10
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:30,530
Okay, I'm going to switch across
to Chrome, and I'm going to load

11
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:33,480
Google Play Music, and I suspect
it'll load in about one second.

12
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:37,160
There we go.
Now after an app's loaded,

13
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:41,550
it's normally idle, it's waiting for
a user to interact.

14
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:44,670
And this is our opportunity to
deal with things that we deferred

15
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:46,590
to meet that one second load time.

16
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:50,240
Normally, these idle blocks
are around 50 milliseconds long,

17
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,620
although you may several
of them in one go.

18
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:56,650
These idle blocks are fantastic times
to get some heavy lifting done so

19
00:00:56,650 --> 00:00:59,780
that when the user interacts
things are nice and snappy.

20
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:00,830
I'll stop for a second and

21
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:04,200
let you think through the best way
to approach an app's idle time.
