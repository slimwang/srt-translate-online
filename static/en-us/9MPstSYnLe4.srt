00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:04,187
To scale something is to make it larger or smaller. This operation is somewhat

2
00:00:04,187 --> 00:00:09,040
different than translation and rotation. When we translate or rotate an object,

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:13,893
we don't change it's shape or it's volume. These two operations are what is

4
00:00:13,893 --> 00:00:18,535
called, rigid body transforms. The name rigid body is just what it says. If you

5
00:00:18,535 --> 00:00:22,069
have an object and apply any number of rotations and translations to it you

6
00:00:22,069 --> 00:00:26,045
won't change its shape. It's as if the object is made out of something, well,

7
00:00:26,045 --> 00:00:30,784
rigid and will keep it's form. Scaling does change an object's overall size, so

8
00:00:30,784 --> 00:00:35,626
it's not a rigid body transform. Scaling in 3 JS is simple enough. Just as

9
00:00:35,626 --> 00:00:39,713
there's a translation or rotation parameter on the object, there is also a scale

10
00:00:39,713 --> 00:00:43,474
parameter. Here's the code to make a balloon object 3 times as large as it was

11
00:00:43,474 --> 00:00:48,272
before. Note that unlike real life. This makes the balloon 3 times larger in all

12
00:00:48,272 --> 00:00:53,234
ways. The thickness of the skin, the part where you seal it off, and so on. Like

13
00:00:53,234 --> 00:00:57,296
rotation, scaling is done with respect to an origin. Since the valve of the

14
00:00:57,296 --> 00:01:01,326
balloon is at the origin, the valve will stay still and the balloon will expand

15
00:01:01,326 --> 00:01:05,658
upwards. In fact, you can scale an object differently along each of the three

16
00:01:05,658 --> 00:01:10,116
axes, x, y, and z. This code is scaling the object along the y axis, but not the

17
00:01:10,116 --> 00:01:14,164
other two. A number less than 1 means you're making the object smaller. The

18
00:01:14,164 --> 00:01:18,915
scale shown here has the effect of compressing it along the y axis. When you

19
00:01:18,915 --> 00:01:22,490
scale a object the same amount in all directions, like we did with the balloon,

20
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:27,125
this is called uniform scaling. If the scale varies it's called non-uniform

21
00:01:27,125 --> 00:01:32,648
scaling. Uniform scaling does not change any angles within the model itself. Non

22
00:01:32,648 --> 00:01:37,203
uniform scaling can modify angles. In other words, the shape of the model itself

23
00:01:37,203 --> 00:01:37,903
is changed.
