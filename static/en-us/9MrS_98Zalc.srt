00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:05,160
Let's see the solution for the performance comparison quiz. We had a laptop

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:10,224
that takes four hours to compress this video. This is a latency, so the speed up

3
00:00:10,224 --> 00:00:15,900
of new versus old will be the old latency divided by the new latency.

4
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:20,964
Four hours is 240 minutes. The new latency is 10 minutes,

5
00:00:20,964 --> 00:00:25,650
so the speedup is 24. So the correct answer

6
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:29,160
here is 24. Intuitively, a speed of larger

7
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,159
than one means that the new thing is actually

8
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,866
faster than the old thing. Speedups less than

9
00:00:34,866 --> 00:00:38,440
one mean that the new thing is actually slower.

10
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:40,430
So if you divide the wrong things here,

11
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:43,060
if you took, for example, 10 over 240, you

12
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:47,650
would have gotten something like 0.04. And at that

13
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:50,700
point, you can check the new thing is actually

14
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,890
significantly faster. So if you're getting a number that is much

15
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:57,590
lower than one, that probably means you're dividing the numbers wrongly.
