1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:05,132
We'll reject h not, because our t statistic is huge. We know that this will

2
00:00:05,132 --> 00:00:09,794
fall well beyond the t-critical value no matter what significance level we

3
00:00:09,794 --> 00:00:15,769
choose, the smallest usually being 0.01. We reject h-not because the

4
00:00:15,769 --> 00:00:21,266
probability of getting this T statistic? In other words the probability of

5
00:00:21,266 --> 00:00:26,117
getting this sample mean from a population with mean six point zero seven is

6
00:00:26,117 --> 00:00:32,900
very, very small. That's the p value. It's the probability of getting this

7
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:38,392
value if the null hypothesis is true. Since the probability is so small, then

8
00:00:38,392 --> 00:00:43,770
there must be something else going on. The null hypothesis is probably not

9
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:50,349
true. Finches with this beak width come from an entirely new population. Not

10
00:00:50,349 --> 00:00:53,693
equal to 6.07 as the mean.
