1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:05,480
So trusted path means that you really
talking to the trusted computing base or

2
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:07,100
the operating system, okay.

3
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:11,340
So path that connects
you typing the keys and

4
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:14,180
where these keystrokes
are being captured.

5
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:18,460
That path is really connecting you and
the trusted computing base and

6
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:20,560
there's no one else in between.

7
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,700
If that is the case,
you have a trusted path.

8
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:26,670
How do you make sure you
have a trusted path?

9
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:28,890
We're going to talk about
a couple different ways.

10
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:33,290
This trusted path really has to be
provided by the operating system,

11
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:36,750
maybe some combination of
hardware as you look at

12
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:40,230
combination of the operating system and
the hardware as we're going to see.

13
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:43,280
So for example, if you login to Windows,

14
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,840
you have to press this key sequence,
Ctrl+Alt+Del.

15
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,360
The idea is that you
press this key sequence.

16
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,760
This sequence cannot be
trapped by any other program.

17
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:57,600
Great, this is going to take
you to the operating system.

18
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,740
So the display and the keyboard has
to be connected to the CPU on which

19
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:06,280
the operating system is running in
a way that there is no one in between.

20
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:10,250
Display is not under
control of somebody else.

21
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:13,400
And somebody else is not able
to capture the key strokes and

22
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:16,040
perhaps even alter them and
things like that.

23
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:18,770
So generally these are sort
of physically connected,

24
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:23,580
isn't it and they're in close proximity,
they're right next to your CPU,

25
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:25,550
both the display and the keyboard.

26
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:28,010
So we assume there's no
one else in between.

27
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:32,020
But if you're paranoid we can do sort of
couple of different things to make sure

28
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:36,830
that really we're not talking to
somebody else but the operating system.

29
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:40,880
People had to propose a bunch
of different ideas to make sure

30
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,440
that when you're authenticating
yourself you have a trusted path.

31
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:47,470
They said there's a special part of
the display that only the operating

32
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:48,920
system can write.

33
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:53,510
So for example you could indicate on
the display when you're talking to

34
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:56,860
the operating system and when you're
not talking to the operating system.

35
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:59,550
Or actually have a light
on the keyboard.

36
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:02,498
Okay, that will light up when you're
talking to the operating system and

37
00:02:02,498 --> 00:02:04,950
it will be off when you're not.

38
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:10,080
So this way the user would
know that when it's providing,

39
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,920
I don't know, his or her password,

40
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,530
it is actually going over a trusted
path to the operating system.

41
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:19,470
The other entity, or
the entity at the other end actually,

42
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:21,410
is the trusted computing base.

43
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:25,860
So one challenge with these kind of
things is, do users pay attention to

44
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:29,820
something you display, or a light on
the keyboard or something like that.

45
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:33,435
If it's a red, flashing light maybe
they do, or something like that.

46
00:02:33,435 --> 00:02:37,610
But the idea here is I think
the concept of a trusted computing path

47
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:39,150
is something we want to understand.
