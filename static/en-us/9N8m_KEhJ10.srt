1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,221
Frist we will discuss active power. The active

2
00:00:03,221 --> 00:00:05,749
power can be computed as one half of the

3
00:00:05,749 --> 00:00:09,620
total capacitance of the circuit, where the capacitance

4
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:13,070
can be seen as roughly proportional to chip area.

5
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:16,050
So, larger chips will have more of this.

6
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:19,530
The next factor is voltage square. This is the

7
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:22,642
power supply voltage. The higher the power supply

8
00:00:22,642 --> 00:00:25,490
voltage, the higher the power is. And this relationship

9
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:28,366
is quadratic. So, doubling of the power supply

10
00:00:28,366 --> 00:00:31,460
voltage will actually quadruple the power. The next

11
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:34,550
factor is clock frequency. This is the gigahertz

12
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:36,240
number that you normally see on a processor

13
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:40,100
specification. And finally, the alpha is the activity

14
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:43,880
factor. Without this alpha, we are assuming that

15
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:47,660
the processor is constantly switching every clock cycle

16
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:50,825
all of it's transistors. So, alpha really says that,

17
00:00:50,825 --> 00:00:54,020
for example, only 10% of the process transistors

18
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:57,350
are actually active in any give clock cycle.

19
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:59,830
Now, let's see what happens to power, if,

20
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:02,540
after two years, we reduce the size of the

21
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:05,330
processor to one half of what it was,

22
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:08,880
because of technology improvement. The new capacitance is

23
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,720
half of what it was for one processor.

24
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:15,860
However, because we want to build a more powerful processor,

25
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:18,452
we put two of them on the chip. So, the

26
00:01:18,452 --> 00:01:20,970
C new really is equal to C old. Let's say

27
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:23,760
that the voltage and the frequency stay the same, and

28
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,940
let's say that it's still the same processor design, so

29
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:29,790
the same percentage of transistors are active. That means really

30
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:33,670
that the active power is relatively unchanged if we do

31
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:37,915
this. What we have is effectively a processor that consumes

32
00:01:37,915 --> 00:01:40,915
the same amount of power, but it does have twice

33
00:01:40,915 --> 00:01:43,390
the number of cores that it had before,

34
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:47,440
so it's, it's actually twice its capable computationally,

35
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,065
because each of those cores is still operating

36
00:01:50,065 --> 00:01:53,335
at the same frequency before. And it's really a

37
00:01:53,335 --> 00:01:55,965
very similar to the old core. In reality,

38
00:01:55,965 --> 00:01:58,805
smaller transistors are going to be faster, so we

39
00:01:58,805 --> 00:02:01,787
can increase the clock frequency of the processor

40
00:02:01,787 --> 00:02:05,977
too. So, let's say that the new clock frequency

41
00:02:05,977 --> 00:02:12,587
is 25% higher than the old one. That increases the power consumed. So, it's

42
00:02:12,587 --> 00:02:14,631
now twice as fast, because of the

43
00:02:14,631 --> 00:02:18,810
number of cores. Another 25% improvement because of

44
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:21,500
this. But the overall power consumption is

45
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:25,390
now higher. Smaller transistors, however, may let

46
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:27,436
us lower the power supply voltage while

47
00:02:27,436 --> 00:02:31,097
maintaining the same speed. So, let's say that

48
00:02:31,097 --> 00:02:34,100
the new power supply voltage is equal to

49
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:37,850
0.8 of the old power supply voltage. That

50
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:40,020
allows us to have a significantly lower power

51
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:44,396
consumption because of this square relationship. So 0.8 squared

52
00:02:44,396 --> 00:02:48,130
is 0.64. If we put these two together,

53
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:51,370
we can get something like the voltage. We don't

54
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:53,580
lower it as much, because if we did,

55
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:56,130
then we couldn't also increase the frequency, so we

56
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:58,960
lower it only a little bit. The frequency, we

57
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,380
can not increase it as much, because if we did,

58
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:03,970
we would have to keep the same power supply voltage

59
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:06,900
as before, so let's say we only increase the frequency

60
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:11,050
by a factor of 1.1. If you now apply this

61
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:14,570
equation, we get that the new power is about 90%

62
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:18,450
of the old power. So, what we got is now,

63
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:21,566
we have a chip that is having two cores instead

64
00:03:21,566 --> 00:03:24,800
of one. It has a lower power supply voltage,

65
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,720
but a higher frequency. So, each of these cores is

66
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,377
10% faster than the one used to be. And

67
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:33,332
yet, we have lowered power consumption. This is why it's

68
00:03:33,332 --> 00:03:35,884
so important for active power to have the technology

69
00:03:35,884 --> 00:03:39,290
improvement to reduce the size of transistors. And we also

70
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:41,970
have to realize that in order to get power

71
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:45,180
improvements, we really, really, really need to lower the voltage.
