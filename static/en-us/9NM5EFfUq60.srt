1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,660
This is where the knowledge
representation helps a lot.

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:07,770
The semantic network knowledge
representation provides a level of

3
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:12,480
abstraction at which the problem
gets represented and analyzed.

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,390
So, although this particular diamond
y could have been displaced here or

5
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:20,900
a little bit further, it could have been
of this size, maybe a little smaller,

6
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:22,340
a little bit larger.

7
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:25,150
The semantic network really
doesn't care about it.

8
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:28,240
With the level of extraction which
a semantic network is dealing,

9
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,900
y gets expanded, and
that is all that matters.

10
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:35,280
An important point to note here is
that any knowledge representation

11
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,440
picks a level of extraction at
which it represents the world.

12
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,010
There's a lot of power in
it because that knowledge

13
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:46,820
representation ignores things that
are at a low level of detail.

14
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:49,010
And therefore the problem-solving
method doesn't have to worry

15
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:50,540
about those things.

16
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:52,570
So it is not the knowledge
representation alone

17
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:56,570
that solves the problem, or the problem
solving method that solves the problem.

18
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:59,080
It is the knowledge representation and
the problem solving method

19
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:02,710
coupled together that solve the problem,
that provide the reasoning.
