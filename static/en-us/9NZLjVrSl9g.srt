00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Now, that we have the mechanical idea behind the SEIR model, turn that into a set of equations.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
For each term that may appear in these equations,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
enter the corresponding letter into one of these boxes.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Leave that box empty if it's not needed. 1/1 day, 1/5 days, 5*10⁻⁹ per day and person,

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
the number of susceptible persons, the number of exposed persons, the number of infectious persons,

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:36,000
the number of recovered persons, the product of the numbers of infectious and susceptible persons,

7
00:00:36,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and the product of the number of exposed and infectious persons.
