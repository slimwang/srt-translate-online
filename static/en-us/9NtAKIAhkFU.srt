00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,390
So far we have actually looked at
a variety of different topics, like for

2
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:08,290
example, how to use a panorama to give
you a better sense of space, actually

3
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:12,660
have a view which is much larger field
of view than usual images that you get.

4
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:15,190
We've also looked at how
to analyze videos, and

5
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:18,260
one of the specific things we've
looked at is video textures.

6
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:22,890
In this lecture, we're going to combine
both the concepts of video textures and

7
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:27,360
panorama building to create what is
referred to as panoramic video textures.

8
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:30,080
We're going to look at how we
can take a video of a scene,

9
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,720
use that to generate a larger
field of view of that scene, but

10
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:36,670
also incorporate in it
the dynamics of the scene,

11
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:39,980
specifically the kind of dynamics
that's captured through video textures.
