1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:03,600
Now there are alternatives to implementing [UNKNOWN] prefixes match with

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,920
a try. One could start with a content addressable memory or

3
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:09,700
a CAM. Now a CAM is a hardware base route

4
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:12,790
look up where the input is a tag and the output

5
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:14,870
is a value. So, for example, the tag might be

6
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:17,540
an address and the value might be the output port. Now,

7
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:21,020
the CAM really only supports exact match but it is an

8
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:25,390
O1. There is something called a Ternery CAM, where isntead of

9
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:30,650
exact matching In the tag, you can have 0, 1, or don't care,

10
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:35,120
or a star. The ternary CAM and in particular its support for a wild

11
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,700
card permits an implementation of longest prefix

12
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,220
match. One can thus have multiple matching

13
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:44,290
entries, but prioritize the match according to

14
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:46,720
the longest prefix in the ternary CAM.
