1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:03,500
So my answer in this case is one dimensional, and

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:06,190
you might disagree, but, in principle,

3
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:10,100
the data really falls onto this line over here which is one dimensional line.

4
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:13,660
We can make a new coordinate system, x prime and y prime.

5
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:17,040
And the truth is, it's not exactly one dimension,

6
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:19,760
there's sort of little deviations here and there.

7
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,540
But for the sake of understanding the data, I'm happy to treat those

8
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:28,620
deviations as noise and think of this as a one-dimensional data set.
