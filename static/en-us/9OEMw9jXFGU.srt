1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:04,912
This hypotenuse here would be 40 units in length. Great job if you've found

2
00:00:04,912 --> 00:00:08,807
this number. Remember, these are the legs of the triangle, since they form the

3
00:00:08,807 --> 00:00:14,000
90 degree angle. The side across from the 90 degree angle, this side is called

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,930
the hypoteneuse. We don't know the length of the hypoteneuse, so we'll call it

5
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:23,584
x. We'll start with our Pathagorean Theorem and we'll plug in the numbers for

6
00:00:23,584 --> 00:00:28,845
the legs here and then hypotenuse here. So, we'll have 32 squared plus 24

7
00:00:28,845 --> 00:00:33,948
squared equals x squared. We'll square each of these numbers and then we'll

8
00:00:33,948 --> 00:00:39,670
have these two added together equals x squared. This gives us 1600 equals x

9
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:43,602
squared. Now we want to take the square root of both sides of the equation to

10
00:00:43,602 --> 00:00:47,467
solve for x. When we take the square root, we'll need to include the plus or

11
00:00:47,467 --> 00:00:51,860
minus symbol. But, in this case, since the distance is positive, we can

12
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:57,860
disregard the negative root. We only want the positive root. This gives us x

13
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:02,630
equals 40, or 40 units in length. Now, there's another way to solve this

14
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:08,132
problem. And it involves a 3, 4, 5 right triangle. This is one of our special

15
00:01:08,132 --> 00:01:13,095
triangles. For our special right triangle, the side links are the ratio of 3 to

16
00:01:13,095 --> 00:01:17,630
4 to 5. It turns out the side lengths of this triangle are in the same exact

17
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:23,628
ratio. We know that the legs are 24 and 32. So, I'm going to put those here. If

18
00:01:23,628 --> 00:01:30,279
we multiply this leg by eight, we would end up with 24. And if we multiply this

19
00:01:30,279 --> 00:01:35,070
leg by eight, we would wind up with 32. So, we can see that eight would be the

20
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:40,060
multiplier for this ratio. So, to get the side length of a hypotenuse of this

21
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:45,530
triangle we would just need to multiple 5 by 8. This is another way without

22
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:50,375
using the Pythagorean Theorem that we can find this hypotenuse.
