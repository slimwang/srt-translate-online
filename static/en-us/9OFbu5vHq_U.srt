1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
In the previous example, I had highlighted ironcrutchli and x in red.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
They were identifiers, which is a formal way of saying

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
variable name or function name.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Identifiers are textual string descriptions that refer to program elements.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Things like factorial, s and tmp are all identifiers.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
We often call them identifiers because they identify a particular value

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
or storage location.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
We're going to allow our identifiers to start with lowercase letters

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
or also uppercase letters, and they can finish out

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
with any number of upper or lowercase letters.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Here we have another uppercase letter as time goes by,

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
and sometimes people like to use underscores to add readability.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
That's totally allowed in the identifier, but we'll say not at the beginning.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
You have to start with a letter, but after that you can have underscores.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Here I've shown 6 examples of identifiers,

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
and I would like you to use the interpreter

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:10,000
to write an identifier token rule for these sorts of JavaScript identifiers.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Try it out using the interpreter.
