00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,530
Here I'm going to actually show you the, focal length and

2
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:07,160
the field of views using this chart, as we go in forward.

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:12,240
So, the field of view was 120 degrees, in the horizontal,

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,850
when we were looking at 12 millimeter lens.

5
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:20,460
When we move to 24, 74 degrees, 15 millimeter, 40 degrees,

6
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:25,770
85 millimeter, 24 degrees, 116 millimeter, 17 degrees,

7
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:30,000
9 degrees field of view for 220 millimeter, and

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,220
300 millimeter basically shows 7 degrees, so much closer viewpoint.

9
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:38,050
Interesting way of looking at how we can go from a focal length of

10
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:41,620
12 millimeters to 300 millimeters and how the field of view changes.
