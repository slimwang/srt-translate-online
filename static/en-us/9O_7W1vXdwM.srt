1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,850
So now we will look at the things
involved when registering

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:04,720
an AdMob account.

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:08,490
This type of account is needed when you
show real ads, but it's not required

4
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:11,600
during test and development,
as we've talked about before.

5
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:15,280
So this is the registration page for
an AdMob account, and

6
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,980
the first thing we want to do is to
sign in with our Google account.

7
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:22,030
So we sign in with our email address,
and then our password.

8
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:26,080
So now we're signed in
with our Google account.

9
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,970
The next thing we need to do is
to provide the information for

10
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:31,860
an AdSense and AdWords account.

11
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:35,490
These are Google products that
AdMob uses, so when you sign up for

12
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:38,400
AdMob, you also need to sign up for
these products.

13
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:42,240
So for
AdSense we will fill out the country and

14
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:46,800
territory, and whether we want
a individual or business account.

15
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,520
And observe that this
cannot be changed later on.

16
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,200
The Payee name which must
match a bank account name.

17
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,403
This field you may not be
able to change either, so

18
00:00:57,403 --> 00:01:00,853
it's important to get it right,
and then the address

19
00:01:06,415 --> 00:01:08,759
And then we click Continue.

20
00:01:08,759 --> 00:01:10,680
Then we have the AdWords information.

21
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:17,050
And here we only need to fill out
the time zone and the billing currency.

22
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:19,690
And then we click Continue.

23
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:25,440
Now you need to read the program
policies and the terms and conditions.

24
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,190
I have already read these documents, so

25
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:29,840
I can immediately accept
these conditions.

26
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,640
Now, we're ready to
create our AdMob account.

27
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,800
And then click Get Started.

28
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:37,540
So this should now be your landing page.

29
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:40,520
And as you can see,
you now have a Publisher ID.

30
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:45,170
This ID is a unique identifier for your
AdMob account that you may use when you,

31
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:46,590
for example, contact support.
