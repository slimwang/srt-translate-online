Hi there.

2
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:04,078
My name's Lyla and I'm a course developer here at Udacity.

3
00:00:04,078 --> 00:00:07,140
Today I'm going to be walking you through an example of how to use a content

4
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:09,390
provider to access data from your Android device.

5
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:14,090
Of course you might be wondering what exactly is a content provider, so

6
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:17,550
before we start any of that I'm going to tell you a little bit about the joys of

7
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:18,800
content providers and

8
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,200
why application developers actually take the time to create them.

9
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:25,310
After that, we're going to learn how to use a standard Android content provider

10
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:28,850
to pull data from our Android device and put it on the UI.

11
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:29,560
Once we're done,

12
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:32,910
you're going to know how to use this important Android framework feature, so

13
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:33,540
let's get coding.
