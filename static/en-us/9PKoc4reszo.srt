As professor Horseman develops his car example, we'll do our own more

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:07,460
interesting example in parallel. Cars aren't where the money is. The money is

00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:11,970
in social networks, but existing social networks, I mean my parents are in

00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:15,290
existing social networks. Maybe we're going to need to start our own new social

00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:20,900
network. Let's call it Udacious.net. Social networks are all about people, so

6
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:24,150
we're going to need a person class. And the thing we're interested in them

00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:29,173
doing, is making friends. So, if we have two people, John and Maria, who meet.

8
00:00:29,173 --> 00:00:33,905
And now John considers Maria a friend, we need to update our persons objects to

9
00:00:33,905 --> 00:00:37,675
reflect that. What might the method call look like in Java?
