1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
So this heap property is a really useful thing, it's going to turn out.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
It's important to figure out how we can take a bunch of numbers

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and make them satisfy the heap property.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Let's do that. Let's start figuring out how that will work.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
First thing to notice is that any one-node tree satisfies the heap property

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
because it can't be bigger or smaller than the parent or the child

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
cause it doesn't have any parents or child.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:38,000
That case is really easy, but now, so let's imagine that we've somehow managed to create two heaps

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
and we've like to join them together by adding another node and have it the heap property hold.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Both of these subtrees the heap property holds which means the smallest values in the entire heap

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
are sitting here at the top of the relative roots, but now we're adding a new node.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
If this node is already smaller, then these two, then everything's fine but it might not be.

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
It might be that this is a large value.

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Let's give an example. So what do we do at this point?

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,000
We need a heap property to hold everywhere for this to actually be a heap. So what can we do?

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Well, so with respect to these three nodes, we're going to need to change something

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
to establish the heap property of this locally.

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
First thing we're going to do is we'll introduce some swapping around.

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Which value can we swap to the top to move things in the direction of

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
more establishing the heap property?

21
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Which of these values should be at the root here? Write the answer in the box.
