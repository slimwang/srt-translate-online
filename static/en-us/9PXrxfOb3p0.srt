1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
[Thrun] So it takes 47 numerical probabilities to specify the joint

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
compared to 65,000 if you didn't have the graph-like structure.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I think this example really illustrates the advantage

4
00:00:14,000 --> 99:59:59,999
of compact Bayes network representations over unstructured joint representations.
