1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,540
You can use these problems to go through the three steps of proving NP completeness.

2
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:10,130
Stating your problem as a decision problem and then show that it is in NP,

3
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:13,470
and finally, use one of these problems here or some other problem

4
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:16,850
that you know to be NP complete for a reduction.

5
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:23,230
To find additional NP complete problems, you can either go to the list in Wikipedia that I showed you

6
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:27,700
or you can see if your local university has a book on NP completeness.

7
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:32,670
One of the most famous ones is this one here called by most simply the Garey & Johnson,

8
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:36,540
but there are also other books that will give you a number of NP complete problems

9
00:00:36,540 --> 99:59:59,999
that you can use as a basis for a reduction.
