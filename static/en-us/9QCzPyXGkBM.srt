00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,395
To make it a little bit easier to visually differentiate between our lines, I've

2
00:00:04,407 --> 00:00:08,515
redrawn our graph and changed teh scale on either axis. So that we're only

3
00:00:08,527 --> 00:00:12,840
looking at a portion of the points that we were looking at before. I've also now

4
00:00:12,852 --> 00:00:17,140
color coded the lines to go with the different brands of solution. So brand one

5
00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:21,675
over here, which is written in dark grey, has the grey line on the graph. Brand

6
00:00:21,687 --> 00:00:26,564
two is in blue, and brand three is in orange. Now, using the techniques that we

7
00:00:26,576 --> 00:00:31,860
learned in the last lesson to calculate slope from points, can you calculate the

8
00:00:31,872 --> 00:00:34,051
slope of each of these three lines?
