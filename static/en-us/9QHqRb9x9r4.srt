00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:05,601
First, we'll talk about inter-rater reliability. First, the rater has to know

2
00:00:05,601 --> 00:00:10,515
the ratee well ,for a long period of time and have observed the person in many

3
00:00:10,515 --> 00:00:17,724
different situations. Second, ideally we would have many different raters rate

4
00:00:17,724 --> 00:00:24,373
the personality of an individual to reduce or avoid bias. With children or even

5
00:00:24,373 --> 00:00:29,521
animals who cannot read their own personalities we need to have observers rate

6
00:00:29,521 --> 00:00:36,197
personality. Traits such as introvert, extravert, anxious, worrying, friendly,

7
00:00:36,197 --> 00:00:41,007
warm and dependable for example, have particular behaviors associated with

8
00:00:41,007 --> 00:00:46,567
them. But rating other people's personality is not as simple as it may first

9
00:00:46,567 --> 00:00:52,178
seem. As we just mentioned, the rater must know the person well, and we need

10
00:00:52,178 --> 00:00:58,232
inter-rater reliability, that is, consistency between different raters. For

11
00:00:58,232 --> 00:01:02,264
example, if someone is deemed hostile by one person and friendly by another

12
00:01:02,264 --> 00:01:07,150
person, then we do not have a reliable reading of personality.
