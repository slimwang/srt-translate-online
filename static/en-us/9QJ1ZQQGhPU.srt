1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
In our solution, we always compute the

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
t and x and v value at the beginning of the next step,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
and you make use of the fact that the entry number

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
0 of t and the entry number 0 of x and the entry number 0 of v

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
are already equal to 0, which is what we want.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
If you run the program, you see that per second,

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
the velocity decreases by 10 m/s.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
It starts out at 0 and keeps decreasing,

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
which means the speed, the magnitude

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
of the velocity keeps increasing.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
This falling object gets faster and faster,

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
but in a negative direction, which is our x coordinate

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
starts at 0 as intended.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It decreases slowly

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
and then faster and faster.

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
You see gravitational acceleration in action.
