00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
[Narrator] Before diving into too much detail,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
let me explain to you why MDPs really matter.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
What you see here is a robotic tour guide

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
that the University of Bonn, with my assistance,

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
deployed in the German museum in Bonn,

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
and the objective of the this robot was to

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
navigate the museum and guide visitors,

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
mostly kids, from exhibit to exhibit.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
This is a challenging planning problem because

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
as the robot moves

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
it can't really predict its action outcomes

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
because of the randomness of the environment

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
and the carpet and the wheels of the robot.

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
The robot is not able to really follow its own commands very well,

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
and it has to take this into consideration during the planning process

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
so when it finds itself in a location it didn't expect,

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
it knows what to do.

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
In the second video here, you see a successor robot

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
that was deployed in the Smithsonian National

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Museum of American History in the late 1990s

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
where it guided many, many thousands of kids

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
through the entrance hall of the museum,

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
and once again, this is a challenging planning problem.

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
As you can see people are often in the way of the robot.

25
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The robot has to take detours.

26
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Now this one is particularly difficult because

27
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
there were obstacles that were invisible

28
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
like a downward staircase.

29
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
So this is a challenging localization problem

30
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
trying to find out where you are,

31
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
but that's for a later class.

32
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
In the video here, you see a robot being deployed in a nursing home

33
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
with the objective to assist elderly people

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
by guiding them around, bring them to appointments,

35
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
reminding them to take their medication, and

36
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
interacting with them, and this robot has been active for many, many years

37
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
and been used, and, again, it's a very challenging planning problem

38
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
to navigate through this elderly home.

39
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
And the final robot I'm showing you here.

40
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
This was built with my colleague Will Whittaker at Carnegie Melon University.

41
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
The objective here was to explore abandoned mines.

42
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Pennsylvania and West Virginia

43
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
and other states are heavily mined.

44
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
There's many abandoned old coal mines,

45
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
and for many of these mines,

46
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
it's unknown what the conditions are and where exactly they are.

47
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
They're not really human accessible.

48
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
They tend to have roof fall and very low oxygen levels.

49
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
So we made a robot that went inside

50
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
and built maps of those mines.

51
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
All these problems have in common that they

52
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
have really challenging planning problems.

53
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
The environments are stochastic.

54
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
That is the outcome of actions are unknown,

55
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
and the robot has to be able to react to

56
00:02:39,000 --> 99:59:59,999
all kinds of situations, even the ones that it didn't plan for.
