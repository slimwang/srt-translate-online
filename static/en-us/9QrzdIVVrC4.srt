1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:04,320
What linearity is going to allow us to do is to build up a signal or

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:08,000
a function, remember an image, a piece at a time and

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,540
then be able to say how a linear operator affects that whole image.

4
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:16,840
Right? Because, basically the way both linearity allows us to say is if I

5
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:19,710
could sum up a bunch of things to make an image,

6
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:23,350
then if I apply a linear operator to that whole image, it's going to be

7
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:27,000
the same as the sum of applying that linear operator to each of the pieces.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,090
And it let's us talk about things in an effective way.

9
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:33,930
So, to do that we need sort of these building blocks of a function.

10
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:38,810
And the building block of functions is what's referred to as an impulse.

11
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:42,990
And the impulse function in a discrete world is very easy to talk about.

12
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:47,280
It's a single point with a value 1, and it looks just like an impulse.

13
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,540
In the continuous world, an impulse is a little bit trickier because what

14
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:52,970
does it mean to be sort of at a single point width, you know,

15
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:57,840
it would have some amount 1, and that's where you have to turn on your calculus

16
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,280
hats just a little bit, no, I guess you put on your calculus hats, right?

17
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:09,920
And an impulse is actually a small, little signal whose area is 1.

18
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,310
Okay? So, and as the thing gets narrower and narrower in width,

19
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:18,310
it has to get taller in height in order to maintain that same area.

20
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:20,850
And in the limit what you get is an impulse.

21
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:23,820
So it's got 0 width and infinite height, but it's,

22
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:27,850
it's integral, it's area is 1, and that's what's referred to as an impulse.

23
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:29,810
We're going to mostly stay in the discrete world, so

24
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:32,000
we won't have to worry too much about that.

25
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,730
So the, the cool thing about an impulse is the following.

26
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:38,640
Suppose I've got some sort of a system, a black box.

27
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,600
So it's a function H, right?

28
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,470
So, sorry, it's an operator H.

29
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:45,040
And we don't know, actually, anything about it.

30
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,880
But if I put in an impulse, okay, so

31
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:53,070
I put an impulse into the system, I can see what comes out.

32
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:56,050
By the way, that response is called the impulse response.

33
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:58,860
Not, not all that clever, right?

34
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:04,090
So what's really cool is, if I know what the impulse response

35
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:10,080
of some black box H is, maybe we'll call that h of x, okay.

36
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:15,000
I can describe what this operators going to do by h of x.

37
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
The reason that works is the following.

38
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,760
Since any sequence of pulses here, and we're going to do this in 2D in a minute,

39
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:26,980
can be described by just adding in a shifted set and

40
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:30,150
scaled set of those single impulses.

41
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:35,260
If I know how this black box effects just the single impulse.

42
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:38,560
I'll be able to say how it affects the entire image.

43
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,130
Okay?

44
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:41,000
And that's why impulse responses matter.
