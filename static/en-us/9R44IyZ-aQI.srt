1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
And the answer is depressing.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
If you, once again, draw the truth table,

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
you find, for the different combinations,

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
that if you've drawn coin 1,

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
you'd never see tails.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
So this case over here, which indeed has tails, tails.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
We have 0 probability.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
We can work this out probability of drawing the first coin at 0.5,

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
but the probability of tails given the first coin

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
must be 0, because the probability of heads is 1,

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
so 0.5 times 0 times 0,

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
that is 0.

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
So the only case where you might see tails/tails is

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
when you actually drew coin 2,

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
and this has a probability of

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
0.5 times the probability of tails

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
given that we drew the second coin,

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
which is 0.4 times 0.4 again,

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
and that's the same as 0.08

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
would have been the correct answer.
