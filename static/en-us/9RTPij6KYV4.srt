1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:03,790
All right, now,
it's time to play with some textures.

2
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:06,230
Let's hop back into the Unity editor.

3
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:11,113
First let's make a new material by
clicking on the Create button and

4
00:00:11,113 --> 00:00:12,920
then going to Material.

5
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:18,400
Let's call this material Chessboard,
okay.

6
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:24,311
Let's go ahead and set the albedo
to a nice light tan color.

7
00:00:24,311 --> 00:00:27,961
Something like this, great.

8
00:00:27,961 --> 00:00:34,620
Now right-click on the hierarchy,
go to 3D Object, and Cube.

9
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:39,551
Over in the Transform component,

10
00:00:39,551 --> 00:00:45,035
set the cube's position to -3,
0.5, and 1, great.

11
00:00:45,035 --> 00:00:50,890
Now, let's rename our cube to be
something like Checkerboard Cube.

12
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,300
And let's drag and

13
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:57,410
drop our new chessboard material
onto our Checkerboard Cube.

14
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:03,310
Okay, so now we have a tan cube but
it doesn't look much like a chessboard.

15
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,550
If you look at the material that you
created, you'll notice little boxes

16
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:15,140
besides many of the rows, here,
here, here and all the rest of these.

17
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:17,769
You can drag and drop textures
into these boxes to assign them.

18
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,990
Each row represents a different type of
material property like albedo, depth,

19
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:26,130
light emission and more.

20
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:30,190
Go to the project pane and
find the search bar, and search for

21
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:32,335
an image called checkerboard.

22
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:39,370
Now, drag and
drop your checkerboard image right into

23
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:44,290
that slot beside the word albedo,
awesome.

24
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:47,760
You just assigned the texture
to this material.

25
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:53,230
And you'll notice your box is starting
to look a lot more like a chessboard.

26
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:56,770
But to finish things off,
let's scale down the box a bit.

27
00:01:56,770 --> 00:02:03,680
Go to the Scale tool, select your cube
and then scale it down along the y axis.

28
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:08,979
Let's also scale the whole
thing down quite a bit, great.

29
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:15,008
Now, go to the Move tool and
move the chessboard onto

30
00:02:15,008 --> 00:02:19,193
the kitchen counter,
something like that.

31
00:02:19,193 --> 00:02:22,040
It looks great.

32
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,160
Okay, who wants to play some chess?
