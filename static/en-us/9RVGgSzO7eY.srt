00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:05,052
We've used the LCD to add and subtract fractions and even simplify complex

2
00:00:05,052 --> 00:00:10,740
fractions. Let's use this LCD one last time to solve equations like this one.

3
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:15,164
This is an example of an equation with a rational expressions. These two

4
00:00:15,164 --> 00:00:19,074
fractions in particular are the rational expressions. We have a polynomial

5
00:00:19,074 --> 00:00:24,816
denominator here x. And a polynomial in the denominator here, 2 x. Before we get

6
00:00:24,816 --> 00:00:29,238
started solving this equation, let's think about what values of x would not make

7
00:00:29,238 --> 00:00:33,535
this equation true. If x equaled one of these numbers, it wouldn't make the

8
00:00:33,535 --> 00:00:35,889
equation true. Which one is it?
