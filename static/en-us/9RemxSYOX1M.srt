00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:04,877
A little while ago, we saw these two equations. And even though they look

2
00:00:04,877 --> 00:00:09,200
really different, we mentioned that they are equivalent to one another. We also

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:13,560
saw that this equation over here on the right, written in this particular form,

4
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:17,910
became very useful when we looked at the quadratic equations that go along with

5
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:23,290
these equations for parabolas. These two equations are also equivalent. But

6
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:28,280
the equation 0 equals negative one-eighth times the quantity x minus 4,

7
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:33,660
times the quantity x minus 28, is very useful to us because from it,

8
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:39,340
we can just read off the locations of the x intercepts. We have one at x equals

9
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:45,530
4, and we have another at x equals 28. Now we were just looking at this equation

10
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:49,930
to help us deal with the expanding dimensions of Grant's growing floor space.

11
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:55,213
We had 0 equals x squared plus 25x minus 150.

12
00:00:55,213 --> 00:01:00,640
What kind of equation is this, though? Is this a linear equation, or

13
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,410
is it an equation for a parabola? Or is it a quadratic equation?
