00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,140
How can we use a minimum spanning tree for shortest tour?

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:07,430
Well there's actually one more thing we need to talk about in terms of terminology

3
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:10,570
so that I can give you an algorithm for shortest tour.

4
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:13,890
Then you will hopefully be able to explain to Dave as well, should he ask you.

5
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:17,390
The edges are still there, but we will just look at the minimum spanning tree for now.

6
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:22,790
The terminology that I would like to introduce to you is that of a walk along a tree.

7
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:26,120
Of course you can define this formally, but it's actually quite easy to see.

8
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:29,800
What I mean by this is if you want to do a shortest tour on a tree,

9
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:32,460
then a shortest tour on a tree goes something like this.

10
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:36,070
You start out at a certain vertex, and then you can travel along that tree

11
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:38,820
by using every edge exactly twice.

12
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,960
Just the way that I'm doing right now.

13
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,580
Actually it's not possible to do it any other way.

14
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:46,460
I mean of course you can walk along the tree in a different order,

15
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:51,920
but actually if you want to do a walk along a tree, then you have to use every edge twice.

16
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,870
Then of course you return back to your origin.

17
00:00:54,870 --> 99:59:59,999
This would be a walk along the minimum spanning tree.
