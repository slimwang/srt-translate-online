00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
[Thrun] I would now like to ask the exact same question

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
for the maximum likelihood estimator.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
So let's not assume we have Laplacian smoothing

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and instead use the maximum likelihood estimator.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Simply compute for me the probability of movie for the title Perfect Storm.
