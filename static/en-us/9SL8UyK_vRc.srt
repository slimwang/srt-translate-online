00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:05,455
We'll want to have the equation x squared plus y squared equals 16. Great

2
00:00:05,455 --> 00:00:09,506
thinking if you got this equation. Remember that circles that are centered at

3
00:00:09,506 --> 00:00:14,746
the origin are of this form, x squared plus y squared equals r squared. We know

4
00:00:14,746 --> 00:00:21,458
that the radius is 4, so we simply replace r with the value of 4. So we'll have

5
00:00:21,458 --> 00:00:26,531
x squared plus y squared equals 4 squared, which is really 16.
