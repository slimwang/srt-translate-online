1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:04,360
As we said earlier,
you've probably used PKI on the web.

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:06,540
An example is Google Mail.

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:10,870
This also helps explain the value
of the certificate authority.

4
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:13,440
We're using Mozilla Firefox here,
but you can,

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,300
and should do the same with any browser.

6
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:20,220
This lock icon,
adjacent to the URL of the website,

7
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:23,330
indicates that it's secure, using HTTPS.

8
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:30,610
Clicking on it, as we see here,
indicates the site name www.google.com,

9
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:33,280
and that the connection is encrypted.

10
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,460
Clicking here,

11
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:39,100
brings up more information, including
the name of the certificate authority.

12
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:41,610
In this case, Thawte Consulting.

13
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:45,110
This would be the entity
that issued the certificate.

14
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:47,870
You already know that
browser can verify that by

15
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:50,840
using the certificate
authorities public key.

16
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:55,010
So browsers are normally shipped with
those keys to use for this purpose.

17
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:58,620
Remember, it is a public key,
so anyone can have it.

18
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:03,790
Finally, clicking here,
brings up Google's public key,

19
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:06,040
showing that it really is public.

20
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:10,070
The text provides more details about
the key, and their references for

21
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:13,010
the more technically inclined students,
who want to know even more.
