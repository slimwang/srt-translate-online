1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
That means, in our garble table we'll have our outputs encrypted with different keys

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
corresponding to inputs that corresponds to that output value.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Of course, we can't send that whole table. That would reveal the values of a0 and b0.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
We need to remove this part of the table.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Then we need to randomly permute the order of these entries.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
The other thing will do is add some padding.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
That means after the garbling we'll have a table that's looks like this.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Because each of these values is encrypted with a different key,

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
the evaluator can't tell which one is which.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The evaluator still needs to be able to decrypt these to produce the right output.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
The question is how does the evaluator know what the output of that truth table is?

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
The evaluator could try decrypting all the entries and pick the one that seems correct.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
The evaluator could try decrypting all the entries using the input value keys known to the evaluator,

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
and use the one that decrypts to something of the form pad concatenated with x,

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
and then use this value as the output, or it is not possible

16
00:00:57,000 --> 99:59:59,999
based on what the evaluator knows.
