00:00:00,003 --> 00:00:04,163
So, let's spend a bit of time now looking at this new graph that Athena is using

2
00:00:04,163 --> 00:00:08,060
for her box-making project. Now, I think that it's pretty incredible if we take

3
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:11,470
a second to notice just how different this new purple curve looks from this

4
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:15,380
other shape, a parabola, which we're super familiar with by now. Now, if we look

5
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:20,070
at their equations, you can notice that the defining difference between the two

6
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:24,754
equations is that this one, for the purple curve is of degree 3. And this one

7
00:00:24,754 --> 00:00:31,200
for the parabola is, of course, of degree 2. So, let's explore what makes this

8
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:36,960
graph different, just a little bit deeper. So, the first things first, are both

9
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,635
of these graphs functions? For each equation, pick whether or not it is a

10
00:00:41,635 --> 00:00:42,343
function.
