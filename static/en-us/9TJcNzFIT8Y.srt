00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,840
To illustrate the technique of constraint propagation, let us consider this

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,820
figure drawn on a 2D surface. Although this figure has been drawn on a 2D

3
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:13,300
surface, you and I can almost immediately recognize that this is a 3D cube.

4
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:15,690
How did we recognize that this is a 3D cube?

5
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:20,730
How can we help machines do it? Cube is an example of a trihedral object.

6
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:25,720
A trihedral object is one with three surfaces joined at a particular point,

7
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:29,870
at this particular point. In general, what [UNKNOWN] a polyhedral surfaces.

8
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:34,590
A polyhedral surface is one where multiple surfaces join at the same point. So

9
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:39,680
a soccer ball, with its white and black patterns, is an example of a polyhedral

10
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:44,240
object because at one point several surfaces can join. A pyramid is another good

11
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:48,920
example of a polyhedral object. A pyramid has four surfaces joining, at

12
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:54,130
the apex. So let's do a simple exercise together. Here are six figures all drawn

13
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:59,900
on a 2D surface. Which of these six figures do you think represents a 3D object?
