00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:04,443
Cay and I are in a twitter battle. I claimed that I will always have at least

2
00:00:04,443 --> 00:00:10,380
one more twitter follower than he has. In other words, my number of twitter

3
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:13,644
followers will always be greater than or equal to the number that Cay has plus

4
00:00:13,644 --> 00:00:19,397
one. Is this true, if Cay has three followers and I have a four. What about

5
00:00:19,397 --> 00:00:26,152
this statement that Cay plus one is greater than or equal to Sara. How about

6
00:00:26,152 --> 00:00:30,063
the statement Cay plus one does not equal Sara?
