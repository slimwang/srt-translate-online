1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Now let's work through it from the top.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Initially x is 1, and then I define a new function tricky, but I haven't called it yet,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
so I'm not actually going to make any new variable spaces over here.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
And then I print out the value of x.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Currently x is 1, and now I call tricky on x,

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
and we noted before that whenever we make a function call we get a new box

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
corresponding to that function call. This one knows who its parents are,

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and this new box is going to have room for all the formal parameters in tricky,

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
also x, and this time we're passing in x.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The current value of x is 1, huh, so we've got almost a duplicate sort of state.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
So now we're inside tricky, and we say x=x+5.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
The real question is: Which one do we change?

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
The answer is this bottom, more specific one down here.

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
This x has shadowed, has taken the place of in our hearts, the old one.

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
So I change just this one to 6, so here, when I'm printing out the value of x,

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
we look in this world, we see a 6, and we print it out.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
And now we return from tricky, and when we return from a function call,

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
you can imagine we throw away all of its space, and we're back here in the normal world.

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Well, what's the value of x here? It's 1.

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
So this assignment statement, x=x+5, changed the function's actual argument

21
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
but did not change this more global value of x.

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,000
We call these boxes that help us keep track of storage places for variables environments.

23
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Kind of like before, when we were talking about state being a bit like the world,

24
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,000
you can view a particular environment like Central Asia or Western Europe or Antarctica

25
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
as being a little region in the world that might have its own values for variables.

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
If I want to know what the temperature is, well, it depends on the current environment.

27
00:01:47,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Are you in the Sahara desert or are you in Northern Sweden?
