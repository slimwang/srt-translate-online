1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,009
So the correct answers are here.

2
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:06,520
First of all, you'll create a Google API
client that uses your desired API.

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:08,570
In the example I showed earlier,

4
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:12,630
I was using the location services
API with a Google API client.

5
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:15,550
With others, you may be doing login,
you may be doing maps, you may be

6
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:19,260
doing other things, but you'll still
be using a GoogleApiClient for that.

7
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:23,530
You'll next extend your activity
with the ConnectionCallbacks.

8
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:26,770
These are the heart of
the asynchronous programming model,

9
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:30,810
where the services can call you back
whenever something important happens.

10
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:35,140
You'll also need to extend your activity
with the OnConnectionFailedListener.

11
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:37,830
In case the connection fails, so
that you can handle it gracefully.

12
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:41,830
And then, finally, after connecting
the GoogleApiClient that you

13
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:46,460
created earlier on, you wait for
the onConnected callback.

14
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:48,690
Once you get the onConnected callback,

15
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:52,130
you know that your ApiClient
is connected to the services.

16
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:54,950
And you're able to make
the calls on those services.

17
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:55,880
And then once you've done that,

18
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:59,070
you can follow the requirements
of your specific API.

19
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:02,530
Like for example, as you saw earlier on,
I was doing location work, so

20
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:06,090
I also had an on location
changed method, that was firing

21
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:09,920
whenever the location changed,
as a result of the location request.

22
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,560
You'll see all of this in much more
detail in the location services module,

23
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,950
as well as all of the other modules.

24
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:21,030
This sequence will be used in every
app that you build and you'll

25
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:24,640
want to be sure that you know it as you
move through the rest of the class.

26
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,330
Since this sequence is so important,
take some time to think of a good way to

27
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:32,290
remember these steps and then maybe
go post in the forum about it.

28
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:34,920
Also take some time to read
what other people have said.

29
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,930
You might find a methodology
that works for you.
