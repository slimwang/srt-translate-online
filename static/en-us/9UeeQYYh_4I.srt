Before answering this question,

2
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:06,689
I want to urge you to carefully
read all of the answers.

3
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:12,330
It's entirely possible that more than
one will technically be correct.

4
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:14,070
We're looking for the best answer.

5
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:19,400
So by now it should be clear that
chronic diseases are very important.

6
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:22,350
So let's make sure you understand
their key characteristics.

7
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:27,350
Which of these is not a chronic disease?

8
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:29,150
Check any and all that apply.
