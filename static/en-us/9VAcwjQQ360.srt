00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:03,550
In the native Java Datastore API, all property

2
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:06,689
values are indexed by default. If you forget to

3
00:00:06,689 --> 00:00:09,135
think carefully about which properties really need to be

4
00:00:09,135 --> 00:00:12,455
indexed, you could end up with index bloat. However,

5
00:00:12,455 --> 00:00:15,323
objectify helps you out and by default property

6
00:00:15,323 --> 00:00:18,960
values are not indexed when you use objectify. So,

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,060
if you want a property to be indexed, you

8
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:26,930
need to add the @Index annotation to the property.

9
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:29,470
However, if you prefer that by default all

10
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:32,119
the properties of a class are indexed, then you

11
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:36,670
add the @Index annotation to the class and

12
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:40,505
then you can add @UnIndex to each property that

13
00:00:40,505 --> 00:00:43,050
you don't want to be indexed. You can

14
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:45,900
also add conditions so that a property's only indexed

15
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:49,180
if it meets certain criteria. For example, only index

16
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:52,410
a property if the value is greater than 100.

17
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:55,530
There's good documentation about conditional indexing in the

18
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:58,710
Objectify Developer's Guide. So what I'm going to want you

19
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:00,860
to do next, is actually go read the developer's

20
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:04,040
guide. It's at this link, or actually an easier

21
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,050
way to find it is just to search

22
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:09,630
on Google for objectify. This brings you down into

23
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:13,080
the open-source project for objectify. Then you click on

24
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:17,600
the wiki. And then, expand the users guide and

25
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,340
you go to the queries and indexes page.
