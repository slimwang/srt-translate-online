00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,910
Earlier we discussed syntax and
semantics and

2
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:07,930
said that syntax is structure
while semantics is meaning.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,930
The HL7 Reference Implementation Model,
or RIM,

4
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:18,180
defines the semantics of a common
set of administrative financial and

5
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:22,240
clinical concepts in order
to foster interoperability.

6
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:27,800
It consists of five abstract concepts.

7
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,210
Each happening is an Act.

8
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:35,040
Examples include procedures,
observations and medications.

9
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,220
Acts are connected through
Act Relationships.

10
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:43,860
Participation defines the context for
an Act author, performer,

11
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:45,800
subject or location.

12
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:50,760
The participants have Roles,
such as patient, provider and so on.

13
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:55,200
And Roles are played by Entities,
which could be persons, organizations,

14
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:58,690
material, places or even devices.
