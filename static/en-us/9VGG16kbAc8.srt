00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,710
So, here's a, a very simple outermost state chart in which we

2
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:09,570
have an unplugged state and a plugged-in state. The pulling the plug causes us

3
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:13,840
to go from the plugged-in state to the unplugged state. And I've labeled here,

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,720
this is not part of the state chart notation, but

5
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:18,810
I've labeled here, what the event number is in our table.

6
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:23,310
So vent number five is the pulling of the plug. Symmetrically, the,

7
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:27,320
going from the unplugged to the plugged-in state is plugging in the plug, and

8
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:31,721
that's, that's event number six, okay? But for the remainder of the,

9
00:00:31,721 --> 00:00:36,520
this exercise, we're only going to, consider sub states of the plugged-in state.

10
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:40,940
That is, now, imagine that, the rightmost state here has all of those other

11
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:44,380
concurrently executing machines which we were, talking about previously.
