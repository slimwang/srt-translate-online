00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:01,380
The way I've always thought of it,

2
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:06,550
in those early days,
is that you have the 100% of your time.

3
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:09,960
Which is building the product and
getting the product out there and

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,630
making sure people know the product.

5
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:14,750
And then the other 100% of your time,
which is running the business.

6
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:16,040
And that in those early days,

7
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:20,980
when you've started hiring, a big part
of that second 100% is just hiring.

8
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:23,580
Finding people, talking to people,

9
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:26,990
getting them excited about
the impact that they can have.

10
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:32,600
And I wish there was a better
answer than the balances.

11
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:33,700
You just have to work a lot.
