If you've got these numbers for your scientific notations, and a positive 2 as

2
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:08,690
your exponent, great work. These two numbers are large numbers, so they'll need

3
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:12,736
positive exponents for the power of 10. And these numbers are less than 1,

4
00:00:12,736 --> 00:00:16,767
they're small, so they'll need negative exponents. Now I'm going to work with

5
00:00:16,767 --> 00:00:20,958
the powers of 10 down here to simplify them. When we multiply the same bases, we

6
00:00:20,958 --> 00:00:26,137
add the exponents. So we'll have 10 to the third, divided by 10 to the 1. And

7
00:00:26,137 --> 00:00:30,956
next, we divide the bases of 10, so we subtract the exponents, giving us 10

8
00:00:30,956 --> 00:00:31,633
squared.
