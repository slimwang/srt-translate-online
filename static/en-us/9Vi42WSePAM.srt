1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,735
So, here's how far we've gotten. We have
our first polynomial factor, x+5, treated as

2
00:00:04,747 --> 00:00:09,459
a block, and it is multiplying each of the
terms inside the second set of

3
00:00:09,459 --> 00:00:13,215
parentheses. The next step is to apply the
distributive property, once again. You

4
00:00:13,227 --> 00:00:19,172
know that we would rearrange each of these
terms so that the factor x+5 comes after

5
00:00:19,172 --> 00:00:23,258
the factors that only have one term inside
them. And then once we got here we would

6
00:00:23,258 --> 00:00:27,638
use the distributive property again, to
simplify for each of these terms. So let's

7
00:00:27,638 --> 00:00:30,905
take a second and compare what we're doing
in this step of the problem to what we did

8
00:00:30,917 --> 00:00:35,015
in the very first step. In both cases,
we're using the distributive property. We

9
00:00:35,027 --> 00:00:38,930
used it the first time, so that we could
set ourselves up to do it again. Notice

10
00:00:38,942 --> 00:00:43,671
though, which numbers and variables are
written here. We have an x and a -2 and

11
00:00:43,683 --> 00:00:48,965
then we have an x and a +5. And those are
just the same terms that are in the two

12
00:00:48,965 --> 00:00:54,655
polynomials up here. The things that we're
multiplying together are x and x, x and x,

13
00:00:54,655 --> 00:01:03,690
x and 5, x and 5, -2 and x, -2 and x, and
5 and -2. What we've done here, using the

14
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:10,038
distributive property, is just make sure
that every term in the first polynomial is

15
00:01:10,038 --> 00:01:15,332
multiplied by every term in the second
polynomial. Here we've reach another point

16
00:01:15,332 --> 00:01:19,027
where we can use a sort of shortcut, so we
don't have to do quite as many steps in

17
00:01:19,027 --> 00:01:19,996
the problem.
