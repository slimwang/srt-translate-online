00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,630
Now you may have noticed, one of the annoying things about

2
00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:05,640
using input this way, is that it's distracting to have the

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:08,860
address bar on the screen when I'm taking a picture. One

4
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:11,880
thing you might want to do is take your app full screen.

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,690
This is pretty simple to do. Just grab the dom element

6
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:16,850
that you want to make full screen, that you want to

7
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:21,630
be the root of the window and call its requestFullscreen method.

8
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:25,370
Now, at the time of this recording, requestFullscreen is still vendor

9
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:29,650
prefixed, so we'll have to use webkitRequestFullscreen and

10
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:33,500
mozRequestFullScreen. One important thing to notice here is the

11
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,570
difference in capitalization. Kind of annoying, but it'll

12
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:39,600
get fixed sooner or later. One important thing to

13
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,410
note is that you can only call this API in the handler for a user action. Like,

14
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:47,300
clicking on a button. This is to avoid

15
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:50,550
apps forcing users into full-screen mode. You can't just

16
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,060
do this when you're loading the page.
