As we are talking about video,

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:05,490
I'm sure you have experienced taking
videos with handheld cameras like this.

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:08,180
Casual videos taken with
smaller cameras like this

4
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:10,530
are prone to a lot of shake and jitter.

5
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:13,470
We're going to talk about what's
happening when you actually have that

6
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:14,720
kind of shake and jitter.

7
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:17,900
And more importantly, I'm going to
introduce to a method that we actually

8
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:21,370
here have developed at Georgia Tech
ourselves that removes the shake and

9
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:22,830
jitter as a post process.
