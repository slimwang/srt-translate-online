00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:11,549
72 nozzles, but one afternoon things took
a turn for the worse. One of his customers

00:00:11,549 --> 00:00:15,369
called, saying that she had just gotten
contacts and she would no longer be

4
00:00:15,369 --> 00:00:19,718
needing the wipers or the nozzles that she
had requested. Another person emailed him

to say that he had gotten laser eye
surgery and he wanted to cancel his order

00:00:23,447 --> 00:00:27,545

00:00:27,557 --> 00:00:32,360
customers, he was frustrated that he would
never be able to target the population

that didn't wear glasses.
