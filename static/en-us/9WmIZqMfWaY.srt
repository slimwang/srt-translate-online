00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:05,650
We just decided that for this situation, we need to have x being greater than 0.

2
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:10,754
But what if I told you that this restriction on x had a special name? In fact,

3
00:00:10,754 --> 00:00:16,804
it does. In this case, x is greater than 0 is called the domain of the function

4
00:00:16,804 --> 00:00:20,498
A of x. So, if this is the case, then what do you think we can say in general

5
00:00:20,498 --> 00:00:24,963
about domain? Is the domain of a function the set of all possible inputs? The

6
00:00:24,963 --> 00:00:29,263
set of all possible outputs? The set of all possible values at the independant

7
00:00:29,263 --> 00:00:33,117
variable? Or the set of possible values of the dependent variable?
