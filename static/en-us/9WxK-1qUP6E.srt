00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:03,730
What is software design? Software design is the process of

2
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:07,880
building a program while satisfying the program's functional requirements and

3
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:12,140
not violating any of its non-functional constraints. This is going to turn out

4
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:16,560
to be a question of trade offs. How do you trade off between performance and

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:21,570
resource consumption, for example? Software design is normally broken into two

6
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:27,280
different phases, architectural design and detail design. Architectural design

7
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:31,350
is the process of carving up the programs into components and

8
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:36,010
assigning responsibilities for aspects of behavior to each component and talking

9
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:39,480
about how the components are going to interact with each other. We're going to

10
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:43,560
spend a great deal of time in this course talking about architectural design.

11
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:48,060
Detail design is the process of dealing with the individual components.

12
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:52,410
Particularly, with respect to their data structures and their algorithms.

13
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:55,310
Let's look for a minute at some of the aspects of detail design.
