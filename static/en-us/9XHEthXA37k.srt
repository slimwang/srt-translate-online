00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,160
So before you made that change,
I asked you to think about whether it

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:07,110
would be better to clean bad stuff out
of posts as soon as the user sends them,

3
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:10,770
before we put them in the database or
whether we should put them

4
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:14,630
into the database as they are and
clean them up before we display them.

5
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:17,150
It turns out that there
are arguments both ways.

6
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:20,670
Usually you'll hear programmers talk
about input sanitization, meaning that

7
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:25,180
we clean bad stuff out of user input,
before we do anything at all with it,

8
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:29,480
that way if someone later displays
the stored posts using another app.

9
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:32,980
They don't have to worry about bad
stuff hiding, in the database.

10
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:36,600
But on the other hand, if we wanted
an accurate record of what users have

11
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:40,340
sent to us, maybe we want to preserve
bad input in the database, and

12
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:42,660
do output sanitization instead.

13
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:45,600
People have different opinions,
about which of these is best.

14
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,190
Right now, since we already have
live bad stuff in the database,

15
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:51,180
we definitely need to sanitize output.

16
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:52,500
But we could sanitize input as well.
