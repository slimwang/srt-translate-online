00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:03,600
Let's try a simple exercise. See the object in

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,380
the photo? That's a strange looking object. So let's see

3
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:08,790
if you can figure out how it can be

4
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:11,830
used simply by what you can see and infer from

5
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:15,910
the photograph. Here are some possibilities. This doesn't exhaust

6
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:19,150
the possibilities. Think of some yourself, and type them in

7
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:23,080
the box below. Maybe it's an upside down candle

8
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:25,520
holder and it can be moved by those three handles.

9
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:30,230
Or, maybe it's a decorative flowerpot. Oh, it, it's, it's

10
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:34,600
a cup for a three-handed person. Or, maybe it's pottery made

11
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,710
by a drunk. You know, as William Shakespeare said, it's

12
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:41,630
made by an idiot full of sounds and fury signifying nothing.
