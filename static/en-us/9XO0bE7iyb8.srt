00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,360
Yeah, one of my big advice big pieces of advice that I'd give for someone

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:06,654
learning how to program is, it's okay to look stupid like, it's okay not to

3
00:00:06,654 --> 00:00:12,256
know what you're doing. Like it's, it's funny one of my big things going into

4
00:00:12,256 --> 00:00:15,784
like, learning how to program was I had pride issues, where I was like I don't

5
00:00:15,784 --> 00:00:21,327
want to look dumb, I don't want to ask for help. And asking for help like,

6
00:00:21,327 --> 00:00:24,241
whether it's, you know, Googling it like Googling is my best friend when it

7
00:00:24,241 --> 00:00:27,249
comes to things that I don't know or you know, even just asking someone next to

8
00:00:27,249 --> 00:00:32,052
me. Like hey can you look over this code or forums like, there's so many

9
00:00:32,052 --> 00:00:36,579
things, so many resources out there that are available. And you know, everyone

10
00:00:36,579 --> 00:00:40,895
in constantly learning, that's the thing, is that like. For me like, looking

11
00:00:40,895 --> 00:00:44,360
back the people that I was asking now that I know like what year they were when

12
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:49,193
I was asking its like, wow they are where I am now. And they were still

13
00:00:49,193 --> 00:00:53,630
learning cause I'm still learning and so just knowing that its like its okay.

14
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:57,392
People you're always going to have someone that's like oh you're new but that's

15
00:00:57,392 --> 00:01:00,057
OK you have to start somewhere.
