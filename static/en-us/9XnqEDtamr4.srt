1
00:00:00,352 --> 00:00:01,661
So to understand this project,

2
00:00:01,661 --> 00:00:04,915
this perpendicular relationship, let's look at the projective space.

3
00:00:04,915 --> 00:00:10,858
So what does a line in the image correspond to in projective space?

4
00:00:10,858 --> 00:00:17,064
Well, a line really is defined by this plane of rays that's intersecting

5
00:00:17,064 --> 00:00:23,489
the image plane and that plane's defined, like all planes are by a normal.

6
00:00:23,489 --> 00:00:26,996
And this is that same normal, a, b, c.

7
00:00:26,996 --> 00:00:32,810
So all the rays that are perpendicular to that normal form the line,

8
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:36,278
because the line is really just a plane in

9
00:00:36,278 --> 00:00:41,276
this projected space intersecting the image plane.

10
00:00:41,276 --> 00:00:42,239
Cool, right?

11
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:43,354
It gets better.

12
00:00:43,354 --> 00:00:46,862
Oh, and we can write this very simply in the same vector notation I

13
00:00:46,862 --> 00:00:48,114
was showing you before.

14
00:00:48,114 --> 00:00:51,762
So essentially, in fact, you know, what, let's, let's say,

15
00:00:51,762 --> 00:00:54,196
l transpose p if I wanted to write it that way.

16
00:00:54,196 --> 00:00:55,753
Right? So that's in vector notation.

17
00:00:55,753 --> 00:01:00,398
And the thing to think about is that in projective geometry and

18
00:01:00,398 --> 00:01:06,491
in this homogenous coordinate system, a line is also a homogenous 3-vector.

19
00:01:06,491 --> 00:01:12,435
So a point is a homogenous 3-vector, but a line is also a homogenous 3-vector.

20
00:01:12,435 --> 00:01:16,368
In fact, this relationship that a point is a 3-vector and a line is

21
00:01:16,368 --> 00:01:20,794
a 3-vector is what's going to get to this duality between points and lines.

22
00:01:20,794 --> 00:01:24,413
And as we've said, a line is a homogeneous 3-vector,

23
00:01:24,413 --> 00:01:27,128
which is defined by that normal to the plane and

24
00:01:27,128 --> 00:01:30,627
it is perpendicular to every point p that's on that plane.

25
00:01:30,627 --> 00:01:32,427
And what does it mean to be perpendicular to a point?

26
00:01:32,427 --> 00:01:36,369
Well, in projective geometry, being perpendicular to a point means that

27
00:01:36,369 --> 00:01:40,007
you're actually perpendicular to the ray that defines that point.

28
00:01:40,007 --> 00:01:42,527
And that's what gives us some of that duality.

29
00:01:42,527 --> 00:01:46,010
Given these points and lines are both three vectors and we have this duality.

30
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:49,493
Suppose I have two points, p1 and p2.

31
00:01:49,493 --> 00:01:53,185
Now remember, points are actually these rays, p1 and p2.

32
00:01:53,185 --> 00:01:57,154
How would you solve for the line that goes between them?

33
00:01:57,154 --> 00:01:59,233
Okay. So you know in algebra, if I gave you two points,

34
00:01:59,233 --> 00:02:00,765
you would figure out your formula for line.

35
00:02:00,765 --> 00:02:03,631
Well, in projective geometry, it's actually pretty easy.

36
00:02:03,631 --> 00:02:11,026
Since l here is just perpendicular to both p1 and p2.

37
00:02:11,026 --> 00:02:14,349
Well, you remember how to get a perpendicular vector given two other vectors?

38
00:02:14,349 --> 00:02:16,948
You just take their cross product, okay?

39
00:02:16,948 --> 00:02:21,883
So l is equal to p1 cross p2, that's it.

40
00:02:21,883 --> 00:02:23,008
No problem, okay?

41
00:02:23,008 --> 00:02:25,992
And l is the normal to the plane.

42
00:02:25,992 --> 00:02:27,721
So that plane is the line, so

43
00:02:27,721 --> 00:02:30,904
the way I get that line is I just cross the two points.

44
00:02:30,904 --> 00:02:31,889
Very easy.

45
00:02:31,889 --> 00:02:33,423
Let's just keep going.

46
00:02:33,423 --> 00:02:38,067
What is the inner section of two lines?

47
00:02:38,067 --> 00:02:38,751
Okay.

48
00:02:38,751 --> 00:02:42,976
So remember now, I've got a line l1 and l2 and remember that

49
00:02:42,976 --> 00:02:48,015
they're actually planes and what I'm showing you here are the lines that

50
00:02:48,015 --> 00:02:53,147
are made up of the planes where the planes intersect the image planes.

51
00:02:53,147 --> 00:02:56,212
So the l1 plane gives you this.

52
00:02:56,212 --> 00:02:59,729
The L2 plane gives you that, okay?

53
00:02:59,729 --> 00:03:04,987
Well, just a little bit of thinking here and you realize if the point p

54
00:03:04,987 --> 00:03:10,167
is perpendicular to l1 and point p is perpendicular to l2, okay?

55
00:03:10,167 --> 00:03:14,590
Then what I need is a line that is perpendicular or, or, and

56
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:18,665
need a point whose ray is perpendicular to l1 and l2.

57
00:03:18,665 --> 00:03:19,768
All right?

58
00:03:19,768 --> 00:03:21,102
Well, that's easy.

59
00:03:21,102 --> 00:03:24,322
So just as we had before in order to find the intersection,

60
00:03:24,322 --> 00:03:27,163
in order to find the line that spans the two points.

61
00:03:27,163 --> 00:03:29,449
We took that cross product to find the line.

62
00:03:29,449 --> 00:03:33,121
In order to find the point that's the intersection of two lines,

63
00:03:33,121 --> 00:03:35,208
I just take the cross product again.

64
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:39,553
So the points and lines as I said, they form a dual in projective space and

65
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:43,472
that means really given any formula, I can sort of switch back and

66
00:03:43,472 --> 00:03:46,910
forth between what are the points and what are the lines.

67
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:51,380
So when I showed you that l transpose p equal 0.

68
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:53,621
And I said, l was the line and p was the point.

69
00:03:53,621 --> 00:03:56,500
Well, that's just because l is for line and p is point.

70
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:59,449
If this was some other language where l stood for point and p stood for

71
00:03:59,449 --> 00:04:01,179
line, you'd all be really confused.

72
00:04:01,179 --> 00:04:04,877
But basically, what it would mean is that I was thinking of 1 as the line and

73
00:04:04,877 --> 00:04:06,066
the other as the point.

74
00:04:06,066 --> 00:04:09,309
We're going to make use of this not in the next lesson, but

75
00:04:09,309 --> 00:04:13,008
in the one later when we talk about fundame, fundamental matrices.

76
00:04:13,008 --> 00:04:16,584
Where just to, to give you forward looking a little.

77
00:04:16,584 --> 00:04:19,639
Remember that if I have a point in a stereo image,

78
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:21,959
it has to appear somewhere on a line.

79
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:24,827
In the other, that's the epipolar line and vice versa.

80
00:04:24,827 --> 00:04:26,220
These pair of epipolar lines.

81
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:30,500
So projective geometry will make it real easy to go between points in lines.
