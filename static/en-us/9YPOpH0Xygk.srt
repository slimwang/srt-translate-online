00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,808
Like I said in the question video, there
are many, many different values for a and

2
00:00:04,808 --> 00:00:12,078
b that you could enter here. But perhaps,
the simplest way is to let a= -17, and to

3
00:00:12,093 --> 00:00:16,702
let b=1.
This is an easy way to express any

4
00:00:16,718 --> 00:00:29,146
integer. We can write 3 as 3/1 and 29 as
29/1 and -300 as -300/1. But we could also

5
00:00:29,146 --> 00:00:33,774
come up with many other fractions that
reduce to these integers if we multiply

6
00:00:33,774 --> 00:00:40,020
the numerator and the denominator, or a
and b, each by the same number. In the

7
00:00:40,032 --> 00:00:46,677
case of -17, for example, if we multiply
the top and bottom by 2, then we get

8
00:00:46,677 --> 00:00:56,174
-34/2, which is another acceptable answer
to this quiz. Or you could have put 51/-3

9
00:00:56,174 --> 00:01:03,615
or 17/-1. If you're feeling at all shaky
on fractions right now, please take some

10
00:01:03,627 --> 00:01:08,158
time to do some of the practice problems
we've provided on fractions or watch some

11
00:01:08,158 --> 00:01:11,055
of the supplemental material we've linked
to.
