00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:04,780
So before proceeding with the candy bowl data, I wanted to take a moment and

2
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:08,710
describe the data that we collected in order to perform this analysis.

3
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:14,040
So if you recall, the goal is to understand what influences consumer choice.

4
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:17,330
In this case, the influencer's a candy selection, and so

5
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:20,310
we elected to record any attributes which we

6
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:23,600
thought might possibly have an impact on selection preference.

7
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,470
So, each record corresponded to someone selecting a candy.

8
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:32,140
For each record, the attributes that we thought to collect, which might have

9
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:39,310
an influence on candy preference were, name, gender, the type of candy.

10
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:42,550
We lumped color and flavor into one giant category.

11
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:46,720
Age of the person who's selecting, and ethnicity of the selector.

12
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:51,400
Now in addition to that attribute, in order to establish a baseline,

13
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:54,430
we also want to include a spurious attribute.

14
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:58,350
That way, any attribute that was ranked as having a weaker relationship than

15
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:01,010
that one, we know that we can safely ignore it.

16
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:05,590
So as our selection of a spurious attribute, we chose shirt color.

17
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:08,570
I think we can all agree that shirt color shouldn't have

18
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:11,620
an impact on what candy someone selects.

19
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:15,970
So, when we're evaluating the strength of relationships of any one of

20
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:20,420
these other attributes to candy choice, we know that if it

21
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:25,450
has a weaker relationship than that of shirt color, we can safely ignore it.

22
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:28,320
Now in addition, the records are chronological,

23
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,590
meaning that the records appear in the order in which selections were made.

24
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:37,080
Now that you know what all of the attributes mean, go grab ahold of

25
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:40,530
the data yourself so that you can follow along while we do the analysis.
