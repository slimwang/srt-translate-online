1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:03,220
Rob just showed us how we can
make things accessible to

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:05,970
anyone who can't use a mouse or
pointing device.

3
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:09,130
Whether that's because it's any
type of physical impairment or

4
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:11,510
a technology issue or
simply personal preference.

5
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:13,320
You would have seen that,

6
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,260
while it definitely requires
some care and thought.

7
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,920
It's not a huge amount more work
if you plan it from the beginning.

8
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,100
And once that work is done,

9
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:23,960
you're already a long way down
the path to a fully accessible site.

10
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:27,800
Already, you've made your
site usable by more people

11
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,290
than if you hadn't addressed
keyboard usability.

12
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:33,290
And giving your site a more
polished completed feel.

13
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:35,340
In this lesson,
we're going to build on that work and

14
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:38,390
get you thinking about other
accessibility factors.

15
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:41,020
Like how do we build our websites
to support users like Victor

16
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:42,160
who can't see the screen at all?

17
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:46,240
We'll start with some background
on assistive technology.

18
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:49,050
The general term for
things like screen readers.

19
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:51,890
These are tools that are designed
to help users whose impairments can

20
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:55,050
prevent them from accessing
information technology at all.

21
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:59,450
Next up, we'll take a look at
the general user experience concepts.

22
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:03,081
We'll build on this to take a deeper
dive into the experience of users of

23
00:01:03,081 --> 00:01:04,361
assistive technology.

24
00:01:04,361 --> 00:01:08,586
Then finally we'll move in to how we can
use HTML effectively to create a good

25
00:01:08,586 --> 00:01:10,172
experience for these uses.

26
00:01:10,172 --> 00:01:12,827
And we'll see that actually
does overlap quite a lot with

27
00:01:12,827 --> 00:01:14,050
the way we address focus.

28
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:17,400
First, let's talk a bit
about assistive technology.
