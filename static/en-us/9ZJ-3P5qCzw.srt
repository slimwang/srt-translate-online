Sometimes basic arithmetic isn't enough to solve a problem and you need to use

2
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:08,850
one of the many math functions that Java has to offer. In fact, there's so many

3
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:12,230
that you couldn't possibly remember them all, and we prepared a fact sheet for

4
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:17,208
you. Let me just go over the most important one. Let's say you need to compute

5
00:00:17,208 --> 00:00:23,130
a power such as 2 to the 10th. You can't write that exponent neatly in Java,

6
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:28,932
instead you use a function and the syntax looks like this. The function name is

7
00:00:28,932 --> 00:00:35,090
pow, it's in a class called Math. You have to reference it as Math.pow. Then,

8
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:40,508
you give it to the two operands, the 2 goes here, and the 10 becomes the second

9
00:00:40,508 --> 00:00:46,030
one. If you need to compute the square root, you use the square root function.

10
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:50,190
Again, it's in the Math class, Math.sqrt, and whatever it goes inside the root

11
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:56,098
symbol in Math notation goes inside the parentheses here. For absolute values,

12
00:00:56,098 --> 00:01:00,560
there is another function. It's called abs and whatever you put between the

13
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:04,967
vertical bars in Math notation goes on inside here. Now, these kinds of

14
00:01:04,967 --> 00:01:09,810
functions come up often enough that I want you to practice this a little bit.

15
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:12,870
Here, I have a bunch of function calls, and I'd just like you to tell me for

16
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:16,845
each of them, what is the result? If you like, you can compute it in BlueJ, or

17
00:01:16,845 --> 00:01:18,509
you can just do it in your head.
