1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,640
>> Okay, so I'm going to make a double

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:04,200
2048. There's going to be one grid up here

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,360
and one grid down here and there's going to

4
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:07,000
be, it's just going to be a disaster of tiles.

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:07,920
>> All right, let's see what happens.

6
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:12,610
>> So, I'm going to copy everything from game container which is two levels in.

7
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:12,640
>> Mm-hm.

8
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:15,320
>> So, I'm going to highlight down, and

9
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:20,935
then this is the closing div.

10
00:00:20,935 --> 00:00:21,310
>> Mm-hm.

11
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:25,330
>> And it's two levels in, so I'm going to copy and

12
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:30,050
paste. Save it.

13
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:31,310
>> All right, let's see what happened.

14
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:35,030
>> Okay, so, here we are. Let's reload the page.

15
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:36,120
>> All right.

16
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,825
>> And, okay, whoa, [LAUGH] that is not what I wanted.

17
00:00:39,825 --> 00:00:40,370
>> [LAUGH]

18
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:42,900
>> I was hoping that there would be way more tile

19
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:45,970
movement. But it looks like just the top tiles are going.

20
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:46,900
>> Yep.

21
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:49,340
>> That's unfortunate, but I guess I shouldn't

22
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:51,610
have expected too much. Any idea what happened here?

23
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,720
>> Not without looking at the code a little bit more.

24
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,650
>> All right, well, maybe we'll do that in lesson two.

25
00:00:56,650 --> 00:00:56,930
>> All right.
