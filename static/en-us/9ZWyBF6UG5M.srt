People sometimes talk about the head and heart, that is, cognition and emotion,

2
00:00:04,057 --> 00:00:07,881
as being two different things. Some people are rational and some people are

3
00:00:07,881 --> 00:00:12,255
emotional. Now, although there might be some value in separating thought and

4
00:00:12,255 --> 00:00:17,144
emotion, we find that emotions can be very helpful for us, and adaptive. They

5
00:00:17,144 --> 00:00:20,042
can be helpful when we need to solve problems, and they can help us adapt to an

6
00:00:20,042 --> 00:00:21,440
environment.
