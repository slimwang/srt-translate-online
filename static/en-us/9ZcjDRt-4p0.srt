00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,210
Okay, so here is the Python documentation, and if I scroll

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:06,980
down, I can find the os module. Let me click on it.

3
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:14,030
And in here, we can find all o the OS related functions that we used. So here

4
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:19,090
is os.change directory, and here is os.getcwd, or

5
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:22,190
get current working directory. Let me scroll down some

6
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:27,810
more. And if I do that I find os.listdir, which lists all of the files within a

7
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:30,920
given directory and on scrolling down even further, I

8
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:34,290
find os.rename. By the way, I want to make a

9
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:37,190
quick note here that even though we don't know how

10
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:41,350
functions like rename really work behind the scenes. We can

11
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:45,740
read their documentation and use them just fine. This hiding

12
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:50,340
of detail behind documentation, in computer science, is called abstraction.
