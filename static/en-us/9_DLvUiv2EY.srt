00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Okay, so we're going to have a last quiz for this section,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
and it's going to be a fairly challenging one.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
So we'll give it a gold star.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Your goal here is to define a procedure, "biggest",

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
that takes 3 inputs that are all numbers

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
and it outputs the greatest of the 3 numbers.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
So here's a few examples:

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
So if the 3 inputs are "6", "2", and "3" the output of "biggest" should be "6".

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
If the 3 inputs are "6", "2", and "7", then the output of "biggest" should be "7".

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
And if the 3 inputs are "6", "9", and "3", the output should be "9".

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
So whichever of the 3 inputs is the greatest number,

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
is the output that your procedure should produce, and it should return that.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
So I've shown the outputs.

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
We wouldn't actually see them, unless we printed them out.
