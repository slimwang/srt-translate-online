1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So you've got a pretty
sweet looking control,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,540
but what about users who
can't see the shiny hotness?

3
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:07,820
Accessibility is a key 
consideration when building apps

4
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:10,050
and particularly when 
you're creating new views.

5
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:12,600
You can start by adding
a content description,

6
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,560
as you would for every
other view in your layout,

7
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:16,870
to ensure that they are all accessible.

8
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:18,596
But what about views
like our wind speed

9
00:00:18,596 --> 00:00:21,707
and direction gauge
where the content isn't static?

10
00:00:21,718 --> 00:00:23,250
Knowing you're looking 
at a wind gauge

11
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:24,816
isn't very useful
if you don't know

12
00:00:24,816 --> 00:00:27,432
what the speed and direction
it's displaying are.

13
00:00:27,432 --> 00:00:29,710
Well, there are couple of options here.

14
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:33,220
For generic views which
don't control their own values,

15
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:36,270
this simplest alternative 
is to set the content description

16
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:38,205
within your app at runtime.

17
00:00:38,205 --> 00:00:41,240
An even more robust solution
is to send an accessibility event

18
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:42,910
from within your view.

19
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:45,370
Whenever the visual content 
has been modified.

20
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:48,440
Then override the dispatch
populate accessibility event,

21
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:52,716
and then the current control's 
visual value, the accessibility event.

22
00:00:52,716 --> 00:00:55,592
Go ahead and add 
accessibility handlers to your view,

23
00:00:55,592 --> 00:00:57,170
and then <i>click</i> here when you're done.
