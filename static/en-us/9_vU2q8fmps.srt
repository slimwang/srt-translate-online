Now, that we have equations for the total number of gallons that Grant will buy,

2
00:00:04,442 --> 00:00:08,785
let's compare the old equation we would have used to calculate how many gallons

3
00:00:08,797 --> 00:00:13,240
of solution Grant would buy to the new equation that we're going to use. How are

4
00:00:13,252 --> 00:00:18,035
these two lines related? Are they parallel? Are they perpendicular? Do they have

5
00:00:18,047 --> 00:00:21,865
different slopes? Do they have the same slope? Do they have different

6
00:00:21,877 --> 00:00:25,815
g-intercepts, or do they have the same g-intercept? Notice that we have

7
00:00:25,827 --> 00:00:30,125
g-intercept here instead of a y-intercept, because our variable over here is a g

8
00:00:30,137 --> 00:00:34,340
instead of a y. This is just different notation. Graphically, it really means

9
00:00:34,352 --> 00:00:39,980
the same thing as a y-intercept since we would create axes to graph these

10
00:00:39,992 --> 00:00:45,955
equations, with n as the horizontal axis, and g as the vertical axis.
