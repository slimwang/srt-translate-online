00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,471
Now that the friends are in an array list. To remove a friend, I just needs to

2
00:00:04,471 --> 00:00:07,953
know its index, and then I can call friends.remove, and that one will be

3
00:00:07,953 --> 00:00:15,823
erased, and the indexes will be fixed. In BlueJ, that would look like this. I

4
00:00:15,823 --> 00:00:19,215
would find the index of the nonFriend, using the find method, and then remove

5
00:00:19,215 --> 00:00:23,930
the friend, at nonFriendIndex. But I need to be a little bit careful,

6
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:27,664
nonFriendIndex could be minus one. I can't remove the person if they're not

7
00:00:27,664 --> 00:00:32,054
there to begin with. So if the nonFriendIndex is not minus one, then I remove

8
00:00:32,054 --> 00:00:35,100
the friend. Otherwise, I don't do anything.
