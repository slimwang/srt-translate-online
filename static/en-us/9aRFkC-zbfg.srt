Hey, Dan. want to see our weather app, so far, that we've been building?

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:09,400
>> Pretty cool. But I want something more.

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,250
>> Well, we're not done yet. We just started

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:14,090
two lessons ago. Give us a break. But fair

5
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:16,750
enough, there's still a bunch more work left to

6
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:18,780
do. What do you think we should do next?

7
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:21,130
>> Well for starters, let's make the list

8
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:22,300
item do something when you click on it.

9
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,952
>> Well, since you seem to be the expert on clicking on

10
00:00:25,952 --> 00:00:30,130
list items, why don't you do it? I'm going to go eat some jellybeans.

11
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:32,659
>> I think Catherine was mocking me there.

12
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:34,910
Speaking of mocks, let's go do some UI.
