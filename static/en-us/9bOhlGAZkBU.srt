1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:02,360
So my entrepreneurial experience.

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:05,550
I found it's abundantly obvious
when you need to hire somebody.

3
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:08,430
So you kind of go on, you have this
idea, you're working on it really hard.

4
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:11,540
You get some users,
you get some traction and

5
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:16,535
the thing that gives you the most pain
is the thing that you need to hire for

6
00:00:16,535 --> 00:00:19,285
and for me it was always operations.

7
00:00:19,285 --> 00:00:23,425
And just like doing deals,
advertising, getting any,

8
00:00:23,425 --> 00:00:26,005
I mentioned earlier that
were in Apple retail.

9
00:00:26,005 --> 00:00:29,964
That was just this woman that I hired
that just miraculously made it happen.

10
00:00:29,964 --> 00:00:33,863
It was huge lots of phone calls and
meetings and so the thing about it is

11
00:00:33,863 --> 00:00:37,427
you need to find the people that
are going to fill in your gaps and

12
00:00:37,427 --> 00:00:40,140
they become,
I like to go until it's painful.

13
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:44,300
I've done their job for a little bit so
I know what to look for but

14
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:47,860
I hate it enough that I know I need
to get somebody else to do it.

15
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:49,470
But I really recommend,

16
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:52,740
I've seen entrepreneurs do this
where they will actually just go,

17
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:56,450
well I need to be the person before
they've actually felt that pain.

18
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:58,802
Like they think this is the playbook,
they read a book somewhere or

19
00:00:58,802 --> 00:01:01,070
they heard from video or
they read the story of another company.

20
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:04,404
Every company is unique and
especially in the early days and so

21
00:01:04,404 --> 00:01:08,505
your strengths are unique, so what you
need to hire first off is probably not

22
00:01:08,505 --> 00:01:11,540
what any other company needed
to hire right off the bat.
