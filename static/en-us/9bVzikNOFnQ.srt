00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:03,160
There's a few things that I'd like you
to clean up now that we actually have

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:05,500
user data to use and users logging in.

3
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:08,880
First, I'd like you to remove
all mention of Anonymous Owner.

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,490
We know who the logged in users are now,
so

5
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:12,530
we shouldn't need to fall back on this.

6
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:15,540
Instead, you should store the email
address of the current user.

7
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:18,610
I'd also like you to finish the goal we
had in all of this, which was to change

8
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:23,300
the main activity screen to show the
user's name and then lists, like this.

9
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:25,820
We're also using the encoded
version of their email

10
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:27,780
as the key to their user data entry.

11
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:31,300
Because of this, if we simply have
the encoded email everywhere in the app,

12
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:34,270
we can easily load up any
associated data with the user.

13
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:36,730
When the user logs in
in the login activity,

14
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:39,490
we have access to their email
through the off data object.

15
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:42,030
And at that point we can encode it,
which I'd like you to do in step three.

16
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:43,950
And the fourth thing
that I'd like you to do,

17
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:48,590
is to store the encoded email as
the current user in shared preferences.

18
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:51,390
You should also store the provider
that's being used there as well.

19
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:54,350
This will be helpful because it
will allow you to easily grab this

20
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:56,400
information anywhere from the app.

21
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,300
It also makes this information
available to us on load,

22
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:01,030
if the user happens to close the app.

23
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:03,040
Okay, the full spec is on its way,
let me transfer it.
