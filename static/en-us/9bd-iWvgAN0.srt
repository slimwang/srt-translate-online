1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,788
So we found 3 critical numbers and we know that we're going to have to test each

2
00:00:03,788 --> 00:00:07,446
of these in an equality to see whether or not it's included in this solution

3
00:00:07,446 --> 00:00:11,174
set. But in addition to these 3 critical numbers, how many intervals are we

4
00:00:11,174 --> 00:00:14,981
going to need to test? How does this critical number makes up the number line?
