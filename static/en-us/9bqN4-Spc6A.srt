Here's our last absolute value equation. This one looks crazy. We have the

2
00:00:04,355 --> 00:00:08,633
absolute value of 2x plus 1 is equal to the absolute value of 3x minus 5. We

3
00:00:08,645 --> 00:00:13,154
have the symbol on both sides of the equation. Alright, let's take a step back

4
00:00:13,166 --> 00:00:17,597
and think about what this really means. We know x is some number, so if I plug

5
00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:21,739
in a number here, I'll get another number. The same is true on this side. So

6
00:00:21,751 --> 00:00:25,762
these numbers could be positive or they could be negative. So if the number's

7
00:00:25,774 --> 00:00:29,810
positive and this number's positive, is this statement true? Or if there is a

8
00:00:29,822 --> 00:00:33,662
negative sign in front of the number, is this statement true? Check all the

9
00:00:33,674 --> 00:00:37,710
statements that you believe are correct. That is the left side is equal to the

10
00:00:37,722 --> 00:00:38,273
right side.
