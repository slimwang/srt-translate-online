1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,340
All right. There's one more class of randomized optimization

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:06,970
algorithms that is really attractive. It's, it's, the, it's very

3
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:10,120
interesting to people. It has proven itself time and time

4
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:13,550
and again. And it's this notion of genetic algorithms. So

5
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:17,250
the main insight that's exploited in the genetic algorithm setting

6
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,360
is this. So let's imagine we've got a two dimensional

7
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:22,100
space. And, it's you know, hard for me to actually

8
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:25,400
draw a, a fitness surface over a two dimensional space.

9
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,100
So just kind of think of this as being one of

10
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:30,290
those maps. Those contour maps. And so imagine that we've

11
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:33,080
got, one dimension that X now comes in, in these

12
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:37,440
two different dimensions. And What we're trying to do is find

13
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,470
the peak, which happens to be there. So what if,

14
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:43,818
we actually evaluate 3 different points, so these green points

15
00:00:43,818 --> 00:00:46,620
here, we actually check what the values are at these

16
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:50,350
points. So what we find is that, from this initial point,

17
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:53,700
this green point here. If we increase our dimension 2, we

18
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:57,260
get a better value. But, it's also the case. It's starting from

19
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:59,367
that point. If we increase on dimension 1, we get a

20
00:00:59,367 --> 00:01:02,630
better value. So, maybe, what we, we ought to do, is take

21
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:07,350
kind of elements of these 2 solutions, these 2 inputs and combine

22
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:10,898
them together, and move out on dimension 1 and dimension 2, and

23
00:01:10,898 --> 00:01:13,190
maybe that will actually give us a good score as well.

24
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:16,020
And in this particular case, it puts us in the base interaction

25
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:18,920
of the local maxima. So, this turned out to

26
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:23,160
be useful in many spaces, especially spaces that can be

27
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:26,670
specified combinatorially like this. Where there is this separate dimensions

28
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:29,300
that contribute in various ways to the overall fitness value.

29
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:32,620
>> Ok Michael, that sort of makes sense. But, what does

30
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:35,630
this have to do with genetics or algorithms for that matter?

31
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:37,880
>> Well, it's an algorithm in that we're doing, it's an

32
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:41,130
optimization algorithm, and the genetic part, is because what we're going to

33
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:44,890
do, is were going to build an analogy with Biological evolution.

34
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:46,880
>> Mm, analogies.

35
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,480
>> In particular, instead of thinking about these input

36
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,770
points, these little green dots, we're going to think of them

37
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:55,240
as each input point is like an individual, and

38
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,430
a group of them taken together is like a population.

39
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:00,950
>> Mm-hm. It's really the same idea, but

40
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:02,920
we're just giving it a different name. Okay.

41
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:06,300
>> The the idea of local search where you make little changes

42
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:10,130
to a, to an input, we're going to now call that mutation. All right?

43
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,930
Where you take an individual and kind of tweak it a little bit

44
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:16,360
>> Oh, like we did in the the, the example we

45
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:19,500
did before where we define the neighborhood as every one, difference

46
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,710
in every single bit. That's right. So, so the mutations can

47
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:25,410
happen along neighborhoods. It's the same kind of concept as that.

48
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:25,890
>> Okay.

49
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:27,620
>> And then, you know? And, and, you can

50
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:31,260
see that there's, the mutations happening over X. So,

51
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:34,560
I assume that you get X [UNKNOWN].

52
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,240
>> [LAUGH] I think that's a fair point. I like your science.

53
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,920
>> Yeah. [LAUGH] Yeah, that's right. It

54
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,850
is science. The, those are all concepts

55
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:45,260
that we were already using when we

56
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:48,740
were doing these other randomized optimization algorithms.

57
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:50,050
One thing that's different though, is the

58
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:53,070
notion of crossover. So, what crossover does,

59
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:56,630
is it takes different points, like this green point and this green point and

60
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:59,060
instead of moving them just to their own neighborhood, it

61
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:01,840
gives you a way of combining their attributes together with

62
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,730
the hope of creating something even better. So, that is

63
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:08,510
where it starts to actually kind of deviate from the

64
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:12,630
standard notion of local search or randomized optimization. And gets

65
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:14,920
us into something that, that feels a little more like

66
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:17,750
evolution. So, this is kind of like. Dare I say

67
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:21,810
sexual reproduction. Right, where the two parents can actually form a

68
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:25,560
new kind of offspring that you know, if you're lucky is has

69
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:29,162
all the positive attributes of both of the parents. Like my children.

70
00:03:29,162 --> 00:03:31,630
>> Uh-huh, and if you're unlucky, it has the

71
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:33,970
worse attributes of the parents, like other peoples children.

72
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:36,050
>> [LAUGH]

73
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:38,630
Exactly. And so, and finally what we were calling

74
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:41,120
iteration before in the context of genetic algorithms, we

75
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,390
can call it generation. Because we're going to take, a

76
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:46,880
population of individuals and kind of you know, mate them together

77
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,220
to create a new population of individuals. And we're

78
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:52,360
going to, what we hope is improve iteration by iteration.

79
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,750
>> Okay, that makes sense. So, If I can just push

80
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:58,150
on this a minute, it seems like, if it weren't for crossover,

81
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:02,480
this is really like doing random restart, except instead of doing restarts

82
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,700
you just do 'em all at once cause we have parallel computers.

83
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:07,860
>> Yeah, I think that's I think that's fair. I think that's quite fair

84
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:13,270
actually. Okay. So then the thing that makes it more than that is, crossover.

85
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:17,550
That somehow these parallel, random searches are bleeding

86
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:20,300
information back and forth, help maybe bleeds the wrong.

87
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:23,720
>> [LAUGH] Yeah, you don't want to get too biological about this.

88
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,800
>> Yes, right. Well, so they're

89
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,010
sharing fluids, metaphorically, with one another

90
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:31,660
>> [LAUGH]. And conveying information that way, just the

91
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:34,230
way genes do. Right. And then, and so that's

92
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:35,980
the sort of interesting concept that now we have

93
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:38,290
information, not just in the individual, like we're moving

94
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:40,370
that one individual around and trying to find better and

95
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:43,170
better solutions. But the population as a whole, represents a

96
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:46,470
distribution over individuals. And that, that distribution might actually be

97
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:49,910
a useful thing to guide the search for higher scoring individuals.

98
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:52,260
>> Okay. That, that makes sense.
