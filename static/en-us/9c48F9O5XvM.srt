1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,270
A couple of more things about the model
that are similar to what we did

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:04,760
before for the Kalman, okay?

3
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:09,600
Since I know some of you have a machine
learning background a little bit

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,720
drawn here is a graphical model.

5
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:16,270
The idea is that x is only impacted by

6
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:20,220
what the x was before, and
what the new protobation is.

7
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:24,660
And the z's, the measurements, are only
a function of the current state,

8
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:25,700
all right.

9
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:28,780
And that's written in the following way,
right.

10
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:33,480
The first thing says the probability of
the measurement, given all the states,

11
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:37,990
given all my histories,
only a function of the current state and

12
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:40,660
that's sometimes called
sensor independence.

13
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:45,230
Okay, the sensing is only dependent
on the current state, all right.

14
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:50,720
The other element is this one that
says the probability of the next

15
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:56,100
state given all of these things that
came in and including the states before

16
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:01,070
is only a function of where we were
before plus the current input.

17
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:04,190
And by the way, here, this is
written as ut, not the ut minus 1,

18
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:06,410
that's what I was telling
you about before.

19
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:08,130
The shame on me,
because I did both of those and

20
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:09,280
I should have made them consistent.

21
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,860
But the idea,
this is the Markovian property, right?

22
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:13,910
We ha, we had the Markovian
property last time also.

23
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:19,590
And Markovian property says,
if I know the state at the last time,

24
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:24,310
none of the earlier state information,
none of the earlier measurements,

25
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:28,600
none of the earlier anything
matter except the state then.

26
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:31,740
And then the one thing we've
added new this time is action

27
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:33,300
at the current time, okay?

28
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:34,750
That's the Markovian property.
