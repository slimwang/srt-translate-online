1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:04,720
We've already done all the hard work of creating our animation with our

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:06,100
update function.

3
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:10,550
Including things like filtering our data, removing and

4
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:14,700
adding any new elements that need to be placed on the page.

5
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:19,480
As well as dealing with the data binding key function which determined which

6
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:26,550
elements to add or remove, d3 has great support for built in transitions.

7
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:30,600
And all you need to do to make the transition smooth is use

8
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,180
d3's special built in functions.

9
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:36,810
One of which is transition which kicks off a transition.

10
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:40,260
And the second most used is the duration.

11
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:45,160
In this case we make our selection, we append anything that needs to

12
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:50,660
be appended, and then kick off a transition that takes 500 milliseconds.

13
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:54,010
And what actually changes during the transition?

14
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:55,990
Well that's what comes after it.

15
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:58,990
All of these attributes which move the circles and

16
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:03,720
set the radius take 500 milliseconds to complete and

17
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:08,390
operate on the enter selection and the circles we are appending.

18
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:13,935
So now when we're adding circles they'll transition more smoothly, but

19
00:01:13,935 --> 00:01:19,320
also potentially more importantly we want the countries to transition smoothly.

20
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:22,170
So following the exact same syntax we

21
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:26,390
place transition with a duration of 500 milliseconds.

22
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:31,630
Right before we change the fill and the stroke of countries to update and

23
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:34,930
hide or show based on the year of the world cup.

24
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:38,100
I would say this is one reason to use D3's built in

25
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:43,420
style functions to add style to our elements rather than using CSS.

26
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:48,780
So we can have much more flexibility in how we animate and apply those styles.

27
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:52,220
As you can see here, the countries transition out and

28
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:56,390
in much smoother than they did before since we added the transition to

29
00:01:56,390 --> 00:02:00,550
the styles applied to the countries as well as the circles.

30
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:01,460
As they come in and

31
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:05,910
get placed at the respective home countries they belong on top of.

32
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:09,990
And now that we have finished our map, or at least the animation of it,

33
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:12,960
we can start to see a little story unfolding.

34
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,170
Can you find a narrative in the graphic we've created?
