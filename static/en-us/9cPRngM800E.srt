Thank you for sharing your responses. I

2
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:05,750
will be providing feedback on the forums periodically.

3
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:10,640
Now there are several ways in which to solve this problem. One way is for us

4
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:13,090
to write a program that somehow keeps track

5
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:16,270
of time, say two hours, and it essentially

6
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:21,010
does nothing during that time. So the first thing we want the program to do is

7
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:24,930
Wait for two hours.

8
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:29,930
And after we've waited for that amount of time, we

9
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:32,790
want the program to open up a web browser, which

10
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:35,330
plays let's say a YouTube video which is your friends

11
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:40,670
favorite song. So the second thing is to open a browser.

Now because we want these two steps to happen multiple times

14
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:50,850
during the day. Because we want to take multiple breaks during the

15
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:54,430
day. We want to put these two steps inside some sort of

16
00:00:54,430 --> 00:01:00,310
loop. So let's say we want to repeat these steps three times.

00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:05,300
Let's build this. I encourage you to follow along.
