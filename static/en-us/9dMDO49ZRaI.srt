Do you remember way back in Physics,
when we talked about reflections?

2
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:07,270
It was often coupled with
another topic called refraction,

3
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:09,723
which is the bending of light
through a material like water.

4
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:15,099
Take a prism, for example, when we shine
light through it, it breaks the light up

5
00:00:15,099 --> 00:00:18,391
into a variety of different
spectrums that create a rainbow.

6
00:00:18,391 --> 00:00:20,980
Refraction allows us to create
some pretty neat effects.

7
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:23,479
So now, let me ask you this.

8
00:00:23,479 --> 00:00:26,068
Do you think Unity has the ability
to simulate refractions?
