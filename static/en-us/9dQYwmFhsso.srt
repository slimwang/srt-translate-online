00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,104
If we're looking for the roots of this, then we need to set y equal to 0, since

2
00:00:04,104 --> 00:00:08,394
the roots are the x-values that will satisfy the quadratic equation that goes

3
00:00:08,394 --> 00:00:12,728
along with this. Now, I could factor this, that would be one way of solving, but

4
00:00:12,728 --> 00:00:16,834
I'm going to use the quadratic formula just to see what happens. So, I have

5
00:00:16,834 --> 00:00:21,422
negative 4 plus or minus the square root of 4 squared minus 4 times 4 times 1,

6
00:00:21,422 --> 00:00:26,011
all over 2 times 4. Let's simplify. Now, this is starting to look pretty

7
00:00:26,011 --> 00:00:31,184
interesting. We have 16 minus 16 under the radical sign. So, that means that

8
00:00:31,184 --> 00:00:36,657
we're adding 0 or subtracting 0 from negative 4. This is the only number that we

9
00:00:36,657 --> 00:00:41,390
can add and subtract negative 4 and get the same answer, just negative 4. This

10
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:45,942
is pretty strange, it's quite the conundrum. If x equals negative 4 over 8,

11
00:00:45,942 --> 00:00:50,421
that's a single answer. So, we get a final answer that the root is negative 1

12
00:00:50,421 --> 00:00:52,483
half, and there's only one of them.
