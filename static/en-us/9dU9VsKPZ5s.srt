00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:02,320
>> Okay Michael, so here's the quiz, because you made me

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:04,630
make it a quiz, I decided to make it even harder, so

3
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:07,180
I want you to tell me how many different strategies are

4
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:09,810
there for A and how many different strategies there are for B.

5
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:14,845
>> And you are talking about just deterministic mappings only, right?

6
00:00:14,845 --> 00:00:15,857
>> Well, we are in a two player

7
00:00:15,857 --> 00:00:18,980
zero sum, finite, deterministic game of perfect information.

8
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:20,350
>> So, [LAUGH].

9
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:21,710
>> So yes, I mean deterministic.

10
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:25,570
>> Okay, alright. because, you know, it could be that it might be helpful

11
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:26,360
to be stochastic.

12
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,680
>> Oh, that's true, that's true. So in fact, that's

13
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,140
a good point. I was going to mention that later, but

14
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:32,920
l'll mention it now. What I just wrote down here, is

15
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,989
actually not just a strategy, it's something called a pure strategy.

16
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:39,730
>> Hm, it's always about purity with you.

17
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:43,630
>> It is, purity of chocolate and bacon mainly. But, yes. So, these are

18
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:47,920
simple pure strategies. Okay, so how many pure strategies are there for A and B.

19
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,140
>> Okay.

20
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:50,690
>> Okay, then let's go.
