00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,040
>> When you fouind Q3 minus Q1 you were calculating what we call the

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:09,528
interquartile range abbreviated IQR. I defnitelly don'talways want to write that

3
00:00:09,528 --> 00:00:13,518
out. Iqr is a lot easier. So now you're going to take a quiz on the

4
00:00:13,518 --> 00:00:18,933
interquartile range. True of false? About 50% of the data falls within the IQR?

5
00:00:18,933 --> 00:00:23,884
The IQR is affected by every value in the data set. And finally, the IQR is not

6
00:00:23,884 --> 00:00:28,882
affected by outliers. So based on what you've learned about the inter quartile

7
00:00:28,882 --> 00:00:30,975
range, give this your best shot.
