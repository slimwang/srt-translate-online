00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:03,000
Hi, welcome to the program.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,029
We're thrilled to have you here, and I'm
looking forward to guiding your journey

3
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:08,800
to the cutting edge of
artificial intelligence.

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,890
You are now an essential member
of the Udacity community.

5
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:13,990
We're here to make sure you
fulfill your goals, but

6
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:15,210
we also want to learn from you.

7
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:17,929
Your experience will guide future
development, and we'd love to hear your

8
00:00:17,929 --> 00:00:22,429
thoughts on how we can improve and
make this program better for others.

9
00:00:22,429 --> 00:00:25,449
Now let's take a quick walk through
the Udacity office to get a flavor of

10
00:00:25,449 --> 00:00:27,089
how we do things here.

11
00:00:27,089 --> 00:00:29,129
So we believe in learning by doing.

12
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:31,219
So rather than simply watching videos,
or

13
00:00:31,219 --> 00:00:34,329
taking tests on AI, you'll build
real artificial intelligence.

14
00:00:34,329 --> 00:00:38,000
And watch those AIs solve complex
problems that humans like me and

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,350
you simply can't do with
the same speed or accuracy.

16
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:42,320
>> Hey, can I get some help?

17
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,960
>> Yeah, of course.

18
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:48,609
Looks like we can just sub
in 0.9 here from here.

19
00:00:48,609 --> 00:00:50,570
And looks like we can
likewise sub in 0.8 here.

20
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:53,539
You want to finish the rest?

21
00:00:53,539 --> 00:00:54,226
Looks like we got it.

22
00:00:54,226 --> 00:00:56,521
[MUSIC]

23
00:00:56,521 --> 00:01:00,250
In the first project, you build a simple
AI agent that solves any Sudoku problem

24
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:03,329
in the world, and
learn two foundational AI techniques.

25
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:05,469
Constraint propagation, and search.

26
00:01:05,469 --> 00:01:08,769
This project is just a little teaser
to get your feet wet, and show you how

27
00:01:08,769 --> 00:01:12,429
quickly you can start applying AI
concepts to problems around you.

28
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:13,370
Hey Christina.

29
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:14,320
>> Hey, Dhruv.

30
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:15,469
>> Nice work, solving Sudoku.

31
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:19,945
You'll also be given the chance to go
above and beyond by using advanced Sudoku

32
00:01:19,944 --> 00:01:21,913
strategies to improve
the speed of your agent.

33
00:01:21,914 --> 00:01:24,534
[MUSIC]

34
00:01:24,534 --> 00:01:25,506
In the next project,

35
00:01:25,507 --> 00:01:29,024
you'll build an AI agent that can
routinely defeat opponents in Isolation.

36
00:01:29,024 --> 00:01:32,064
Here you'll apply Minimax and
Alpha-beta pruning,

37
00:01:32,064 --> 00:01:35,724
two strategies used by Google's
world-beating Go agent AlphaGo.

38
00:01:35,724 --> 00:01:38,484
You go on to create an AI that
guides Pac-Man through his maze and

39
00:01:38,484 --> 00:01:41,674
allows him to eat all the food in
the most efficient way possible.

40
00:01:41,674 --> 00:01:44,105
Definitely more efficient
than Ryan over here.

41
00:01:44,105 --> 00:01:45,730
>> I'm still practicing.

42
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:48,082
>> Using simple techniques
such as breadth-first search,

43
00:01:48,081 --> 00:01:51,345
depth-first search and A-Star search
your AI agent will traverse Pac-Man's

44
00:01:51,346 --> 00:01:53,805
maze faster than any other human player.

45
00:01:53,805 --> 00:01:56,299
Next you will be tasked with
finding the optimal route for

46
00:01:56,299 --> 00:01:58,593
taking cargo from one place to another.

47
00:01:58,593 --> 00:02:02,478
Planning problems like this are the very
core of the logistics industry.

48
00:02:04,379 --> 00:02:08,340
And you'll see just how powerful AI is
in solving these kinds of problems.

49
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:11,939
And finally, you use hidden Markov
models to automatically read sign

50
00:02:11,939 --> 00:02:15,740
languages characters and convert them
into their English text counterparts.

51
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:18,920
This is just one of
the many examples of how AI

52
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:22,439
is making a meaningful
impact in society at large.

53
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:24,889
And all this is just in term one.

54
00:02:24,889 --> 00:02:27,559
We think you'll have a lot of fun, and
we can't wait to see you get started.
