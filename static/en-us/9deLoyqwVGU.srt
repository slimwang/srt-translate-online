00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,560
Remember that technical
factors use only price or

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:08,310
volume, whereas fundamental
factors use other components.

3
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:13,650
So moving average of price is only
using price, so that one's technical.

4
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:19,210
Percent change in volume is only
using volume and that's allowed for

5
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:21,590
technical factors, so
that one's technical.

6
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:26,450
This one is using price,
yes that's technical, but

7
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:29,170
it's also using earnings which
is a fundamental factor, so

8
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:32,110
that makes this whole thing
a fundamental factor.

9
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:38,010
So over here intrinsic value
is based on dividends,

10
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:40,960
which is a fundamental, so
this one is a fundamental indicator.
