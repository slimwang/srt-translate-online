Let's think a little bit more about one of our solutions, 3 plus 4i, the one we

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:08,301
were working with in the last problem. Now this is an interesting number,

3
00:00:08,301 --> 00:00:12,195
because it has one part of it that looks real and one part of it that looks

4
00:00:12,195 --> 00:00:16,415
imaginary. So my question for you is where on our world of numbers diagram it

5
00:00:16,415 --> 00:00:20,445
belongs. Please select the spot where you think it should be positioned.
