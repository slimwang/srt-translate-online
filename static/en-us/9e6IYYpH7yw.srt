00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,730
Now let's take a look
at Android security.

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:08,160
Here's an overview of the architecture
of Android which is based on Linux.

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,010
Android is implemented in the form
of a software stack architecture

4
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:17,440
consisting of a Linux kernel,
a runtime environment and

5
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:23,050
corresponding libraries, an application
framework and a set of applications.

6
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:26,320
At the lowest level is the Linux Kernel.

7
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,480
It provides a level of abstraction
within device hardware and

8
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,640
the upper layers of
the Android software stack.

9
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:38,400
Each application running on the Android
device runs its own instance

10
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,992
of the Dalvik virtual machine.

11
00:00:39,992 --> 00:00:44,840
After written in Java,
and compiled to bytecode

12
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:49,678
of the Java virtual machine, which is
then translated to Dalvik bytecode.

13
00:00:49,678 --> 00:00:55,030
The Dalvik excutable format is very
compact and it is designed for

14
00:00:55,030 --> 00:01:00,400
systems such as smart phones that
are constrained in terms of memory and

15
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,860
processor speed.

16
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:07,030
By using Dalvik, Android can
achieve performance and efficiency.

17
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:10,430
The Android core libraries
are Java based libraries for

18
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:12,390
application development.

19
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:15,710
For example, for
web browsing, data access and

20
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:18,940
database queries,
graphics rendering, and so on.

21
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,950
The Android call libraries
do not actually perform

22
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:25,020
much of the actual work.

23
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:30,282
And are in fact, essentially Java
wrappers around a set of C and

24
00:01:30,282 --> 00:01:32,377
C++ based libraries.

25
00:01:32,377 --> 00:01:39,046
These C and C++ libraries are included
to fulfill a wide range of functions,

26
00:01:39,046 --> 00:01:45,860
including 2D or 3D graphics rendering,
secure second layer, etc.

27
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:50,210
The application framework is a set
of services that collectively,

28
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:52,730
from the environment,
for Android apps to run.

29
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:59,210
The application framework allows
apps to be constructed using usable,

30
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:02,500
interchangeable, and
replaceable components.

31
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:06,860
Furthermore, an app can publish
its capabilities along with any

32
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:12,580
corresponding data, so that they can
be found and reused by other apps.

33
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:16,040
At the top of the Android
software stack are the apps.

34
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:20,560
These include apps that come
with the device such as home,

35
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,000
contacts, and phone and browser.

36
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,160
A lot of third party apps
that the user has downloaded

37
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,640
after he purchases the device.
