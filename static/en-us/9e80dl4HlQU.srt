00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,108
The way that we factor it tells us that our two critical values, the two points

2
00:00:04,108 --> 00:00:08,301
that are splitting our number line up are x equals negative 7 and x equals 5. So

3
00:00:08,301 --> 00:00:12,257
I start by writing those. Then we just need to fill in the intervals surronding

4
00:00:12,257 --> 00:00:16,305
those values. We have x is less than negative seven then we have the region

5
00:00:16,305 --> 00:00:20,233
between negative 7 and 5. So negative seven is less than x which is less than

6
00:00:20,233 --> 00:00:22,640
five. And then lastly, x is greater than five.
