00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,350
In the last exercise that you did with Sarah, something remarkable happened.

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:08,189
Here we have a string we call toUpperCase. And then, we look at what's in the

3
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:13,030
variable on which we just invoked the method. And we notice that it does not

4
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:19,500
contain the upper case version. So, calling this method did not modify or as we

5
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:26,650
say, mutate the object. We say that toUpperCase is an accessor method, it

6
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:32,520
leaves the object on which it is called unchanged. Instead, it returns a value

7
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,770
and that value is then stored in this variable. The uppercased string is here,

8
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:42,800
the original string is still here. Contrast that with that method call. Here we

9
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:47,090
have a picture and we call the translate method on it. When the method is

10
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:53,600
called, the picture changes. It is moved to a different location. We say the

11
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,660
object has been mutated. It is now different than what it was before. And we

12
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:04,680
call the translate method a mutator. So again, an accessor leaves the object on

13
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:11,476
which it operates unchanged, and mutator changes or mutates the object.
