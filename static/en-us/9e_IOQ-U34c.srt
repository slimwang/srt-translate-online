00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,861
When solving this problem, I'm going to start within the absolute value bars.

2
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:09,440
Remember, I have a negative 1 on the outside, and then, I need to do the

3
00:00:09,452 --> 00:00:14,310
exponent first. So, I have 8 minus 25. 8 minus 25 is negative 17. So, I have

4
00:00:14,322 --> 00:00:19,422
negative 1 times the absolute value of negative 17. The absolute value of

5
00:00:19,434 --> 00:00:24,433
negative 17 is positive 17, so I have negative 1 times 17. Remember, when I do

6
00:00:24,445 --> 00:00:29,610
the absolute value of a number, I want the positive result, or the distance from

7
00:00:29,622 --> 00:00:34,715
zero and I don't have to put the absolute value bars anymore. Negative 1 times

8
00:00:34,727 --> 00:00:38,064
17 is negative 17. If you got negative 17, nice work.
