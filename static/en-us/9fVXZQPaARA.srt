1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:04,370
Now, we want to revisit that
question of information flow.

2
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:07,220
And remember, recall that
information flow is a problem

3
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:10,490
that cannot be addressed by
discretionary access control, okay.

4
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:14,730
So we want to see how mandatory
access control, or MAC, or

5
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:20,010
multi level security, in particular
the BLP model that we are focusing on.

6
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:24,946
And so how does the BLP model help us
solve that information flow problem

7
00:00:24,946 --> 00:00:25,860
that we had?

8
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:31,285
So we say we have an object,
this is a top secret object.

9
00:00:31,285 --> 00:00:35,275
So we have a top secret object 2 is TS.

10
00:00:35,275 --> 00:00:37,585
This is more sensitive information.

11
00:00:37,585 --> 00:00:40,265
We never want this information to go and

12
00:00:40,265 --> 00:00:45,775
end up in an object that
has level is only secret.

13
00:00:45,775 --> 00:00:48,115
So this is more sensitive object.

14
00:00:48,115 --> 00:00:52,560
2 is more sensitive than object 1
because we said TS is greater than S.

15
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:55,120
So this is highly top
secret information.

16
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,960
We never want it to end up in
an object that is only classified

17
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,160
at the secret level.

18
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,750
Okay, so how can this information
flow from here to there?

19
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:06,060
There are two paths.

20
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:09,450
Path one is that a top
secret user reads it.

21
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:12,910
We know that the read
down rule means what?

22
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:16,030
For this to read, for
someone to be able to read this,

23
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:19,900
the user has to be TS,
otherwise they can't read it.

24
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:22,600
A secret user can only read secret or
below.

25
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:26,220
So, a top secret user
can read this object.

26
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:27,740
So, this read will be allowed.

27
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:30,330
And then they, can this
information that they have pulled,

28
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:35,090
remember the Alice, Bob, Charlie example
in discretionary access control we had?

29
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:38,950
Where Alice gave read access to Bob,
who copied the data

30
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:42,250
into a file that he created and
then passed it on to Charlie?

31
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:44,650
Well, can User 1 do something like that?

32
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:47,790
Can it create Object 2,
in which it may be able to

33
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:51,070
write this information that
it just read from Object 1.

34
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:55,180
For someone who is not top-secret to
be able to read this information,

35
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:58,480
the object we create has to be secret or
lower.

36
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,120
TS then is just like here.

37
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,975
They won't be able to read Object 2,
they won't be able to read Object 1.

38
00:02:02,975 --> 00:02:08,050
This object is at the lower level,
then the write rule says what?

39
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:09,220
You can only write up.

40
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:10,620
You can't write down.

41
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:14,740
So all the top secret user can
take this information, read it.

42
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:17,590
But they're not able to write
it in an object that can be read

43
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:20,010
by somebody who's not
cleared at top secret.

44
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:24,670
So this path doesn't allow informational
flow to get to a lower level.

45
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:26,140
What about a secret user?

46
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:31,280
We know the secret user can,
once it's here, can read that.

47
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,370
I guess we know that
a secret user can't read.

48
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:36,340
So, this path we said is not possible.

49
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:40,190
This path actually ends right here
because the secret user is not able to

50
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:42,460
read a top secret document.

51
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:46,050
This label would not dominate
the label of the object.

52
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:51,510
So this path is broken here,
this path is broken right here,

53
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:54,000
so this information actually
never flows in here.

54
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,175
And information from Object
1 flowing to Object 2.

55
00:02:57,175 --> 00:03:00,565
Secret can read this object and
can write up, yes.

56
00:03:00,565 --> 00:03:03,665
But that doesn't violate any
confidentiality requirements.

57
00:03:03,665 --> 00:03:07,235
So secret information can now
be read by a top secret person.

58
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:12,780
This information, made its way from
here, through user 2, into this object.

59
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:15,890
The top secret could already read this,
read down.

60
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:19,780
So, in this direction,
information of flow doesn't make

61
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:24,760
more sensitive information available to
a user, who is cleared at a lower level.

62
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:28,350
The system would not allow information
that is read from this object

63
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:30,760
to be written into an object
that is at the lower level.

64
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:33,480
That's a guarantee
that comes with BLP and

65
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,500
the MAC model that we didn't
have with DAC before.

66
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:40,800
So this is how we're able to control
information flow, and that's how we

67
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:45,071
fix one of the shortcomings that we
had with discretionary access control.
