1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Here's the idea: you collect the votes from the voters. Those are inputs to a random permutation.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Let's say this is controlled by the Apple Party,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and what the permutation does is randomly scramble the order of the votes.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Now the position of the votes that came in

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
doesn't match the position of the votes that came out.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
We'll also do some encryption, and we'll get to that in the next question part.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Those are passed along to the next party. Let's call that the Blue Party.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
The Blue Party also scrambles the votes in some random permutation,

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
and then those are passed along to the next one and we'll call this one the Crazy Party.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Our parties start with the letters A, B, and C, and the Crazy Party does the same thing.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
It selects some other random permutation where it randomly selects a permutation,

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
and it scrambles the positions of the votes.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
In order for this to work, we want at the end of this to know what the actual votes are.

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
The question is what value should we use for x to enable this chain.

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Our security assumption is that the Apple, the Blue, and the Crazy Party all hate each other.

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,000
They wouldn't possibly collude, so they can be trusted not to collude with the other parties.

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
But otherwise they can't be trusted, they'll want to try to change the election,

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
change the votes, and do everything they can.

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The question is which one of these would be the best choice for the xi values?

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Neither of these are the correct choice. Neither of these will work securely.

21
00:01:26,000 --> 99:59:59,999
We're going to have to do some other things, but which one of these is the best starting choice?
