1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,136
But still, we don't know how many values are less than any of the numbers in

2
00:00:05,136 --> 00:00:10,520
between the balance of each bin. For example, we wouldn't be able to tell their

3
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:15,981
proportion less than 175. Ideally, we would want a smaller bin size as possible.

4
00:00:15,981 --> 00:00:20,987
In fact, infinitely small. But look out what happens with this data when we

5
00:00:20,987 --> 00:00:26,407
decrease the bin size. In other words, we increase the number of bins. Here, we

6
00:00:26,407 --> 00:00:32,235
have 50 intervals. Here, a 100 intervals. And notice that the frequency on the

7
00:00:32,235 --> 00:00:38,564
y-axis is getting smaller. Here's 200 intervals. 500 intervals. 1,000 intervals.

8
00:00:38,564 --> 00:00:44,796
And now, you see that the frequency is 1 for a lot of bins. 5,000 intervals.

9
00:00:44,796 --> 00:00:51,264
30,000 intervals. And now at 150,000 intervals, the frequency for each bin is

10
00:00:51,264 --> 00:00:57,364
either 0 or 1. That's because the size of each bin is so small so there is only

11
00:00:57,364 --> 00:01:02,781
1 value in many of the bins or just 0 values. So eventually, if we keep

12
00:01:02,781 --> 00:01:08,972
decreasing the bin size we loose the shape of our distribution. Try it yourself.

13
00:01:08,972 --> 00:01:14,044
I shared a histogram link that illustrates this concept really well. Use the

14
00:01:14,044 --> 00:01:19,258
data set of physics test scores and change the bin size to the smallest possible

15
00:01:19,258 --> 00:01:22,126
bin and see what happens to the frequency.
