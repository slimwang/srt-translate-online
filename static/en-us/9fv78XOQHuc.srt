Well, I hope your keyboard didn't melt. When I ran it, got an error message.

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:08,070
Let me show you. The class compiled with no syntax erros. So I clearly don't

3
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:11,506
have a compile time error. But when I run the program, down here, I get an

4
00:00:11,506 --> 00:00:15,686
error message. And Bluej tells me that something very bad happened in the

5
00:00:15,686 --> 00:00:20,155
highlighted line. First off, it is a run time error. It's an error that

6
00:00:20,155 --> 00:00:24,184
happened at run time. And it is so bad that it terminated my program and

7
00:00:24,184 --> 00:00:29,243
displayed what's called an exception report. And the report is that a division

8
00:00:29,243 --> 00:00:34,284
by zero was attempted. And that's of course very, very bad. you've seen how to

9
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:37,880
deal with a number of different kinds of errors, and you'll get to practice

10
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:40,573
that with Sarah right now.
