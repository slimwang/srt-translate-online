I hope everyone enjoyed the visit to the Computer History Museum. Maybe one day,

2
00:00:03,628 --> 00:00:07,088
there'll be something in the museum built by a CS101 student. If you're ever in

3
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:10,322
the area, it's a really cool place to visit, and you can also drop by our

4
00:00:10,334 --> 00:00:13,818
offices in Palo Alto, only a short distance from there. What we're going to do

5
00:00:13,831 --> 00:00:17,289
next is learn about the present of computing. We're going to visit SLAC National

6
00:00:17,301 --> 00:00:20,853
Accelerator Laboratory, and see how they're using computing to advance science

7
00:00:20,504 --> 00:00:20,504
today.
