1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So, we actually just learned some interesting lessons.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,000
The probability of any random variable Y can be written as

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
probability of Y given that some other random variable X assumes value i

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
times probability of X equals i,

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
sums over all possible outcomes i for the (inaudible) variable X.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
This is called total probability.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
The second thing we learned has to do with negation of probabilities.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:37,000
We found that probability of not X given Y is 1 minus probability of X given Y.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Now, you might be tempted to say "What about the probability of X given not Y?"

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:51,000
"Is this the same as 1 minus probability of X given Y?"

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
And the answer is absolutely no.

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
That's not the case.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
If you condition on something that has a certain probability value,

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
you can take the event you're looking at and negate this,

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
but you can never negate your conditional variable

16
00:01:05,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and assume these values add up to 1.
