00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:04,666
When you turn off flat shading, smooth shading is used by default. The resulting

2
00:00:04,666 --> 00:00:08,320
object now uses a smooth shading normal stored at each vertex to compute the

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,310
effect of lighting and interpolate the result. This is the usual way to use this

4
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:16,494
lambursion diffuse material. However, now you know what's going on behind the

5
00:00:16,494 --> 00:00:20,979
scenes, with the application supplying tessellated geometry and smooth shading

6
00:00:20,979 --> 00:00:21,530
normals.
