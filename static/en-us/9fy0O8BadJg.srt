1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:05,180
Now, what we're going to do is
build a forest model in Ultrix,

2
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:07,420
interpret the results,
and validate the model.

3
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:10,730
Now we've already created
samples of 70% for

4
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:15,230
the estimation sample, and
30% for the validation sample.

5
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:17,700
So let's bring in a force model and
configure it.

6
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:21,010
So we can find this force model tool
within the predictive category.

7
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:24,190
The first thing we're going to do,

8
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:27,150
just like all the other models
is simply name the model.

9
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:32,390
So I'm going to call this FM, for Forest
Model, under score transportation,

10
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:33,630
since that's what we're
trying to predict.

11
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:37,620
The next thing we're going to do is
select what is my target variable,

12
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:38,480
which is going to be the mode,

13
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,470
and then lastly what are my different
possible predictor variables?

14
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:47,750
So gender, age, marital status and
drive distance in miles.

15
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:50,660
And so far this is exactly
the same thing that we've done in

16
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:53,040
all the previous models
up to this point.

17
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:55,630
Now what are some of
the different options?

18
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:57,780
The first option is
the option rate below,

19
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:00,580
which is the number of trees to use.

20
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:04,060
So remember that we have
a force model here,

21
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:07,370
which is an ensemble of decision trees.

22
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:10,590
And even with the logo, you can see
that it's many different trees,

23
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:14,480
as compared to a decision tree,
which is one single tree.

24
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:17,560
This option right here
is to choose how many

25
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:21,950
of these individual decision trees
that we want to actually make.

26
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:23,500
So this can be 300, it can be 200,

27
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:28,150
it can be 5, it can be a thousand,
whatever you so choose.

28
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:31,070
Typically, we leave it at default,
which is 500,

29
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:33,850
then we go back and we change this

30
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:37,550
based off of some of the results that
we're going to review in the future.

31
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:42,090
The other options could be seen in
the model customization options.

32
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:46,270
What is the minimum number of
records allowed in a tree node?

33
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:51,110
So just like before, the smaller number
the more splits that are going to occur.

34
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:56,000
Now, the last two configuration options
revolve around a concept called

35
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,010
bootstrapping, which you can read
more about in the readings notes.

36
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:03,890
This is a more advanced technique and
for the purpose of this course,

37
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:08,830
we're going to keep these values and
options at the default places.

38
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:12,720
So, I'm going to bring a browse tool
after these are our report output

39
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,560
there's no interactive result for
this model.

40
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,640
So I'm going to run this, and
then I'm going to allow you to go and

41
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,360
learn a little bit of what you're
going to be looking for in the results,

42
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,800
in the next session.

43
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,040
Then we're going to come back and

44
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,940
actually view the results
from this model.
