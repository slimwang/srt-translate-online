00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:04,090
One more thing you may be wondering is,
how does the term Data Analysis relate

2
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:07,730
to similar terms like Data Science,
Data Engineering or Big Data?

3
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:11,639
First, Data Science is very
similar to Data Analysis.

4
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:16,000
In fact, many people might describe
some of the examples I gave near

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,410
the beginning of the lesson,

6
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:20,190
such as Netflix's movie
recommendations as data science.

7
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:23,920
I often hear people use the terms,
data analysis and

8
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,380
data science interchangeably.

9
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:28,860
However, to the extent that
there is a difference.

10
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:31,730
In my experience data science
is a little more likely to refer

11
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:34,970
to building some sort of a system,
like a recommendation system, or

12
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:36,340
a ranking algorithm.

13
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:37,580
While a blog post or

14
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:40,910
a paper is more likely to be
refered to as data analysis.

15
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:42,550
It's definitely a fuzzy line though.

16
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:45,630
If you hear some advice for a data
scientists, it's probably relevant for

17
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:46,670
a data analyst as well.

18
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:51,400
In terms of job postings, a data
scientist title sometimes requires more

19
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,740
experience than a data analyst title.

20
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:55,390
Although of course
this varies by company.

21
00:00:56,410 --> 00:00:59,330
Data engineers are more focused
on the data wrangling step of

22
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:01,560
the data analysis process.

23
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:04,849
They make data pipelines and insure that
data collection is fault tolerant and

24
00:01:04,849 --> 00:01:06,310
scales well.

25
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:09,110
They're more involved in storing and
processing data, and

26
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:12,370
less involved in drawing
conclusions based on the data.

27
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:15,750
Big data is a fuzzy term that refers
to the fact that many companies

28
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:20,420
today are dealing with a lot of data,
terabytes, petabytes, and more.

29
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:24,240
There's no rule for how much data you
need before it is big, but certainly

30
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,240
the amount of data we have today
seems big compared to ten years ago.

31
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,430
Data analysts, data scientists, and

32
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:33,780
data engineers can all work with
either big data or not so big data.
