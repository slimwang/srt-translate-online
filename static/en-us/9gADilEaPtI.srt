00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,073
Here are my answers for
the function names.

2
00:00:02,073 --> 00:00:05,454
And as you can see, most of these are
named in a pretty straightforward way.

3
00:00:05,454 --> 00:00:08,465
It's almost a one-to-one
mapping with the requirements

4
00:00:08,465 --> 00:00:10,400
that we saw in the interactions here.

5
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:15,090
As for the return types, getRequestToken
should return the request token,

6
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:18,330
which is a string, and
the same applies for getSessionID.

7
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:21,870
Then for getting the UserID we should
return an integer because that's what

8
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:24,360
the UserID is represented as.

9
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:27,370
For getting movies by search String or
getting favorite movies, or

10
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:30,580
even getting our watchlist movies,
each of these three functions

11
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:34,570
all return an array of movies, and
so you can see the brackets here and

12
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:38,510
then the TMBDMovie object
is what should be returned.

13
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:42,610
And then in final two POST functions,
postToFavorites and postToWatchlist,

14
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:45,860
we should return the status code
indicating whether the post succeeded or

15
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:48,780
not, and the status code is
represented as an integer.

16
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,060
Again, all these answers
are not absolute.

17
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:54,630
This is just my design
approach to the API methods.

18
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:58,870
We'll use these functions as we
implement the Movie Manager, but

19
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:02,530
as you build apps, feel free to create
and to tweak API clients over time,

20
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:05,220
until you have something
that's usable and awesome.
