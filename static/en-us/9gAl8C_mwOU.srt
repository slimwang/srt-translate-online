1
00:00:00,462 --> 00:00:02,550
>> All right, so that quiz maybe was ill-placed, in

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:04,630
that it was about what this is not about. What

3
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:09,150
this is about is computational learning theory. And computational learning

4
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:12,750
theory really gets us a formal way of addressing three really

5
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:16,860
important questions. One is, what's a learning problem? Let's, let's

6
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:18,820
define very carefully what it is that we want a

7
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:21,960
learning algorithm to do. If we can do that, we

8
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:25,510
can actually show that specific algorithms either work or don't work,

9
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:27,980
with regard to the definition of the problem. And maybe we

10
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:31,950
can even come up with algorithms that solve those problems better.

11
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:35,300
So that's kind of on the upper-bound side. And then on

12
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:38,400
the lower-bound side we can also show, for example, in some cases

13
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,730
that some problems are just fundamentally hard. So you, you define

14
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:45,061
a particular learning problem and you discover. Wait, the algorithms that I'm

15
00:00:45,061 --> 00:00:47,180
thinking of don't seem to work. You might actually be able

16
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:51,060
to show that no algorithms, say, no algorithms in some particular class

17
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:52,720
are ever going to be able to solve them

18
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:55,150
because, that problem is not solvable by problems in that

19
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:58,230
class. So those problems are fundamentally hard. So, answering

20
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:01,100
these kinds of questions require that you be fairly careful

21
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:05,830
about defining things and using mathematical reasoning to, to

22
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:07,860
determine what's going on. So we're going to focus mostly

23
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:13,440
on that, talk about some algorithms that are not necessarily

24
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:16,110
practical. You wouldn't necessarily want to use them, but they do

25
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:18,780
help illuminate what the fundamental learning questions are

26
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:21,802
and, and why certain algorithms are effective and ineffective.

27
00:01:21,802 --> 00:01:24,050
>> Okay, so Michael, so can I ask you a question then?

28
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:24,470
>> Sure, please.

29
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:28,110
>> So, it sounds to me like you've just justified this in the

30
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:30,970
same way that a computing theoretician might

31
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:33,420
try to justify theory. Are they related?

32
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:36,380
>> Right. That's a very good observation. In fact, the, the kinds of

33
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:38,190
analyses and tools that are used for

34
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:41,140
analyzing learning questions are also the same

35
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:44,470
kinds of tools and mechanisms that are used in the context

36
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:48,500
of a-, analyzing algorithms in computing. So yeah, that's exactly right.

37
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,140
>> Okay, great.

38
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:53,170
>> In fact, let's let's, let's leverage that analogy.

39
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:54,940
And we'll do it in the context of a quiz.
