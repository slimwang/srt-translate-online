00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,620
>> One thing that comes up when doing filtering is what to do

2
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:03,735
about the boundaries,

3
00:00:03,735 --> 00:00:06,879
because you might ask what happens when your filter falls off the edge.

4
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:09,096
>> What happens when your filter falls off the edge?

5
00:00:09,096 --> 00:00:12,277
>> Meghan has been rehearsing this all week, outstanding.

6
00:00:12,277 --> 00:00:16,619
Well, basically it's undefined until you define it.

7
00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:17,258
All right?

8
00:00:17,258 --> 00:00:21,080
So you have to think about what size operation you want, so

9
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:23,422
that can be illustrated like this.

10
00:00:23,422 --> 00:00:24,501
Okay?

11
00:00:24,501 --> 00:00:27,623
And here we're going to use a little bit of old MatLab nomenclature,

12
00:00:27,623 --> 00:00:31,432
they've changed it, because the old MatLab nomenclature actually makes it clear.

13
00:00:31,432 --> 00:00:36,460
So, here I've got a function f and I'm filtering it with g.

14
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:40,256
And you might try to think about well, what's the size output that I want.

15
00:00:40,256 --> 00:00:43,494
And there's sort of three different possible sizes.

16
00:00:43,494 --> 00:00:50,554
One is when g just touches that corner, I start to get a response.

17
00:00:50,554 --> 00:00:54,095
So if I think of the center point of g as the reference,

18
00:00:54,095 --> 00:00:58,761
I would actually get a box that's bigger than the original function.

19
00:00:58,761 --> 00:00:59,737
Okay.

20
00:00:59,737 --> 00:01:05,072
The flip side is if I want to make sure that all of g is actually touching f,

21
00:01:05,072 --> 00:01:08,657
then I'm going to, again using the center point,

22
00:01:08,657 --> 00:01:12,252
I end up with a smaller output than the original.

23
00:01:12,252 --> 00:01:14,639
And that, that's used to be referred to as valid,

24
00:01:14,639 --> 00:01:16,756
since all those points were in fact correct.

25
00:01:16,756 --> 00:01:20,615
But the problem is when I filter a 55 by 55 image,

26
00:01:20,615 --> 00:01:23,791
I'd really want to get back a 55 by 55.

27
00:01:23,791 --> 00:01:27,356
I don't want to get back a 58 by 58 or a 52 by 52.

28
00:01:27,356 --> 00:01:30,118
What I want is referred to as the same.

29
00:01:30,118 --> 00:01:35,900
So here you see that we put that filter with its middle at the corners and

30
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:38,058
we get back the same size.

31
00:01:38,058 --> 00:01:40,185
So the problem of course,

32
00:01:40,185 --> 00:01:45,419
is what's underneath these pixels here that are sticking out?

33
00:01:45,419 --> 00:01:47,147
And basically when you do filtering,

34
00:01:47,147 --> 00:01:49,310
you have to tell the system what you want there.
