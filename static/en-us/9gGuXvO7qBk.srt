1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,830
The least common multiple of X plus 2 and 2x minus 4 is just their product, X

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:09,211
plus 2 times X minus 4. In order to make our first fraction have that

3
00:00:09,211 --> 00:00:14,202
denominator, we need to multiply it by 2x minus over 2x minus 4. And we need to

4
00:00:14,202 --> 00:00:19,100
multiply by the second fraction to have achieve the same end goal by X plus 2

5
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:23,780
over X plus 2. Once I've written out what each of these fractions is With the

6
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:28,786
same denominator, I can think about how to combine the numerators. We'll be able

7
00:00:28,786 --> 00:00:33,445
to just add the numerators together since they have the same denominator. So,

8
00:00:33,445 --> 00:00:37,991
when we do that, the numerators going to be 2X minus 4 minus 3 times X plus 2.

9
00:00:37,991 --> 00:00:42,377
So, I'll simplify that and then put it in the fraction, this is just going to

10
00:00:42,377 --> 00:00:47,332
save me some space. This simplifies to negative X minus 10. Or if I want to pull

11
00:00:47,332 --> 00:00:52,733
out a factor of negative 1, negative in parentheses x plus 10. Then I can write

12
00:00:52,733 --> 00:00:57,630
the negative sign outside of the entire fraction and put x plus 10 as the

13
00:00:57,630 --> 00:00:58,481
numerator.
