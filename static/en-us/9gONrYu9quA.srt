Let's talk a little bit about number line notation. There are two main ways that

2
00:00:04,337 --> 00:00:08,552
people use to show inequalities on number lines. One set of conventions uses

3
00:00:08,552 --> 00:00:12,907
dots, either open or closed, and the other set of conventions uses parenthesis,

4
00:00:12,907 --> 00:00:17,312
either square parenthesis or brackets, or rounded parenthesis. The closed dot

5
00:00:17,312 --> 00:00:21,606
and the square bracket are equivalent. And to one another or show the same

6
00:00:21,606 --> 00:00:25,663
inequalities. In the open circle and the rounded bracket show the same

7
00:00:25,663 --> 00:00:30,181
inequalities. Thinking about what you know about selecting numbers on number

8
00:00:30,181 --> 00:00:34,465
lines so far, which pair of inequalities do you think shows x is greater than

9
00:00:34,465 --> 00:00:38,640
negative 2 and which one do you think shows x is greater that negative 2?
