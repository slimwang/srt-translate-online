1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,830
In order to complete this challenge,
I will take advantage of the for

2
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:04,420
loop I've already created.

3
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:08,320
Within it, I will add an anchor tag to
edit and delete each restaurant like so.

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,580
I will leave the hrefs empty
with hashtags for now,

5
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:15,125
since I'll be adding the edit and delete
functionality in later objectives.

6
00:00:15,125 --> 00:00:18,585
I rerun my server again, and
get a restaurants page with Edit and

7
00:00:18,585 --> 00:00:20,555
Delete options for each restaurant.

8
00:00:20,555 --> 00:00:22,485
Objective two is in the bag.

9
00:00:22,485 --> 00:00:25,675
The source code for objective two is
available in the instructor notes.
