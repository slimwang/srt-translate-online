1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,740
Now there's a small problem when
I actually try to rub this code.

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:05,000
Let me write a message.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,990
I'm going to go ahead and press send.

4
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:11,129
Now, over here in the database,
I'm going to click on the database tab.

5
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:14,070
If everything worked out,
I should be seeing my message here.

6
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:15,400
But there's still nothing.

7
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:16,769
Nada, no.

8
00:00:16,769 --> 00:00:18,629
Okay, so something's wrong.

9
00:00:18,629 --> 00:00:21,279
If you go back to your app and
look at the Android monitor,

10
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:25,620
it'll provide a clue I'm looking
here at the Warn level of messages.

11
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:28,600
So if we look at this last
message here it says,

12
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:31,679
it tries to set the value at this
point that's seems reasonable.

13
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:33,890
But database error permission denied.

14
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:37,570
Looking back at our database
there's another clue up here.

15
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:41,939
It tells me that the default security
rules require users to be authenticated.

16
00:00:41,939 --> 00:00:44,299
Now this is referring to
the security rules field for

17
00:00:44,299 --> 00:00:47,599
our database,
which can be access right here.

18
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,620
This rules here,

19
00:00:48,619 --> 00:00:52,829
are used to determine which users can
access what information in the database.

20
00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:55,809
There´s a rule for handling who
can read from the database and

21
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:58,289
a rule for
who can write to the database.

22
00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:01,769
Now, by default, the rules are set so
that users can read and write from

23
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:06,200
the database, only if they are
authenticated, also known as logged in.

24
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,900
But you haven't even implemented
the login functionality yet, so

25
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:11,590
it's actually impossible to
get to a state of the app

26
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:13,140
where your user can read or write.

27
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:16,170
Now we're going to talk quite a bit
more about authentication and

28
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:17,609
these rules later on.

29
00:01:17,609 --> 00:01:20,939
For now, I'm going to change these
rules so that we can experiment and

30
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:22,609
actually get a write working.

31
00:01:22,609 --> 00:01:24,500
So I'm going to set my read and
write to true.

32
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,730
And I'll go ahead and press publish.

33
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:29,920
This allows anyone using the app
to read and write to the database.

34
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,629
Okay, I want to emphasize that you
should never set these rules to true for

35
00:01:33,629 --> 00:01:35,129
a production application.

36
00:01:35,129 --> 00:01:38,659
Setting these rules to true makes
it possible for a savvy user

37
00:01:38,659 --> 00:01:43,119
with a bit of programming experience to
basically do anything to your database.

38
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,990
That includes reading the entire
database, which might have

39
00:01:45,989 --> 00:01:50,530
sensitive information about users,
or erasing all of the data in it.

40
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:53,290
So because of that, setting read and
write to true is for

41
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:55,120
development purposes only.

42
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,280
And we could see here
that after publishing,

43
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,489
Firebase is giving me a little warning.

44
00:01:59,489 --> 00:02:02,479
But for now let's see if changing these
rules allowed me to actually write to

45
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,530
the database.

46
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:06,000
I'm going to go ahead and
try to send another message.

47
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,770
Okay so I set my message and
now going over to the database tab

48
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:13,000
I can see that I actually have
a message's location, and

49
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,169
I can expand that out and
see that my message was saved.

50
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:19,629
Congratulations, you just wrote
your first data to the database,

51
00:02:19,629 --> 00:02:20,629
isn't that cool.

52
00:02:20,629 --> 00:02:23,335
>From now on this messages
node will exist and

53
00:02:23,335 --> 00:02:26,068
it'll contain a list of
individual message notes.

54
00:02:26,068 --> 00:02:30,700
This messages node here, is the database
reference that we are referencing here.

55
00:02:30,699 --> 00:02:33,459
And if I go and
make a few more messages,

56
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:38,120
we can see here at the database, they
are listed out under the messages note.

57
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:41,580
And if we're using Firebase Vocabulary,
each of these messages could be

58
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:45,670
considered a child of the messages and
you'll also notice that there is

59
00:02:45,669 --> 00:02:50,299
a random sequence of letters and
numbers associated with each message.

60
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:53,360
Recall that every time data
is pushed to the database.

61
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,680
A unique ID is created as a key for
that data.

62
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:00,099
This allows me to type
the same message twice and

63
00:03:00,099 --> 00:03:03,969
then, in the database, be able to
differentiate between the two messages.

64
00:03:03,969 --> 00:03:07,789
Now, under these unique keys, you'll
find the actual message data itself.

65
00:03:07,789 --> 00:03:12,729
Each message consists of a text key
value pair and a name key value pair.

66
00:03:12,729 --> 00:03:15,319
Right now,
all messages show our name as anonymous,

67
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:17,500
because we haven't been
authenticating users.

68
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,659
You'll learn how to
authenticate users shortly,

69
00:03:19,659 --> 00:03:21,710
when we actually talk
about authentication.

70
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:24,390
For now,
we'll just have to remain anonymous.

71
00:03:24,389 --> 00:03:29,139
So right now, you're effectively sending
messages from the app to the database.

72
00:03:29,139 --> 00:03:32,709
The next task is actually to read these
messages and display them in the app.
