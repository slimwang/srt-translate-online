It looks to me like the slope of these opposite sides is the same. Slope,

2
00:00:04,154 --> 00:00:08,460
however, as we'll soon talk about, has to do with how the change in y and the

3
00:00:08,472 --> 00:00:12,766
change in x are related. Any two lines that have the same slope are parallel.

4
00:00:12,866 --> 00:00:17,173
They will never touch one another. They'll always just be the same distance

5
00:00:17,185 --> 00:00:18,999
apart along their entire length.
