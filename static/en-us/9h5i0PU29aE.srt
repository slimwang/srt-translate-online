00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:02,370
I'll start from the last diagram.

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:04,200
It shows the nav coming
in from the right,

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,060
see how it's over here off the canvas?

4
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:09,220
And then it comes in and
covers the canvas on the right side.

5
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:13,640
This one is wrong, because this
property translate negative 300 pixels,

6
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:17,780
means that the nav bar is starting 300
pixels to the left of the view port.

7
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:19,370
So, this can't be right.

8
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:23,940
In this example, it shows the nav
bar showing up from, well, nowhere.

9
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:25,230
It's not over here.

10
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:26,300
This is wrong.

11
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:30,220
According to the CSS over here,
it clearly exists somewhere.

12
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:33,760
In this example, the nav bar is starting
off to the left of the viewport, but

13
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,120
then when it comes in,
it pushes the content off the viewport.

14
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:41,260
This is wrong, because the position
of the nav element is absolute.

15
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:42,510
Which means that when it comes in it

16
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:45,090
will actually just cover
the existing content.

17
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:48,750
All that is to say that this diagram
accurately shows the way the navbar will

18
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:50,120
show up on screen.

19
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:50,910
And there you have it.

20
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:53,950
This is a good way to visualize the way
your navbar is sliding in on the screen.
