00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,480
A bitonic split gives us a natural
divide and conquer scheme for

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:05,689
sorting any bitonic sequence.

3
00:00:05,689 --> 00:00:07,090
Let's see how.

4
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:09,850
Given an input sequence, split it.

5
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:12,510
That means you pair
elements from each half.

6
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:14,490
In this case there are 32 inputs, so

7
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:17,850
you'll pair elements that
are 16 away from one another.

8
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:19,850
Here's the logical pairing.

9
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:23,520
Here are the mins and
here are the maxes.

10
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:26,160
That ends the first splitting step.

11
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,980
The result is two bitonic
subsequences each of length 16.

12
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:33,750
You can then repeat this
process on each subsequence.

13
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:37,760
Start the splitting by pairing elements
that are eight away from each other.

14
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:42,730
First pair, then take mins,
then take maxs.

15
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:47,390
That leaves you with four bitonic
subsequences, each of length eight.

16
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:51,286
And you'll just repeat this
process until you run out of pairs

17
00:01:10,557 --> 00:01:14,300
What you just did is
called a bitonic merge.

18
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:18,910
That is you started with a bitonic
sequence as input and you sorted it.

19
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:21,020
Let's write out some pseudo code.

20
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:24,410
You're given a bitonic sequence,
let's say it's of length n.

21
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:28,050
If there were at least two elements
then you do the following, again for

22
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:30,440
simplicity, let's assume that n is even.

23
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,910
You start by splitting the sequence.

24
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:35,960
This will give you two
bitonic subsequences.

25
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:39,230
You then merged each
of those subsequences.

26
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:42,290
Now remember that all elements of
one subsequence are less than or

27
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:44,670
equal to all elements of the other.

28
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:46,370
That makes them independent.

29
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:47,820
Therefore you can spawn one of them.
