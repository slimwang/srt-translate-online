1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:02,280
Wow, you did a Latin version point two.

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:05,080
There's a lot on this screen,
it's looking pretty slick.

3
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:08,109
>> Well it wasn't just me,
we've been hard at work.

4
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:09,730
>> Do you want to look at the y frames?

5
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:11,550
>> Yeah sure,
let's review what we've done.

6
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:13,120
In version zero point two the app,

7
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,129
you made the fundamental screens
of shopping list plus plus.

8
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:19,704
This included the main screen with all
the lists, also known as the shopping

9
00:00:19,704 --> 00:00:22,240
lists fragment, and
the shopping list detail screen,

10
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,220
also known as the active
list details activity.

11
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:28,830
In order to do this, you needed to
master reading and writing data.

12
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:31,360
You also learned about
the FirebaseUI library,

13
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:35,230
which helps you easily show up to
date Firebase data in the list view.

14
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:38,640
At this point, you've got an app that
can be edited by a bunch of users

15
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,110
simultaneously, which can add lists,
rename them, and delete them.

16
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:46,810
Inside of those lists, we've also
got items that any user can add.

17
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:49,170
And on your own, I'm going to
have you work on the edit and

18
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:51,840
delete functionality for those items.

19
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,390
>> If your users work well together,
I'd say this is a pretty useful app.

20
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:57,280
>> Well, JP,
that's actually why you're here.

21
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:57,780
Take a look.

22
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:02,530
>> Wow, do humans even eat those?

23
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:05,099
>> I don't know.
It seems that we have a troll in our

24
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:05,830
midst.

25
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:09,060
>> Well,
have you considered another option?

26
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,770
Maybe something from outside
your group of roommates?

27
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:12,820
Anyone who told them to?

28
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:16,550
>> But I hadn't shared
the code with anyone, unless.

29
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:17,310
You.

30
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:18,910
You.
Who have you been talking to?

31
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:20,340
You're under a non-disclosure agreement.

32
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:21,060
Was it Grocery Grabber?

33
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:22,220
How much did they pay you?

34
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:23,300
How much?
>> You know,

35
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:27,020
another way to solve this is to
implement user authentication Firebase.

36
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:30,270
With user authentication, you can share
accounts, you can create lists and

37
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:31,810
add items to lists.

38
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:34,120
>> Interesting.
That's actually not a bad idea.

39
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:37,980
>> Yeah and Firebase user
authentication is really pretty easy.

40
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:40,070
>> Well, I better read up
on user authentication, but

41
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:42,000
I'll see you both in version
point three of the app.
