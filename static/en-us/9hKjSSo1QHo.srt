1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,650
So, here you can see a list of items that were put in by somebody,

2
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:06,280
not all that imaginative.

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:06,939
No, it wasn't Art.

4
00:00:06,939 --> 00:00:08,080
It was somebody else.

5
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:08,760
Really.

6
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:11,880
You know, sofa, table, chair, things that were in the room.

7
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,000
But notice, those are specific things.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,350
You could have said, wall, floor.

9
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:20,810
You might've said that's a living room, that's probably a house.

10
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:22,096
That's a modern house.

11
00:00:22,096 --> 00:00:25,840
Or you could have said that's the house of an upper-middle class family

12
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,990
taken back in 1997 somewhere near Ohio.

13
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:30,600
How you would know that I don't know,

14
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,790
but maybe you know something about interior decorating.
