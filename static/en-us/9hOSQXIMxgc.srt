00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:04,538
Transpose of a matrix is this original matrix with it's rows and columns flipped

2
00:00:04,538 --> 00:00:09,788
along the diagonal. There are two diagonals but the one I mean is from the upper

3
00:00:09,788 --> 00:00:13,880
left to the lower right. It's where we put the scale factors for example. Here

4
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:20,112
I'm showing the original matrix A,B,C,D and so on with column order. What we do

5
00:00:20,112 --> 00:00:24,818
to transpose is we flip along the diagonal and they're now in this order. The

6
00:00:24,818 --> 00:00:29,932
mathematical notation for this is M superscript T, where T means transpose. The

7
00:00:29,932 --> 00:00:34,878
other operation that is commonly done to a matrix is computing its inverse. The

8
00:00:34,878 --> 00:00:39,084
inverse is shown like this a negative 1 in the superscript. If you multiply a

9
00:00:39,084 --> 00:00:43,243
matrix by its inverse, you get the identity matrix. The inverse of a matrix

10
00:00:43,243 --> 00:00:47,930
essentially undoes the work of that matrix. For example, if your matrix moves an

11
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:52,367
object five units up, the inverse moves it five units down. The inverse of a

12
00:00:52,367 --> 00:00:56,369
rotation matrix is one that rotates on the same axis but back the other

13
00:00:56,369 --> 00:01:00,942
direction. The inverse of a scale matrix scales the object back down. Let's look

14
00:01:00,942 --> 00:01:04,988
at the inverses of some common transform matrices. For translation, we start

15
00:01:04,988 --> 00:01:09,613
with our translation values over here. The inverse is the negation of all those

16
00:01:09,613 --> 00:01:14,168
translation values. Which makes sense. You move to one direction, and then you

17
00:01:14,168 --> 00:01:18,456
come back the other direction. For any rotation matrix, it turns out that the

18
00:01:18,456 --> 00:01:24,300
inverse is the transpose. So, for this one, for example. Its rotation around the

19
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:29,316
z axis and you simply transpose these two elements and you know have the inverse

20
00:01:29,316 --> 00:01:34,289
of the z rotation. For a scale matrix, we divide one by the original scale

21
00:01:34,289 --> 00:01:38,824
factors. Or to say it more mathematically. We take the multiplicative inverse of

22
00:01:38,824 --> 00:01:43,126
each scale factor. Things get more complex when we combine rotation, translation

23
00:01:43,126 --> 00:01:47,094
and scale matrices. The inverse of a matrix representing a complex series of

24
00:01:47,094 --> 00:01:51,076
transforms is usually not obvious. I won't spend the time explaining how to

25
00:01:51,076 --> 00:01:54,992
compute an inverse that's a whole lesson of linear algebra. The good news is

26
00:01:54,992 --> 00:01:59,380
that every graphics library in the know universe. Has a matrix inversion routine

27
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:05,204
of some sort. Three.js is no exception. Matrix4 class has a getInverse function.
