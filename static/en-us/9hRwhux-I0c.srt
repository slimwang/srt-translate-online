1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,029
want to see something cool?

2
00:00:02,029 --> 00:00:02,980
>> Yes.

3
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:03,500
>> Okay.

4
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:07,313
Let me show you how come they got their
paper on the cover, I think It was

5
00:00:07,313 --> 00:00:11,208
the ACM, I think it was the journal,
the journal of ACM, but I forget.

6
00:00:11,208 --> 00:00:14,801
They had the cover picture
of a journal and here's why.

7
00:00:14,801 --> 00:00:16,875
Here's a picture of an apple, okay?

8
00:00:16,875 --> 00:00:18,740
Beautiful picture of an apple.

9
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:19,790
Here's a picture of an orange and

10
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:22,900
I'm going to tell you it's not
just any picture of an orange.

11
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:25,260
You'll notice that this apple
is in front of some pencils.

12
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:26,770
This orange is in front
of some other pencils.

13
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:30,520
kind of same colored background, and
you'll notice they're the same size, and

14
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:32,680
that's because they've been
scaled to be the same size.

15
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:37,370
Using the Laplacian pyramid stuff,
I can make this picture.

16
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:42,723
Okay, now if Megan could see this
picture, Megan would be going, wow,

17
00:00:42,723 --> 00:00:43,917
how did they do that?

18
00:00:43,917 --> 00:00:45,850
>> Wow, how did they do that?

19
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:48,020
>> Okay, first of all,
I hope you are too, it's pretty cool.

20
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:49,580
It's half orange, half apple,

21
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:52,860
and it blends, and
you can't see any seams, all right?

22
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:58,480
And the way they did that is,
they built a Laplacian pyramid, so

23
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:03,167
this is the coarser scales,
this is the original Laplace scale.

24
00:01:03,167 --> 00:01:07,987
The coarser, coarser, and they just seam
together, each one of the, the pyramids,

25
00:01:07,987 --> 00:01:12,278
by just a single pixel, but at the small
size, not at the, not at the expanded

26
00:01:12,278 --> 00:01:16,436
size, so at the very small one, they
took half of the left, the left half of

27
00:01:16,436 --> 00:01:21,380
the apple, the right half of the orange
and they just blended the middle row.

28
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:24,470
Then they expand that, okay?

29
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:27,880
Take the Laplacian here,
Laplacian there, combine that,

30
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:30,730
add in with single row,
you do that all the way down,

31
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:35,460
and what you've done is you've blended
the, the low frequencies over a larger

32
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:39,285
range of the image, and the high
frequencies over a smaller range and

33
00:01:39,285 --> 00:01:42,945
you make this magic apple orange thing,
and that's how you get yourself on

34
00:01:42,945 --> 00:01:47,855
the cover of the transactions
on ACM Transactions on graphics.

35
00:01:47,855 --> 00:01:48,385
Cool, right?
