1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,570
Communities to practice are unique
learning and doing environments.

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:06,270
They were detailed in great
book from 1991 called,

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:08,480
Legitimate Peripheral Participation.

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,390
And it basically suggests
that novices and

5
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:12,340
experts work together in
certain environments.

6
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:15,464
And the novices actually learn
from the experts while the experts

7
00:00:15,464 --> 00:00:16,500
are doing some task.

8
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,058
And over time, the novices take
a little bit of responsibility and

9
00:00:19,058 --> 00:00:20,350
then a little bit more.

10
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:23,610
And learn how to contribute to that
environment while also contributing to

11
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:25,240
that environment.

12
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:29,100
So for an example that's used in that
book is the example of midwives.

13
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:31,762
So when a midwife is first
being trained in certain areas,

14
00:00:31,762 --> 00:00:35,310
the first thing she goes through is just
being in the room during childbirth.

15
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:38,674
She experiences the different things
that the experienced midwives

16
00:00:38,674 --> 00:00:41,350
are saying and doing and
just kind of gets a feel for it.

17
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:43,860
And then over time, she takes on
a couple responsibilities, and

18
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:47,170
a couple more, and learns, and
learns a little bit more each day.

19
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:50,130
And eventually is an expert herself,
and can start training her own novices.

20
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:52,970
It's a very apprenticeship
driven approach.

21
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:55,860
And that book they suggested, this is
really one of the best ways to learn.

22
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:58,370
because your learning right
in the authentic context,

23
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:01,270
where you'll ultimately
contribute to what you learned.

24
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:03,670
But it presents a lot of
difficulties for classroom learning,

25
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:06,110
because classrooms
are completely absent of this.

26
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:08,930
You very rarely have classrooms
where you really are doing what you

27
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:09,830
are learning to do.

28
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:13,076
You're learning in place to the idea of
being that you're going to go out into

29
00:01:13,076 --> 00:01:15,250
the world and then do it in a job or
do it in a career.

30
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:18,782
But in the classroom you're not actually
contributing, but this learning theory

31
00:01:18,782 --> 00:01:21,310
suggests that that's the opposite
of a great way to learn.

32
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:22,266
So the question is,

33
00:01:22,266 --> 00:01:25,420
can we create these kind of
environments where this is simulated,

34
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:29,025
where students are experiencing what
it would be like to contribute a little

35
00:01:29,025 --> 00:01:32,720
more over time to this enterprise
that they're trying to learn.

36
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,410
Technology may be able
to help us with this,

37
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:36,790
because with technology we can
create these kinds of similations.

38
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:39,744
We can simulate, whatever career
the students are going to go into and

39
00:01:39,744 --> 00:01:43,800
simulate giving them some of these
responsibilities while AI agents or

40
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,260
the simulation itself
takes care of the rest.

41
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:48,710
So we'll talk about the value
of this educational approach,

42
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:51,270
as well as how we can use technology
to really bring it to life.
