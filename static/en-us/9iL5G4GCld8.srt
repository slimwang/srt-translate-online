00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
In order to improve this function I have to ask myself, "What do each of the loops do?"

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
"And can I implement that in another way other than with nested loops?"

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
The answer seems to be that each of the nested loops is incrementing the word by one letter,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
from abcd to abcde, and then it's checking to see if we have a new word,

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
and it's checking to see if we should stop

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
if what we have so far is not a prefix of any word in the dictionary.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
If I don't want to have nested loops what I want instead is a recursive procedure.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm going to have the same structure as before.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm going to start off by initializing the results to be the empty set,

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
and then I'm going to have some loops that add elements to that set,

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
and then I'm going to return the results that I have built up.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Then I'm going to start the loops in motion by making a call to this recursive routine.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 99:59:59,999
What I want you to do is fill in the code here.
