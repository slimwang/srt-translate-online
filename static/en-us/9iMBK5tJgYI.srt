00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:03,609
Putting a negative sign out in front of the entire function means we're going

2
00:00:03,609 --> 00:00:07,900
to reflect the function in the x-axis. Let's take a look at our graphs,

3
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:13,262
finally. So here we have our progression starting with our first function, f(x)

4
00:00:13,262 --> 00:00:18,826
equals x cubed. Then we translate it to the right by 1. To give us f of x

5
00:00:18,826 --> 00:00:24,802
equals the quantity x minus 1 cubed. And then finally, we reflect this in the x

6
00:00:24,802 --> 00:00:29,889
axis, giving us f of x equals negative x minus 1 cubed.
