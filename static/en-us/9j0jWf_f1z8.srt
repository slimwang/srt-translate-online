00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:03,530
State charts can be nested. That is a state may

2
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:08,963
have a state chart nested within it. Let's, for a second, step out from our

3
00:00:08,963 --> 00:00:13,963
layer in which we've been modelling and think about the outermost layer of this,

4
00:00:13,963 --> 00:00:18,830
of this particular device and work inward. If you recall the paper I've asked

5
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:24,360
you to read by Harrell the digital watch had the same outermost layer

6
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:28,270
having to do with whether the batteries are in the watch or not. What might be

7
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:33,030
the analogous situation here, as far as an outermost state is concerned?
