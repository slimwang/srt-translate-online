1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,460
For this quiz, I want you to
experience the web without images.

2
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:06,180
Install Lynx and ChromeVox.

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:08,170
You can find some links
in the instructor notes.

4
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:10,700
Once you do,
visit an image heavy website.

5
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:14,840
Ask yourself, what is it like
experiencing the web without images, and

6
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:16,850
try listening to a site with ChromeVox.

7
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,330
If all you had was ChromeVox,

8
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:21,350
could you figure out what
the images were trying to tell you?

9
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:24,640
Making your website accessible to
everybody is incredibly important,

10
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,730
because not only does it
make you a good person,

11
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:30,010
it means that more people
can experience your website.

12
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:31,600
So, when you check this
check box down here,

13
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,870
it means that you are promising to
use all attributes responsibly.
