00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,982
One idea you'll run across with transparent textures is that of premultiplied

2
00:00:03,982 --> 00:00:08,783
alpha. PMG files never used premultiplied alpha. Other formats vary. Texture

3
00:00:08,783 --> 00:00:12,205
data can be stored however you want in memory, either unmultiplied or

4
00:00:12,205 --> 00:00:17,293
premultiplied. So what's it mean? Here's the blending equation normally used

5
00:00:17,293 --> 00:00:20,990
for transparency. The source, that is the transparent object, is blended with

6
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:25,025
the destination, the object behind it using the source's alpha value.

7
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:29,106
Premultiplied alpha means just that. The term alpha source times color source

8
00:00:29,106 --> 00:00:32,921
is going to be the same every time this texture data is accessed. We can

9
00:00:32,921 --> 00:00:35,981
premultiply the original color by the alpha, and store this new color in

10
00:00:35,981 --> 00:00:40,542
memory. This new equation saves a multiplication every single time this text

11
00:00:40,542 --> 00:00:44,618
cell is accessed. Say we access this texture 60 times a second and a million

12
00:00:44,618 --> 00:00:49,174
text cells are accessed. That saves 60 million multiplies a second, which could

13
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:50,560
start to add up.
