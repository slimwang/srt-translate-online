00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,130
Here are Greg and Lauren and they both have a problem, or a stressful event.

2
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:07,860
Their shoes are untied. Greg thinks about strategies he can use to change this

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:12,156
situation to reduce the stress. He could buy elastic shoes so he never has to

4
00:00:12,156 --> 00:00:16,734
tie his shoes again, he could tape his shoes so that they won't come untied. Or

5
00:00:16,734 --> 00:00:21,260
he could tie his shoe. These are ways in which he could change his situation to

6
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:26,176
reduce the stress of having an untied shoe. Here Greg focused on his problem

7
00:00:26,176 --> 00:00:30,529
and changed his situation. This is called, problem-focused coping and it

8
00:00:30,529 --> 00:00:33,844
involves looking at the situation and changing the situation that caused the

9
00:00:33,844 --> 00:00:38,575
stress. Lauren on the other hand, had a different way with coping with this

10
00:00:38,575 --> 00:00:40,270
some what trivial event.
