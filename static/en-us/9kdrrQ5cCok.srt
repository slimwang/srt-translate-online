00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,469
Here are some guidelines about the review process itself. First off,

2
00:00:03,469 --> 00:00:05,540
spread out the reviews over time.

3
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:09,360
Performance degrades if reviews are too concentrated. A practical limit for

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:14,120
the duration of a review is the smaller of 250 lines of code, or 2 hours of,

5
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:18,920
of artifact reviewing. Each type of review should have its own criterion for

6
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:22,100
thoroughness, which should be determined in advance of the meeting.

7
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:27,310
You can, treat the review as a go, no go decision activity. That is,

8
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:30,170
the review meeting should end with a decision about whether or

9
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:34,280
not the artifact is ready for the next stage of the development process.

10
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:37,500
In fact, some organizations require the reviewers to sign off on

11
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:41,270
the acceptability of the artifact, thereby improving accountability.
