1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,300
This one would have been 5 times the square root of 3. Great work if you

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:07,569
figured that one out. We know 75 is the same thing as 25 times 3. We want to

3
00:00:07,569 --> 00:00:11,522
make sure that we split this up into factors where one of the factors is a

4
00:00:11,522 --> 00:00:16,449
perfect square. This allows us to use our product rule and then to take the

5
00:00:16,449 --> 00:00:21,110
square root of this one. So we use the product rule in this step, and then we

6
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:26,760
take the square root of 25 which is just 5. We're left with 5 times the square

7
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,228
root of 3, which is just equal to 5 root 3. And notice that we make another

8
00:00:30,228 --> 00:00:33,667
assumption. If we write a number in front of a radical sign, we assume there's

9
00:00:33,667 --> 00:00:38,662
multiplication in between them. So here's our answer.
