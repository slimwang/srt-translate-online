1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
We saw earlier how we could prove correctness, and correctness is easy to show.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Proving security is really hard.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
This property of the one-time pad that we can change the key and that leads

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
to a different message, is the reason why it is secure.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
But first I want to talk about how to prove security in general.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Then we'll come back to the problem of how do we prove that the one-time pad

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
is actually a perfect cipher.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
How can we argue that a cipher is secure?

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
This is a really hard problem.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I'm going to start with a quiz, and it will definitely require some guesswork.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
See if you think it through before I explain the answer.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm going to give you give possible ways someone might argue

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
that a cipher is secure.

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
For this quiz, your goal is to order the arguments below

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
by how effective they are in convincing someone that a cipher is secure.

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Use 1 to indicate the best argument and 4 to indicate the worst argument.

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
The choices are many very smart people were highly-motivated to break

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
the cipher but were not able to.

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
That means it must be secure.

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
The second choice is there are 834 quadrillion possible keys, so it must be secure.

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The third choice here is a mathematical proof that's been accepted by experts

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
that shows the cipher is secure.

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
The forth choice is here is a strong argument why breaking the cipher

24
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
is at least as hard as some problem we already believe is hard.

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
This is a bit of a unfair question, since we haven't talked about this yet.

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I think it's useful for you to think about it on your own before I talk about it.

27
00:01:22,000 --> 99:59:59,999
See if you can figure out which of these arguments are most effective.
