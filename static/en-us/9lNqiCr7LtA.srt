00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:02,885
Okay, so here's your chance to demonstrate what you've learned

2
00:00:02,885 --> 00:00:06,730
thus far. You know, my computer science professor in college

3
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:10,670
used to say, if you truly want to learn something,

4
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:12,970
teach it to someone else. And that's what we are doing

5
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:15,810
to do in this exercise. We want you to find

6
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:18,630
a friend or a colleague that does not know much

7
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:21,610
about computer programming at all. And then we want you

8
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:25,140
to teach this program that we've written together to that individual.

9
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,740
Now, while you're doing that, we want you to use

10
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:32,240
your phone or a video camera to record a video of

11
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:35,510
your conversation with that friend. Capture their reactions and then

12
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:38,800
you can share that video with us on our discussion forum.

13
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,450
Now, if you don't have access to a video camera,

14
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:45,170
you can also share with us photos or some text describing

15
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:47,670
your friend's reaction while you were teaching them this piece of

16
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:52,490
code. The next video we'll showcase how to share videos and

17
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:53,860
photos on our discussion forum.
