00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,140
Many phones have currency conversion
apps which are pretty useful when

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:04,480
you're traveling.

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:06,850
This exercise deals with an example one.

4
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:10,500
In this case, we're converting
US dollars into Japanese Yen.

5
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,330
And the rate is 1 US dollar
to 119 Japanese Yen.

6
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:17,240
And we're going to assume that
we're converting 40 dollars.

7
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:18,700
Okay.
Let's hand simulate to see if it

8
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:19,450
does what we expect.

9
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:23,110
In the first line, we're declaring and
initializing a variable called dollars,

10
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:24,720
and we're setting the value to 40.

11
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,540
This variable is probably storing
the amount that we're trying to convert.

12
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:29,294
Okay.

13
00:00:29,294 --> 00:00:31,680
On this next line,
we have a variable called dollarsToYen.

14
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,930
And we're setting that to 119.

15
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:37,250
This variable probably represents
this conversion rate up here,

16
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:39,100
that $1 is 119 yen.

17
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:42,220
Next we're declaring and
initializing a variable called yen.

18
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:45,110
Now let's calculate the value
that we're initializing it to.

19
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:48,620
So here we have dollarsToYen,
which is 119.

20
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:51,050
And we're multiplying it by dollars,
which is 40.

21
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:53,150
I used a calculator for this one.

22
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:55,554
The result here is 4,760.

23
00:00:55,554 --> 00:00:59,780
In the next line,
that's what we display 4,760.

24
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:01,640
So, did this do the right thing?

25
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:04,360
Well we know that $1 is 119 yen and

26
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:08,570
if we have $2 it's going to
be two times whatever $1 was.

27
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:15,240
So it'd be two times 119 and
if we had $40 it would be 40 times 119.

28
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,370
Which is the exact
calculation that we do here.

29
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:20,470
So it looks like, yes, this is correctly
calculating the number of yen.
