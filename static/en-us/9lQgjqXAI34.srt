1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,650
Now, you just learned how to
use the SQL update command.

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:06,830
And using the where clause,
we saw that we can set

3
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:10,100
constraints on the objects that we
want to read or select out of a table.

4
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:13,560
And using that same where clause,

5
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:15,700
we can specify a single pet
that we want to update.

6
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:19,960
In our case,
we want to specify the pet via its id.

7
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:24,100
Now the final database operation
you need to know, involves

8
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:27,580
deleting all the pets who have been
entered into the database incorrectly.

9
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:31,080
Now a word of warning here.

10
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:35,580
It's shocking how easy it can be to
remove all the pets from the database.

11
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:38,040
So be very careful when
using this command.

12
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:42,620
So here's the code for
the delete SQL command.

13
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:48,260
And this single code here will
delete everything from the table.

14
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:52,980
So, that here reads DELETE FROM and
the table-name.

15
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:55,090
So, this is the specific
command that we'll be using for

16
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:58,090
deleting all othepets for
our pets table.

17
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:00,810
And I'll be adding it to our cheat
sheet, so that we can refer to it later

18
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:03,285
when we're building out our delete
all button for our pets app.

19
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:07,690
And to reiterate, be very careful
when you're using this command,

20
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:10,380
because it deletes all
the pets from our table.

21
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:16,230
Now if we just want to remove a single
pet that's been incorrectly entered,

22
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:20,840
we can make the command more specific
once again by using our where clause.

23
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:25,632
So just as updating, if we want to
specify a specific pet to delete,

24
00:01:25,632 --> 00:01:29,056
here we use the where clause,
followed by id and

25
00:01:29,056 --> 00:01:33,354
the id of the pet in the database
that we're interested in.

26
00:01:33,354 --> 00:01:34,859
