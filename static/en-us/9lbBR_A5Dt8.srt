00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:02,070
Here's the answer.

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:06,150
For the height,
if you had the top padding, content, and

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:08,940
bottom padding, you get 175 pixels.

4
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:13,595
For padding,
you only need to specify 50 pixels.

5
00:00:13,595 --> 00:00:16,665
This cover's adding the padding
to not only the top and

6
00:00:16,665 --> 00:00:20,515
bottom of the element, but
also the left and right.

7
00:00:20,515 --> 00:00:24,585
Getting familiar with the short hand way
of writing CSS will help you save time

8
00:00:24,585 --> 00:00:25,835
and make your code a little cleaner.

9
00:00:26,865 --> 00:00:29,115
Short hand doesn't work for
every property, so

10
00:00:29,115 --> 00:00:32,970
do some research on your own to
figure out when it's okay to use.

11
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:36,960
Finally, for margin,
you only need to specify 20 pixels.

12
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,250
Just like padding, margin behaves
the same way when writing it shorthand.

13
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:44,970
This takes care of adding 20
pixels in all four directions.

14
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:48,010
Top, bottom, left, and right.
