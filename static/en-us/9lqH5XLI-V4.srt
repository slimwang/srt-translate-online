1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,100
To go over the mathematics
of both dilation and

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:07,430
erosion, we have to talk about something
called the structuring element, okay?

3
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:10,040
The structuring element is a mask, okay?

4
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:15,340
It's a shape that you're going
to use to do these operations.

5
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:17,310
And, it can be any shape.

6
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:20,190
For today, the shapes
are going to be ones and zeroes.

7
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:21,940
They can also be ones, zeroes, and x's.

8
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:23,850
And the x's are don't cares.

9
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:26,370
But nothing we're going to talk about
today will, will involve don't care, so

10
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:27,640
I'm not going to talk about it.

11
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:31,170
What's important about the shape is that
they all are defined with respect to

12
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:34,940
sometimes called an anchor, or
reference point, or an origin, right?

13
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:39,450
And usually, not always,
usually that origin is in the middle

14
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:43,710
of whatever shape you're making use of,
okay?

15
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:48,960
So given a structuring element,
we can define both dilation and erosion.

16
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,230
So dilation is as follows.

17
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:55,300
Basically, I've got some binary image,
B, okay?

18
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:56,480
And that's here.

19
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,830
I've got a structuring element, S.

20
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:01,330
And the structuring element
has to have an origin.

21
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:03,040
Basically, what you do is,

22
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:06,610
you're going to take this
dilation structuring element and

23
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:11,000
you're going to run it around here,
placing the origin at different places.

24
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,030
And wherever you place it,
you're going to take the OR

25
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:19,690
of all of the ones in the structuring
element with the ones underneath it.

26
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:25,130
And so what that means is if any of the
ones land, of the structuring element,

27
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:29,965
land on a one in the binary image,
the aura of all that will be one.

28
00:01:29,965 --> 00:01:32,125
So, Arpin did this and he's very proud.

29
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:36,667
So, there's my structure element, and
he, there he goes, [SOUND] very good.

30
00:01:36,667 --> 00:01:37,315
Cool.

31
00:01:37,315 --> 00:01:39,795
All right?
So you basically run it all over, and

32
00:01:39,795 --> 00:01:44,695
what the result of this, okay,
is this val, is thing here.

33
00:01:44,695 --> 00:01:47,055
And let's just take a lot at that,
right?

34
00:01:47,055 --> 00:01:49,490
These are our two original ones.

35
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:50,300
Okay.

36
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:55,260
So when I put this structuring element
down here, like that, nothing was a one.

37
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:57,780
In fact, as I slide it all along,
nothing is a one, so

38
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,190
those are all zeroes.

39
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:00,000
Right?

40
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,630
But when I put my structuring element
here, notice it overlaps there.

41
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:08,470
Okay.
So this value which is the origin for

42
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:10,550
that first position, that gets a one.

43
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:14,890
And as I slide it along, that's how
I get the, the, the rest of these.

44
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:18,050
So that's dilation by
a particular shape.

45
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:21,280
Now I'll tell you
sometimes you'll dilate by

46
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,240
sort of a funny shape like that.

47
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,060
Usually your shape will be symmetric.

48
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:27,560
Sometimes it will be
taller than it is wide

49
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:31,070
because you're trying to extend things
in one direction as opposed to another.

50
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:34,667
But this cutout kind of thing
would be a little bit unusual.

51
00:02:34,667 --> 00:02:36,667
In fact, here's a nice example.

52
00:02:36,667 --> 00:02:41,129
So here's a binary text and you can see
that there's white pixels but they've

53
00:02:41,129 --> 00:02:45,249
got lots of, if, you know, if you take
a look at that m, you can see it's

54
00:02:45,249 --> 00:02:50,000
kind of, bunch of little spots in there
that seem to have some holes in it.

55
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,270
So if I use a structuring
element that looks like this.

56
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:57,930
That, essentially, says that if I touch
anybody to my right, left, up or, or

57
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:00,970
below, I want to turn on the pixel.

58
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:04,880
And, when I do that, you get
the really much better result, right?

59
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:08,320
I mean, it's much easier to read the one
on the left, the one on the right.

60
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:11,270
The one on the right might be uglier,
okay, because it doesn't look so

61
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:13,670
crisp, but
there's no question about reading it.
