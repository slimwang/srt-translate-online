00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,980
Let's look at the inverse of linear functions. We're going to find the inverse

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:10,160
function of f of x equals 2 x plus 3. We've seen functions like these before.

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,916
This is just a linear equation that crosses the y axis at 0, 3 since the y

4
00:00:14,916 --> 00:00:21,720
receptor's 3. The slope of this equation is 2, so we'll rise 2 and then we'll

5
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:26,695
move to the right one unit. Now this is all the way back to unit three when we

6
00:00:26,695 --> 00:00:31,412
first learned about lines. But now what we're going to do is we're going to

7
00:00:31,412 --> 00:00:37,528
undo these operations. We know f of x is the same thing as y. This is just the

8
00:00:37,528 --> 00:00:41,814
output. So, now, the first thing we need to do to find the inverse function is

9
00:00:41,814 --> 00:00:47,052
to switch x and y. If we switch the variables x and y, then we get this new

10
00:00:47,052 --> 00:00:54,320
equation. X equal 2 y plus 3. Now we just need to solve for y to get our new

11
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:59,150
inverse function. so you tell me, what would you get for y if you solved for

12
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:06,495
it? In other words, what's the expression over here that involves x? As a hint,

13
00:01:06,495 --> 00:01:08,652
it should be a fraction.
