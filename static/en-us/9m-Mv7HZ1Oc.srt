00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,374
Let's use our calculator to plug in this number and see what happens. We have

00:00:04,374 --> 00:00:10,849
3.1 times 10 to the negative 4 power. I double check that that looks right and

3
00:00:10,849 --> 00:00:17,444
hit the equal sign. We get 0.00031. Interesting.
