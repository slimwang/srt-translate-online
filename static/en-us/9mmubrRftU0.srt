1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:01,640
How do we actually do this?

2
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:02,860
Well, let's talk about this.

3
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:06,880
Here is a simple example,
I have a video clip here and

4
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:09,420
I'm going to use this to
generate a video texture.

5
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:12,080
Playing this video you kind of
notice that basically it

6
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,215
is got a lot of dynamic nature, and

7
00:00:14,215 --> 00:00:18,465
of course, I'm intentionally simp,
taking simpler examples of these flames.

8
00:00:18,465 --> 00:00:21,685
But you can see that this is actually
a very interesting, you know,

9
00:00:21,685 --> 00:00:22,995
dynamic scene.

10
00:00:22,995 --> 00:00:25,845
A video texture basically
builds from this and

11
00:00:25,845 --> 00:00:30,870
it identifies transitions in
time which it loops over.

12
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:34,790
So in essence the red bar here is
showing you something interesting.

13
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:37,730
This was the time axis from zero,
to let's say whatever,

14
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:39,840
however long the video frame was.

15
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,130
It basically jumps from
one to the other, and

16
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:47,820
it can keep doing this in this space
to generate a Infinitely long video.

17
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:49,840
So this red dark,
basically in the time axis,

18
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,440
is basically flickering from one to
the other, and it's showing that it can

19
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:56,040
actually search and seek out
other examples and keep looping.

20
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,570
How do we generate that is what
we're going to try to get next
