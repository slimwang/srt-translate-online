In preparation for his upcoming glasses expo, Grant needs to figure out how to

2
00:00:03,702 --> 00:00:06,871
ship all of his wipers and the glasses that they're being modeled on.

3
00:00:06,959 --> 00:00:10,306
Unfortunately, he's not going to have the nozzles ready in time but his

4
00:00:10,318 --> 00:00:13,921
investors are still confident that they'll be plenty of excitement about the

5
00:00:13,933 --> 00:00:17,483
wipers on their own. Grant's just worried about how to get the wipers to the

6
00:00:17,495 --> 00:00:22,875
expo. He's planning on bringing all of his model glasses wipers to the expo in a

7
00:00:22,887 --> 00:00:27,345
suitcase, but his concern is that the suitcase will be overweight. When his

8
00:00:27,357 --> 00:00:31,970
suitcase is empty it weighs 7 pounds, and each glasses wiper set, along with its

9
00:00:31,982 --> 00:00:36,305
protective packaging, only weighs 1 half a pound, or 0.5 pounds.

10
00:00:36,309 --> 00:00:40,739
Can you find a relationship between the number of glasses wiper sets that Grant

11
00:00:40,751 --> 00:00:45,194
packs and the total weight of his suitcase? Please use x for the number of wiper

12
00:00:45,206 --> 00:00:46,919
sets and y for the total weight.
