00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
[Norvig] And here's the answer.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
For the straight flush the values of the card_ranks is 10, 9, 8, 7, 6.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Here was the straight flush, and notice what we've done

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
is we put the order with the highest cards first

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
because we're going to use these ranks for tiebreakers,

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
and in tiebreakers it's the highest first that counts.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
So we always want the result from card_ranks to be sorted highest first.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
For 4 of a kind, four 9s and a 7. That looks right. The 9s come before the 7.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 99:59:59,999
For full house, three 10s and two 7s. 10s come before the 7 and again, that looks right.
