1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Now that you've simulated and simulated the down heapify algorithm on an example

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
and you've seen what the code looks like, tell me what the running time of down heapify

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
would be if you have the heap of size n where the top node might be

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
violating the heap property but it satisfied everyone else.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 99:59:59,999
We run down heapify on this and re-establish the heap property and it takes how long?
