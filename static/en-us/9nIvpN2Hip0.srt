00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:04,515
So here are the numbers that I get for A, when I plug in n. You can see we have

2
00:00:04,515 --> 00:00:07,925
some pretty long decimals here, except for our first answer, which is very

3
00:00:07,925 --> 00:00:13,692
simple. Since we just get 1 plus 1 to the 1st power. However, you might notice,

4
00:00:13,692 --> 00:00:17,310
that the difference between adjacent values, here, gets smaller and smaller as

5
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:22,236
n increases. The difference between these last two, doesn't show up. Until the

6
00:00:22,236 --> 00:00:27,452
fifth decimal place. Something interesting is definitely happening here.
