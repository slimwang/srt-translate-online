1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:02,450
Okay. So I deleted my old tickets sold field.

2
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:02,790
>> Yep.

3
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:05,010
>> And remember when we went to the festival, and there

4
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:08,020
were all those people outside like, get your tickets, get your tickets.

5
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:10,770
>> I think they had a sketchier voice than that. Like, you need some tickets?

6
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:11,720
>> Get your tickets, yeah.

7
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:11,720
>>

8
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:11,997
[LAUGH]

9
00:00:11,997 --> 00:00:15,110
>> Okay, totally sketchy, I don't want these scalpers at

10
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:18,960
my festival. the reason this stuff always happens is because

11
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,480
You know, one person could buy like a thousand tickets

12
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,340
and then they can sell them at like 10X value.

13
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:24,640
>> Yeah.

14
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,541
>> Which is super-annoying. so, so how can I, say,

15
00:00:28,541 --> 00:00:32,080
for example, don't let anyone buy more than one tickets?

16
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:35,220
>> So that's really easy to do in Salesforce, because

17
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:38,210
you can just create a rule that prevents that from happening.

18
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:41,400
And what that is called in Salesforce is a Validation Rule.

19
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:41,650
>> Okay.

20
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:43,760
>> And so basically you set up some

21
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,640
sort of condition that shouldn't happen, and if

22
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,462
it does, it throws an error at whoever's

23
00:00:49,462 --> 00:00:51,360
you know, trying to create or modify the record.

24
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,070
>> Okay, let me try and do this. So this is on

25
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:58,670
attendees, because we don't want the attendee to buy more than eight tickets.

26
00:00:58,670 --> 00:00:59,220
>> Exactly.

27
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:01,669
>> And I'm going to click my little friend on the right.

28
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,190
Oh, okay, a few validation rules. Add one.

29
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:05,560
>> Yep.

30
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:09,800
>> Okay, let me give this a shot and tell me if I make any mistakes.

31
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:10,590
>> Alright.
