00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,649
So far, we've seen that when we have an equation. An equation like, for example,

2
00:00:04,752 --> 00:00:08,927
y equals 3 x minus 5, we can graph that equation. And when we graph that

3
00:00:08,939 --> 00:00:13,617
equation, any point that we can pick out that lies along this line will satisfy

4
00:00:13,629 --> 00:00:18,094
this equation. If we pick a point along here, like this one let's say, we can

5
00:00:18,106 --> 00:00:22,470
figure out its coordinates. Substitute them into x and y respectively, and then

6
00:00:22,482 --> 00:00:26,763
find the two sides of the equation are equal to 1 another. In principle then, we

7
00:00:26,775 --> 00:00:30,848
should be able to check whether or not a point is on the line of an equation

8
00:00:30,946 --> 00:00:35,274
without having to look at the graph at all. As great as visual representations

9
00:00:35,286 --> 00:00:38,954
are, algebra itself is super powerful. Let's test out this theory.
