1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,851
So the answer is a bigger sample. If we chose this one also, and let's say these

2
00:00:05,863 --> 00:00:11,425
two, so we double our sample size. Then you see we have this small value 32%.

3
00:00:11,546 --> 00:00:17,142
And that's going to drag down the sample statistic X bar, the average. So, this

4
00:00:17,154 --> 00:00:22,600
will be closer to the population average mu. And of course, ideally, we'd want

5
00:00:22,612 --> 00:00:27,455
the entire population, but often times that's really hard to do, because the

6
00:00:27,467 --> 00:00:32,290
population might be so big. That's when we need a sample. But a bigger sample

7
00:00:32,302 --> 00:00:37,465
will better approximate the population parameter. Another example where samples

8
00:00:37,477 --> 00:00:42,424
can be misleading is predicting the outcome of the presidential election. For

9
00:00:42,436 --> 00:00:46,970
this last Presidential election with President Obama versus Mitt Romney, a lot

10
00:00:46,982 --> 00:00:51,238
of polls were given out which each came up with its own result. Some of them

11
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:55,670
predicted that Romney was going to win, which as we know didn't happen. While

12
00:00:55,682 --> 00:01:00,209
each sample may not perfectly predict population parameters. The sample

13
00:01:00,221 --> 00:01:05,743
statistic can give us an interval in which the population parameter lies, as

14
00:01:05,755 --> 00:01:11,165
long as the sample is random and as unbiased as possible. We'll go more into

15
00:01:11,177 --> 00:01:13,047
depth about samples later.
