1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:05,094
If we factor out a 10,000 from each term in the original expression, then for

2
00:00:05,094 --> 00:00:12,048
the first term, we find 10,000 divided by 10,000 or just 1. For the second

3
00:00:12,048 --> 00:00:19,068
term, which we add to the first one, we get 0.03. That's our answer, 1 plus

4
00:00:19,068 --> 00:00:20,068
0.03.
