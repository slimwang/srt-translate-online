1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:04,450
So this is everything you need to know
about extending regular notifications

2
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:06,680
for a great experience on Android Wear.

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:09,740
Your application remains
basically the same as before, but

4
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:14,478
we used Werable extensions to add more
detail that is useful on Android Wear.

5
00:00:14,478 --> 00:00:17,490
The Android Wear software takes
care of all the hard parts such as,

6
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:20,710
showing the user interface and
handling speech recognition.

7
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:21,810
Another thing to know,

8
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:25,160
is that these kinds of extensions
are quite common in Android.

9
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:28,440
Similar concepts are used to handle
messaging with Android Auto.

10
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:31,810
So, you'll be able to use similar
techniques to extend your software

11
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:33,120
to many different platforms.
