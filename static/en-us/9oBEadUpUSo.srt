00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:06,040
To understand a method of means and analysis. Let us look at this blocks

2
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:10,360
word problem. This is a very famous problem in AI. It has occurred again and

3
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:14,930
again. And almost every textbook in AI has this problem. You're given a table on

4
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:19,680
which there are three blocks. And A is on table, B is on table, and

5
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:25,440
C is on A. This is the initial state. And you want to move these blocks,

6
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:29,970
to the gold state. On this configuration, so that C is on table, B is on C and

7
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:34,780
A is on B. The problem looks very simple listen, doesn't it?

8
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:36,850
Let's introduce a couple of constraints.

9
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:43,870
You may move only one block at a time, so you can't pick both A and B together.

10
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:48,390
And second, you may only move a block that has nothing on top of it. So,

11
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:52,870
you cannot move block A in this configuration, because it has C on top of it.

12
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:56,700
Let us also suppose that we're given some operators in this world.

13
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:00,770
These operators essentially move some object to some location. For

14
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:06,140
example, we could move C to the table, or C onto B, or C onto A.

15
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:10,740
Not all the operators may be applicable in the current state. C is already on A,

16
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:14,770
but in principle, all these, all of these operators are available. Given these

17
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:20,300
operators, and this initial state and this goal state, write a sequence of

18
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:24,040
operations that will move the blocks from the initial state to the goal state.
