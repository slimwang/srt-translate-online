1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:02,310
Just now let's look at a bunch
of different examples.

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:07,030
Here, basically doing a comparison to
conventional aperture corrections,

3
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:11,120
a conventional aperture like this
to use for doing corrections.

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:14,184
You see a little bit of ringing,
that's shown here.

5
00:00:14,184 --> 00:00:18,146
You see a lot of defocusing, you can
see a little bit of ringing here also.

6
00:00:18,146 --> 00:00:22,024
This is the output with this aperture,
much crisper image.

7
00:00:22,024 --> 00:00:25,429
Here's an example very similar to what
we looked at when we did the light

8
00:00:25,429 --> 00:00:29,860
fieldwork of being able to de-focus,
focus an image in a single image itself.

9
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:33,230
You can see basically,
interactively, we can focus one of,

10
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:36,990
one of the subjects and move around and
be able to focus on the other one.

11
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:39,500
Again, this is coded aperture.

12
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,390
We used to do these
types of captioning or

13
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:45,450
hold in, information on one image
to be able to allow you to do this.

14
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:47,510
Refocusing from a single
image in this example.

15
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:49,930
Hopefully, you can see this
on your compressed videos.

16
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:53,414
Now actually, I'm going to
borrow a specific example on

17
00:00:53,414 --> 00:00:56,571
how these authors generated
this coded aperture.

18
00:01:10,827 --> 00:01:14,758
That's it, they basically did was, open
up a lens, I don't recommend doing that

19
00:01:14,758 --> 00:01:18,080
to your favorite high end
expensive lens by yourselves.

20
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,080
But open it up and
put that small aperture in there, and

21
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,380
then seal the camera back.

22
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:26,230
And of course when you put the camera
the lens back on the camera

23
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:28,270
you basically have a coded aperture.

24
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:30,490
Again, do this at your own peril.

25
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:33,340
I don't recommend taking off and
breaking up your very,

26
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:35,630
very favorite lens to
do this kind of stuff.
