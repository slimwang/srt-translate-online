1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,000
Before we move on to the next stage, which would be dispatch,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,890
let's do a issue quiz. So in this quiz, we have our instruction queue,

3
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:14,610
we have our RAT, we have our register file, we have a reservation stations.

4
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:17,140
These two instructions are already reservation stations.

5
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:21,320
There are two left to issue. And these are the values of the register file,

6
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:26,740
of the RAT, etc. So your task is to issue these two instructions,

7
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:30,640
or at least issue those that can be issued at, at this time.

8
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,360
You don't need to consider when these instructions are going to finish,

9
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,050
just issue whatever can be issued in the next several cycles,

10
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:40,170
assuming that these are just not going to leave from here anytime soon
