Let me ask a different quiz--suppose you run linear regression, and you found that b=4 and a=-3.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
To remind you, this describes the following linear relationship between x and y.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
My question is about the correlation coefficient r.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Will r be positive, negative, zero, or can't we tell as in can't tell?Check exactly one box.
