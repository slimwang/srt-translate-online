1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,330
So, that's very good. So, you, were able to realize that Pavlov is

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:06,670
in Nash equilibrium. But we can go further than that. Or farther, than that.

3
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:07,290
>> Further.

4
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:10,730
>> We can go further than that. And show that in fact Pavlov is sub-game

5
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:13,070
perfect. So, unlike tit for tat. It's

6
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:17,180
actually subgame perfect. So let's let's take a

7
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:19,810
look at how we could convince ourselves of that. So I think the important thing

8
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:22,840
to see is that by feeding these two

9
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:25,230
Pavlov machines different sequences we can get into

10
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:27,210
any of these four different combinations of states.

11
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:29,320
They're both in the cooperation state. They're both

12
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:32,250
in the. Both in the defect state, ones

13
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:34,430
cooperate, ones defect, ones defect and ones cooperate.

14
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:35,180
>> Mh-hm.

15
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:38,420
>> so is it the case, that no matter which state

16
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:41,790
that those are in, that the average reward is going to be

17
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:45,520
mutual cooperation. So let's check, if they are both cooperating, and we

18
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,810
continue with these Pavlov machines then they will mutually cooperate, so yes.

19
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:50,710
>> Mh-hm.

20
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:54,360
Alright if they're in defect defect then what's going to happen?

21
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,320
>> Well then they both agree, so then they cooperate.

22
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,970
>> So they're going to move to cooperate

23
00:00:57,970 --> 00:00:59,060
and then they'll stay there forever, so

24
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:01,510
then that'll be mutual cooperation. Awesome. What

25
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:03,120
if ones in cooperation and ones in defect?

26
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,180
>> Then they disagree.

27
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:08,430
>> Right. And they move to the other state.

28
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,470
>> More specifically what?

29
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:14,530
>> Oh, I don't know [LAUGH], I can't remember. I'm trying to keep

30
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:20,710
track of who, who's who. So if I cooperate. and you defect, then let's

31
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:25,270
see the guy who cooperates moves to defect. And the guy who defects

32
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:28,590
moves to defect. Because you, and now

33
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:30,320
you agree, and so you're going to cooperate.

34
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,910
>> Boom. So, when we're in the

35
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:36,370
cooperate defect state, then on the first move.

36
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:39,090
Let's see, you just, yeah, the right-hand

37
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:42,390
Pavlov just defected, so that causes this transition.

38
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:44,310
And this guy just cooperated, which causes this

39
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:46,240
transition, so that we've gone to defect defect.

40
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,850
>> Right. Which means that

41
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:50,240
we're going to average cooperation, because [CROSSTALK]

42
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:50,558
>> Mm-hm.

43
00:01:50,558 --> 00:01:52,030
>> That's where we're going to get stuck in the long run.

44
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:52,470
>> Right.

45
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:54,640
>> And the same thing works through here. Boom.

46
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,119
>> That's actually very cool, and kind of counter-intuitive.

47
00:01:58,119 --> 00:02:01,370
>> Yeah. And truly neat. So sort of no matter what

48
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:04,910
weird sequence we've been fed we manage to

49
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:08,100
resynchronize and then return to a mutually cooperative state.

50
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,030
>> So I have a question for you.

51
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:13,120
>> Go for it. So presumably this is really cool

52
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,210
like mathmatically because now we shold all do, we should

53
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:19,700
all be Pavlovians. Like we're all Kinseans. ANd then we

54
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,970
just kind of move forward from there. D people do this?

55
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:24,720
>> I don't know the answer to that question.

56
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,520
>> I mean other than men on a basketball course.

57
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:30,510
>> Sure, you can always return to that. Though I'm not sure I'm aware of any

58
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:32,570
analyses of men on a basketball court and

59
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:36,260
whether or not You know, people have analyzed that.

60
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:37,610
>> Hmm.

61
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:38,970
>> But how about this. If I find

62
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:42,900
out, I will post something on the instructor's comments.

63
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:45,640
>> Okay, that sounds reasonable. So Pavlov

64
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,710
is subgame perfect. That's awesome. So remind

65
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:51,870
me again why I care that something is subgame perfect? Because it means that,

66
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:54,510
so let's say that you actually, so I'm being this left Pavlov

67
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:56,420
and you defect and me and you're like yeah I'm going to

68
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:58,560
defect on you because I just want to take advantage of you,

69
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,300
and you're, you're going to forgive me and I will have gotten this

70
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:05,910
extra bonus for that. And what it turns out is that No,

71
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:09,600
if we do Pavlov versus Pavlov, we're going to fall into mutual cooperation

72
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,970
no matter what. So, so, so this defection that I do, this,

73
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:17,940
this threat, this punishment that I deal out to you, you can earn

74
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:20,580
it back, and we can go back into a cooperative state.

75
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:21,160
>> Right.

76
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:24,250
>> So, it's worth it to me to punish

77
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:26,120
you, because I know that it's not going to cost

78
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,740
me anything in the long run, and it stabilizes your

79
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:31,140
behavior in the short run. Sure. It makes perfect sense.

80
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:32,760
>> So it becomes a plausible threat.

81
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:33,600
>> I like it.
