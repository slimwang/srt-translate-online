00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:06,200
What we have seen so far are the basic features of Acme. That is the vocabulary

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:10,980
of keywords and descriptions that you can build from the keywords describing

3
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:15,620
basic architectures. However, Acme has some additional features that allow you

4
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:20,710
to go beyond this basic vocabulary. In particular, because Acme was

5
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:26,840
designed in support of interchanging architectural descriptions between tools.

6
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:32,330
And each tool may have its own vocabulary that goes beyond what's needed for

7
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:38,320
simple interchange. Acme has a mechanism for embedding within it tool specific

8
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:43,980
terminology. This additional text is not interpreted by Acme other than for

9
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,230
syntax checking. But is passed along to the various tools. And they can do their

10
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:55,960
own work on it. This extension mechanism is called Acme's property sublanguage.
