1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,690
The first one of course is not a functional property because condition two is not fulfilled.

2
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:07,320
All computer programs are computer programs.

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:10,400
There is no computer program that is not a computer program.

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,950
Of course, this sounds a bit silly but it's actually

5
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:16,270
the only example I could think of where this condition here is violated.

6
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:20,730
A program always returns one already is a functional property.

7
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:23,590
First of all, it describes how output relates to the input

8
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:26,420
namely output doesn't care about the input and is always one

9
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:28,560
and property two is also always satisfied.

10
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,750
For example, there are computer programs that I could write that always return two

11
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:36,800
and property two is fulfilled for all the other three as well, so I won't even mention it anymore.

12
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,550
A program solves vertex cover?

13
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:44,400
Yes, definitely that describes an input-output behavior, how output relates to the input.

14
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:48,170
Is a computer a virus? I would say yes, this is a functional property.

15
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:51,750
Now, it is a bit debatable if saying it is a computer virus

16
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:55,220
already described sufficiently how the output relates to the input

17
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:59,420
but I would say that probably any definition of a computer virus that you would give me

18
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:02,470
would in some way describe what the computer virus is doing.

19
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:06,450
So, it might ignore anything that receives and overwrite your hard disc,

20
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:09,020
so put something in the memory, or it might lock your screen.

21
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:11,850
So, I would say here, the input-output behavior is variable

22
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:15,510
depending on how you define computer virus but it is always defined.

23
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:18,510
Now, the final one that is a bit of a tricky one saying that

24
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:23,480
a program only requires linear time is not a functional property

25
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:27,770
because that does not describe how the output relates to the input.

26
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:32,060
It is the property of the program but it is not a functional property

27
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:35,910
because it doesn't ask what does the program do

28
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:38,700
and what does the program do is actually this relationship here.

29
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,690
It only asked how fast that the program are doing that.

30
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:44,200
This is something that is a little more tricky to figure out,

31
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:47,290
but basically, any time that you ask can a program do X

32
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:49,920
that will be a functional property that you are asking for

33
00:01:49,920 --> 99:59:59,999
at least in almost any of the cases.
