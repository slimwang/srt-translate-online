1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,086
This data, is what's called normally distributed. That's very important. A

2
00:00:05,098 --> 00:00:10,370
normal distribution has one peak right here, called the mode. And it looks like

3
00:00:10,382 --> 00:00:14,766
most scores fall at around 20%. And in fact, when you looked at the

4
00:00:14,778 --> 00:00:19,926
interactivate software in the last video, when I showed you the different bin

5
00:00:19,938 --> 00:00:25,935
sizes for this data, it said that the mean was 19.151, which is about 20%. The

6
00:00:25,947 --> 00:00:32,265
shape is roughly symmetrical. You can see that it follows a distribution that

7
00:00:32,277 --> 00:00:38,413
looks kind of like this. And, if you were to fold it across this line, it would

8
00:00:38,425 --> 00:00:43,133
pretty much overlap right on top of each other. Now 35 percent is out about

9
00:00:43,145 --> 00:00:48,219
here, so we cannot say that the most common body fat percent is 35%. We can,

10
00:00:48,231 --> 00:00:53,808
however, say that most scores fall in the middle of the distribution. Here's the

11
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:59,239
middle, and you can see that 64 approximately men fall right here in the middle

12
00:00:59,251 --> 00:01:05,916
with these 2 bins. Are there more scores between 15 and 25 than 35 and 50. 15

13
00:01:05,928 --> 00:01:12,197
and 25 covers this middle area here, but 35 and 50 goes from here out to about

14
00:01:12,209 --> 00:01:18,553
here. So yes, we can say there are more scores between 15 and 25 than 35 to 50.

15
00:01:18,686 --> 00:01:25,773
How about between 0 and 10? Doesn't look like there are many scores, whereas

16
00:01:25,785 --> 00:01:32,725
between 18 and 24, that covers pretty much this whole section, so no we cannot

17
00:01:32,737 --> 00:01:39,860
say this. And finally, do relatively fewer men have a body fat percentage above

18
00:01:39,872 --> 00:01:45,797
35, or below 5%? Yes, only a few men have that body fat percentage.
