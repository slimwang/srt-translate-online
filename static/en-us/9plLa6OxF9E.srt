1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:04,160
So here is a demonstration of
the skeleton app that was just created.

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:08,430
So here is our main window, and if I
click on the Interstitial Ad button,

3
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:11,410
I will launch
the Interstitial Ad activity.

4
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:14,790
You can now see that we have the two
buttons here, Load Interstitial and

5
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:16,670
Interstitial Not Ready.

6
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:20,653
The Interstitial Not Ready button
is our mShowButton member of

7
00:00:20,653 --> 00:00:23,120
the Interstitial activity.

8
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:27,940
And as you can see, this is disabled
since we disabled it in our code.

9
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:29,870
Now, when I click on Load Interstitial,

10
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:33,470
you'll see that the text of this button
changes to Loading Interstitial.

11
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:36,590
Now it's your turn to implement this.

12
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:38,120
Let's see what we did.

13
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:42,480
We created two buttons in the layout
file of InterstitialActivity,

14
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,140
Load Interstitial and
Interstitial Not Ready.

15
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:50,310
We defined a callback for Load
Interstitial to be loadInterstitial.

16
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:55,050
And in this callback we disable
the button Interstitial Not Ready, and

17
00:00:55,050 --> 00:01:00,020
we change the text of Interstitial
Not Ready to Loading Interstitial.

18
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:04,410
To be able to disable and change the
text of this button programmatically,

19
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:06,300
we need to define it as a Property or

20
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:09,190
a member of our
InterstitialActivity class.

21
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:12,350
This member had the name mShowButton.

22
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:16,380
We define the callback for
this button to be showInterstitial.

23
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:20,480
And for now, we left the implementation
of this callback empty.

24
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:23,380
We also disable this button in onCreate.

25
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:27,920
And finally, we defined the
interstitial_ad_unit_id to be this value

26
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,770
in our string resource file.

27
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:35,380
And remember, this value is to test
ad unit ID for interstitial ads.

28
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:37,860
Now it's your turn to
do all of these things.

29
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:39,630
And check here when you're finished.
