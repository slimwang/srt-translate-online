1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:01,960
So that concludes this lesson.

2
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:03,540
It concludes the lesson on tracking.

3
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:06,410
It concludes what seems like months
of recording about tracking.

4
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:08,490
Somehow this ended up being a lot but

5
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:10,610
its really a cool part
of computer vision.

6
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:12,450
You have probabilistic state.

7
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:14,230
You have the notion of measurements and

8
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:16,930
the idea of combining those to come
up with what's really going on

9
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:19,970
in the world, which at its heart is
what computer vision is all about.

10
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,560
Also for many of you,

11
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:27,060
even if you don't end up doing computer
vision this idea of maintaining

12
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:31,810
a consistent interpretation over time
as something changes becomes important

13
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:35,190
whether you're tracking the state of
traffic flow over a bridge, something,

14
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:40,040
whatever it is this idea of maintaining
Interesting interpretation over time.

15
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,820
So some of the principles we
learned here from computer vision,

16
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:46,150
can be applied to those
more generic situations.

17
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:47,840
Anyway, that's it for tracking.

18
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:48,790
Onward and upward.

19
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:51,870
Pretty soon we'll start
talking about recognition, and

20
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:53,470
lots of other cool stuff.

21
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:53,970
See you later.
