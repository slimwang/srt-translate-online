00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:04,750
So far, we've looked at the data
types number, string, and boolean.

2
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:08,955
But there are couple more we need
to look at, and those are null and

3
00:00:08,955 --> 00:00:09,806
undefined.

4
00:00:09,807 --> 00:00:11,515
At first,
they might seem somewhat confusing,

5
00:00:11,515 --> 00:00:13,580
because they are pretty similar.

6
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:16,940
So you might want to replay this
explanation a couple of times.

7
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:19,980
Null is a data type that has no value,

8
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:22,890
just like how you can set
a variable to a value of 10.

9
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:26,560
You could explicitly set
a variable to a value of null.

10
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:32,700
Undefined is a data type that
indicates the absence of value.

11
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,600
It's a bit confusing, but
it's not the same as null.

12
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,759
Null is a value that means nothing or
totally empty.

13
00:00:40,759 --> 00:00:45,299
But undefined actually means
does not have a value,

14
00:00:45,299 --> 00:00:47,159
not even a value of nothing.

15
00:00:47,159 --> 00:00:53,659
You could declare a variable x and try
to use it, and it will return undefined.

16
00:00:53,659 --> 00:00:56,839
It's undefined because
the variable x exists,

17
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,110
it just doesn't have a value yet.

18
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:01,289
If you set a variable to
the value of null and

19
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:04,560
try to use it, it will return null.

20
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,609
In other words,

21
00:01:05,609 --> 00:01:10,099
undefined will be returned to you, if
you didn't assign a value to something.

22
00:01:10,099 --> 00:01:12,699
Null will be returned
if you purposefully

23
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,260
assigned the value to nothing.
