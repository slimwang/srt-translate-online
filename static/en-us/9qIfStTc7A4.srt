1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,270
So once we see these two things next to each other, it

2
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:05,635
kind of raises the question, why, don't we just use a gradient decent type of approach

3
00:00:05,635 --> 00:00:09,930
,on an error metric that's defined in terms of y hat instead of

4
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:12,730
this, the activation a? because y hat ,is the thing, that we really

5
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:15,230
want to match the output. We don't really want the activation to

6
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:18,470
match the output. There's no, there's no need for that. So, it seemed

7
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:21,730
there's a, bunch of different possible reasons for that. It could be, well

8
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:22,990
we don't do that, because, it

9
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:25,640
would just be computationally intractable. It's too,

10
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:29,410
it's too much work. Another possibility would be, well, to

11
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:31,340
do the gradient descent, you'd have to be able to take

12
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:33,980
the derivitive and if we use it in this form,

13
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:37,370
it's not differentiable. So, we can't take the derivative. Another one

14
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:39,710
is, well sure we can do all that, it's not

15
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:43,800
intractable and its not, not differentiable. But, if we do that

16
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,960
then the weights tend to grow too fast, until you

17
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,970
end up getting unstable answers, and then, the last possible choice

18
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:53,410
that we will give you is. You can do

19
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:55,740
that but you can get multiple different answers and

20
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:58,130
the different answers, behave differently and so this is

21
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:00,390
really just to keep it from being in illdefined.
