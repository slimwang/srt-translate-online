1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:03,080
The answers are A, B, and A.

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:06,090
The first example is
of a consumable item.

3
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:10,140
These keys will be used up in the game
to unlock levels and get a plant.

4
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:12,910
This second example is of entitlements.

5
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:14,968
Once these different
blade types are bought,

6
00:00:14,968 --> 00:00:16,768
the player can keep them indefinitely.

7
00:00:16,768 --> 00:00:20,880
And the third is another example
of a group of consumable items.

8
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,280
These power ups can be bought and
then used up in the game.

9
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:27,290
Most of these in-app items can
be purchased with real money.

10
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:31,250
But many games also include
in-game currency, like stars.

11
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:32,460
So let's take a look at those.
