>> What's really interesting about the last set of equations is that you can

2
00:00:03,916 --> 00:00:08,125
tell they are parallel just by looking at them. Remember, in standard form, we

3
00:00:08,125 --> 00:00:12,163
get the slope by finding negative A over B. So, we only need to look at the left

4
00:00:12,163 --> 00:00:16,245
side of the equation. Since these two equations have the same left side, that

5
00:00:16,245 --> 00:00:20,846
means, their slopes have to be equal. Equations with equal slopes are either the

6
00:00:20,846 --> 00:00:25,346
same line or they're parallel lines. We know these two lines can't be the same,

7
00:00:25,346 --> 00:00:29,757
because the right-hand side is different, so these lines must be parallel.
