00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,650
Now I know its really tempting to think that the answer is seven but this would

2
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:08,698
be a mistake. We know that the square root of five is really just a number. So

3
00:00:08,698 --> 00:00:13,960
we have seven times one number minus one times another number. So if we have

4
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:18,540
seven of one number and we subtract one of that number. Then we'll six of that

5
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:22,260
number left. This is why this answer is really six times the square root of

6
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:26,708
five. If we think about factoring the square root of 5 from both of these

7
00:00:26,708 --> 00:00:30,299
terms, we would be left with the quantity of 7 minus 1 times the square root of

8
00:00:30,299 --> 00:00:36,224
5, and when we subtract, we'll get 6 times root 5. Another way to think about

9
00:00:36,224 --> 00:00:40,226
this reasoning is with an object. If you thought the answer was seven, then

10
00:00:40,226 --> 00:00:44,200
consider this, if we had seven cakes and subtracted a cake we wouldn't be left

11
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:49,967
with seven cakes we'd really be left with six cakes. This is sort of an analogy

12
00:00:49,967 --> 00:00:53,987
for what's going on here we have seven cakes at root 5's minus one cake or 1

13
00:00:53,987 --> 00:00:59,104
root 5. This leaves us left with 6 root 5.
