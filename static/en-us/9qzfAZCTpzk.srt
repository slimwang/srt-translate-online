00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:04,080
Here are a few examples where
ads are used fairly effectively.

2
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:07,340
You could see here a banner ad.

3
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:11,200
Banner ad are images based
advertisements that often appear

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,120
in the side, top, or
bottom section of a website.

5
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,790
They use PCC, paper click model,

6
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:22,630
In which advertisers pay a fee each
time a user clicks on this ad.

7
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:24,410
You can see here on the verge,

8
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:28,740
that Spotify is actually taking quite
a lot of real estate over the top.

9
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:33,490
If we scroll down,
we can see another ad over here.

10
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:36,670
And in most cases,
if we continue scrolling,

11
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:41,530
down to the bottom we can see
another ad just over here.

12
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:48,200
Another example would be the Huffington
Post, and you can see here another ad.

13
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:56,230
And another example in Yahoo Finance
would be actually two ads one for

14
00:00:56,230 --> 00:01:01,680
their mobile app and the other very
prominently on the right side.
