1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Now, let's look at one more example and this time we go to a bank and hope to get a fair coin

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:16,000
This going coin over here and our alternate hypothesis is a two-sided hypothesis

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:26,000
with a probability either is smaller than 0.5 or larger than 0.5 which provide us p≠0.5.

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
The way to know where this concept will lead, in all we've done so far,

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
we assume that H₀ is correct and we've computed some sort of distribution and then we cut out

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
a critical region such as the volume underneath with smaller input of 5%,

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
assuming you a 5% confidence.

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Now in the two-sided test, what we do is cover the smaller region on the left but also one on the right,

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
such that the area on the left doesn't exceed half of 5%

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
that is 2.5% and the same for the area on the right.

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Now, we've moved the critical region into two areas.

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
We have a two-sided test now that's called a two-tailed test

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
and in totality, the two critical regions on the left and right don't exceed 5%.

14
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
This looks awfully like a confidence interval, right?

15
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Let's flip the coin. In 14 experiments, heads comes out exactly 3 times

16
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
and 11 times it comes out tails.

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Let's do the analysis. So in this table, I've graphed to you the probabilities

18
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
under the binomial distribution for each possible outcome, from 0 to 14 as before.

19
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:54,000
We go 0, 0.005, 0.22, 0.06, 0.12, 0.18, 0.21--this is obviously

20
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
the most likely outcome for the null hypothesis and then it goes down

21
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
exactly the way it went up over here.

22
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I've also added check boxes. I want you to check exactly those that define the critical region,

23
00:02:08,000 --> 99:59:59,999
so the total probability in the critical region does not exceed 5% and remember this is a two-tailed test.
