00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
This is a particle filter question where we start with a single particle over here facing east.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
The particle has an X, a Y, and a heading direction,

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
and this particle is on a checker board with black squares and white squares.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Let's assume we draw 5 new particles from this particle for the motion of going right,

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
and they end up as indicated over here.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Each of these 5 new particles--1 of which falling into a2, 2 of which falling into b2,

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
1 into c2, and 1 into b3--

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
each of these particles will obtain an importance weight,

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
as now that what we'll measure is on a black square.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
So the measurement is black.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
To calculate the importance weight, let me tell you that the probability of seeing black

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
on a black square = 0.8,

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
whereas the probability of seeing black on a white square is only 0.1.

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
So I want you to tell me the total importance weight that falls to a2--

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
here we just have a single particle--

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
into b2--please add the importance weight of both particles--

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
c2, and b3.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Please add your numbers over here.
