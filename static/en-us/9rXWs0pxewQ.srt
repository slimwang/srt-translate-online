The last question asked, what is the maximum clustering coefficient for a node in B?

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Here's the formula for a clustering coefficient.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
If you look at any node in the left side say the middle one.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
We know that all of its neighbors will be in the right group,

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
and since B is a bipartite graph, they're can't be any edges in between numbers of the right group.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 99:59:59,999
This implies that Nv will always be zero, which means the clustering coefficient will always be zero.
