1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:02,020
Okay, let's find the traversal paths for

2
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:05,530
the image filter used on
the given media file.

3
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:08,670
From scanning the response, we can
see that there's a filter key here

4
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:11,070
which maps to the string
value of Sierra.

5
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:15,140
If you've ever used Instagram,
Sierra is the name of one of the filters

6
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:17,930
that you can apply to your
images to give it a cool effect.

7
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:22,250
To get down to this key value pair,
we need to start at the root JSONObject,

8
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:25,870
find the JSONObject with
the key of data, and

9
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:29,410
then down to the string value for
the key of filter.

10
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:31,590
Here's the path written out.

11
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:33,850
This one's pretty straightforward.

12
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:39,490
Root, JSONObject with key data, and then
get String value for the key filter.

13
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:42,310
Next, let's find the path
to get the website URL for

14
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:43,669
the thumbnail version of this image.

15
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:48,020
All right, for this one, I gotta scroll
around a little bit and look around.

16
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:50,581
And indeed, I see there's
the word thumbnail here, so

17
00:00:50,581 --> 00:00:53,500
that's probably the key I'm looking for.

18
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:56,875
After studying the response for a little
bit, I found the thumbnail here,

19
00:00:56,875 --> 00:01:00,318
along with other images for
this particular media file,

20
00:01:00,318 --> 00:01:05,248
including low resolution,
thumbnail, and standard resolution.

21
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:10,410
The path to get to this value
is to start at the root object,

22
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:16,390
then to go to the data JSONObject,
then find the images JSONObject.

23
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:18,430
Then we care about the key thumbnail,

24
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:22,510
which is a JSONObject with information
about the thumbnail image.

25
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:28,460
And lastly, we find the URL key, where
we can find the thumbnail image's path.

26
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:31,720
So back on the quiz,
here's what the path looks like.

27
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:36,510
Root, JSON object with key data,
JSON object with key images,

28
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:41,050
JSON object with key thumbnail, and
then get String value for the key url.

29
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:46,950
Now let's work on the last question,
finding the first hashtag for the image.

30
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:48,170
Looking at this response,

31
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:51,920
we see the tags list, which contains
the list of hashtags for the image.

32
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:57,480
Then we see the first and
only hashtag, which is hammocklife.

33
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:00,515
I wish I was living my
hammock life right now.

34
00:02:00,515 --> 00:02:04,120
Anyways, let's find the path
of this first hashtag.

35
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,630
We start at the root object as always,

36
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:12,490
then we go to the data JSONObject and
look for

37
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:17,150
the key tags, which maps to a JSON
array because of the square brackets.

38
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:20,565
Then we look at the first element
in the array, which is hammocklife.

39
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:24,210
And here's the path
that we just discussed.

40
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:26,650
Root JSONobject with key data,

41
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:31,290
JSON array with key tags, then look
at the first element in the array.

42
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:33,110
Hooray, great work with this quiz.
