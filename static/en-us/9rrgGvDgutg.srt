00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,099
So let's construct a table like this. In the first column, we'll consider different programs.

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:11,266
And I'm just going to label them p1 for the first program, p2 for the second program, and so on and so on.

3
00:00:11,267 --> 00:00:18,399
In the second column we'll then consider different cases of what halt can say with respect to that program,

4
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,566
when considering what happens if the program is run on itself.

5
00:00:22,567 --> 00:00:31,832
So for example, we might say that for P1, halt might say yes, and for P2 it might say no when given the program,

6
00:00:31,833 --> 00:00:34,566
and the program has an input.

7
00:00:34,567 --> 00:00:42,632
Now, what does that mean? So if halt says yes in the first line here, it would mean that program one stops

8
00:00:42,633 --> 00:00:51,266
when given program one as an input. And of course, similarly, if halt says no, it would mean that P2 goes into an infinite loop

9
00:00:51,267 --> 00:00:54,832
when given P2 or itself as an input.

10
00:00:54,833 --> 00:01:01,499
Now we're going to do a very quick quiz here, because what I would like you to think about here for P1 and P2,

11
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:07,899
what inverse halt, when run on that program, actually does. So what does inverse halt do when it's run on P1?

12
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:10,999
And what does inverse halt do when it's run on P2?

13
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,066
So does inverse halt, when run on P1, halt or go into an infinite loop?

14
00:01:15,067 --> 00:01:18,999
And does inverse halt, when run on P2, halt or go into an infinite loop?

15
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,133
So please check the one that is correct for each one.
