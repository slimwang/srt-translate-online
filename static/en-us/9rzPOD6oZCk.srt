00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
It turns out that if we could just build this chart correctly--

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
and that's not going to be easy, but it's going to within our power--

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
then we've solved parsing.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Let's say that our grammar has some special start symbol S.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
So goes to E, and then E could be many things.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
The state we really want to be in is this one.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I have seen everything. S goes to E, and there's nothing more. We are totally done.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I mentioned before that we have to augment all of our parse states with this starting add information.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Just to be a little more specific, I have seen S goes to E,

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
and there was no additional previous information.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Starting from zero tokens of input,

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I have seen enough to make the judgement S goes to E based on this input string.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:56,000
So if the input is T tokens long, we just look to see if S goes to E dot starting at zero

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
is in chart T.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
If it is, our input is in the language of the grammar.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
If it's not, our input is not.

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Parsing totally solved assuming we can build the chart,

18
00:01:09,000 --> 99:59:59,999
but building the chart is going to be tricky--tricky but possible.
