00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,159
We're going to use this difference of square pattern to help us simplify the

2
00:00:03,159 --> 00:00:07,644
binomial radicals we saw earlier, in the denominator. But before we do that,

3
00:00:07,644 --> 00:00:12,535
let's learn a new term, the term is conjugate. The conjugate of a binomial is

4
00:00:12,535 --> 00:00:17,775
the same exact binomial, with an opposite sign in between the two terms. So the

5
00:00:17,775 --> 00:00:22,874
conjugate of the root of 7 plus 2 would be the root of 7 minus 2. We just

6
00:00:22,874 --> 00:00:26,390
change the middle sign. What's so great about the conjugate is that if we

7
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:31,212
multiply a binomial with it's conjugate, we just get a number. We won't have

8
00:00:31,212 --> 00:00:35,216
any more radicals. For example, if we multiply these two binomials together,

9
00:00:35,216 --> 00:00:40,510
we'll just have a squared minus b squared. We square the root of 7 to get 7,

10
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:46,262
and we square the 2 to get 4, 7 minus 4 equals 3. So what do you think would be

11
00:00:46,262 --> 00:00:50,595
the conjugate of these binomials. List those conjugates here. And then I want

12
00:00:50,595 --> 00:00:54,793
you to multiply it, the binomial with it's conjugate, to get the product.
