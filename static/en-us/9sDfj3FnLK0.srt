1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:04,850
Great, you've learned how to package
applications in a container images.

2
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:08,160
Which means you can now use tools like
Docker to not only distribute them, but

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,740
run them on a large range of machine.

4
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:13,260
This unlocks the doors even
more advance automation.

5
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:17,540
Now you have the power to abstract
away the gory details of packaging and

6
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:20,870
running your application on
specific operating systems.

7
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:23,630
Now you can focus on shipping your
ideas and making your users happy.

8
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:26,360
But this is just the first step.

9
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,570
Until now we've been working
on a single machine.

10
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:30,440
But if we're limited
to a single machine,

11
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,820
we're not going to be able to meet
the demands of today's users.

12
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,050
So how can containers be coordinated,
distributed, and managed that scale?

13
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,732
And at a even more fundamental level.

14
00:00:39,732 --> 00:00:42,670
Should we even be talking about
running specific containers on

15
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:44,260
specific machines?

16
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:47,030
What's really important is that
our application itself is running,

17
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:50,061
delivering value and
being monitored and maintained.

18
00:00:50,061 --> 00:00:53,750
And to do that we'll be using
a platform called Kubernetes to manage

19
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:54,610
all that complexity.
