00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,210
Now that we've defined NP, and

2
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:05,530
defined what it means to be
verifiable in polynomial time,

3
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:08,790
I want you to apply this knowledge to
decide if several problems are in NP.

4
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:11,990
First, is a given graph connected?

5
00:00:13,035 --> 00:00:18,075
Second, does a graph have a set of
K vertices with no edges between?

6
00:00:18,075 --> 00:00:19,705
This is called
the independent set problem.

7
00:00:20,795 --> 00:00:24,385
And lastly, will a Turing Machine
accept exactly one string?
