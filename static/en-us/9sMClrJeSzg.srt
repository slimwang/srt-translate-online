1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,270
Now that we talked about the detail of optimization problems

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:06,080
versus decision problems, we are ready to dive in.

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:11,890
So how can we show that a problem is intractable?

4
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:14,880
We already know how to show that a problem is tractable.

5
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,010
We just have to find a polynomial time algorithm for it.

6
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:21,860
But how do we find out if the problem is intractable?

7
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:24,900
And there's actually two different ways we could go about this.

8
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:29,190
The first way we could try to show intractability is by gathering evidence.

9
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:34,880
What I mean by gathering evidence is this, we've already found out that Alice, Bob, and Carol

10
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:39,960
were working on problems for which they weren't able to find a polynomial time algorithm,

11
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:44,790
but all of their problems were connected, so if one of them managed to find a solution

12
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:50,340
then all of their problems will be tractable, so one way we could be gathering evidence is

13
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:54,330
if we just find more people working on more hard problems,

14
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:57,060
and of course all of them are very smart people.

15
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:02,220
If we could find more and more people who are also very smart working on very tough problems,

16
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:07,310
but also no one of them finds a polynomial time algorithm.

17
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:11,620
We could basically be saying, look, there are so many people who have looked at this problem,

18
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:18,190
none of them has found out that the problem is tractable, so we think it must be intractable.

19
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:21,410
Another way to go about this would be a mathematical proof.

20
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:27,050
And what a mathematical proof would have to show is that no matter what kind of intricate,

21
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:32,020
ingenious, sophisticated, complex algorithm we use for a problem,

22
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:36,380
that algorithm will still need exponential time to solve the problem.

23
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:40,640
So, what I would like you to think about for our next quiz is

24
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,220
the advantages and disadvantages of each of these approaches here.

25
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:46,090
And I would like you to think about two things.

26
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:50,870
First of all, which of these approaches is probably easier to accomplish?

27
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:56,090
And secondly, which of these two approaches here would you find more convincing

28
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:58,390
to show that a problem is intractable?

29
00:01:58,390 --> 99:59:59,999
So please give me your two answers in these bubbles.
