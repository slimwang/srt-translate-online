1
00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:04,765
For this problem, x would equal positive 1. Nice effort if you got this one

2
00:00:04,765 --> 00:00:09,123
correct. To start solving this equation, we want to isolate the radical on one

3
00:00:09,123 --> 00:00:14,188
side, so we need to get rid of the subtraction of 1 here. We add 1 to both

4
00:00:14,188 --> 00:00:20,238
sides of the equation to get the 4th root of 3x minus 2 equals 1. We want to

5
00:00:20,238 --> 00:00:25,015
undo this 4th root. So we raise both sides of the equation to the 4th power.

6
00:00:25,015 --> 00:00:29,735
This leaves us with 3x minus 2 on the left, and 1 to the 4th, or just 1 on the

7
00:00:29,735 --> 00:00:35,878
right. We add 2 to both sides of the equation to get 3x equals positive 3. And

8
00:00:35,878 --> 00:00:41,130
finally, to get x by itself, we divide by the coefficient 3 to get x equals 1.

9
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:45,934
To be sure this is correct, we check this in the original equation. We

10
00:00:45,934 --> 00:00:50,750
substitute x with the value of positive 1, and then try and check. Here, we'll

11
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:55,668
get a 4th root, a positive 1. And we know the 4th root of 1 is just 1. Then we

12
00:00:55,668 --> 00:01:00,076
subtract to get 0 equals 0. So yes, this answer checks, which means this is our

13
00:01:00,076 --> 00:01:01,230
solution.
