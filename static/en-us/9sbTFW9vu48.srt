1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,070
Things are a little trickier than this,
however.

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:06,620
It is occasionally necessary, even when
modeling external visible behavior of

3
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:10,020
a device, to invent some
additional internal states.

4
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:13,290
The most common example are timers,
such as what we saw earlier.

5
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:15,950
A user can't really understand
how a clock radio works

6
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:19,580
without appreciating that there
are several internal timers working.

7
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:23,220
See if you can come up with a list
of what internal timers are there.

8
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:24,740
Okay, what timers do you have?

9
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:28,240
>> So,
the first one is the snooze timer.

10
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:33,385
So as soon as you hit the snooze button,
then in 10 minutes,

11
00:00:33,385 --> 00:00:37,318
the-
>> Times up to 10 minutes, sure.

12
00:00:37,318 --> 00:00:38,700
What else?

13
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,790
>> There is an alarm time.

14
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:45,492
I think, or you know,
the alarms not going to go on forever.

15
00:00:45,492 --> 00:00:50,840
So there's like an internal, isnâ€™t there
a state for, our alarm has started and

16
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:54,470
then at some point the alarm needs to
go off so its not playing forever.

17
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:58,140
>> So, recall the original requirements
in which we said that the alarm can only

18
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:01,620
go for an hour, and so there has to be
a timer to time up to that one hour.

19
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:03,630
>> Okay.
What else?

20
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:07,810
>> For the sleep, internally
when you are playing music and

21
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:09,160
you have your sleep timer set.

22
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,840
Is there something that kicks off?

23
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,500
Usually you press sleep on,
right, or something like that?

24
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:19,320
And then it'll run until it meets
the time you set for when the-

25
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:25,470
>> Well if you set the sleep timer.

26
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:29,040
Then when you move your slide switch or

27
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:34,010
mode switch into radio or
alarm, I guess into radio,

28
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:40,080
it's going to, normally if you hadn't
set the sleep time, it would go off.

29
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,070
You wouldn't be hearing any radio.

30
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:45,780
So, if you're sitting there and
move it to on, radio comes on.

31
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:46,560
>> Okay.

32
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,789
>> But if you move it to radio.

33
00:01:51,789 --> 00:01:53,700
>> Music
>> Music, music.

34
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:54,720
Okay, it would normally go off.

35
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:59,430
But if you have the sleep timer set,
it goes off after that amount of time.

36
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:03,740
>> And then, another internal
timer is for your sleep timer.

37
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:08,192
I guess I want to make sure I understand
correctly how the sleep timer,

38
00:02:08,192 --> 00:02:10,360
like how it functionally works.

39
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:15,390
So you press the sleep time, and
that's like, say you want to play for

40
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:17,190
30 minutes before it goes off.

41
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:24,720
So to activate that, what mode do you
need to be in to start your sleep timer?

42
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,530
>> Okay, so
there's two things going on here.

43
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:31,180
Setting the amount of time
before the radio goes off and

44
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:40,410
then actually causing that to happen at
night when you're ready to go to sleep.

45
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:45,420
So, we know how to set the time
by hitting the sleep button and

46
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:47,520
then setting some time there.

47
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,430
Now, it turns out on this
particular clock radio,

48
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:55,210
we've seen that the possibilities
are 12 hours and there's 60 minutes.

49
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:58,430
But, this particular clock radio,
you can only set it for,

50
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:00,950
I believe, up to an hour.

51
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:01,530
>> Okay.

52
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:04,640
>> So, you're really just
setting the minutes part of it.

53
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,550
And, I haven't personally tried
this feature out, so I don't

54
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:15,200
what the internal logic does in the
situation where you say three hours and

55
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,760
twenty minutes, even though it only
can do this sleeping for an hour.

56
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:24,920
So, that's one thing that as an actual
developer, we'd have to decide upon.

57
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:27,290
>> Okay.
>> Then there's the question of how,

58
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:31,380
when you're going to bed at night,
this thing works, and what it is,

59
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:36,210
is if you have set the sleep time,
if it's got an actual value

60
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:40,950
you've put in there,
when you move the mode switch into

61
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:45,360
radio you would normally
expect not to hear anything.

62
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,960
But if you've got the sleep time
set then you would actually expect

63
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:52,270
the radio to continue playing
until that sleep time expires.

64
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:52,930
>> Okay.

65
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:55,540
So then, I guess,
just the internal timer for that.

66
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:57,820
So as soon as you move
it into that mode,

67
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:00,190
it goes up until you're
to that threshold.

68
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:01,060
>> Right.

69
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:05,230
>> And then lastly,
we have this internal clock timer for

70
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:07,600
your actual display clock.

71
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:12,630
>> So yeah, we're clocking
the minutes and hours as they go by,

72
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:16,325
and so there has to be some timer
to do that particular thing.

73
00:04:16,325 --> 00:04:19,411
So we can add these timers and
sub-machines,

74
00:04:19,411 --> 00:04:22,220
and when we do the results,
this is what you see here.
