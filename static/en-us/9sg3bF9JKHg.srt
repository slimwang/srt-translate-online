00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:01,870
Now it's time to
download the sample code

2
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:03,680
we'll use in the rest of this lesson.

3
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:05,350
Download controllersample.zip

4
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:07,600
by following the link in
the instructor notes.

5
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,540
Next, unzip it and
import it into Android Studio.

6
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:12,530
And finally, run it on an emulator.

7
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:13,410
Once the game is running,

8
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:16,510
you can steer the ship using
the arrow keys on your keyboard.

9
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:19,080
And you can fire the lasers
with the space bar.

10
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,200
The first time you press one of
these keys, your ship will appear.

11
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,270
If you need more details
on any of these steps,

00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:26,420

lesson first.
