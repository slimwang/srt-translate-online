00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:04,830
That just about covers the basics of
conditionals and logical operators.

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:07,919
But we've got a couple more
things we want to show you first.

3
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:10,960
>> For the rest of this lesson, we'll
focus on some more advanced aspects of

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,480
working with conditional statements.

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,190
This includes things like truthy and
falsey values, the ternary operator and

6
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:16,830
the switch statement.
