1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,090
So I think that there is a special function that's

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:05,730
only for pickles fields, but I can't remember what it

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:09,080
was. Maybe we should, copy and paste that error into

4
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:11,600
Google and see if it tells us what that error is?

5
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:14,270
>> Formula for pickless field.

6
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:18,750
>> Right here, awesome,. Ellen Williams. So, she

7
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:20,640
also is writing an if statement that's using

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,460
pickless values. And so you can see here, if is pick val, which is the function

9
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:27,760
that you need to use, that's the, stage name

10
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,090
is the field, and then pending is probably the

11
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:33,960
pickless value. So if the stage name is pending,

12
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,550
do this. So we need to use that also.

13
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:38,372
>> It's funny that she was dealing with stages, too.

14
00:00:38,372 --> 00:00:39,641
[LAUGH]

15
00:00:39,641 --> 00:00:39,641
>>

16
00:00:39,641 --> 00:00:41,486
[INAUDIBLE]

17
00:00:41,486 --> 00:00:46,060
>> So let's grab from the functions on the right, and over here.

18
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:46,813
>> Uh-huh.

19
00:00:46,813 --> 00:00:50,000
>> We can grab text. ISPICVAL.

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:50,270
>> Yep. ISPICVAL.

21
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:50,640
>> There it is.

22
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,010
>> Okay and where to do we want to put this if?

23
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:55,850
>> In that first, yeah, over the Ticket Type VIP.

24
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:58,840
>> Okay, then like, pick this field.

25
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:03,440
It's going to be ticket type, and the text is VIP.

26
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:07,675
>> Yep. Alright, let's check the syntax now. Awesome.

27
00:01:07,675 --> 00:01:11,860
>> That's cool. Alright. This formula's a bit of a

28
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:15,040
beast. I would not have come up with it by myself.

29
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,210
But I guess Google was a good, good tool. Is

30
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:20,400
that something you find yourself doing a lot when you're developing?

31
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,680
>> yeah. I mean, because, we're not supposed to remember

32
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,010
everything. And so, definitely whenever I run into errors, I'll Google

33
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:28,310
the error itself because a lot of people have ran into

34
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:31,200
the same things before. There's also in the upper right hand corner

35
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:36,210
these Quick Tips for getting started, seeing samples, more examples. I mean,

36
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:39,370
there's a lot of tools available if you are new to formulas.

37
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:39,750
>> Cool.
