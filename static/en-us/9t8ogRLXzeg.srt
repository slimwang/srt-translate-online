1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:04,675
There is sort of a golden rule
when it comes to founding,

2
00:00:04,675 --> 00:00:08,260
co-founding, partner founding companies.

3
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:12,390
One, obviously is easy because all
decisions rest with one person.

4
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:16,630
Two, is good and
powerful because it's a conversation.

5
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:19,740
Three, is probably the limit.

6
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:23,170
I don't know that I would ever get
involved in a business where there was

7
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:27,110
more than three top partners
who are making decisions.

8
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:31,770
The reason for that is,
three people form a very strong axis.

9
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:34,650
You have lots of strengths
on the table and

10
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:36,920
all the weaknesses
typically are covered.

11
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:39,960
And you won't ever have
one person dominating,

12
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,530
if you do then it's actually a sole
proprietor with two lackeys.

13
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:47,019
So we won't get into that but
a three co-founder business I found,

14
00:00:47,019 --> 00:00:49,408
in my experience to be very strong.

15
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:53,010
One of the businesses I was part of,

16
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:56,830
I was one of three co-founders and
we were very powerful in what were doing

17
00:00:56,830 --> 00:01:00,860
because we each brought a different
skill set to the table, and a different

18
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:04,819
temperament given changing environments
and scenarios that were playing out.

19
00:01:04,819 --> 00:01:09,100
So, as those things played
out we each stepped up

20
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:11,740
in the given situation with
our skills and overcame them.
