1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So, we've seen that it's easy to figure out the solution to a game

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
if there's a dominant strategy or if there's a Pareto-optimal equilibrium.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Now let's look at a harder game for which such solutions don't exist.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
This game is called Two Finger Morra,

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
and it's a betting game, and we're going to show a simplified version of it.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Again, we have a simple 4-state outcome matrix,

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and there are 2 players called even and odd.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
And they both simultaneously show either

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
1 or 2 fingers.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
And then if the result of the total number of fingers is even,

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:44,000
then the even player wins that many dollars from the odd player.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
And if the total number of fingers is odd,

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
then the odd player wins that number of dollars from the even player.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
So, if 1 and 1 is 2, so that's even,

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:04,000
so even gets +2, and we won't bother writing odd getting -2

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
because it's a zero-sum game, and it will always be the opposite.

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Similarly, 2 and 2 is 4,

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
so even gets +4 and odd gets -4.

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
2 and 1 is 3, so even loses 3 dollars

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
and pays it to odd and similarly up here.

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Now, there's no dominant strategy, and it seems kind of tricky

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
to figure out what the right strategy is.

23
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
We're going to need more complicated techniques,

24
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
and it turns out that there is no single move

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
that's the best strategy for either player.

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
But there is what's called a mixed strategy,

27
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
so a single strategy of always playing one or the other

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
is called a pure strategy, and a mixed strategy

29
00:01:47,000 --> 99:59:59,999
is when you have a probability distribution over the possible moves.
