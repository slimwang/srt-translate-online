00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Here is a really tricky quiz. Let's look at the robot motion again.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Say I change the last measurement from 2 down to 1.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
You might remember the robot poses were -3, 2, and 5.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Before that modification the landmark position was 7, but a 1 doesn't really add up.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
A 1 suggests I might be at a different distance to the 7 than the 5 over here

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
that comes from this side.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Here is my quiz.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
First, I want you to know if I make this modification what is the effect on x2?

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Will the estimate be smaller than 5?

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
That is, we shrink the robot path a little bit?

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Will it be exactly equal to 5 like before?

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Or will it be larger than 5? Check exactly 1 of the three boxes.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I also want to know what is the effect on x0.

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Will it be smaller than -3, equals -3, or larger than -3.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
This is a completely nontrivial quiz.

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
It takes really some thinking.

17
00:00:59,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Invest in thinking, and you can even go back and try it out.
