00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:04,050
When you create an application
that uses Location Services,

2
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:06,630
there are a number of steps
that you'll typically follow.

3
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:08,220
I'm going to list the six steps here.

4
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:11,110
And you're going to have to fill in
the blanks as to what you're going to do

5
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:11,616
in each step.

6
00:00:11,616 --> 00:00:12,848
The first step is,

7
00:00:12,848 --> 00:00:18,170
you're going to create a something
that uses the Location Services API.

8
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:19,770
Think about what that is.

9
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:22,810
The second step is that you're
going to extend your activity

10
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:24,400
with the number of callbacks.

11
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,430
What do you think those
callbacks might be?

12
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:29,880
The third step is that you
then extend your activity

13
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:33,410
with a particular listener in
case the connection fails.

14
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:35,550
Do you remember what that listener is?

15
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:39,320
The fourth step will be that you
continue to extend your activity and

16
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,390
you extend it with another listener.

17
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:44,550
This time it's a listener for
location updates.

18
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:46,715
Again, think about what that is.

19
00:00:46,715 --> 00:00:49,035
The fifth step is,
after you've connected,

20
00:00:49,035 --> 00:00:53,475
there's something will wait for
the something callback.

21
00:00:53,475 --> 00:00:56,395
What do you think that is and what
callback do you think it's waiting for?

22
00:00:56,395 --> 00:01:01,762
And then finally, in this callback,
you'll set up something, and

23
00:01:01,762 --> 00:01:05,622
it's another callback, and in this you
can capture your location information.

24
00:01:06,632 --> 00:01:09,252
These are all the steps that
you'll typically follow.

25
00:01:09,252 --> 00:01:10,542
Can you fill in the blanks?
