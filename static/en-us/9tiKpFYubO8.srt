00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:02,480
So far I've used the term pixel.

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:06,240
Let's try to understand what that pixel is in the context of an image.

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,510
A pixel, or a picture element, is basically the element that

4
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:13,870
contains the light intensity at some location within that image.

5
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:16,430
In this case i and j of that image.

6
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:19,510
So for example, what we're really interested in is now we have the scope and

7
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:23,570
the boundary of this image here, which is known by its width and height.

8
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:27,270
But I also want to know within it at any location here what would

9
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:30,070
be various intensities within that image?

10
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:34,740
And I want to be able to do this for all aspects or all parts of this image.

11
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:40,000
So for example at the ith and the jth index, this is the val, this is the pixel.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,830
What would be the intensity value at that location?

13
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:46,360
In essence, a computational aspect of all of this is,

14
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:50,048
that I want to be able to create either a discrete representation or

15
00:00:50,048 --> 00:00:54,240
a continuous representation that I can now, by giving it values of i and j,

16
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:57,540
give it some numeric value of what this image would be.

17
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:01,290
Because once I get this numerical value, I could use it for

18
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:02,880
various types of computational steps.
