When working together, we use the general formula 1 over a plus 1 over b equals

2
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:10,203
1 over x. This is one job completed in a hours plus one job completed in b

3
00:00:10,203 --> 00:00:15,910
hours equals 1 divided by x. The total time it takes for two things, or people

4
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:20,725
to complete that job together. But not everything has to work together.

5
00:00:20,725 --> 00:00:24,257
Sometimes things can work against each other. So, what new equation do you

6
00:00:24,257 --> 00:00:27,460
think we could write here and use to help us problem solve?
