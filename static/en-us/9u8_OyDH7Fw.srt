A static variable is a variable that belongs to a class but not to any object

2
00:00:04,466 --> 00:00:11,108
in that class. They're even less common than static methods. You're most likely

3
00:00:11,108 --> 00:00:17,082
to see them for constants. For example the math class defines a static variable

4
00:00:17,082 --> 00:00:22,624
called PI. Can see it's a static, can see it's a constant because it's declared

5
00:00:22,624 --> 00:00:29,301
as final and it's the value of PI. If you ever need to use it, you would call

6
00:00:29,301 --> 00:00:34,762
it as Math.Pi. Here is another example, there is a class that defines a

7
00:00:34,762 --> 00:00:39,920
variable called out. And again, it's static. What do you think? Which class

8
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,589
does this? I copied this declaration from the source code of one of the Java

9
00:00:43,589 --> 00:00:47,794
classes. Tell me which one.
