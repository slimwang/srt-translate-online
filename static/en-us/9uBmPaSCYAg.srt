00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,170
Okay, let's see if you understand
the concept of pennants, and

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:03,950
how pennants work.

3
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:08,490
Here are two pennants, one rooted at a,
and another rooted at e.

4
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:11,670
Here's my question,
if we try to combine these two pennants,

5
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:13,780
what will the outcome be?

6
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:17,410
Is it this thing, this thing,
either of the above, or none?

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:18,980
Choose one.
