1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:02,260
Another key point is that you don't need any

2
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:05,160
extensive knowledge of biology or genetics to take this course.

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:07,570
>> The Udacity team has worked really hard to

4
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:10,520
make sure that this class is accessible for everyone.

5
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:13,150
Ideally, you'll have some exposure to high school biology

6
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:16,740
but event that's not necessary. Now if you need resources

7
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:18,150
to help you out where you're in the course,

8
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:20,400
there are two main places for you to look. The

9
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,170
first is in the section titled Instructors' Notes. And

10
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:26,150
that's where we as your instructors will post relevant information

11
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:29,090
to the concepts and topics that you see in the videos. The

12
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:32,470
other important section is called Discussion Forums. And this is where you

13
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:36,480
and your fellow classmates can actually post links to topics, or questions

14
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,390
that you want to talk more about. For example, there is a discussion forum

15
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:43,080
on this page entitled the meaning of life. And I've put a

16
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:46,680
permanent link to it in the instructor's notes on this page. Now

17
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,440
I want you to click on that link and go see what

18
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:49,630
it says because you're going to need

19
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:52,380
the information to answer the following question.

20
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:55,440
What is the answer to life, the universe, and everything?
