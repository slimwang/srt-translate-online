00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:02,790
Here's a scenario for you to consider.

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:06,540
The flex box is a very useful tool for
responsive design.

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:12,190
It's a CSS display property that resizes
elements, and reflows them on the page.

4
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:15,460
For instance, imagine you've got
these three elements on a page and

5
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:18,500
then the user resizes
the screen to become larger.

6
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:21,430
As a result,
the elements themselves become larger.

7
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:25,562
In this scenario, which of the following
processes does the browser perform to

8
00:00:25,562 --> 00:00:26,679
render the new page?

9
00:00:26,679 --> 00:00:31,114
Does the browser perform style,
layout, paint, or composite?

10
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:32,280
Check all that apply.
