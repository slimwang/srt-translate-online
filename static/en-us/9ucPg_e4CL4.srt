1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The answer is we're transitioning from this state to this state.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
We get a reward of zero in the old state.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Then we get the Q value of 100 minus the Q value of zero,

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
and the discount rate is 90.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
That's a difference of 90.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Then the alpha, the learning rate, is 1/2. That gives us 45.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
We apply that 45 to the state action pair.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
We were in this state, and we executed the action north,

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
so the 45 goes here.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Notice it doesn't go over here.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
We did end up going to the east, but we didn't execute the action of going to the east.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 99:59:59,999
All the other actions remain unchanged.
