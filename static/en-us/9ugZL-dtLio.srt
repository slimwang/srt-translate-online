1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:04,000
We were so obsessed with the little
things that didn't matter

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,760
like the of a specific button or

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:14,120
the specific experience when the user
is clicking back but is not logged in.

4
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:21,910
All kinds of side things that won't move
the needle and doesn't really matter.

5
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:26,220
And it's very important to make sure
that the experience is perfect and

6
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:29,580
you're nailing it on the first time but

7
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:33,340
you need to make sure that the product
is right and not the buttons.

8
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:36,580
Need to make sure the general flow and

9
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:40,430
the problem that is being solved
with your product is right, and

10
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:45,460
not the specific background color or
the perfect logo or

11
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:50,100
the responsiveness of the website
because that's optimisation.

12
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:51,570
You do that in the AB testing part.

13
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:56,500
You do that after you nail your MVP but
we did that before we

14
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:01,190
met them MVP and we waited a lot of
time on that and I wish we hadn't.

15
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:01,940
It will not happen again.
