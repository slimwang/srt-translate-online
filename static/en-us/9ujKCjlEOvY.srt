1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,650
Now that we've covered exponential
smoothing models in detail, let's begin

2
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:08,220
construction on a model to forecast
bookings for Bates Hotel using Alteryx.

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:11,620
We'll begin by dragging and dropping
an Input Data tool onto the canvas and

4
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:14,185
loading in the Bookings xlsx.

5
00:00:14,185 --> 00:00:17,009
We'll be using this data to forecast
the next six months of room bookings.

6
00:00:17,009 --> 00:00:21,645

7
00:00:21,645 --> 00:00:24,400
Next, bring in a Record ID tool.

8
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,950
All this does is number our records,

9
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:29,150
but doing this will allow us to
filter out a holdout sample.

10
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:32,170
We'll get more in depth on holdout
samples later in the course.

11
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:36,413
For now, we'll filter out the last six
records in our time series to use as

12
00:00:36,413 --> 00:00:40,657
the holdout sample, by setting our
filter to include records less than or

13
00:00:40,657 --> 00:00:42,241
equal to RecordID 114.

14
00:00:42,241 --> 00:00:46,297
Now that we've prepared our time series
data for model construction, we can take

15
00:00:46,297 --> 00:00:49,939
a look at the time series plots to
determine how we should apply our trend,

16
00:00:49,939 --> 00:00:53,560
seasonal and error components
in our model calculation.

17
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:56,760
We'll connect a Record ID
tool to a TS Plot tool.

18
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:01,050
In the TS Plot tool configuration, we'll
select Bookings as the target field,

19
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:06,100
Monthly for our target field frequency,
and Time series plot as our plot type.

20
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:10,190
Now, add a Browse tool to the
interactive node of the TS Plot tool.

21
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:12,040
You can do this by
right-clicking on the tool and

22
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:14,810
selecting Add Browse After
(Interactive).

23
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:15,280
Now hit Run.

24
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:20,430
The interactive output for the TS Plot
shows us a vast amount of information.

25
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:23,040
Let's take a look at
the decomposition plot.

26
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,270
From this plot, we can tell our
trend moves in a linear fashion,

27
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:28,920
suggesting applying trend additively.

28
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,950
The seasonality within our time series
data looks to be about the same

29
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:32,850
every year.

30
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:33,750
But is it?

31
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:36,558
The seasonal portion of our
decomposition plot allows us to that

32
00:01:36,558 --> 00:01:38,260
confirm is this is true.

33
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:40,510
Looking at the seasonal peaks and
valleys,

34
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:44,180
we can see that seasonality increases
in volume each seasonal period.

35
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:47,200
This suggests applying seasonality
in a multiplicative manner.

36
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:50,675
Lastly, our remainder, or error,

37
00:01:50,675 --> 00:01:54,080
shows changing variance as
the time series moves along.

38
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,940
This means we should use
error multiplicatively.

39
00:01:56,940 --> 00:02:00,390
The next step after determining
the fashion of how to apply our trend,

40
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:05,360
seasonal, and error components, will
be to build a model using the ETS tool.

41
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,130
Let's drag and
drop an ETS tool onto the canvas.

42
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:12,720
We'll name our model MAM, to show how
we're applying the different components.

43
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,540
Next, select Bookings as
the target field, and

44
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:17,410
Monthly as target field frequency.

45
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:22,210
On the Model type tab, we can set
the different component types.

46
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:27,180
Set Error to Multiplicative, Trend to
Additive, Trend dampening to No, and

47
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,690
Seasonal type to Multiplicative.

48
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,140
On the Other options tab, let's input 6
as the number of periods to include in

49
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:38,190
the forecast, and set the series
starting point to 2006 period one.

50
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:43,570
Let's also test if trend dampening will
have a positive effect on our model.

51
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:48,150
So, copy and
paste the ETS tool on the canvas, and

52
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:51,520
make sure the configuration is
the same as our first ETS model.

53
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,790
Except now,
set Trend dampening to Yes, and

54
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:56,920
also make sure to add
dampened to the model name so

55
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:59,258
we can tell the difference when
referencing the final output.

56
00:02:59,258 --> 00:03:03,409
Our alpha, or smoothing value
is calculated automatically by

57
00:03:03,409 --> 00:03:09,030
Alteryx to maximize error reduction,
so we'll not have to set this.

58
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:14,070
Before we hit Run, auto-browse to
the R or report node of the ETS tools.

59
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:17,100
We can click on the Play
button to build our models.

60
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:20,554
The output from our ETS tool will
show us important information such as

61
00:03:20,554 --> 00:03:26,260
in-sample error measures, information
criteria, and the selected alpha value.

62
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:28,620
We'll discuss how to compare,
forecast, and

63
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:30,890
visualize these results in lesson four.

64
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:32,306
For now, save this workflow,

65
00:03:32,306 --> 00:03:34,984
as we will come back to reference
it later on in the course.

66
00:03:34,984 --> 00:03:36,149
