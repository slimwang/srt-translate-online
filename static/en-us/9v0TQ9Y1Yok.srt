1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:03,253
The real kind of relationship that
you have with the co-founder,

2
00:00:03,253 --> 00:00:06,000
is very similar to the relationship
that you have with your partner.

3
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:09,110
Your for them.

4
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:11,300
You can say everything to them.

5
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:17,500
You can be happy, and cry,
and be upset and furious.

6
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:22,890
And share what you really are, and
what you really feel with them.

7
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:26,900
And they will accept it,
and they will support you.

8
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:31,850
It sounds very sentimental and
very weird, but that I believe,

9
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:36,220
that's the secret of a great
partnership between partners.

10
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:38,230
Being there for each other.

11
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:44,208
Understanding what's your partner's
strengths and weaknesses,

12
00:00:44,208 --> 00:00:49,780
and really becoming a stronger unit,
a stronger combination.
