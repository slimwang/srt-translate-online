1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:02,190
Looking at this plot, we can see that we have

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:05,290
some funky outliers in here. And down here is the bulk

3
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:08,450
of our data. To determine good x and y limits for

4
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:12,300
our axis, we can look at 95th percentile, using the Quantile

5
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:15,718
command. This will let us see the ninety-fifth percentile of

6
00:00:15,718 --> 00:00:18,890
www_likes_received. And the ninety-fifth percentile

7
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:20,800
of likes received. And hopefully, we

8
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,230
should get rid of some of these points. To do that,

9
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:25,920
I'll use the x lim layer and the y lim layer.

10
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,240
We'll pass zero as the lower bound for x lim, and

11
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:32,689
for the upper limit, we'll use the ninety-fifth percent quantile for

12
00:00:32,689 --> 00:00:36,600
the ww likes received. Similarly, for likes received, we'll use the

13
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,890
same sort of syntax and just replace the variable. Zero will

14
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:42,910
be our lower bound, and the ninety fifth percentile for likes

15
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:45,980
received will be our upper bound. When I run this code,

16
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:48,330
we're in effect zooming in on that lower portion of the

17
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:50,990
graph that we had over here. The slope of the line of

18
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:54,580
best fit through these points is the correlation. And, we can

19
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:57,740
even add to the plot by using some code. We do

20
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:00,230
that by adding a smoother, and setting the method to a

21
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:03,140
linear model or lm. Notice too that I also colored it

22
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:05,610
red so that we could see it through the black points.

23
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:10,140
Let's quantify this relationship with a number. So what's the correlation

24
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,540
between our two variables? I don't want you to have to

25
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:16,080
subset the data, so just include all the data points and

26
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,890
then round your answer to three decimal places.
