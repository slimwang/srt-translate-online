1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,176
Honeypot can be low or high interaction.

2
00:00:03,176 --> 00:00:07,981
A low interaction honeypot typically,
emulates some network services,

3
00:00:07,981 --> 00:00:09,515
such as the web server.

4
00:00:09,515 --> 00:00:13,009
For example,
you can speak the HTTP protocol.

5
00:00:13,009 --> 00:00:16,132
On the other hand,
it is not a full version of the service.

6
00:00:16,132 --> 00:00:20,971
For example, the emulated web server
does not have all the web content and

7
00:00:20,971 --> 00:00:23,310
server side programs.

8
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:28,150
A low interaction honeypot is typically
sufficient to detect network skin and

9
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:31,160
probe and imminent attacks.

10
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:35,530
On the other hand, a sophisticated
attacker may realize that

11
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:40,370
these services are not full version and
probably are not real.

12
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:46,050
A high interaction honeypot, essentially
replicates what what a real server or

13
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:51,230
work station has in terms of operating
systems, services and applications.

14
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:53,800
In other words,
they look really realistic and

15
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:58,420
they can be deployed alongside with
the real servers and work stations.

16
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:03,820
Since a high induction honeypot mimics a
real server and workstation, an attacker

17
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:08,340
may be attacking it for a long time
without knowing it is a honeypot.

18
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:11,360
Therefore, we can learn
more about the attacks.

19
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,490
On the other hand, it is also quite
challenging to make a honeypot

20
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:18,100
look like a real server and workstation.

21
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:21,550
For example,
we must emulate user activities and

22
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:25,120
never traffic on honeypot and
this requires

23
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:29,090
a significant amount of programming
effort as well as data storage.
