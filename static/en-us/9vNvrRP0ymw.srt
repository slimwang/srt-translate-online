1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Of the 3 paths on the frontier, we have ones

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
with a cost of 146, 140, and 118.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
And that's the cheapest, so this one gets expanded.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
We take it off the frontier, move it to explored,

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
add in its successors. In this case it's only 1.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:29,000
And that has a path total of 229.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Which path do we expand next?

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Well, we've got 146, 140, and 229

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
So 140 is the lowest.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Take it off the frontier. Put it on explored.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Add in this path

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
for a total cost of 220.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
And this path for a total cost of 239.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 99:59:59,999
And now the question is, which path do we expand next?
