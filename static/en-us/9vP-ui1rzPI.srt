00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:04,380
Okay, so I've gone ahead and pulled up a meme of myself.

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:07,660
And let's analyze the way this text is drawn.

3
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:11,860
Memes tend to use white text that is outlined in black.

4
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:15,810
This makes it easy to read the text no matter what background it's over.

5
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:18,820
So in this case, the like here is on top of a light background, but

6
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:21,110
we can read it really easily because of the black outline.

7
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:24,510
And then down here, over my dark shirt because the letters have

8
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:28,270
white fills inside they're easily legible there too.

9
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:31,970
So this is a nice strategy for making sure that text is always legible.

10
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:36,410
The way this is accomplished is with a mix of fill and stroke text.

11
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:39,470
To the scripts I've added this method, stroke text.

12
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:43,500
Which is going to draw the string hello udacity.

13
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,540
And it's going to put it at the point 50, 10.

14
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:48,320
Now, note here that this 50 is going to be,

15
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,320
in the case of this text, the lower left-hand corner of the text.

16
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:52,971
So, if this were 0,

17
00:00:52,971 --> 00:00:56,970
0 we wouldn't be able to see the text because the lower left-hand corner

18
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:59,780
would be at zero and the rest of the text wouldn't be above the page.

19
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:01,630
So that's just something to know.

20
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:03,930
Let's go ahead and see what happens when we call this method.

21
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:06,170
Come over here and hit Refresh.

22
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:09,605
And we can see that we now have a hello udacity written in

23
00:01:09,605 --> 00:01:14,326
the same green color that we set earlier drawn at the position 50, 10.

24
00:01:14,326 --> 00:01:18,450
This string here could be any string and we can use JavaScript to set it.

25
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:20,110
We could also use fillText instead.

26
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:22,570
I'll go ahead and save that.

27
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:24,030
Now we've got fillText.

28
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:26,730
I'll come over here and hit refresh, and

29
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:31,110
we've got hello udacity written in the same blue color that we set here.

30
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:34,450
In addition to letting us decide what strings to draw on the page and

31
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:38,310
where to draw them, the Canvas 2D context allows us to set a lot of

32
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:42,890
other options, like for instance, font size, font style, and line width.

33
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:44,660
Check the instructor notes for more information.
