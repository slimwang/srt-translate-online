00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
We had a question from Bonnie Monson on classes

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
and what they are, and classes are part of something called

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
object-oriented programming.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
It's a really big topic.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
You could easily spend an entire course or 2 or 3

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
on just object-oriented programming.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Steve just recommended you look at the docs.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
We'll link to the docs.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
A lot of people weren't satisfied with that.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
There's really not any way for us to deal with

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
object-oriented programming in any kind of complete way in this course.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Basically, a class is a way to organize

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
variables, functions, and other pieces of data

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
in Python or another object-oriented programming language

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
such that you can pass them around and that you have

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
different spaces of names so that you don't have

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
multiple variables with the same name conflicting with each other.

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
There is a lot more to it, but we don't think that we're going to have to

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
deal with that that much, and you shouldn't have to know too much about it.

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Again, we're going to link to the docs.

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
If you really want to know about it, I would recommend reading them.

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
They're not too bad.

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
They might be beyond some of you depending on what your background is,

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
but we're hopefully going to be offering some more material on that

25
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
in future courses, so if you'd like to know more about that,

26
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'd recommend sticking around for that.
