1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,220
Now let's look at another whole concept.

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:06,250
And that is the use of a CMOS sensor.

3
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:10,910
CMOS stands for Complimentary Metal Oxide Semiconductor.

4
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:15,700
again, has a lot of things that it has learned from CCD.

5
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:17,680
But a CMOS, of course, is a little cheaper.

6
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,950
And it's something which actually you will be, you're using all the time

7
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:24,129
because most of the cameras, the small cameras that you see and in fact,

8
00:00:24,129 --> 00:00:29,700
in the high end cameras, now all move to using CMOS sensors as opposed to CCDs.

9
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:34,100
Here are a few interesting differences between CCDs verses CMOS sensors.

10
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:35,030
One thing to note is,

11
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:39,010
of course, as we talked about before, there are these Bayer patterns.

12
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:42,530
But ben, beneath the Bayer patterns are these photo diodes.

13
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:45,655
We can refer to all of them as basically photosites.

14
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,680
This is where, of course, information is captured and

15
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,530
converted into light intensities and colors.

16
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:56,510
So these regions are the photosites for either one of them.

17
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:59,180
Basically, any one of these regions is a photosite.

18
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:02,770
And we want to be able to capture information from these photosites.

19
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:07,710
So the big difference is, the photosites in a CCD are passive and

20
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:09,920
actually do no work whatsoever.

21
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,520
As soon as something is captured, information is then moved over, and

22
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:18,910
there is an amplifier that's used to kind of take the exact values and

23
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:22,950
amplify it to a scale that can be measured by the storage device that comes in.

24
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:30,080
So I'm just showing an example of how things are copied over, one row at a time,

25
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,560
and then saved.

26
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:37,140
Photosites in CMOS actually have an amplifier right there.

27
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,370
And actually they can do local processing.

28
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:40,590
So the readout at each and

29
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:45,830
every one of them is local as opposed to in this case, not really global, but

30
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:49,070
actually it's done after all the things have been stored.

31
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:53,510
Here, every readout is done at the local sensor itself.

32
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:57,070
So in essence, there is a small local amplifier at each and

33
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:59,010
every one of the photosites.

34
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:03,230
So each and every point here, every photosite has its own amplifier.

35
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:06,170
So, of course, that allows them to do local processing.

36
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:09,669
One thing to note here is this is one of the traditional problems.

37
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:12,966
If you play around with the video on your hand held camera or

38
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:17,930
a cell phone camera, you see something called a rolling shutter artifact.

39
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:19,790
We'll actually, in one of the applications,

40
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:21,810
talk about how we can get a rolling shutter.

41
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:24,910
It's something which we've done a lot of research on.

42
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:27,820
But basically one of the reasons for rolling shutter is because of

43
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:30,810
the readout that's happening at each and every photosite,

44
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:37,200
if the camera is moving faster than the readout is, you will see some sort of

45
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:42,020
rolling artifacts, some non-rigidity in a scene, or some bending of the scene.

46
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:45,380
That is just because when this thing is read, by the time this is read,

47
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:47,020
the scene may have changed, and

48
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:52,890
that is an artifact that's common in, especially lower end CMOS sensors.

49
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:56,010
Higher end ones have a much faster readout rate and can do much better.
