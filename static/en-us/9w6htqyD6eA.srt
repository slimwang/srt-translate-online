Hello, welcome back to computer vision.

2
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:07,070
Today, we're going to start talking about, stereo and

3
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:09,550
this particular lecture is on stereo geometry.

4
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:12,260
In general, the next few lectures are going to be on

5
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:16,760
the relationship between sort of camera geometry and scene geometry.

6
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:20,510
We're starting with stereo because frankly you guys are going to do this,

7
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:23,480
in a problem set and I want to be able to get you there quickly, and

8
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:27,280
also in some sense it is the conceptually easiest way to get started.

9
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:32,280
So stereo is really just a special case of having multiple views of an image,

10
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:36,630
two particular views, and here's just an example of two views of a vase.

11
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:39,900
In fact, we're going to get to this particular figure, oh,

12
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:42,110
a little bit later when we talk about epipolar geometry.

13
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:45,000
But the idea is that there's this relationship between two views, and

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,940
you can use it to recover the depth that's there.

15
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:51,720
We'll also take a look at sort of having arbitrary different views, and this is

16
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:56,440
an image that comes from work on using special features to align objects and

17
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:58,290
be able to detect that they're there, but, again,

18
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:01,270
you have two different views and you have to figure out how they relate.

19
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:03,960
This is an example of what you can get from stereos, so

20
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,720
the picture on the left is one half of a stereo pair,

21
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:12,540
on the right is a crude depth map, the brighter things are, the closer they are,

22
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:16,310
in fact, we're going to talk about how to compute exactly that.

23
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:18,770
And in general, you can have lots of views,

24
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:22,250
where you have images taken from a whole bunch of places, or

25
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:25,610
a whole bunch of directions, and it's a question of how do these images relate.

26
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:27,360
And this notion of how images relate and

27
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,210
how do they relate to the scene, that's what we're going to be focusing on.
