00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,060
So let's quickly look at the crondon xml configuration

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:05,380
file, where we set up the cron job, to

3
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:08,575
run the set announcement function. So the URL, it's

4
00:00:08,575 --> 00:00:13,000
/crons/set_announcement, basically just the task to the servlet that

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,130
runs the task. And a description, it's kind of optional,

6
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:20,210
but very helpful. And the schedule is every one

7
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:22,730
hours. It's not every one hour, it must be

8
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:25,750
every one hours. And then if you had more cron

9
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:29,100
jobs you would just add more cron entries and fill

10
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:32,360
them in, etc. And that really is it for cron jobs.
