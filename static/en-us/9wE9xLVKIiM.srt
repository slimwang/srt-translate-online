00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,601
Let's keep playing around with conjugates. First I'd like you to find the

2
00:00:04,601 --> 00:00:09,609
complex conjugate of 1 plus 9i and fill that into this orange box. Then I'd like

3
00:00:09,609 --> 00:00:14,532
you to find the product of 1 plus 9i in that conjugate. So write the conjugate

4
00:00:14,532 --> 00:00:19,572
again in this second set of parentheses and then multiply it by The original

5
00:00:19,572 --> 00:00:23,520
complex number. And fill the answer in this last box.
