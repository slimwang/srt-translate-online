1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:00,940
Induction and

2
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:04,080
deduction are critical topics to
understand in machine learning.

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,962
So let's pause for a moment and go over
them in more detail with a segment from

4
00:00:06,962 --> 00:00:09,700
Ashok's and
my Artificial Intelligence course.

5
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:12,500
Note especially, that machine
learning is largely about induction.

6
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:15,800
>> Let us look at
abduction more closely.

7
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,340
To understand the similarities and

8
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:20,852
difference between deduction,
abduction and induction,

9
00:00:20,852 --> 00:00:24,810
let us look at the relationship
between a rule, cause and effect.

10
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:29,170
Let's consider a simple rule
like if it is cloudy, it rains.

11
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:33,663
So it is cloudy is the cause,
it rains is the effect.

12
00:00:33,663 --> 00:00:36,519
If it is cloudy,
then it rains is the rule.

13
00:00:36,519 --> 00:00:40,310
>> Other example of a rule would
be the rule that Bob hates Joe.

14
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:43,860
So Bob hates Joe, so
whenever Joe walks in, Bob Leaves.

15
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:46,670
The cause is Joe walking in,
the effect is Bob leaving, and

16
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:48,770
the rule is Bob hates Joe.

17
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:51,700
>> You've already come across yet
another instance of this particular

18
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:55,260
arrangement when we were
talking about flu and fever.

19
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:58,330
So the rule might be,
if flu, then fever.

20
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:00,256
Flu is the cause, fever is the effect.

21
00:01:00,256 --> 00:01:06,010
Now in deduction, in one fundamental
kind of inference we know the rule and

22
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:08,990
the cause and
we need to deduce the effect.

23
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:12,030
So given the rule if it is cloudy,
then it rains and

24
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:16,670
given the cause it is cloudy
we can deduce that it rains.

25
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:19,400
>> Similarly,
in our rule that Bob hates Joe,

26
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:22,690
we can say that if Joe just walked in,
we can deduce that Bob will leave.

27
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:26,670
>> Or if the rule is,
if flu, then fever, and

28
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:31,070
we know that Ashck has flu,
then we can deduce that Ashok has fever.

29
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:33,220
This is simply an instance
of modus ponens and

30
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:36,790
we discussed this in detail when
we were talking about logic.

31
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:38,220
Now let us look at induction.

32
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:41,870
Given a relationship between a cause and
an effect, we can try to induce a rule.

33
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:48,490
For example, if we observe repeatedly
that when it is cloudy, it rains.

34
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:49,950
It may be induce a rule.

35
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:52,120
If it is cloudy, then it rains.

36
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,270
>> Same thing with Bob and Joe.

37
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:56,980
If we observe repeatedly that
every time Joe arrives Bob leaves,

38
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:59,130
we can induce a rule
that Bob must hate Joe.

39
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:03,660
>> If every time a patient
goes to a doctor with flu and

40
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:08,530
a patient has fever, then we can
induce a rule, if flu, then fever.

41
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:13,270
In case of abduction, given a rule and
an effect, we can abduce a cause.

42
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:19,570
As an example, given the rule,
if it is cloudy, then it rains, and

43
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:23,430
the effect that it is raining,
we can ask ourselves, is it cloudy?

44
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:28,187
>> And once again with Bob and Joe,
given our rule that Bob hates Joe and

45
00:02:28,187 --> 00:02:31,825
given that we just arrived at a party
and we see that Joe is here but not Bob,

46
00:02:31,825 --> 00:02:35,470
we might be able to abduce that
Bob left when Joe arrived.

47
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:40,219
>> Or given the rule, if flu then fever
and the fact that Ashok has fever,

48
00:02:40,219 --> 00:02:43,292
we might be able to abduce
that Ashok has flu.

49
00:02:43,292 --> 00:02:46,650
First of all,
notice that we are back to diagnosis.

50
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:49,660
Diagnosis as an instance of abduction.

51
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:51,740
But notice several other properties.

52
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:54,150
First, deduction is truth preserving.

53
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:56,830
If the rule is true, and

54
00:02:56,830 --> 00:03:02,040
a cause is true, we can always guarantee
that the effect is true as well.

55
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,870
Induction and
abduction are not truth preserving.

56
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:07,320
You may know something about the
relations between cause and effect for

57
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:11,150
some sample, that does not mean that
the same relationship holds for

58
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:12,190
the entire population.

59
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:17,956
Induction does not always guarantee
correctness, same for abduction.

60
00:03:17,956 --> 00:03:20,055
We may know the rule and the effect and

61
00:03:20,055 --> 00:03:24,336
we may suppose that the cause is true
but that need not necessarily be true.

62
00:03:24,336 --> 00:03:28,377
It may be the case, if flu,
then fever and Ashok may have fever But

63
00:03:28,377 --> 00:03:31,760
that does not necessarily
mean that Ashok has flu.

64
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,230
Fever can be caused by many,
many things.

65
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:38,960
The reason that fever does not
necessarily mean that Ashok has flu is

66
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:43,770
because there can be multiple causes for
the same effect, multiple hypothesis for

67
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:44,380
the same data.

68
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:48,830
This is exactly the problem
that we had encountered earlier

69
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:51,410
when we were talking about
what makes diagnosis hard.

70
00:03:52,648 --> 00:03:55,030
We said that deduction, induction, and

71
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:58,460
abduction are three of
the fundamental forms of inference.

72
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:01,430
We can of course also
combine these inferences.

73
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:03,140
Science is a good example.

74
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:05,818
You and I are scientists,
observe some data about the world.

75
00:04:05,818 --> 00:04:09,820
Then we abduce some explanation for it.

76
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:15,300
Having abduced that explanation for
it, we induce a rule.

77
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:22,084
Having induced a rule, now we can use
deduction to predict new data elements.

78
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,230
We go and observe some more.

79
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:30,650
Again, we abduce, induce,
deduce and we continue the cycle.

80
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:35,166
Might the cycle also explain
significant part of cognition.

81
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:41,883
Is this what you and I do on a daily
basis, abduce, induce, deduce?

82
00:04:41,883 --> 00:04:42,763
>> In machine learning,

83
00:04:42,763 --> 00:04:45,310
what we're largely interested
in doing is induction.

84
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:48,900
Taking some data in which we speculate
cause and effect relationship exist and

85
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,380
inducing a rule.

86
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:51,811
The rule actually need to be causal,

87
00:04:51,811 --> 00:04:54,090
it's a right of the rule's
about correlation.

88
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:57,010
The important thing is inducing a rule
that will allow us to make sense of data

89
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:58,270
in the future.

90
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:00,980
That rule can then be applied
deductively or abductively.

91
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:01,970
In trading, for example,

92
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:05,880
we might apply that rule deductively
to protect what stocks will gain value.

93
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:09,870
Or abductively to decide where
insider trading has already occurred.

94
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:11,458
So now that you have
a good grasp of induction,

95
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:12,860
let's get back to Charles and Michael.
