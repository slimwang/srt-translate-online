1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,746
Now that we're logged in, the next two
steps are to get the Session ID and

2
00:00:03,746 --> 00:00:04,409
the User ID.

3
00:00:04,409 --> 00:00:08,260
Each of these steps will closely mimic
what we did to get the Request Token.

4
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:14,280
In code we already called getSessionID
here, and getUserID here.

5
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:17,210
So all you need to do is correctly
implement both of these convenience

6
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:18,430
methods.

7
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:21,430
If you implement these correctly
then the completionHandlerForAuth

8
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:26,340
closure will be called, where success is
true, and we don't have any errorString.

9
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:28,998
This should cause the main
tab view to be presented and

10
00:00:28,998 --> 00:00:30,150
we're ready to use the app.

11
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:32,940
Okay, so now it's your turn.

12
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:35,200
When you're done implementing
getSessionID, and

13
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,850
getUserID, check this box.
