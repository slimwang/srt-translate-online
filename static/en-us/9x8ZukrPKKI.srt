00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,242
Okay, so we have 2 polynomials that we
are trying to add together. And this may

2
00:00:03,242 --> 00:00:08,573
sound silly, but if we're adding one
quantity to another, we're actually adding

3
00:00:08,573 --> 00:00:15,020
+1 times this quantity. Anything, 
let's say some number a, times 1 is

4
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:21,753
just equal to itself. So a times 1 is a, 
and 5 times 1 is 5, and 4x^2 times 1 is 4x^2,

5
00:00:21,753 --> 00:00:26,773
and -2x times 1 is-2x.
So having the parentheses here with the

6
00:00:26,785 --> 00:00:32,024
plus sign in front of them doesn't change
the value or the sign of any of the terms

7
00:00:32,024 --> 00:00:36,634
inside the second set of parenthesis. So
we can just write it but without the

8
00:00:36,634 --> 00:00:40,045
parenthesis. There's also nothing
happening to the first set of parenthesis,

9
00:00:40,045 --> 00:00:44,907
at least not yet, so we can just rewrite
it without the parenthesis as well. And

10
00:00:44,907 --> 00:00:48,510
now, we have a thing that we have a ton of
practice we're dealing with. We just need

11
00:00:48,522 --> 00:00:52,193
to rearrange our terms and simplify. Once
we've rearranged we combine our now

12
00:00:52,193 --> 00:00:56,875
adjacent like terms. So for x^2 term we
have 11x^2.

13
00:00:56,875 --> 00:01:02,931
And now I'm dealing with the x to the
first terms, +2 -2 is just zero, so these

14
00:01:02,931 --> 00:01:06,863
cancel each other out. And we don't have
any term in the final answer with an x^1

15
00:01:06,863 --> 00:01:12,205
in it. Then we just have 1+4 so our final
answer is 11x^2+5.

16
00:01:12,205 --> 00:01:15,482
I just love doing these problems so much.
because you start out with something

17
00:01:15,482 --> 00:01:18,787
that's so complicated and messy looking,
and you end up with a really, really

18
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:20,543
beautiful simple answer.
