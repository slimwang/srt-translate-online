00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,612
Commuters in the US spend an average
of one hour a day in their car.

2
00:00:03,612 --> 00:00:08,720
And a person checks their smart phone
an average of 125 times per day.

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,640
Our cars get us where we're going
while our phones keep us connected.

4
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:16,720
But using your phone while driving
can be distracting and dangerous.

5
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,520
But what if you could stay connected
using your phone but in a safer and

6
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,160
more convenient way that's
integrated in the car?

7
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:29,610
And better yet, what if developing for
this new platform was easy and familiar?

8
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:32,820
Welcome to Android Auto,
bringing Android to the car.

9
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:36,740
It's the same platform you already
use for phones, tablets, televisions,

10
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:38,060
watches, and more!

11
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:42,410
In fact, all these experiences
will often be in the same APK.

12
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:46,890
But now your app can also extend to
the car in a way that's safer and

13
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:48,670
more efficient for the driver.

14
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:50,380
So they can stay connected, but

15
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:52,850
with their hands on the wheel and
eyes on the road.
