Do you remember solving linear equations? Well, we're going to use some of the

2
00:00:04,318 --> 00:00:07,948
same techniques we learned all those lessons ago to change equations like this

3
00:00:07,948 --> 00:00:13,420
one, so that we can use our techniques using logs to find out what x is. It's

4
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:16,570
pretty common in mathematics to try to change a problem to be in a form of what

5
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:24,190
we've seen before. So here, we have the equation e to the x minus 3 equals 43.

6
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:29,260
For right now, let's just think of e to the x as our variable. Now if we do the

7
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:33,799
same thing to both sides of our equation, what is e to the x equal to?
