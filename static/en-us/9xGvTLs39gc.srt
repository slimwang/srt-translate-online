1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:04,070
Let's do a quiz in which we analyze
the performance metrics for

2
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:05,580
shortest job first.

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:09,160
To do this, let's assume first that
shortest job first is used to schedule

4
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:12,140
three tasks, T1, T2, and T3.

5
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:14,260
Also, let's make
the following assumptions.

6
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:16,760
The scheduler will not preempt the task,
so

7
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:20,690
this will be the run to completion type
of model that we discussed so far.

8
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:23,994
We'll assume that we know the execution
times of these tasks, and

9
00:00:23,994 --> 00:00:26,241
we'll use the same values
as we used before.

10
00:00:26,241 --> 00:00:30,410
So, T1 and T3 are 1 second and
T2 is ten seconds.

11
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:33,243
And, let's assume that they're
all arrive at the same time.

12
00:00:33,243 --> 00:00:36,808
So, we will start analyzing
this system from some time, T0,

13
00:00:36,808 --> 00:00:40,680
when all of these tasks
are actually in the system already.

14
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:44,770
Per this system, calculate the
throughput, the average completion time,

15
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:48,490
and the average wait time,
using the shortest job first algorithm.
