00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,408
Let's do a quiz to see if
we understood locality.

2
00:00:03,408 --> 00:00:07,270
Which of these are not
good examples of locality?

3
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:09,720
It rained three times already today, so

4
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:13,510
we can conclude that it is
likely to rain again today.

5
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:16,440
We ate dinner at six
every day last week, so

6
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:21,200
we can conclude that probably we will
eat dinner around six this week, too.

7
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:25,940
And, it was New Year's Eve yesterday,
so we conclude that probably,

8
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:28,549
it will be New Year's Eve today, too.

9
00:00:28,549 --> 00:00:33,750
Again, you need to find which of these
are not good examples of locality.
