1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,310
So the super in supercomputing
is about solving big,

2
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:06,970
hairy computational problems
as efficiently as possible.

3
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:10,276
And here at Georgia Tech, there are many
examples of scientists everyday

4
00:00:10,276 --> 00:00:12,904
using supercomputers to do
all kinds of important stuff.

5
00:00:12,904 --> 00:00:16,165
Stuff like simulating
the dynamics of the earth, or

6
00:00:16,165 --> 00:00:18,323
studying biomolecular systems.

7
00:00:18,323 --> 00:00:21,732
Or analyzing social networks,
or understanding the cosmos,

8
00:00:21,732 --> 00:00:22,770
just to name a few.

9
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,710
Now, these are incredibly
complex phenomena and

10
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:29,930
many scientists believe we won't
gain any insight into them without

11
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:34,220
some combination of your mathematical
models, leaner algorithms and

12
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:39,670
data structures, more and accurate data,
as well as enough processing color.

13
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:42,850
Now ours is a CS course
on super computing.

14
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:47,580
So the main question we'll be interested
in is, given a computational problem and

15
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:52,240
a machine, how do you compute at
the absolute limits of scale and speed.

16
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,040
You'll encounter many such
limits throughout the course.

17
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:59,280
But one of the more interesting ones,
come from physics.

18
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,110
These are things like limits
based on the speed of light,

19
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:05,410
all the amount of energy, power or
heat dissipated by the system.

20
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:10,380
In fact that's the reason we're here
in this crazy mad scientist lab

21
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:14,860
run by my crazy mad scientist friend and
colleague Ken Brown.

22
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:15,370
Ken Brown and

23
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:19,510
his crew are thinking about how to
build Quantum Computing Systems.

24
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:23,160
That represents one of the ultimate
limits of physical computation.

25
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:26,340
Now we won't actually talk about quantum
computing stuff in this class, but

26
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:29,350
I wanted to start there to sort
of stimulate your imagination,

27
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:32,660
not only about the limits of
conventional computing systems but

28
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:34,520
also about what might lie beyond.
