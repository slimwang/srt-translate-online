00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,969
Let's step through this now with
an example of how a minimizer

2
00:00:03,969 --> 00:00:08,280
would try to find the coefficients
of a line that best fits this data.

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:12,260
So keep in mind that we have to
give the minimizer an equation

4
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:14,060
that it has to minimize.

5
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:17,550
And what we're going to give
it is that error metric.

6
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:20,150
In fact we used squared error.

7
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:26,290
So we might guess an initial C0 and
C1 and that would be a line

8
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:31,750
like this, and we would give that
to the minimizer and let it go.

9
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:36,850
So it would measure the error
with this particular line,

10
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:39,900
it would fiddle with these
values a little bit and

11
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:45,620
see how much the error changed, try
a new set of values see how that works.

12
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:49,070
And eventually it's going to iterate,
and

13
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:52,700
eventually it's going to settle on
what it thinks is the best solution.

14
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:58,400
So key points here are that
we express the problem for

15
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:01,660
the minimizer as
a minimization problem and

16
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:06,350
we give it the equation
to minimize as the error.

17
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:11,790
And then, what it finds now instead
of x is it finds the values for

18
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:13,480
these coefficients.

19
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:15,660
So, let me show you how
to do that now in code.
