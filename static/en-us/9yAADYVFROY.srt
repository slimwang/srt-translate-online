1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:02,200
Let's go over the problem again.

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:05,270
We want to build an application with a list of cats, and when you

3
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:10,800
click on the cat in the list, they will display in the cat viewing area here.

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,550
And what's more, the number for

5
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:16,890
the number of clicks should always reflect the number of the current cat.

6
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:18,320
We're going to go through this right now and

7
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:23,770
figure out what should belong to the model, the view or views, and the octopus.

8
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:26,750
First, let's identify the model and the view portions.

9
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:31,170
Of the following things, choose whether they belong in the model or the view.

10
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:35,060
The clickable list of cats here, the current cat display, and

11
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:38,130
the array of cat objects which is driving all of this.
