00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:03,610
All right, so we've used UI navigation controller,

2
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:05,990
to navigate between multiple screens on our phone.

3
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:10,360
At this point, I want you to imagine that you were designing a final test for

4
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:11,350
this course.

5
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:15,010
And that that test would be taken by your peers in the class.

6
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:19,505
What question about UI navigation controller would you ask in that examine?

7
00:00:19,505 --> 00:00:21,450
. Think about what question you would ask and

8
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:22,940
submit that on the discussion forum.
