00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:04,340
As we can see here, early on in the World Cup games,

2
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:08,140
the games involving the home team were actually very well attended.

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:09,700
But as time's gone on,

4
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:14,470
depending on the year, sometimes the home team's not even in the tournament.

5
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:18,230
Or there's other potentially more interesting games which have

6
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:21,670
a higher attendance rates than the ones involving the home team.

7
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:26,420
One hypothesis for why this might be happening very early on is that many of

8
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:29,790
the fans who show up to the games are from the home country,

9
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:34,130
due to the fact it might be hard to get to a given World Cup

10
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:38,160
with the current state of transportation and technologies.

11
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,640
As flying became more commonplace, as airlines have blown up, maybe over

12
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:47,180
the years it's just much easier for teams and fans to get around the world.
