00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,300
Let's talk about online first, the way
we typically approach development.

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:07,130
Online first means,
we try the network first.

3
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:11,090
If that fails, we serve some offline
content like some cached data,

4
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:14,720
a fancy error page, or
a picture of a sad cat.

5
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:16,940
So based on what Jake has been saying.

6
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:20,960
If we pick an online first approach
rather than offline first,

7
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,000
in which of the following
conditions will our app work well?

8
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:27,120
In good connectivity?

9
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,819
Poor connectivity or
what we call lie-fi?

10
00:00:29,819 --> 00:00:31,309
Or offline?
