00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:04,348
The cocktail party effect is another example of selective attention. Now

2
00:00:04,348 --> 00:00:07,384
imagine you're in a room having a conversation with your friends about how much

3
00:00:07,384 --> 00:00:11,453
you love your Introduction to Psychology at Udasity class. And how everybody

4
00:00:11,453 --> 00:00:16,110
should take it. Then all of a sudden you heard your name from across the room.

5
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:18,882
In this example you're selectively attending to the conversation you were

6
00:00:18,882 --> 00:00:22,926
having. Yet still heard your name across a noisy room with a bunch of other

7
00:00:22,926 --> 00:00:27,670
conversations going on. So you were able to filter out the background auditory

8
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:33,218
stimuli that wasn't important, that was the background conversations. Yet you

9
00:00:33,218 --> 00:00:37,084
were still able to focus on the important stimulus which was your name. So that

10
00:00:37,084 --> 00:00:39,690
background information came to the foreground.
