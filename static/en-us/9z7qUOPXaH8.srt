>> So, why the mood of out of proportion when conditions are table? Consider

00:00:03,733 --> 00:00:07,427
this problem. >> We're going to keep our ratio with the number of dimes to the

3
00:00:07,427 --> 00:00:10,880
number of quarter's the same. >> How many dimes are there if there are 231

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,653
quarters? Now here, I wouldn't want to list out a long table of numbers, that

5
00:00:14,653 --> 00:00:18,382
would take too much time. >> Instead, I could set up a proportion and solve. >>

6
00:00:18,382 --> 00:00:23,381
You try setting up a proportion and solving. >> Put your final answer here.
