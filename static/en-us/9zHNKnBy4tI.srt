1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,130
The solution here is that you can also find 4 vertices that form an independent set.

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:09,500
This one here is rather obvious. You can also take this one in there, this one here.

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,850
It's not connected to any of the other ones and this one here.

4
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:17,410
Well, I've already placed the vertices in very similar locations, but as you can see,

5
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:22,860
each vertex here has a corresponding vertex in the independent set, and of course,

6
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:25,610
the way I've drawn this is not really by accident.

7
00:00:25,610 --> 99:59:59,999
There's a certain type of relationship between this network here and this network here.
