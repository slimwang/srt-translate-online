1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:03,210
You've already learned how
to activate auto tracking so

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:06,640
that every time any user goes
to any screen in your app,

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,110
a hit is recorded and
sent to Google Analytics.

4
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:13,260
While you're learning how to
add analytics to your app,

5
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:15,480
it's fine to have auto tracking enabled.

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,740
It's gratifying to see the hits
coming in the dashboard.

7
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:23,430
But if your app gets wildly popular and
if you've got auto tracking enabled,

8
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:26,960
then that's going to be a lot
of screen hits that get sent.

9
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,960
In fact, it could be too many hits,
and you might run into quota limits.

10
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,040
If your app exceeds its quota limits,
excess hits will not be counted.

11
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,060
You can read about quota
limits in the developer docs.

12
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:43,860
The main point to understand
is that it's often better to

13
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:46,650
specifically track
what you want to track

14
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:49,630
rather than enabling auto
tracking across all activities.

15
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:54,535
It's easy enough to disable auto
tracking for all activities.

16
00:00:54,535 --> 00:01:00,122
Simply set ga_autoActivityTracking
to false in the config file for

17
00:01:00,122 --> 00:01:01,380
your tracker.

18
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:07,430
And then, instead, to track when
users go to a specific screen,

19
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:11,520
you can send a screen view hit,
like this.

20
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,319
You add the code to onStart.

21
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:15,677
Then you get the tracker.

22
00:01:15,677 --> 00:01:17,801
Hopefully you know how to do that now.

23
00:01:17,801 --> 00:01:21,935
You can set the screen name on
the tracker with setScreenName.

24
00:01:21,935 --> 00:01:28,715
And then you send the hit, calling
build on HitBuilders.ScreenViewBuilder.

25
00:01:28,715 --> 00:01:31,872
And you'll need to make sure that
your app has the right imports.

26
00:01:31,872 --> 00:01:33,718
You're going to need the Tracker class.

27
00:01:33,718 --> 00:01:36,260
And you're going to need
the HitBuilders class.

28
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:40,302
For all hits that are sent,
you still get the geo information,

29
00:01:40,302 --> 00:01:45,118
the device info, the engagement details,
and all that other good stuff.

30
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:47,510
Okay, go ahead and try it now.

31
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:52,898
In the tracker config file,
set ga_autoActivityTracking to false.

32
00:01:52,898 --> 00:01:55,352
Then pick an activity in your app, and

33
00:01:55,352 --> 00:01:58,740
add the code to the onStart()
method to send a hit.

34
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:03,930
So, here,
I'm tracking hits to ShowRecipe.

35
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:08,086
So I'm in the ShowRecipeActivity
with my onStart method.

36
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:11,620
And you can see I set my screen
name to Show recipe screen.

37
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:13,710
And here's the code to send the hit.

38
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,190
And then, of course,
run your app and try it out.

39
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:23,150
You can look in the logs to
see that your hit gets sent

40
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:24,490
when you go to that screen.

41
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:30,384
See there's my hit, but not when
you do anything else in the app.

42
00:02:30,384 --> 00:02:34,153
And then of course, don't forget to
check your analytics dashboard and

43
00:02:34,153 --> 00:02:36,020
then come here and check the boxes.
