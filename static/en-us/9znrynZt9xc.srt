00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:01,800
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:03,830
>> So, Nosmo, what happened to your neck?

3
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:07,365
>> Oh, I hurt it. I actually have slightly limited range of motion

4
00:00:07,365 --> 00:00:09,356
and so I can only move this way, kind of like a robot.

5
00:00:09,356 --> 00:00:09,740
>> Oh, no.

6
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:11,240
>> Kind of like an alive Android.

7
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:13,350
>> Sounds like you have a constraint.

8
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:15,380
>> I know, it, it is a constraint, but instead of

9
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:17,980
fighting against it, I'm going to totally embrace it and work with

10
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:21,370
it. Well actually this lesson is all about how to work within

11
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:23,480
constraints and deliver great user experiences.

12
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,160
So you're actually right at home.

13
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,480
>> I know. That's awesome. Let's get started. So in lesson

14
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,150
two we taught you some tools called personas in use cases that

15
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:32,800
allow you to better prioritize your future lists and make really

16
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:37,730
good applications. And you also learned a little bit about UX research.

17
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:40,795
>> And in lesson one, we taught you about hi, low-res

18
00:00:40,795 --> 00:00:44,210
wire framing. Which helps you think about the big picture first, before

19
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:47,480
you go into things like flows and details and UI elements.

20
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:50,660
So, Nosmo, lets talk about what you're going to learn in lesson three.

21
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:51,160
>> Okay.

22
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:54,190
>> In this lesson you'll learn how to design for

23
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:57,580
the Mobile user. And how this is different from designing for

24
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:00,330
a web or a desktop user. You'll also learn about

25
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:02,900
four mobile constraints that you'll need to keep in mind for

26
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:05,260
any mobile apps that you'll build. Then you'll learn more

27
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:07,780
about wire framing and picking up from where we left off

28
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:10,980
in lesson one. We're going to go deeper into how to design

29
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:13,940
a flow of screens to support each step inside your application.
