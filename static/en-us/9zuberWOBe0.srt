00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:04,290
So our next challenge, is to build out this second scene in our app.

2
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:06,580
Here are some tasks for you to practice.

3
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:10,480
The first is to change the image of this button, so it looks like the snail.

4
00:00:14,412 --> 00:00:19,319
[SOUND] There, we will use this button to play sounds at a very slow rate.

5
00:00:19,319 --> 00:00:23,220
By the way this image is also available in the instructor notes.

6
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:26,340
The second task, is to fix this buttons constraints so

7
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:29,090
it appears at the top left of the phone like that.

8
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,530
And the third task is to create an action for

9
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:35,950
this button, in play sounds view controller.

10
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:38,030
So here are your challenges one more time.

11
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:40,110
Check this box, when you are done with this exercise.
