00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,138
So now that we've learned how the brain sends an receives signals, let's talk

2
00:00:03,138 --> 00:00:07,481
about how the brain functions. Now the brain isn't just one big black box where

3
00:00:07,481 --> 00:00:11,534
there's one unique function. It's actually made up of several important parts,

4
00:00:11,534 --> 00:00:16,202
each with a unique purpose. Now just like we learned in the evolution material,

5
00:00:16,202 --> 00:00:20,683
the brain is the result of millions of years of development. At the broadest

6
00:00:20,683 --> 00:00:24,709
level, there are three major regions of the brain, the hindbrain, the midbrain

7
00:00:24,709 --> 00:00:30,756
and the forebrain. These areas represent different evolutionary ages, meaning

8
00:00:30,756 --> 00:00:34,178
the hindbrain evolved first, followed by the midbrain and finally the

9
00:00:34,178 --> 00:00:40,352
forebrain. In fact, we can see some of the oldest animals on the planet. Fish

10
00:00:40,352 --> 00:00:44,384
and reptiles only have a hind brain. Birds and mammals have a mid brain and

11
00:00:44,384 --> 00:00:48,256
fore brain. But it's really the primates who have the most complex and

12
00:00:48,256 --> 00:00:49,850
developed fore brains.
