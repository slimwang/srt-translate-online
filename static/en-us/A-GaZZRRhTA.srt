1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,041
So to answer this, we want to look at these for loops

2
00:00:02,041 --> 00:00:08,229
and decide how many times each warp is going to have to execute the for loop.

3
00:00:08,229 --> 00:00:13,347
And that means how many times at least 1 thread in the warp is going to have to execute it.

4
00:00:13,347 --> 00:00:18,897
So looking at this expression here, for a single warp these values will vary from 0 to 31.

5
00:00:18,897 --> 00:00:26,110
So there will be at least 1 thread in that warp for whom this modulo expression evaluates to 31.

6
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:29,143
And that means that the entire warp is going to go through the motions

7
00:00:29,143 --> 00:00:33,217
of executing this bar function 31 times.

8
00:00:33,217 --> 00:00:36,881
Now, some of those times some of the threads will be deactivated.

9
00:00:36,881 --> 00:00:42,011
So the very first time, thread 0 will not execute the bar function.

10
00:00:42,011 --> 00:00:45,823
It will be deactivated because i will not be less than 0.

11
00:00:45,823 --> 00:00:49,054
And the next time thread 0 and 1 will be deactivated and so forth.

12
00:00:49,054 --> 00:00:53,695
Ultimately, the total amount of time that the warp has to spend in this loop

13
00:00:53,695 --> 00:00:58,009
depends on the total number of time that any 1 thread has to spend on it.

14
00:00:58,009 --> 00:01:00,670
Each warp will executive this loop 31 times.

15
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:02,680
This next loop, though, is different.

16
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:08,771
In this case the integer divide means that threads 0 through 31 are going to evaluate to 0.

17
00:01:08,771 --> 00:01:14,118
This expression will evaluate to 0, and therefore they're not going to execute the bar function at all.

18
00:01:14,118 --> 00:01:19,754
And in threads 32 through 63 we'll evaluate this expression to 1,

19
00:01:19,754 --> 00:01:22,155
and they'll execute the loop 1s and so forth.

20
00:01:22,155 --> 00:01:28,106
So there will be 1 warp which evaluates at 0 times, 1 warp which evaluates at 1 time,

21
00:01:28,106 --> 00:01:32,785
1 that evaluates at 2 times and so forth, all the way up to a single warp,

22
00:01:32,785 --> 00:01:35,289
which evaluates at 31 times.

23
00:01:35,289 --> 00:01:42,938
So the average number of times that all of the warps will execute this loop is 15.5.

24
00:01:42,938 --> 00:01:45,674
So now we know what we need to know to answer the question.

25
00:01:45,674 --> 00:01:52,222
Clearly, the second loop will execute faster, and it will be twice as fast

26
00:01:52,222 --> 00:01:57,491
because, on average, the number of times that the expensive bar function gets evaluated

27
00:01:57,491 --> 00:02:02,743
is half the number of times that that bar function gets evaluated during the first loop.
