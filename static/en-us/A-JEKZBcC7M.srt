00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,700
When adding IBOutlets and IBActions in Storyboard,

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:04,559
it's easy to make a mistake.

3
00:00:04,559 --> 00:00:06,599
You might connect the wrong

4
00:00:06,599 --> 00:00:08,669
element to the wrong Outlet or the wrong

5
00:00:08,669 --> 00:00:11,130
element to the wrong action.

6
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:12,839
When this happens what do you do?

7
00:00:12,839 --> 00:00:14,789
Let me show you. I’m going to go ahead

8
00:00:14,789 --> 00:00:16,710
and make some mistakes on purpose and

9
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:18,300
show you what to expect.

10
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,579
I've removed connections for all the IBOutlets

11
00:00:20,579 --> 00:00:22,679
for our playback and stop buttons.

12
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:25,350
And I'm going to link an incorrect

13
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:28,739
element to an IBOutlet. I'll control drag

14
00:00:28,739 --> 00:00:30,210
from the Play Sounds View Controller

15
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:32,939
down to our EchoButton.

16
00:00:32,939 --> 00:00:34,558
Instead of selecting the EchoButton, I’m going to

17
00:00:34,558 --> 00:00:38,070
connect it to the SnailButton.

18
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:38,878
Once this is done,

19
00:00:38,878 --> 00:00:40,409
there's a special place that I can look

20
00:00:40,409 --> 00:00:42,299
in Storyboard to see all my existing

21
00:00:42,299 --> 00:00:43,170
connections.

22
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:44,700
It's called the Connections Inspector.

23
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,829
With the Play Sounds View Controller

24
00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:49,710
selected in the Document Outline,

25
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:51,570
go to the utilities panel and will select the

26
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:54,840
connections inspector. It's the one with

27
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,488
the icon that has an arrow pointing to the right.

28
00:00:56,488 --> 00:00:58,890
Here I can see all the outlets

29
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:00,509
for this View Controller, including the one

30
00:01:00,509 --> 00:01:03,329
I made by mistake. If I hover my mouse

31
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:05,579
over the connection we can see that the

32
00:01:05,579 --> 00:01:07,890
Snail Button outlet is connected to the

33
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:09,060
Echo Button.

34
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,519
this isn't what we want. To remove the

35
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:13,228
connection, all I have to do is click the

36
00:01:13,228 --> 00:01:15,599
X next to the button’s name.

37
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:20,489
Ok. So that was one common mistake, but

38
00:01:20,489 --> 00:01:22,379
what about if I incorrectly connect an

39
00:01:22,379 --> 00:01:24,959
IBAction? So let's go ahead and break

40
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:27,269
some things. I'm going to remove all the

41
00:01:27,269 --> 00:01:34,700
existing connections to the IBActions.

42
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:37,399
And this time I’ll connect the Stop Button

43
00:01:37,399 --> 00:01:39,709
to the IBAction for playSoundForButton.

44
00:01:39,709 --> 00:01:42,468
Instead of making this connection

45
00:01:42,468 --> 00:01:44,090
from the Document Outline, I can actually

46
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:45,920
make it from the Connections Inspector.

47
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,530
If I hover my mouse over the empty

48
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:52,849
circle, will see a plus icon appear.

49
00:01:52,849 --> 00:01:55,340
Now I can click drag and then select the

50
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:57,228
element that I want to trigger this action.

51
00:01:57,228 --> 00:02:02,118
So I’ll click and drag over to

52
00:02:02,118 --> 00:02:03,890
the Stop Button, so that the Stop Button

53
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:06,200
calls the playSoundForButton action.

54
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:10,068
Then a pop-up will appear for

55
00:02:10,068 --> 00:02:12,829
exactly which particular action we want

56
00:02:12,829 --> 00:02:14,719
to trigger our playSoundForButton

57
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:15,889
function.

58
00:02:15,889 --> 00:02:19,830
The default is Touch Up Inside.

59
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:22,139
So if you have a problem like this,

60
00:02:22,139 --> 00:02:24,210
it's as simple as clicking the X to remove

61
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:27,090
the erroneous connection.

62
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:30,270
Alright, there's one more common mistake

63
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:32,550
that I want to show you. First we need to

64
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:33,659
set this up.

65
00:02:33,659 --> 00:02:36,060
Let's connect the Stop Button outlet to

66
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:38,580
the Stop Button interface element.

67
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:40,050
You can also do this from the Connections Inspector.

68
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:42,569
Hover over the empty circle

69
00:02:42,569 --> 00:02:46,020
for the stop Button and then click drag

70
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:48,870
to the stop Button interface element.

71
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:51,569
And let go. okay with this connection intact,

72
00:02:51,569 --> 00:02:53,610
I want to actually remove the IBOutlet

73
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:56,789
from code. Go to the

74
00:02:56,789 --> 00:02:59,310
PlaySoundsViewController.swift file, and let's

75
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:01,830
remove the IBOutlet for the stopButton.

76
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:05,459
oh oh, now what's going to happen to our

77
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:06,449
connection?

78
00:03:06,449 --> 00:03:07,740
Well, it's definitely going to cause a problem.

79
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:10,409
Since I remove the outlet, we

80
00:03:10,409 --> 00:03:12,419
have now what is known as a broken connection.

81
00:03:12,419 --> 00:03:16,740
We go back to Storyboard and

82
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:19,319
we look in the connections inspector.

83
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:22,530
For the stopButton, we now see this ! over

84
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:23,580
the connection.

85
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:25,439
This means that the connection is broken.

86
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:28,259
If we try to run this code, we might even

87
00:03:28,259 --> 00:03:30,959
get a crash. To fix this, I can remove the

88
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:35,519
connection by clicking the X.

89
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:37,199
Then I want to recreate the outlet

90
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:39,689
in Play Sounds View Controller. I can either

91
00:03:39,689 --> 00:03:42,719
create the IBOutlet in code or I can set

92
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:44,939
the assistant editor and do the control

93
00:03:44,939 --> 00:03:46,590
click dragging method that we saw

94
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:49,830
earlier in this course. I just set it

95
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:52,709
back up in code. And then in the

96
00:03:52,709 --> 00:03:54,120
Storyboard, I’ll make the connection

97
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:54,780
again.

98
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:58,830
Perfect.

99
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:00,599
Awesome. So those are three common mistakes,

100
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:02,489
and a lot of them can be solved

101
00:04:02,489 --> 00:04:03,870
easily by just looking in the

102
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:05,370
Connections Inspector

103
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,500
So if you find yourself running into

104
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,419
these types of problems, the Connection

105
00:04:09,419 --> 00:04:15,979
Inspector can be a lot of help.
