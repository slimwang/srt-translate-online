The decision variant of vertex cover can be solved in 2.4^k*nÂ³ time and this is by far

2
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:11,730
not the best algorithm for vertex cover there is and I'm soon going to tell you a little bit about that.

3
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:15,710
Even with this, think about what that means and I'm actually going to quiz you on this one.

4
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:21,180
Does it mean that for any fixed k, vertex cover can be solved in polynomial time?

5
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:25,950
Does it mean that the running time is independent of the size of the input graph?

6
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:32,240
Or have I been tricking you all along and it's actually the case that P=NP?

7
00:00:32,240 --> 99:59:59,999
Please check all of those that are correct.
