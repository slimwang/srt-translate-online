00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,540
Another thing that I wanted to mention
before we dive into the code

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:06,750
is that it's important to be 
a good Android citizen.

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:10,756
This means adhering to the principle 
of minimizing network activity

4
00:00:10,756 --> 00:00:15,117
and having an app that works seamlessly
between offline and online states.

5
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:18,950
We're going to make that happen 
by creating a cache data model

6
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:22,255
that is shared between 
the various activities of Sunshine.
