00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,846
>> The first graph was correct. Lets see why. Let's solve this inequality for y

2
00:00:04,846 --> 00:00:09,938
so we can get the boundary line. First, we subtract 4 x from both sides, then we

3
00:00:09,938 --> 00:00:14,960
divide each term by 3 to get y is greater than or equal to negative 4 3rd x plus

4
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:19,640
4. This inequality is in slope intercept form so I can graph the line that

5
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:24,732
represents the boundary. The y-intercept is 4, and my slope is negative 4 3rd.

6
00:00:24,732 --> 00:00:29,549
Down 4, right 3. That will get me to my next point. This is the boundary line

7
00:00:29,549 --> 00:00:34,649
for the inequality. I draw it solid, because the symbol is greater than or equal

8
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:39,759
to. So, points on this line do satisfy this inequality. Next, I choose a test

9
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:45,221
point, like the origin, to determine which region to shade. This region or this

10
00:00:45,221 --> 00:00:50,973
region. Plugging in zero for x and zero for y, I get, 0 is greater than or equal

11
00:00:50,973 --> 00:00:56,039
to 4. We know this is not true. So, points in this region do not satisfy the

12
00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:01,498
inequality. We want points in this region, so we shade above. Amazing work if

13
00:01:01,498 --> 00:01:03,115
you got that one right.
