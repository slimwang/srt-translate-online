00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:03,020
Let me the explain the reasoning 
that I use when I look at a new layout.

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:05,930
It looks like there's two 
equally spaced columns here.

3
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:08,780
That signals to me, that
we need LinearLayout weights,

4
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:11,050
where each of these have equal weights.

5
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:13,370
So let's create 
a horizontal LinearLayout.

6
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:17,583
Within this first child, we have 
three vertically stacked text views,

7
00:00:17,606 --> 00:00:21,240
so we have a vertical LinearLayout, 
and the same goes for this second child,

8
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:24,030
which has two elements vertically 
stacked on top of each other

9
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:26,530
which means we use 
a vertical LinearLayout as well.

10
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:30,590
And here's the code, we created a new
list_item_forecasts_today.<i>xml</i> file

11
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:32,259
under the layout folder.

12
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:35,120
The code looks very similar
to list_item_forecast.

13
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,760
It has a horizontal LinearLayout, 
as a root element.

14
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,510
The first child is a vertical LinearLayout

15
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:42,970
with width zero and a weight of one.

16
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:45,386
The second child is another 
vertical LinearLayout

17
00:00:45,386 --> 00:00:47,622
with a width of zero and a weight of one,

18
00:00:47,622 --> 00:00:50,240
that way the horizontal space
will be distributed evenly

19
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,640
among each child.

20
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,736
If you go back to the first LinearLayout,

21
00:00:53,736 --> 00:00:56,060
notice that we have 
three TextViews within it,

22
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:58,980
for date, high temperature, 
and low temperature.

23
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:01,240
We specify gravity 
to be center horizontal,

24
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:04,260
so anything within the LinearLayout 
will be centered horizontally.

25
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:08,440
Otherwise, by default, they would be 
left-aligned to the LinearLayout.

26
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:10,990
The same applies for the 
second LinearLayout.

27
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:14,360
We specify gravity to be 
center horizontal so that the icon

28
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:18,700
and the weather forecast TextView 
within it are also centered horizontally.
