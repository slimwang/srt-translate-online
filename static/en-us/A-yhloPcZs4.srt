1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,800
Now let's do a quiz on DES.

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:05,170
Check all the statements that are true.

3
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:09,298
First, to decrypt using DES,
the same algorithm is used,

4
00:00:09,298 --> 00:00:13,630
but with per-round keys
used in the reversed order.

5
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:21,729
Second, with triple DES the effective
key length can be 56, 112 and 168.

6
00:00:21,729 --> 00:00:28,260
Third, each round of DES contains both
substitution and permutation operations.

7
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:33,322
Fourth, the logics behind the S-boxes
are well-known and verified.
