00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:04,780
Many forms ask for addresses,
E-commerce in particular.

2
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:10,090
Incidentally addresses are often
incredibly annoying parts of the form

3
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:12,700
because they require so
many input fields.

4
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:18,810
There are street address, postal codes,
territories, countries, region, etc.

5
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:25,390
But luckily, addresses can be pretty
easily generated from a mobile device.

6
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:32,130
Essentially all mobile devices have
location services through gps or wi-fi.

7
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:33,930
By accessing geo location,

8
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:38,390
you can often auto fill addresses
to within a fairly close range.

9
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:40,480
Users might need to adjust a bit but

10
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,840
manipulating one input is
obviously better than eight.

11
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,880
For example Uber,
in this example, you could see

12
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:52,520
how we got the location of the users
with this simple JavaScript code.

13
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:57,170
Another way to do it will be to
allow users the auto fill option.

14
00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:00,590
Here you could see that with
only few clicks I have been

15
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:04,280
able to retrieve a location
that was previously saved.

16
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:09,830
When you search for a car, the app uses
your location to guess your address.

17
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:14,780
And when you sign up they ask for
permission to use your location.

18
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:19,720

services on the web, Android, and
