>> Well we know that we want A over here to equal 300. Now for the length, which

2
00:00:04,428 --> 00:00:08,987
was originally 15 feet, you want to tack on an extra distance of x to it. So our

3
00:00:08,987 --> 00:00:13,581
length will be 15 plus x. We do a similar thing for our width. It's going to be

4
00:00:13,581 --> 00:00:18,178
10 plus x. So here's our equation. And of course it does not matter which order

5
00:00:18,178 --> 00:00:23,115
you have these factors in because of the commutative property of multiplication.
