You just ran three demo programs. The first program gave the correct view of

2
00:00:03,625 --> 00:00:06,971
the scene. The next two demos were a bit more mysterious, call them mystery

3
00:00:06,971 --> 00:00:10,360
demos number 1 and number 2. The question to you is, which of the following is

4
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:16,378
true? Number 1 draws objects in a fixed order, number 2 draws objects front to

5
00:00:16,378 --> 00:00:19,544
back. Number 1 draws objects front to back, number 2 draws objects back to

6
00:00:19,544 --> 00:00:23,273
front. Number one draws objects front to back, number two draws objects in a

7
00:00:23,273 --> 00:00:26,947
fixed order. Or number one draws objects in a fixed order, number two draws

8
00:00:26,947 --> 00:00:28,560
objects back to front.
