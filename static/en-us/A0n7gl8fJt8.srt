1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,180
Now that your done with the lectures, it's not the end.

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:08,510
One of the things you might consider doing is putting together a lessons learned presentation.

3
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:14,100
This summarizes everything you learned week to week either by watching the lectures

4
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:17,580
or hopefully getting out of the building and talking to customers.

5
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:19,710
What to do with that presentation?

6
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:23,060
Well number 1 is you could post it to the forums, and we'll select the best presentations

7
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:25,330
and put them on Steve's blog.

8
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:28,310
The second is you might use this as a prototype

9
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:32,439
for actually thinking about how to talk to investors and how to talk to other customers.

10
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:38,240
But what do you do next after this class really depends on you.

11
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:41,050
One is, it could have been a good exercise for you to decide whether

12
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:43,780
entrepreneurship is for you or not.

13
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:48,970
Next could have been is you've decided whether your idea is worth pursuing or not.

14
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:54,400
Third is, if you have and you still like your team members after getting out of the building

15
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:59,540
and working hard, you could decide that the next step might actually be to pursue this idea

16
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:03,660
either in an incubator, an accelorator, trying to raise some funds,

17
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:07,000
or trying to take the company to the next step.

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,910
What I hope is this class gave you a small taste of what entrepreneurship feels like,

19
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:15,720
and what are the things you need to do.

20
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:18,440
There is a ton more to learn. Take a look at the rest of the Udacity courses.

21
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:23,020
Take a look at steveblank.com and Alexander Osterwalder's website,

22
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:25,570
businessmodelgeneration.com.

23
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:28,120
I also recommend checking out startupweekend.org

24
00:01:28,120 --> 99:59:59,999
for other events and other courses, and we'll see you when you're a public company.
