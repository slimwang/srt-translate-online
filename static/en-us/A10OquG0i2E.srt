1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:01,609
What did you write, David?

2
00:00:01,609 --> 00:00:04,950
>> So, I wrote the sentence as
Bill propelled a bullet into Bob.

3
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:06,978
I looked up the verb shot and

4
00:00:06,978 --> 00:00:10,790
decided what that really means is
pulling the trigger on a gun, which

5
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:15,600
results in a bullet being propelled at
high velocity out of the gun's barrel.

6
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,410
So, it's fair to say that shot
becomes propelled a bullet.

7
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:22,010
Given that,
I now have propel as my primitive.

8
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:24,960
I have the same rule that says
an animate agent that immediately

9
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,830
precedes the verb becomes
the agent in the frame.

10
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:30,440
So, Bill is now my agent.

11
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:34,070
I have my rule that says an inanimate
object that immediately follows the verb

12
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:35,100
becomes the object.

13
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,490
So, bullet is now my object.

14
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:38,190
Even though bullet wasn't
in the original sentence,

15
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:40,970
it's by rephrasing it that
I can pull that object out.

16
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:44,000
And I can use the constraints of into to

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,510
determine that the destination
of the bullet is inside Bob.

18
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:48,550
>> That's good, David.

19
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:51,310
But know this sentence could have
another interpretation also.

20
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:54,818
Imagine that Bill had a camera, and Bill
will soon be taking pictures of Bob.

21
00:00:54,818 --> 00:00:56,620
>> That's true, Ashoke.

22
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:59,820
And I bet if we had used Bill takes
a picture of Bob as the meaning of shoot

23
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,970
earlier in this lesson, that's probably
what I would've thought of first.

24
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:06,790
If I wanted to then put Bill shot Bob
in terms of taking a picture into this

25
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:11,330
form, I'd first rewrite it as
Bill took a picture of Bob.

26
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:13,000
>> That's really interesting, David.

27
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,810
Because notice if you say
Bill took a picture of Bob,

28
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:19,890
it's not clear into what primitive
action will this took map into.

29
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:22,200
Perhaps we can discuss
this more on the forum.

30
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,860
There's one more thing to notice here.

31
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:27,330
Like David says, I can have multiple
interpretations of Bill shot Bob.

32
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:30,740
This sentence doesn't help me resolve
between those interpretations.

33
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:33,850
Perhaps it is something coming
before this sentence in the story or

34
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:36,590
something coming after that
that will help me disambiguate.

35
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:39,300
From the sentence itself we can
simply construct two particular

36
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:40,120
interpretations.
