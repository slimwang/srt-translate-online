1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
In this problem, we are told to define a function called countdown.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,770
Countdown takes one parameter--the number that it countdowns from--

3
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:09,810
let's call it "n." Don't forget the colon.

4
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:14,180
The goal here is to countdown from "n" all the way down to blastoff.

5
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:16,520
This sounds like something that is going to need a while loop.

6
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:19,990
Let's get started. Let's leave the condition blank for now--

7
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:22,860
because we already know what we need to do inside the while loop,

8
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:24,990
and that is, print the number.

9
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:27,460
We also know at the end, that we want to blastoff.

10
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:29,560
So we have two things to fill in.

11
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:33,030
One, how long we countdown for?

12
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:36,070
Lastly, what do we do after every count?

13
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:41,680
If we look at the sample, the last time that we count is when n=1.

14
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,380
So, one way to do that is saying while "n" is greater than zero.

15
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:49,920
Every time we countdown, we subtract 1 from "n"--so let's do that--

16
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,920
and all together, this will produce the outcome as expected.
