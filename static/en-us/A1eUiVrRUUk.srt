00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So, what happens if we take this big HTML input

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
and run it through our simplification procedure?

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Let's find this out. We click on "Run."

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
You see that the simplification algorithm correctly returns select,

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:20,000
which actually means that it has been able to very nicely simplify this complex input

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
into just these eight characters.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Let's take a look into how this actually operates.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm inserting a print statement in here, which gives us a representation of the string

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
as well as it's length,

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
so we can see whatever simplify has been working on

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
and down here we can see how simplify() operates.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
It first takes the entire string,

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
then it takes the first half, tests this, fails again.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Of this it takes the first half, fails again.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Takes the first half, fails again, and there we go.

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
With a technique like this, we can automatically simplify any input.

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
All we need is an automated test that tells us whether the program in question

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
passes or fails.

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Unfortunately, at this point our strategy is not yet perfect.

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
We'll have to refine it a bit, because it doesn't work well for all inputs.

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
What happens if we put in another HTML input--that is select, foo, and end of select?

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
What do we get as a simplified input with this function?

23
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
So, here's our quiz. What's the result of simplify() here?

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
With this input: <select>foo</select>

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,169
Is it a string consisting out of the eight characters <select>?

26
00:01:30,184 --> 00:01:35,000
Is it a string consisting of <select> and the first two characters of foo?

27
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Is it a string consisting of <select> and all of foo?

28
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,979
Or is it the entire HTML input? Over to you.
