1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,070
Of all the Android launch devices,

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:05,920
the Nexus 1 will always 
hold a special place in my heart.

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:08,860
That's not to take anything away 
from my first Android device,

4
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:12,810
the HTC G1, that launched Android 
to the world with its distinctive chin

5
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:14,930
and slide-out keyboard.

6
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:18,320
Or the HTC Magic, 
first prerelease android phone

7
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,520
I got to dog food
when I joined Google.

8
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,430
And the first, the wave of devices
we gave every attendee

9
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:26,320
starting at Google I/O in 2009.

10
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:31,180
2010 was the year Android went from 
"that's interesting" to global phenomenon.

11
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:34,510
Growing from 100,000 
activations a day in May,

12
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:37,070
to over 300,000 by December.

13
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:40,310
That was seriously helped 
by the release of the Motorola Droid.

14
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:42,850
I can still remember 
the offices here in Building 44,

15
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:47,780
echoing with the constant refrain
of "Droid" as each device rebooted.

16
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:51,660
The Droid was the first of the thinner, 
higher res, more powerful Android devices

17
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:53,960
that have since become standard.

18
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:57,510
And it was also the device whose 
release on Verizon here in the U.S.,

19
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:00,400
really kicked off the flood 
of Android activations.

20
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,810
But I was a Londoner then,

21
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:04,096
and the Droid was
a [inaudible] only phone,

22
00:01:04,096 --> 00:01:06,842
so it was never really
a device I truly used.

23
00:01:06,842 --> 00:01:10,620
Then, there was the Nexus 1, 
code-named Passion.

24
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:15,160
The first device I felt was pure Android,
was also the phone we brought with us

25
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:18,990
on our 2010 Android 
Developer Labs World Tour.

26
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:21,280
Me and my colleagues 
traveled across the world.

27
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,040
Seven cities in ten days,
introducing over 20,000 developers

28
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,450
to Android by way of presentations
and a free Nexus 1.

29
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:32,560
As a result, I made
a lot of friends across Europe,

30
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,890
and learned exactly 
how many boxes of phones

31
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:39,530
I can carry across snow drifts 
in Stockholm, and icy roads in Berlin.

32
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:43,540
Since then, The Nexus S4 and 5
have each improved on what it takes

33
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:45,610
to make a great Android phone.

34
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:49,820
And OEMs across the world, have created
thousands of different Android devices.

35
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:51,483
Starting with the Motorola Xoom,

36
00:01:51,483 --> 00:01:54,306
which led Android's 
official expansion into tablets,

37
00:01:54,306 --> 00:01:57,030
and leading the way 
for the Nexus 7 and 10.

38
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:58,830
But that was just the start.

39
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:01,590
Those changes paved the way 
for the Android [inaudible]

40
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:03,990
to grow into what could be, 
the brains behind anything

41
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:08,870
from phones and tablets, to TVs, 
cars and wearables, like Android Wear.

42
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:10,940
It's impossible to know, what comes next.

43
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:11,950
Who knows?

44
00:02:11,951 --> 00:02:15,771
Maybe the next Android devices, 
will be Androids themselves.
