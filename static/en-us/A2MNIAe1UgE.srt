1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:05,070
So, the first, as we just talked about,
the scroll bar and the handle.

2
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:08,860
The user could click on that handle and
drag it up and down.

3
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:10,540
>> So, even more basic than that.

4
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:12,460
Why does this application exist?

5
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:15,180
What is the user's main purpose for
the application?

6
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:19,740
>> Just to view the text that we're-
>> So, our basic use case is read text,

7
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:20,400
view text.

8
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,130
And then, you've got one for moving
a handle to see other parts of the file.

9
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:25,730
What else?

10
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:30,505
>> And then,
the user could drag the view ports,

11
00:00:30,505 --> 00:00:34,420
can adjust the size of the frame.

12
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:37,108
>> So, we can resize the view port.

13
00:00:37,108 --> 00:00:39,150
So, those are the three
primary use cases for

14
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:41,960
this particular application
that we're going to consider.
