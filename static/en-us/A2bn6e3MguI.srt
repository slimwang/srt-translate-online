1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,190
I chose to delete this edge here.

2
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:06,020
I started by coloring this vertex green,
and

3
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:09,500
then reasoning about what colors
the other vertices might be.

4
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:13,950
Assuming that I don't delete this edge,
this vertex here has to be orange.

5
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:18,050
And assuming that I don't delete this
edge here, this one has to be green.

6
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:22,360
And assuming I don't delete this edge
here, this one has to be orange again.

7
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:27,510
And that's okay, because this edge here
has one green and one orange vertex.

8
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:32,170
This vertex here must be green,
since both of its neighbors are orange.

9
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:34,860
This last vertex here has both green and

10
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:38,680
orange neighbors, so
I need to delete one of its edges.

11
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:42,010
I picked this edge to delete,
and I colored it orange.
