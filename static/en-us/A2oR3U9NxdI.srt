00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:04,350
Let's take a quiz now in which we will
compute some of the performance metrics

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:06,560
for a preemptive scheduler.

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,970
An OS scheduler uses a priority-based
algorithm with preemption

4
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:12,740
to schedule tasks.

5
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:16,960
Given the values that are shown in this
table, complete the finishing times for

6
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,040
each of the three tasks.

7
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:23,738
Also assume that the priorities are such
that P3 is slower than P2 is, and

8
00:00:23,738 --> 00:00:25,700
then is slower than P1.

9
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:30,360
Write the finish times of each of the
tasks in the boxed areas provided here.
