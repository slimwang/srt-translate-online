[Thrun] To answer this question, let us add up these numbers.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Battery age is 1, 1, 1.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
This has 1 incoming arc, so it's 2.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Two incoming arcs makes 4.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
One incoming arc is 2, 2 equals 4.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Four incoming arcs makes 16.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 99:59:59,999
If we add all the right numbers, we get 47.
