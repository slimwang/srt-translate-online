1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:02,440
How did this project go?

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:04,180
I mean, you did something awesome.

3
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:07,826
You built an app from scratch and
it was probably frustrating.

4
00:00:07,826 --> 00:00:11,242
And at times you might have wanted
to quit, but you did it, and

5
00:00:11,242 --> 00:00:14,410
you have something awesome to show for
it.

6
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:15,850
And in this lesson,

7
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:19,020
you'll become a better developer
by reflecting on what happened.

8
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:22,650
And we'll pose a series of
questions that you can answer and

9
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:27,240
just see what you might have done
differently or what you did really well.

10
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,300
Log these experiences on your blog,
if you've been keeping it.

11
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,316
Or if you'd like to keep it more
private, we have a little text box for

12
00:00:33,316 --> 00:00:34,520
you to give your response.
