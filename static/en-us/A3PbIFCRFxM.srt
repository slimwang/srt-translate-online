00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:04,057
Thinking about the function you just filled out the table for, let's look at

2
00:00:04,057 --> 00:00:11,361
what values f of x has, as x increases by 1, over and over again. 1x is 1. f of

3
00:00:11,361 --> 00:00:19,925
1 is 2. 1x is 2. f of x is 4, or 2 times 2. And when x is 3, well, f of 3 is 8,

4
00:00:19,925 --> 00:00:26,412
which is 2 times 2 times 2. To get f of 4, we would take f of 3 and multiply

5
00:00:26,412 --> 00:00:33,278
that by 2 one more time. I see a bunch of repeated multiplication here. Can you

6
00:00:33,278 --> 00:00:36,819
think of another way to write this? Think about things that you learned very

7
00:00:36,819 --> 00:00:42,496
early on in this course. Please use that more compact notation to rewrite these

8
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:48,000
three values of f. Then please tell me what f of 10 is, what f of 100 is, and

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,300
what f of x is.
