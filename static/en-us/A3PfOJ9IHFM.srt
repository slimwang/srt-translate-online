00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:04,400
What is a freelancer and how can
they help you build your startup?

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,060
Freelancers are workers who charge
an hourly or project based rate for

3
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:12,100
their skills without being considered
an employee of your company.

4
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:16,110
There's people with all types of skills
that offer their services as freelancers

5
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:19,720
and there's a few basic ideas you should
understand before working with one.

6
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:23,400
First let's look at some of the benefits
of working with a freelancer.

7
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,140
Freelancers can be great for
your business.

8
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:28,430
If you don't want to commit to a full
time employee or have a limited and

9
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:29,800
temporary need.

10
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:33,890
For example, maybe you need to use
specialized experience with a technology

11
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:34,980
you don't know or

12
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:39,410
need to complete a series of small tasks
that would take too long to do yourself.

13
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:41,090
If you have any of
these requirements for

14
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:45,490
your business this could be an excellent
opportunity to work with a freelancer.

15
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:48,220
While there are benefits to
working with the freelancer.,

16
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:50,160
it's important to understand
some of the downsides.

17
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:54,230
First, working with
freelancers can be very tricky.

18
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:57,380
It's difficult to evaluate
the skills of a freelancer and

19
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:59,830
because of this it's also risky.

20
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:02,810
If you don't have recommendations
from people you personally know

21
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:07,040
then you need to evaluate the skills of
each freelancer from their portfolio.

22
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,295
Also communication can be a problem.

23
00:01:09,295 --> 00:01:12,980
You'll need to be aware of language
barriers and time zone differences and

24
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:15,770
be patient with some of
the issues this can cause.

25
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:18,730
While it can be difficult to find
a freelancer there are some great

26
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:21,540
platforms available for
you to make your decisions.

27
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:25,060
To start try using websites
such as Freelancer, Fiverr, and

28
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:28,860
UpWork but
there are many other possibilities.

29
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:31,910
The benefits of using these sites is
that they usually have some type of

30
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:34,310
quality assurance in place for
their workers.

31
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:37,860
There's also often more than one person
on the team to help minimize the risk

32
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:40,250
that your project won't be completed.

33
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:42,870
And most of your communication
will be done through writing so

34
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:44,290
be careful that you're clear and

35
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:48,140
concise about what you need from
any freelancer you're working with.

36
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:51,180
Freelancers provide an amazing
opportunity to get the skills you need

37
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:52,580
for your business.

38
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:54,010
Once you get used to the process,

39
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:56,880
it can really help accelerate
your growth as a company.

40
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,300
Take some time to decide if you think
it's possible to use freelancers to get

41
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,190
any of the skills you need for
your business.
