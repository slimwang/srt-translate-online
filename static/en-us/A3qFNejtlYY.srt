1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,368
Therefore, when we have this test statistic that measures whether or not there

2
00:00:04,368 --> 00:00:10,269
are significant differences between three or more samples. We have to construct

3
00:00:10,269 --> 00:00:14,823
this statistic so that as within-group variability increases the test statistic

4
00:00:14,823 --> 00:00:20,108
decreases. Becomes more in favor of the null, meaning that the sample means are

5
00:00:20,108 --> 00:00:25,322
less likely to be different from each other. And this statistic should also

6
00:00:25,322 --> 00:00:29,165
take into account that as between group variability increases, the test

7
00:00:29,165 --> 00:00:34,838
statistic increases. The sample means are more likely to be different from each

8
00:00:34,838 --> 00:00:40,550
other. We can do this by making a test statistic. Let's call it f. A ratio of

9
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:45,878
the between group variability and within group variability. Which should be in

10
00:00:45,878 --> 00:00:49,857
the numerator, and which should be in the denominator?
