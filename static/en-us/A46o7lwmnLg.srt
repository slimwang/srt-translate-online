00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,589
You've initialized your scene with lights, objects and a camera. Naturally, the

2
00:00:03,589 --> 00:00:06,895
next step is to render. If you look through an entire Three.js program you've

3
00:00:06,895 --> 00:00:11,998
seen this line, telling the renderer class to render the scene. It's possible

4
00:00:11,998 --> 00:00:14,770
to call the renderer once during initialization and be done, but usually we

5
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:19,664
want to have the scene be updated as needed. Once the scene is set up, calling

6
00:00:19,664 --> 00:00:22,938
the animate function gets things rolling. The key bit of magic is the

7
00:00:22,938 --> 00:00:26,650
window.requestAnimationFrame call, which in turn uses the animate method

8
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:32,170
itself. This method will start up a rendering whenever it makes sense to do so.

9
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:34,650
The other thing that requestAnimationFrame does for you is help lower the

10
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:38,832
temperature of your computer. No, really. Say you have a webGL program running

11
00:00:38,832 --> 00:00:42,272
in a browser window. If you switch to another tab, the browser will know that

12
00:00:42,272 --> 00:00:46,350
the program is no longer visible and it will not keep it running. The animate

13
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:50,104
method calls the render method to well, render the scene. Actually, it can do

14
00:00:50,104 --> 00:00:53,750
much more than that. I like to separate out the render method itself just to

15
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:57,350
keep track of what's doing what. This method is where you want to put code that

16
00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:01,506
performs changes before rendering the scene. For example, if the user modifies

17
00:01:01,506 --> 00:01:05,330
the slider, the slider's value is used here to modify the scene. We've seen

18
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:08,339
that in previous programs. If you have a bouncing ball animation, you change

19
00:01:08,339 --> 00:01:12,140
the position of the ball here. This is where animation gets going.
