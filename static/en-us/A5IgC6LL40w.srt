On UNIX-based systems,

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:05,930
init is the first process that starts after the system boots.

3
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:09,840
And because all other processes can ultimately be traced to init,

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,730
it's referred to as the parent of all processes.

5
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:16,990
On the Android OS, Zygote is a daemon process which has

6
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:20,380
the single purpose of launching app processes.

7
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:25,650
The OS accomplishes this by forking the Zygote process every time a new

8
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:30,580
app needs to be created, so the Zygote process is the parent of all of the apps.
