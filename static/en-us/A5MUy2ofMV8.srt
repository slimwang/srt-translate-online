1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,123
Now this is a good example of what we learned in lesson one, that different

2
00:00:03,123 --> 00:00:06,489
psychologists have different view points or perspectives in terms of how they

3
00:00:06,489 --> 00:00:12,050
explain behavior and sometimes they're very passionate about those view points.

4
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:15,534
Now throughout the course we discuss the importance about nature and nurture in

5
00:00:15,534 --> 00:00:19,668
learning. And it's also important to hear when we're looking at how we learn to

6
00:00:19,668 --> 00:00:25,079
comprehend and to produce language. The social cultural theory of language

7
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:29,300
suggests that things such as schooling, our peers, birth order, socioeconomic

8
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:35,797
status and our parents all contribute to our language development. And we know

9
00:00:35,797 --> 00:00:38,506
that imitation is important and you should remember that from the lesson on

10
00:00:38,506 --> 00:00:43,090
learning. An interesting example of imitation, did you know that infants as

11
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:46,470
young as 50 minutes old will open their mouths and stick out their tongues when

12
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:50,420
they see adults do. That's pretty powerful.
