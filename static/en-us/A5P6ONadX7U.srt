00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:01,450
Hey, everybody.

2
00:00:01,450 --> 00:00:03,460
I hope the course has been fun so far.

3
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:05,620
This lesson can be
particularly challenging, but

4
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:07,700
I want you to know that
I've been in your shoes.

5
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:10,200
So, to ease you into building
the My Favorite Movies app,

6
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,730
here are a couple things I
want to call to your attention.

7
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:15,630
First, some of the app's been
implemented ahead of time.

8
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:18,760
This is going to allow us to focus
on just the networking code.

9
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:23,060
Second, the AppDelegate's used like
a singleton to get the NSURL session.

10
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:25,190
If you've never heard
about singletons before,

11
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:27,500
check out the link in
the instructor notes.

12
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:32,100
And last, we've broken each HTTP
request into a seven-step process and

13
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,980
we'll cover that in just a moment.

14
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:36,350
For now, let's get started
with the movie database.
