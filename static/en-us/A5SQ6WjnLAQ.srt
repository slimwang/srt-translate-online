1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:04,450
We pass the code we want to
test into the expect function.

2
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:08,850
And we chain a rule set function,
which is called a matcher, onto the end.

3
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:12,570
We pass what we know to be
the correct value to our matcher.

4
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:15,350
We know that 0.3 is the result we want

5
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:20,144
when we call our add function with
0.1 and 0.2 as its parameters.
