1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:04,333
So, let's start out what we know first. We know what we want to test. So, I'll

2
00:00:04,333 --> 00:00:07,322
go into the plot tester and I'll create a new plot of the size that we did the

3
00:00:07,322 --> 00:00:11,530
example for. And then, I'll print out the actual which should be the number of

4
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:15,610
fields, if the radius is 400. And then, I'll print out the expected number that

5
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:19,468
we calculated, which was 8. Now, to actually do the calculation, first thing I

6
00:00:19,468 --> 00:00:23,735
do is calculate the number of rows, which should be an int. And the way that we

7
00:00:23,735 --> 00:00:27,310
did that was to calculate the length minus the diameter, divided by the radius

8
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:31,394
times the square root of 3. But that wasn't counting the first row, so I've

9
00:00:31,394 --> 00:00:35,010
gotta add the first row back. And since there are some doubles in here, I won't

10
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:38,590
automatically get integer division. So, to drop the fractional part, I'll need

11
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:42,454
to actually cast this. Now, I haven't actually defined diameter. But that's

12
00:00:42,454 --> 00:00:46,580
just twice the radius. After that, I calculated the number of odd rows. Which

13
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:51,136
was the total number of rows, plus one, divided by two. And the number of even

14
00:00:51,136 --> 00:00:54,808
rows, was just n rows over two. The number of columns in each odd row, was

15
00:00:54,808 --> 00:00:59,018
based on the width and the diameter. I want to make sure that I actually get an

16
00:00:59,018 --> 00:01:03,347
int here. So, I notice that the width is an int and the diameter is also an

17
00:01:03,347 --> 00:01:08,435
int. So, that's good. The column is an even row was the width, but we couldn't

18
00:01:08,435 --> 00:01:13,122
use that first space at the left. So, we have to subtract off one radius before

19
00:01:13,122 --> 00:01:17,988
we divide to see how many diameters fit across. And then, the total number of

20
00:01:17,988 --> 00:01:22,191
fields is the odd rows times the number of columns per odd row. And then, the

21
00:01:22,191 --> 00:01:25,519
number of even rows times the number of columns per even row and this number of

22
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:30,471
fields is what we wanted to return. Let's find all my typos, oh got lucky that

23
00:01:30,471 --> 00:01:33,865
time. Let's see if the plot tester agrees, look's like it at least works for

24
00:01:33,865 --> 00:01:38,350
the example we checked. That's a good sign. That was a pretty tricky problem.

25
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:40,620
If you struggled, way to stick with it.
