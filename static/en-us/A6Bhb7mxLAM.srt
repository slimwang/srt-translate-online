00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:04,839
Here's the solution. This is the code we had before. What we need to do is to

2
00:00:04,839 --> 00:00:09,596
put it inside a try and add an exception handler. So now, when this code raises

3
00:00:09,596 --> 00:00:13,254
an IOError, when the file can't be opened, we'll print our nice message and

4
00:00:13,254 --> 00:00:17,316
maybe you came up with a more creative message than this one. After the try,

5
00:00:17,316 --> 00:00:19,593
execution continues normally.
