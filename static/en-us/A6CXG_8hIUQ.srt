Try solving this third problem. What do you think would be the value of m?

2
00:00:03,575 --> 00:00:08,672
Notice that m is the base here, and also we have a fraction. We have log with

3
00:00:08,672 --> 00:00:15,010
base m of 1 16th equal to negative 4. When you think you know the value of m,

4
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:16,622
write it here.
