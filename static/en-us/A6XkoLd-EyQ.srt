1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,030
So these two numbers 3 plus 4i and 3 minus 4i. Both of which you remember were

2
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:09,770
solutions to a quadratic equation we solved before, are called complex

3
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:14,826
conjugates of one another. Everything about them is the same. Except for the

4
00:00:14,826 --> 00:00:19,531
sign between their real and imaginary components. And when we multiply them

5
00:00:19,531 --> 00:00:24,458
together, we get a real number. Considering this new term, what do you think the

6
00:00:24,458 --> 00:00:27,290
complex conjugate of the number 2 minus 3i is?
