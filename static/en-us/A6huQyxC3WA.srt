00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,090
Naturally the next question is,

2
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:05,520
what would you expect the parameter this to get bound to?

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,420
In order to answer that we must recall the rule that we plan to

4
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:11,540
use when deciding what the keyword this will refer to.

5
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:15,350
Take a moment to try and restate the simplified rule that we'll be using to

6
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:17,680
determine what value this gets bound to.
