To take The Brain That Changes Itself off the list, I first have to figure out

00:00:03,532 --> 00:00:08,716
what its index is. Originally, it was three. Zero, one, two, three, but then I

00:00:08,716 --> 00:00:13,658
added another one, before it, so now it's four. So I'll remove the item at

4
00:00:13,658 --> 00:00:18,635
index four. I think you're more familiar with basic ArrayList modifications

00:00:18,635 --> 00:00:23,524
now. Let's go back to Kai to talk about, how to do computations that take the

00:00:23,524 --> 00:00:26,664
entire ArrayList into account.
