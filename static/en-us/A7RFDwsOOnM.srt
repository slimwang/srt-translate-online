1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The answer of the quiz is D.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
The first enqueue operation returns true because in a 2-element queue

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
where we haven't inserted many elements there's space to insert an element.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
The second enqueue call succeeds for the same reason.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
The third enqueue call fails and returns false, because there was no room left

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
in a 2-element queue after 2 enqueue operations had already succeeded.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Because we have a FIFO queue, the first dequeue operation returns the first element

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
that we'd added to the queue--that is to say 6,

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
the second dequeue operation returns 7,

10
00:00:32,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and the third dequeue operation, which is now called on an empty queue, returns none.
