00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,620
Since these problems have
been around for a long time,

2
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:05,350
why are we only now getting
around to solving them?

3
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:09,970
One reason is the increasing
incidence of chronic disease for

4
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:12,540
at least the two reasons
illustrated here.

5
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:16,630
As you probably know, people are living
longer, as we can see by comparing

6
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:24,270
the green bars, from 1999 to 2000, with
the blue bars, only ten years later.

7
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:27,560
Chronic disease rates increase with age.

8
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:28,690
So, that's reason one.

9
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:32,439
Moreover, in large part due to
behavioral issues such as increase in

10
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:36,560
obesity, the rates of chronic disease
have increased significantly,

11
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:39,080
even over this relatively
short time period.
