00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Welcome to Unit 5. Today we talk about actual robot motion.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
In the previous unit we talked about how to find paths .

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Now we'll talk about how to turn these paths into actual motion commands.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
In particular, we'll talk about generating smooth paths.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Then we'll talk about control.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
In particular, a method called PID control.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
As usual, you get a chance to program all these wonderful things.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
You might be remember that our planning took place in a discrete world,

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
and the type of plans we found look very much like this,

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
perhaps in response to obstacles over here.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Now, a path like this has lots of disadvantages.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
You don't want to a robot to go straight, take a 90-degree turn and go straight again.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
For one, a car can't even do this, but for another this will force the robot to move

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
really slowly around the corner over here.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
A much better path would look like this.

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
This is a smoother path.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
In the extreme case, you might even generate a path just like this.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The question becomes can we modify the blue path to look more like the red or the green path?

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Suppose your car like a robot right over here wished to get to right over here.

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Which path would you prefer?

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
The blue path, the red one, or the green one?

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Just check one of the three.

23
00:01:31,000 --> 99:59:59,999
This is a question where I check your intuition. This is not a mathematically precise question.
