1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:02,969
Okay, our XML's looking pretty slick,
but

2
00:00:02,969 --> 00:00:05,960
we still have to add
the interactivity with Java.

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:08,880
Now, using the previous
exercises as an example,

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,960
you're going to make the right
side update for team_b.

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,520
Before doing anything else you're
going to copy and paste the code for

6
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:21,430
displayForTeamB from the instructor
notes into your own code.

7
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:23,550
And you're going to update
the text view ID for

8
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:28,010
Team B to team_b_score,
if you haven't already.

9
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:29,710
I'll show you how to
do both of these now.

10
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:33,050
All right, here we are in our Java code.

11
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:38,240
I've got the display for Team B code
copied, I'm going to do this right

12
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:43,850
below, not inside but below,
the displayForTeamA and paste.

13
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:46,320
To make it not inside,

14
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,150
you want to make sure that it's
after this bracket right here.

15
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:53,490
And you know that the two curly braces
match up because when you put your

16
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:57,440
cursor next to one of the curly braces,
the other one highlights.

17
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:02,540
Okay, so
I've pasted this code here, good.

18
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:08,080
Now I need to go over to my XML code,
get rid of the preview, okay.

19
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:13,410
And I'm going to scroll down
to this TextView here, and

20
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:18,150
I actually already updated this in the
last video, but if you need to update

21
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:23,890
it, I'm going to pretend I didn't, you
could type id and set the id attribute.

22
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:31,260
And remember, you want the @+id/ and
then you type the id that you want,

23
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:38,630
in my case, I want team_b_score,
okay, cool.

24
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:41,990
Okay, and now you're pretty much
ready to start hooking up the Java.

25
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:44,820
I'm not going to give you too,
too many instructions, but,

26
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:48,320
if you're feeling like you might get
stuck, here's some things to consider.

27
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,860
Think about how you're
going to associate the buttons

28
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:53,095
with running some code in, Java.

29
00:01:53,095 --> 00:01:56,700
This was one of the first steps
we did for the team a side.

30
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,375
Next, consider hat new variable or
variables you'll need.

31
00:02:00,375 --> 00:02:02,245
Hint, you're going to need at least one.

32
00:02:03,445 --> 00:02:06,225
Finally, think a little bit about
what's going to happen when you click

33
00:02:06,225 --> 00:02:06,805
on each button.

34
00:02:07,805 --> 00:02:10,245
Now, I just want to point
out that these steps

35
00:02:10,245 --> 00:02:14,125
loosely relate to the steps we
used to make the team a side.

36
00:02:14,125 --> 00:02:16,090
So if you're feeling really,
really stuck,

37
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:19,920
reviewing those videos again might be
helpful, and then, once you're done,

38
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:24,100
you have the satisfaction of checking
off this box, okay, get to it.
