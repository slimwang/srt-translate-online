00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Several statistics we can compute in a pretty straightforward way if the list L is sorted.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Let's imagine that these are list of values that we're concerned about and I put little

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
pointy things on it to say that this is now sorted from smallest to largest.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
If this L is sorted the minimum value is sitting here in the very first position--so it's L(â),

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
the maximum is sitting all the way at the end here--L(n-â),

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
midpoint is just the average of those two--so we can look up the minimum, the maximum

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
add them together and divided by 2, and the median is just whoever is

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
sitting in the middle of this list once it's sorted.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:42,000
In this case, all of these operations run in Î(1) constant time, given that the list is sorted.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Things like the mean or the mode aren't quite so straightforward to do on a sorted

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
list like this but these four we can do very, very quickly.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Just to practice this idea, here's little quiztistics. Here's a sorted list of two digit numbers.

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I want you to find the midpoint and the median of this list

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
and then tell me what's the mean of those two values.

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
You can write it in this box.
