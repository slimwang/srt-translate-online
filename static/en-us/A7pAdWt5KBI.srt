00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Let's get another example and this time will be quite a bit more specific.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
We already wrote a random tester for the little bounded line queue data structure

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and one thing we might want to ask ourselves is "Did that further do a good job at all?"

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Well, if you wrote a queue and find all the type of the bugs that I seeded in the queued data structure,

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
then you probably did a pretty job but let's take a look again.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
We're going to do is we're going to look at the queue as a finite state machine.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
We're going to see what kind of states we can drive that machine into using the random tester.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
We're going to start off with an empty queue and 50% of the time, at this point,

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
we're going to make a dequeue call, which is going to fail, 50% of the time,

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
we're going to enqueue something resulting in a queue containing one element.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Okay, from here, it should be pretty obvious what could happen.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
We can dequeue something going back to the empty state

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
or enqueue something going to the two element state unless it is assumed that that's full.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
And so, the dynamic process that we're going to get when we run a random tester is

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
some sort of a random walk through this finite state machine.

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
And so, what we want to ask ourselves is

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
"Does this random walk have a reasonable probability of executing all the cases?"

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
And so here, probably the most interesting cases are dequeuing from an empty queue,

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
enqueuing to a full queue, and then walking around the rest of the states base.

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
And so, what I've done is, I rig the random tester with some extra static skipping,

21
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
so you can tell us about this a little bit--so let's go take a look at that.
