00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,020
The answer is 120 million,
so if Buffet trades only 120

2
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:10,980
times per year,
Simons has to trade 120 million times.

3
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:12,680
So here's how I arrived at that.

4
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:15,500
We know that their information
ratios are the same, so

5
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,770
we just set the equation
equal to each other.

6
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:21,680
One for Simons and one for Buffet.

7
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,310
So the information coefficient for
Buffet, times square to 120.

8
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:28,660
This is Buffet's information ratio.

9
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:31,950
Now this is Simon's information ratio.

10
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:35,510
It's his information coefficient
times the square root of x,

11
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:37,200
which is what we're trying to find.

12
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:42,169
Now first thing we can do is replace
ICS with what we know is that

13
00:00:42,169 --> 00:00:45,620
it's one-one thousandth of Buffet's.

14
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:50,360
Now we can multiply both sides by 1,000.

15
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,990
And divide both sides by Buffet's IC.

16
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:55,710
And we get this.

17
00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:01,480
And now we just square both sides and
we're left with x or 120 million.

18
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:07,760
Okay, that's it for the fundamental
law of active portfolio management.

19
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,280
I'll see you again soon, thanks.
