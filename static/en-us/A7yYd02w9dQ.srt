1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,360
So before we were dragging fields onto the page.

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:02,700
>> Uh-huh.

3
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:05,440
>> But now what were trying to drag on, is a list of related records.

4
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,580
>> Okay, so I should click Related List over here.

5
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:08,270
>> Exactly.

6
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:14,210
>> Okay, good. Set times, and I'll drag it down and that's lovely.

7
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:16,610
>> Awesome. Click Save. Don't forget that guy.

8
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:19,840
>> Thank you. You've added or moved Related Lists

9
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,420
to this page layout. Yeah, I always want to overwrite.

10
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:24,330
>> We want everyone to see the set times.

11
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:25,510
>> Yeah. Set times are important.

12
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:31,320
Cool, set times. But that's totally lame, I don't care about ST 0001.

13
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:31,480
>> Yeah.

14
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,220
>> Can I get more information than it?

15
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:36,180
>> So the auto-number isn't too useful. But we

16
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:39,090
can also from the page layout modify what shows up

17
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:41,060
in this related list. So let's actually go back

18
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:43,690
into the layout, or page layout editor and fix that.
