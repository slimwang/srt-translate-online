00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:04,410
Let's do an example of direct-mapped
caches and how they're accessed.

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:08,000
Here is a direct-mapped
cache with eight lines,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,760
each of which is 32 bytes in size.

4
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:15,850
The processor produces the following
sequence of accesses, one at a time.

5
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:23,910
3F1F hex, 3F2F hex, 3F2E hex,
and 3E1F hex, in this order.

6
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:24,600
The question for

7
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,805
you is what is the content of
the cache after these four accesses?
