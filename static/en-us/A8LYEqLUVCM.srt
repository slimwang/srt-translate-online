1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,310
Alright, what'd you got?

2
00:00:01,310 --> 00:00:02,420
>> I'm going to say it's one, one.

3
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:05,340
>> Alright, how would you figure that out?

4
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:07,868
>> Well first, I would ask you if that's correct. [LAUGH]

5
00:00:07,868 --> 00:00:10,179
>> [LAUGH] We'll see when you try to.

6
00:00:10,179 --> 00:00:10,704
>> [LAUGH]

7
00:00:10,704 --> 00:00:11,230
>> Figure it out.

8
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:15,620
>> Okay, so, the idea here is I'm trying to

9
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:20,110
figure out what Curly would get, if Smoove was out to

10
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:22,840
get, make certain that Curly got the worst possible value.

11
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:25,780
So, Curly gets to ch Curly gets to choose among rows.

12
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:29,030
And Smoove gets to choose among columns. So, If

13
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:32,900
I chose the B column, then Curly could get

14
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:34,920
a one. You're given choice Curly would go for

15
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,170
the first row instead of the second row, because

16
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:39,580
Curly would get a one. If I took the

17
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:43,460
S column, as Smoove, Smoove took the S column,

18
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:46,240
then Curly would choose the second row, and would

19
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:50,580
get two. And one is lower than two. So,

20
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:53,200
Smoove would choose the first column and Curly would have to get

21
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:56,240
the first row and would end up with a one. That make sense?

22
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:00,230
>> Yes, but here's what you haven't figured out.

23
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:01,220
>> Yes?

24
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:03,650
>> What happens if Smoove, no because, because

25
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:06,210
Smoove says, I'm always going to choose the Backstreet Boys.

26
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:06,721
>> Mm-hm.

27
00:01:06,721 --> 00:01:10,085
>> Then you're right, Curly should also choose that and at least coordinate.

28
00:01:10,085 --> 00:01:10,930
>> Mm-hm.

29
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:12,860
>> But what if Smoove is random say

30
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:15,010
half and half random between the two options.

31
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:15,630
>> And I

32
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:16,880
don't know what's going to happen before then?

33
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,650
>> And you don't know what's going to happen, sorry?

34
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:22,120
>> I know that, I know it's half Curly knows it's half

35
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:25,150
and half but doesn't know which one he's choosing any given time?

36
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:26,635
>> Exactly.

37
00:01:26,635 --> 00:01:30,650
>> I see. Then, I would end up with, one half and one.

38
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:32,070
>> Then for choosing B.

39
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:32,690
>> Uh-huh.

40
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:34,580
>> Expect the score would be a half, and for choosing

41
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:37,160
S, they'd expect the wor, expect the score would be one.

42
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:37,470
>> Yep.

43
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:40,690
>> Oh, I see. And, and then Curly would choose S and

44
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:41,120
get the one.

45
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:41,540
>> Right.

46
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:44,400
>> And that's still consistent with, with that?

47
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,033
>> Mm-hm.

48
00:01:46,033 --> 00:01:50,150
>> Can we work out what the what the worst case is?

49
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:51,000
>> What do you mean?

50
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,470
>> Well I feel like, we should solve it

51
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:54,520
like a [INAUDIBLE] game, like we did in your lesson.

52
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,050
>> Oh.

53
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:58,226
>> Say that Smoove is actually choosing a

54
00:01:58,226 --> 00:02:00,645
pro, probability either X or 1 minus X.

55
00:02:00,645 --> 00:02:02,290
>> So I thought you were asking for like

56
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:04,805
a pure decision, I wasn't even thinking about mixed decisions.

57
00:02:04,805 --> 00:02:05,390
>> Uh-huh,

58
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:07,810
yes, it could be a malicious and randomized adversary.

59
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:09,757
>> [SOUND] So we are.

60
00:02:09,757 --> 00:02:10,880
>> [LAUGH] You said yuck [LAUGH].

61
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,390
>> We, we are really talking about my ex-girlfriends.

62
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:17,040
Okay so you just do the math. Do the math.

63
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,530
>> Alright, so if we, if Smoove chooses Backstreet Boys

64
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:25,830
with probability X and Sting with probability of one minus X.

65
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:26,220
>> Mm-hm.

66
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:30,644
>> Then, Curly for choosing Backstreet Boys will get X on average and

67
00:02:30,644 --> 00:02:36,740
for choosing Sting, we'll get two times one minus six on average. And the

68
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:39,630
useful point is going to be to discover when these are equal to each other.

69
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:40,610
>> Yep.

70
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:44,740
>> So in fact, Smoove, by being malicious and

71
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:48,860
stochastic, can actually force things down to 2 3rds.

72
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:54,650
>> Hm. And things being symmetric as they are, Curly can do the same.

73
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:55,670
>> Okay.

74
00:02:55,670 --> 00:03:01,240
>> So, basically, Curly can behave in such a way, that even against a

75
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:05,830
malicious adversary, it could, he could guarantee himself to a score of 2 3rds.

76
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:08,290
>> Yeah, a malicious possibly mixed adversary.

77
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:09,929
>> That's right.

78
00:03:09,929 --> 00:03:12,317
>> Okay. But one, one would be right if we

79
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:15,310
were sticking with pure strategies, but why would we do that?

80
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:17,390
>> That's right, but for the purpose, if that's right, and you can do a

81
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:18,780
version of the folk theorem. In fact, there's

82
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:20,600
lots of different flavors of the folk theorem.

83
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,650
The one that we're going to focus on

84
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:23,570
is going to allow for these mixed strategies.

85
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:24,165
>> Mm-hm.

86
00:03:24,165 --> 00:03:26,970
>> But. In fact in general you could say you know,

87
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:30,260
no I kind of like the mixed strategies, let's just stick with that.

88
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:32,160
>> No, I like the mixed strategies too, I just wasn't thinking about them.

89
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:36,970
>> So, I want to point out that in fact the solution that you gave, I

90
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:38,600
think that actually does correspond to what is

91
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,380
usually called Minmax, which is the pure strategy.

92
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:41,810
>> Yeah!

93
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:45,500
>> So the, [LAUGH] the minmax is, is in fact one, one.

94
00:03:46,738 --> 00:03:48,995
The other concept is really important too though. And I think

95
00:03:48,995 --> 00:03:52,400
it's sometimes called the security level profile. So instead of the min

96
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,780
max level profile the security level profile. And that allows for

97
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:58,204
the possibility of, of mixed strategies. So that gets you down to

98
00:03:58,204 --> 00:04:00,418
the 2 3rds, 2 3rds. I think you know, it turns

99
00:04:00,418 --> 00:04:03,154
out that there's folk theorems that can be defined with with either

100
00:04:03,154 --> 00:04:06,670
of those concepts. I prefer this one. But I do like this

101
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:11,180
name better [LAUGH]. So I, I apologize if that made things confusing.

102
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:11,810
>> I'm not

103
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:13,330
confused now. I think in the end Michael,

104
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:15,080
the important thing is we were both right.

105
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:19,329
>> Well, the example that I'm going to next, these two concepts line

106
00:04:19,329 --> 00:04:23,423
up. So let's let's do that, and then we don't have to care. [LAUGH]

107
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:24,750
>> I, I'm all for that. Let's do that.
