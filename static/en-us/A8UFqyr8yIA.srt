00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:02,660
Think back to the beginning of this

2
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:06,010
lesson. Where we considered a computer system that

3
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:09,070
was displaying graphics for a video game.

4
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:13,200
Playing music or browsing the web. Seemingly all

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:18,350
of them at the same time. All of these applications need access to the physical

6
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:21,520
hardware And they have to be made to

7
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:26,820
share nicely. No hogging the CPU, no overwriting

8
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:30,050
each other's coder data. This becomes then the

9
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:32,940
job of the operating system, to protect these

10
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:36,040
applications from one another, and to protect an

11
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:40,070
application from itself. While getting out of the way

12
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:43,410
as quickly as possible so that these applications

13
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:45,650
can do what they need to do in order

14
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:48,600
to get their jobs done. Now we will

15
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,590
discuss the abstractions in an operating system. From managing

16
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:55,790
the hardware safely and efficiently. Particularly we'll

17
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:58,040
focus on the processor and the memory.
