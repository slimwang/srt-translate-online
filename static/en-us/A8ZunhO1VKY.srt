1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,800
Since this equation is linear, we can use our skills from before. We solve the

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:08,220
equation by grouping the variable terms on one side, and the constant terms on

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:13,600
the other. We subtract 4 from both sides first to get negative 3x equals

4
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:18,350
positive 3. Then we divide both sides by negative 3 to get x is equal to

5
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:22,352
negative 1. This is our answer, and for these types of problems we're going to

6
00:00:22,352 --> 00:00:25,982
write the answer as a solution set. So this would be the solution set to our

7
00:00:25,982 --> 00:00:30,604
original equation. Once we find our solution, we want to make sure we always

8
00:00:30,604 --> 00:00:35,590
check it against the excluded values. For this equation, we knew x cannot equal

9
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:40,660
0, so this solution set is okay, since x could equal negative 1. And like all of

10
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:44,549
our other equations, we can check to make sure that we're right. We plug in a

11
00:00:44,549 --> 00:00:49,437
value of negative 1 for x here and here. When I simplify the equation, I'll have

12
00:00:49,437 --> 00:00:53,627
negative 3 and a half on the left and negative 3 and a half on the right. So

13
00:00:53,627 --> 00:00:55,337
yes, this is correct.
