00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The answer is the first choice. Alice needs to validate--sorry.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
My answer is the first choice. The bank needs to validate the hashes.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
It needs to know the preimage for the hash. It's enough to get just one of those.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
It isn't necessary to get both of them because the bank presumably starts knowing Alice's identity.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
If the bank doesn't start knowing Alice's identity,

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
then anyone could create a bill that would blame Alice for double spending.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
So if the banks knows Alice's identity, then the bank can compute the other part of this

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
computing xk1 by XORing this value with Alice's identity

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
and they can check if both of the hashes are correct.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 99:59:59,999
If they are, that validates that each of these identity components is correct.
