00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:02,490
Now that we're getting more
comfortable stepping through code,

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:06,580
I want to take another look at stack
traces in the Debug Navigator.

3
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:10,430
First, let's start with
the BugFactory.swift file, and I want

4
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:14,890
you to set a break point at line 26 in
the beginning of the createBug method.

5
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:19,720
Then run the app and examine the stack
traces that are produced when this

6
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,950
specific breakpoint is hit.

7
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:23,640
By examining those stack traces,

8
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,970
you should be able to answer
the following question.

9
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:30,230
In the breakpoint debugging
scene of SoManyBugs,

10
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:32,630
how is the createBug
method being called?

11
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:38,400
Is the method being called
when we handle a tap,

12
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,920
when we handle a tap and when we animate
the bugs, when we handle a tap and

13
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,050
when the BreakpointBugViewController
initializes, or

14
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:49,180
only when the
BreakpointBugViewController initializes?

15
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,200
Mark the best answer
to complete the quiz.
