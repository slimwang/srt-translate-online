Hi. I'm Magnus.

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:08,824
>> And I'm Jocelyn. [SOUND] Welcome to the course Building

3
00:00:08,824 --> 00:00:16,549
Scalable Applications on Google Infrastructure.

4
00:00:16,549 --> 00:00:20,311
>> Jocelyn and I work at Google with Cloud Platform, and we will teach

5
00:00:20,311 --> 00:00:22,461
you how to build scalable systems that

6
00:00:22,461 --> 00:00:25,503
runs on Google infrastructure, and that can scale.

7
00:00:25,503 --> 00:00:26,291
>> And scale.

8
00:00:26,291 --> 00:00:27,420
>> And scale.

9
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:28,210
>> And scale.

10
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:33,790
>> And scale. Because here at Google, we know how to build scalable system.

11
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:37,620
>> That's right, and now your applications can run on Google infrastructure,

12
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:42,120
as well. I will be teaching you the theory around building scalable systems.

13
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,740
>> And I'll be hacking right along with you.

14
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:46,050
>> Let's get started.
