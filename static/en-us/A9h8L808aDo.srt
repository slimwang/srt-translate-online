00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:04,030
The three engines of growth are ways
to think about customer acquisition.

2
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:06,580
The first one is the sticky
engine of growth,

3
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:10,480
where you're going to focus on bringing
your customers back month after month.

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,330
You really want them to stick with you.

5
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:15,170
You're really focusing here on
keeping customers with you,

6
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:17,330
rather than acquiring new customers.

7
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:19,810
So, this is the right
engine to focus on,

8
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:22,980
if your focused on retaining
customers for the long term.

9
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,860
The second engine of growth
is the viral engine.

10
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,270
This is usually heaven for
entrepreneurs,

11
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:31,960
where they get to the point where their
customers are bringing in new customers.

12
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:35,850
And their user base is just
growing virally and organically.

13
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:39,750
Now I wouldn't rely on this one, because
it's really hard to actually get here.

14
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:41,730
Your product is going to
have to be incredible, and

15
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:46,150
really fit your target market perfectly,
otherwise it doesn't really work.

16
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:50,710
So once you have a really awesome
product, growth can be self sustaining,

17
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:52,870
but it doesn't necessarily
happen to everyone.

18
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:56,370
And the third engine of growth
is the paid engine of growth.

19
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:58,290
Most start ups have to be
familiar with this one.

20
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:01,190
And most advertising channels
fall into this engine.

21
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:04,550
Now as long as you're making
a profit on each customer,

22
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:06,860
you can keep operating this engine.

23
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:10,800
Your profit will allow you to invest
more and more into advertising and

24
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,380
help you sustain your growth.

25
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:17,150
Now big companies will focus on more
than one or even all of these engines.

26
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:21,290
However, as a startup, we recommend
that you focus on only one at a time.

27
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:24,610
In this lesson in particular we'll
be focusing on the paid engine for

28
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:25,600
customer acquisition.

29
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,240
If you're interested in learning more,

30
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:30,980
we highly recommend checking
out the book The Lean Startup.

31
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:35,080
It describes these three engines as
part of a whole lean startup approach,

32
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:38,170
that helps entrepreneurs build
fast growing companies, and

33
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:42,220
encourages them to build, measure and
learn on an ongoing basis.

34
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:44,820
Check out the link to the book
in the instructor notes.

35
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:46,700
Okay, so let's dive into
this paid engine of growth.
