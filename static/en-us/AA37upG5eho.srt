1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:04,970
Quality reporting is a particularly
interesting and challenging area

2
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:11,410
generally done by reporting
process and/or outcome measures.

3
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:13,980
While outcome measures
are usually preferable,

4
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:17,130
we often don't have
practical ones available.

5
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:21,550
Hemoglobin A1c is a test
done on a blood sample

6
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:26,860
that can serve both as a process and
an outcome measure for diabetes care.

7
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:32,540
Hemoglobin, the red stuff in your blood
cells, is the oxygen carrying molecule.

8
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:38,420
The level of its A1c variant tracks with
the amount of glucose out in the blood.

9
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:43,249
Glucose is the molecule that is not
properly regulated in diabetes.

10
00:00:43,249 --> 00:00:45,513
So the more that's out of the blood,

11
00:00:45,513 --> 00:00:48,369
the more of it that enters
the red blood cells.

12
00:00:48,369 --> 00:00:52,770
The more glucose in the cells,
the higher the A1c level.

13
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:57,821
As we can see here,
not much glucose, a low A1c level.

14
00:00:57,821 --> 00:01:03,610
Lots of glucose, an unhappy red blood
cell because its A1c is very high.

15
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:09,174
But this increase occurs over time,
so hemoglobin A1c is proportional

16
00:01:09,174 --> 00:01:14,387
to the average blood glucose level
over the prior couple of months.

17
00:01:14,387 --> 00:01:19,118
This is great, since the goal of
diabetes therapy is to keep the same

18
00:01:19,118 --> 00:01:23,025
average glucose level within
normal ranges over time.

19
00:01:23,025 --> 00:01:26,765
As you can see here,
the blood glucose levels go up and

20
00:01:26,765 --> 00:01:31,441
down depending upon what's eaten,
exercise and other factors.

21
00:01:31,441 --> 00:01:35,351
However, it may go up and
down here the hemoglobin A1c

22
00:01:35,351 --> 00:01:39,522
level remains constant at 7,
indicating good control.

23
00:01:39,522 --> 00:01:45,168
In fact, good control is defined as
an A1c under 9 by most organizations,

24
00:01:45,168 --> 00:01:51,460
but the highly regarded Mayo Clinic
uses this number 7 as its benchmark.

25
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:56,120
Which of these would be
an outcome measure for diabetes?

26
00:01:56,120 --> 00:02:02,370
Recording of key data, testing for
HbA1c level on a regular basis,

27
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:05,254
a HbA1c level under 9?
