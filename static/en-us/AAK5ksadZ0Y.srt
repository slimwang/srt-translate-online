00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,680
In the abstract version of the bank account application,

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:05,920
each time we wanted to know the bank balance,

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:09,400
we had to add up all the previous deposits and withdrawals.

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,970
And if you've done any kind of implementation out there,

5
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:15,650
you know that that screams for having some kind of temporary variable that holds

6
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:18,880
the intermediate results so you don't have add those all up every time.

7
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:24,820
So let's add that in as refinement to our to our spec.

8
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:28,010
That is we're going to add another level of refinement,

9
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:32,180
in which we're going to implement this particular optimization.

10
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:35,690
Okay, that will reduce the number of computation that we had to do,

11
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:39,130
at the expense of adding this temporary variable in.

12
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:42,210
For the class model itself, there's just one additional line.

13
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:44,310
And this is in the attribute box, and

14
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:47,270
it adds in a variable called runningTotal, which is an integer.
