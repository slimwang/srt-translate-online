00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,398
I decided to add some onion power to the recipe, so I

2
00:00:03,398 --> 00:00:08,109
need to add onion powder to the ingredients list and then also add it down here.

3
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:12,346
And this line is a little long now, so I'll break it into two lines.

4
00:00:12,346 --> 00:00:16,533
Now I'll use git diff to double-check what changes I've just made and

5
00:00:16,533 --> 00:00:18,854
I can see the addition of onion powder.

6
00:00:18,854 --> 00:00:22,360
Add the chili recipe to the staging area and commit.

7
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:27,590
Now when I run git status, I can see that my branch is ahead by one commit and

8
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:28,780
that's the commit I just made.
