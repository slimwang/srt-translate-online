00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,703
Now that we have gone over these
different types of ideas, I'd like you

2
00:00:03,703 --> 00:00:07,340
to hear about a company and decide which
of these ideas apply to that company.

3
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:09,675
The first company is called Shyp.

4
00:00:09,675 --> 00:00:12,811
Shyp is a company that allows
users to send mail and

5
00:00:12,811 --> 00:00:14,910
packages to anyone in the world.

6
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:19,153
Users can choose an item,
take a picture of it on their phone, and

7
00:00:19,153 --> 00:00:22,179
then set a destination and
schedule a pickup.

8
00:00:22,179 --> 00:00:26,553
Shyp takes care of the rest by picking
up the item and finding the lowest cost,

9
00:00:26,553 --> 00:00:30,300
and most reliable way to send
the package, pretty seamless.

10
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:34,420
So which type of ideas do you
think apply to the company Shyp?

11
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:37,540
Check all of these idea types that
you think apply to the company.
