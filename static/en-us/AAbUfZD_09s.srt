1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,580
So here's an example
of 18 different moves,

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:08,930
and it's showing you some of the motion
history, motion energy images of it.

3
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:14,580
So we now have this problem of how
do we recognize motion energy,

4
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:16,200
motion history images.

5
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:20,540
Well, these are kind of
gray-scale blobby-like images.

6
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:26,220
And the good news is even in 1999, there
have been about 150 years, or maybe

7
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:31,250
20 years, pick your favorite number, of
computer vision describing gray blobs.

8
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:31,890
And trying to say,

9
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:35,400
okay, I recognize this gray blob as
being different than that gray blob.

10
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,390
And that's basically all we had to do.

11
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:40,250
So, basically, 1999,
we did some sort of,

12
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:44,765
what I think of as old style computer
vision we're going to compute some,

13
00:00:44,765 --> 00:00:47,205
summarization statistic of that blob.

14
00:00:47,205 --> 00:00:50,615
We're going to compute some features of
that blob that have something to do with

15
00:00:50,615 --> 00:00:52,795
the distribution of the,
where the pixels are and

16
00:00:52,795 --> 00:00:57,247
their intensities in the MHI, and we're
going to build the generative model.

17
00:00:57,247 --> 00:00:59,057
Okay.
There are a couple reasons we were doing

18
00:00:59,057 --> 00:01:00,097
generative models.

19
00:01:00,097 --> 00:01:04,777
One is that discriminative models hadn't
become as popular as they had been and

20
00:01:04,777 --> 00:01:08,467
so Jim Davis' advisor was not
smart enough to tell him to

21
00:01:08,467 --> 00:01:10,410
go make sure you're using
the discriminative model.

22
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:12,910
I will tell you that people have
subsequently used it, and of course,

23
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:14,730
it makes your recognition better.

24
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:17,710
Generative models also have the nice
properties as we mentioned before,

25
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:21,790
that when I come in, if I come up
with a new, aerobics move, right, so

26
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:24,990
I want to add one, I just have to
build a model of that category.

27
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:28,180
I don't have to,
to retrain my entire system.

28
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:30,060
Okay, whether you use generative or
discriminative,

29
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:31,990
the idea is that we're going to
compute these statistics and

30
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:33,890
then do the recognition.

31
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:36,840
So, how are we going to
describe this sentence?

32
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,870
And this allows me to spend a little bit
of time telling you about some very old

33
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:46,900
computer vision work that becomes,
that's still important, and fundamental.

34
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:50,700
And that's the notion of
the moments of a shape.

35
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:54,900
So, so some of you from physics, you
know about second order moments, right?

36
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:55,810
Axis of inertia.

37
00:01:55,810 --> 00:02:00,010
The moment is the distribution of
matter about a point or an axis or

38
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:00,900
something like that.

39
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:06,835
So in computer vision, the moments
are defined in a very simple way, right?

40
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:11,985
So the I J moment, okay,
is just the sum over

41
00:02:11,985 --> 00:02:17,605
the X Y of the whole image of X raised
to the I power, Y raised to the I power.

42
00:02:17,605 --> 00:02:23,970
But you're only counting points
where the image is non-zero.

43
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:24,710
Okay?

44
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:29,330
So, if I is a binary image,
then this is a one or zero, so

45
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:32,030
you're only counting it at
points that are turned on.

46
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:36,960
If it's a grayscale image, then you're
weighting the point by essentially how

47
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:40,240
heavy it is, which is a little bit
like when you do moments of inertia.

48
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,580
If you've got little points
that are heavier than others,

49
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:45,490
they add more to the inertia
without the axis.

50
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:49,940
So these are the moments, and so you can
talk about the second order moments,

51
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:53,100
or the first order moments, or
even the zeroth order moments, right?

52
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:55,750
What would this be for
the zeroth order moment?

53
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:59,500
Well, if I is zero and
J is zero then these are one,

54
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:03,850
this would just be counting up
the number of non-zero pixels.

55
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:07,283
Which means that M
zero zero is the area.

56
00:03:07,283 --> 00:03:09,350
[NOISE] Right?

57
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:14,150
because the area of the picture that's
non-zero, that's just the sums,

58
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:17,400
the counting of the non-zero pixels.

59
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:17,900
All right?

60
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:22,250
The problem with regular moments,
of course,

61
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:26,950
is that they're sensitive to what
the X and Y position actually is.

62
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:27,910
Right?
So,

63
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:32,540
you kind of want the moments of a shape
to be independent of where the shape is.

64
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:37,170
So there's something called the central
moments that just take X, but

65
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:42,000
they subtract off the mean of X, and
Y, and subtract off the mean of Y.

66
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,210
And it is, otherwise just the same.

67
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:50,400
So, that's this Mu P Q, and it's X minus
X bar to the P, Y minus Y bar to the Q.

68
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,130
All right?

69
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:53,610
And, you know, what is X bar?

70
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:57,700
Well, one way of thinking,
it's the average X, so the average X

71
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:02,370
would just be the sum of all the Xs
divided by however many Xs there are.

72
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:04,070
Well, that's what this is, right?

73
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:09,898
X bar is M one zero, the first moment
in X divided by the overall area,

74
00:04:09,898 --> 00:04:13,285
remember the M zero zero,
same thing in Y.

75
00:04:13,285 --> 00:04:16,860
So that's regular moments,
but the problem with moments,

76
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:20,925
of course, is that they're very
sensitive to a variety of changes,

77
00:04:20,925 --> 00:04:25,478
so if I scale the image up, right,
obviously, the moment's going to change,

78
00:04:25,478 --> 00:04:29,004
the area will get bigger,
the distances get, get larger.

79
00:04:29,004 --> 00:04:31,490
If I rotate it things might change.

80
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:32,340
All sorts of problems.
