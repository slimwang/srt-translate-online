1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
[Narrator] And the answer is south.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The reason why it's south is if we attempt to go south,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
an 80% probability we'll stay in the same cell.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
In fact, a 90% probability because we can't

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
go south and we can't go east.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
In a 10% probability, we find ourselves over here which is a relatively

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
safe state because we can actually go to the left side.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
If we were to go just west which is the intuitive answer,

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
then there's a 10% chance we end up in the minus 100 absorbing state.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
You can convince yourself if you go south,

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
find ourselves eventually in state C3, and then

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
go west, west, north, north, east, east, east.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
You will never ever run risk of falling into the minus 100, and

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
that argument is tricky and to convince ourselves

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
let me ask the other hard question:

16
00:00:47,000 --> 99:59:59,999
so what shall we do in state B3 that's the optimal action?
