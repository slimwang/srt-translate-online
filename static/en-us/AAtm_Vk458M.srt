00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:01,040
Up through now,

2
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:04,390
you've only seen a limited range
of the data that can be stored.

3
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:08,039
There's actually a lot more and
you see some of it here.

4
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:10,930
If you view this screen in
your own HealthAlt account,

5
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:13,840
you'll see the full list
of data categories.

6
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,140
It's quite extensive.

7
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:20,780
I want you to focus now on this item,
the Continuity of Care Document, or CCD.

8
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:24,350
You should know what it
is from lesson five.

9
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:29,780
By clicking here, a patient can
upload their CCD into HealthAlt once

10
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:34,070
they have it, something you're going to
do yourself in the next class activity.
