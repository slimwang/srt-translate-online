The answer is graph C, this light green one right here. We found out in the last

2
00:00:04,739 --> 00:00:09,420
quiz that the vertex of this equation is at negative 1, negative 13. So if you

3
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:14,230
look for the curve on this graph that has that vertex, we have two actually that

4
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:19,022
meet right here, C and D. If we plug in other points to this equation though, we

5
00:00:19,022 --> 00:00:21,128
can see that C is the one that fits.
