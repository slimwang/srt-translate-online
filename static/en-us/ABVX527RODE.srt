As you go through this course, you might encounter commands that

2
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:06,080
you've never seen before. And we don't expect you to know everything,

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,970
but we do want you to keep the following in mind

4
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:11,910
when you encounter any sort of challenges or difficulties. First, take an

5
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:14,800
active role in problem solving and be aware of the resources

6
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:17,600
at your disposal. You can type a question mark and the name

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,690
of any function to bring up help documentation in r. So

8
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:25,590
for example I can look up the documentation for the function mean.

9
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:28,590
Here it will tell me any parameters that mean takes. And

10
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:32,549
it will give me examples usually at the bottom of the documentation.

11
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:35,330
I can copy and paste these into the console. And press

12
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:38,800
enter to see what the function does. Here, I created something called

13
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,470
x, and then if I hit x into the console, I

14
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:44,598
can see what this is. This is just the vector of numbers

15
00:00:44,598 --> 00:00:47,520
zero to ten, and then the number 50. I can take

16
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,600
the mean of x, and print it out. And finally, I have

17
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,870
some sort of trend parameter. Maybe you can figure

18
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:55,260
out what this does. Now, if you can't solve your

19
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:58,940
problem using the documentation I would suggest Googling it.

20
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:02,840
StackOverflow is also another great site to browser for help.

21
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,260
I've linked to some of the most useful websites

22
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:07,550
in the instructor notes, and you can also find these

23
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:10,970
in the course materials under Our Resources. One of my

24
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:16,110
personal favorites when I learned R was Quick-R, or statmethods.net.

25
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:19,550
This site has excellent examples and short pieces of code that

26
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:22,510
can refresh your memory and get you going on any data analysis.
