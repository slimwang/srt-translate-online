1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,570
Let's take a very simple
robot sensing problem, right?

2
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:09,058
So let's assume that a robot knows
the 3D map of its world, okay?

3
00:00:09,058 --> 00:00:09,578
And for now,

4
00:00:09,578 --> 00:00:12,240
we're just going to worry about
a robot running around on the floor.

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,370
So it's not climbing stairs,
instead it's just running around.

6
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:18,830
And let's assume also that it
has noisy depth sensors, so

7
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:21,510
it can measure depth in a lot
of different directions.

8
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:24,140
And they're noisy, so the,
the measurement is uncertain, but

9
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:25,990
we know about the uncertainty.

10
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:27,950
That is we have a sensor model.

11
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:28,620
Okay?

12
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:31,910
And it moves between frames, and
it takes a, a set of readings, and

13
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:34,960
then it moves again and takes a set
of readings, and it moves again.

14
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,880
But the idea is it keeps
taking all these readings, and

15
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:41,100
the question is,
how well can it know its state?

16
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:42,740
So, what is its state?

17
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:43,280
Montana?.
No.

18
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:49,790
Its state is three values, x,
y and theta, its orientation.

19
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:51,350
Okay?
That's why we're just doing a,

20
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:54,620
a multiple robot on
the ground three dimensions.

21
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:55,460
All right?

22
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:58,540
So, just to remind you, on a Ba,
Bayesian filter framework,

23
00:00:58,540 --> 00:00:59,560
we need four things.

24
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:03,000
We need some sort of the prior,
remember that trip to Delphi, so

25
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,160
you unpack your next prior.

26
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:10,266
We need a dynamical system model and
that's the likelihood of landing in some

27
00:01:10,266 --> 00:01:16,140
new place, given that you're in an old
place plus whatever action was taken.

28
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:19,210
We need a sensor model, remember,
a likelihood that's the,

29
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:21,910
not the probability of being
someplace given a measurement.

30
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:24,580
The likelihood is the probability
of getting the measurement given

31
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:29,280
what your state was, and then we
need this stream of observations and

32
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,570
the action data, the Zs and the Us.

33
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:34,750
For that robot that I described,
the state is obvious.

34
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:36,230
The map will be easy, et cetera.

35
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:39,490
The thing that's tricky, not tricky,
the thing we have to define,

36
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:41,060
is the sensor model.

37
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:46,090
So here's a picture of a sensor model,
and what this is is,

38
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:52,760
this is the probability of getting
a particular measurement if,

39
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:58,380
let's say, the actual state was
here on this black line, okay?

40
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:01,200
And, what was nice is when
your using a real robot,

41
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,420
you can actually measure the likelihood,
so

42
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:07,980
you, you, you stick the sensor,
you know, three meters away, or,

43
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:13,170
let's see, it's at centimeters, so 200,
so 2.3 centimeters away from the wall.

44
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:14,680
You turn it on,
you turn it on, you turn.

45
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:17,630
You collect a whole bunch of
measurements and you see what you get.

46
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:21,300
That distribution would
be this distribution.

47
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,180
Okay?

48
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:26,570
And in fact,
the blue is what was measured.

49
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:27,920
All right?
So that's why the blue's got

50
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,300
the noisy stuff.

51
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,920
And the red is how they approximated it.

52
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,900
And you can see they basically had
some sort of a Gaussian function or

53
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:35,970
something like that.

54
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:42,970
In fact, you can see that the laser
has a less noise than the sonar, okay?

55
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:45,030
So, this is, this is actually
a relatively noisy laser.

56
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:47,390
A modern laser would be,
you know, very precise.

57
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:49,880
Except that you might have some
specular problem, et cetera.

58
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:54,520
So all of that would be fine, except,
you'll notice there's this thing here

59
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:59,580
and this thing there, and the question
is, what's going on when, you know,

60
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:02,950
the thing is 2.3 meters away and
here it says 500.

61
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:08,510
But, the astute observer will notice
you're just using the very last value.

62
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:10,070
Well what that really is,

63
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:15,630
is that's the probability
that you get no return, okay?

64
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:20,280
So you're some distance from the wall,
you send out your sonar chirp, or

65
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:24,120
you send out your laser,
and it just goes away.

66
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,460
Gets on a train, never comes back.

67
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:30,110
This happens you guys know what
specular reflections are, right?

68
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:31,870
So when light bounces off to,

69
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:35,280
turns out that sheet rock
is very specular to sonar.

70
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,020
So when you send out a sonar chirp,
often it doesn't come back, it skips

71
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:44,010
like it reflects off, in which case,
you don't ever hear the chirp come back.

72
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:46,360
Or it comes back after having
gone through a long echo path.

73
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:52,130
Likewise, if you're looking at something
that's shiny, like a glass wall.

74
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:54,340
When you point at it,
you can see the laser beam.

75
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:56,870
But when you point it on the side, okay?

76
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,040
It'll be reflective.

77
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,500
It'll be a specular.

78
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:02,360
So what these values are,

79
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:08,010
is the probability of getting no return
given that you're at some distance.

80
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:10,850
And in fact, that probability stays
the same pretty much no matter what your

81
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:11,880
distance is.

82
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,530
All right?

83
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:17,269
So remember, this is not the probability
that your distance is actually 500.

84
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:20,579
It's the probability that
you would get this no return

85
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:23,350
at any given point in time, okay?

86
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:25,760
So we need to incorporate
that noisy model.
