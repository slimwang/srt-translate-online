00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,777
>> Notice that 3x squared and 2x both have a factor of x in them. If we divide

2
00:00:05,777 --> 00:00:11,768
3x squared by x, we're left with 3x. And if we divide 2x by x, we're just left

3
00:00:11,768 --> 00:00:18,028
with 2. So factoring this, 3x squared plus 2x, gives us x times the quantity 3x

4
00:00:18,028 --> 00:00:18,625
plus 2.
