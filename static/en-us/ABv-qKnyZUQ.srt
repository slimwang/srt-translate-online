00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hi everybody! Welcome to CS 215.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
My name is Micheal Littman, and I'm going to be your instructor.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Let's get off with a little magic trick.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
All right! Here is a collection of actors from movies.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
This is Bruce Willis, Danny Devito, Cloris Leachman, Stanley Tucci,

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Tom Hanks, Haley Joel Osment, and Robin Williams.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I'm going to connect together actors who were in movies together

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
with lines that represents those movies.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
So Bruce Willis and Tom Hanks were in a movie together called,

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
"The Bonfire of the Vanities" that seemed like it was going to be very good but it was not.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Bruce Willis and Cloris Leachman were in a movie together

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
called "Beavis and Butt-Head Do America"--it was not a very popular movie.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Tom Hanks and Stanley Tucci were in a movie called "The Terminal."

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Haley Joel Osment and Bruce Willis were in "The Sixth Sense." They were the stars of that movie.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I will not tell you the ending, but Haley Joel Osment

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
was also in "Forrest Gump" with Tom Hanks.

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Robin Williams and Stanley Tucci were in a movie called "Deconstructing Harry."

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Cloris Leachman and Stanley Tucci were in a movie called "Gambit".

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Danny Devito and Robin Williams were in "Death to Smoochy." All right!

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Next I'm going to connect Bruce Willis and Danny Devito,

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
who were in a movie together called "I'm Still Here."

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
And lastly, I'm going to connect Bruce Willis and Stanley Tucci,

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
who were in a movie called "Billy Bathgate."

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
All right! Now that we have the diagram, I'm going to start off with one of the actors.

25
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Let's say Bruce Willis and I'm going to move around on this structure

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
visiting all the movies exactly once and so let's see how that goes.

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
So there's lot of different choices to start off.

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Let's say, I'm going to go from Bruce Willis to Tom Hanks, Tom Hanks to Stanley Tucci,

29
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Stanley Tucci back to Bruce Willis, Bruce Willis to Cloris Leachman to Stanley Tucci again,

30
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,000
to Robin Williams to Danny Devito to Bruce Willis to Haley Joel Osment,

31
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
and then to Tom Hanks, and now you can see that I've visited

32
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
all of the movies exactly once and I ended up at Tom Hanks.

33
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
All right! So let's try this again with a different set of actors.

34
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Now we've got Susan Sarandon, Dustin Hoffman, Julia Roberts,

35
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Kevin Bacon, Robert De Niro, Anne Hathaway, and Meryl Streep.

36
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
And then we're going to put in some of the movies again.

37
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Robert De Niro and Dustin Hoffman who were in a movie together called "Wag the Dog."

38
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Robert De Niro and Meryl Streep were in a movie together called "Marvin's Room."

39
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Dustin Hoffman and Susan Sarandon were in a movie together called "Moonlight Mile."

40
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Dustin Hoffman and Julia Roberts were in a movie together called "Hook."

41
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Dustin Hoffman and Kevin Bacon were in a movie together called "Sleepers."

42
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Susan Sarandon and Julia Roberts were in a movie together called "Stepmom."

43
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Kevin Bacon and Julia Roberts were in "Flatliners."

44
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Nobody can tell from some of the movies and the actors

45
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
that I've picked that I watched more movies in the 80s than I watch now.

46
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Meryl Streep and Kevin Bacon were in a movie together called "The River Wild."

47
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Meryl Streep and Anne Hathaway were in "The Devil Wears Prada" together.

48
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
And Anne Hathaway and Julia Roberts were in "Valentines Day."

49
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
We're going to do this as a little bit of a quiz so I'm going to mark

50
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
each of these edges as something that you need to visit.

51
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
You need to visit all of them.

52
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I strongly suggest that you actually check them off as you go

53
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
because it's really easy to do one twice or forget one by accident.

54
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
So this is what I want you to do, I want you to go through

55
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
and start at Meryl Streep and move along the green lines here at the movies

56
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
and each time you visit a movie, check it off as you go.

57
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
So the right answer in this quiz is to have all the edges

58
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
checked off and none of them checked off twice.

59
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
It's really easy to mess that up, so be very careful.

60
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
And then when you're done, I want you to mark the little bubble

61
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
corresponding to which actor you end up with at the end of your path.

62
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
You can follow any path that you want--you just have to make sure

63
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
that you visit each of the movies once.

64
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
All right! I'd like you to actually go and do this and check off the actor that you end up with.
