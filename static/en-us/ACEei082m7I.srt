1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,469
When building an app that uses
the Google services, you'll generally

2
00:00:03,469 --> 00:00:06,820
use an Asynchronous Programing Model
that looks a little bit like this.

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:12,300
In the onCreate of your activity,
you create a Google API client.

4
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:15,020
And then in the onStart
of your activity,

5
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:18,490
you connect that Google API
client to the relevant APIs.

6
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:20,660
In this case Location Services.

7
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:21,870
In order to use this,

8
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:24,840
you're going to need to override
a number of different methods.

9
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:27,750
One is OnConnectionFailed,
which the services will

10
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:31,290
call whenever the connection drops and
you need to handle what to do.

11
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:32,600
Generally just reconnecting.

12
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:37,940
One is OnConnectionSuspended, which is
very similar to OnConnectionFailed and

13
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:41,710
will be called if the connection gets
suspended but not necessarily broken.

14
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:43,230
And you might want to
cache some information.

15
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:47,800
When you succeed in making
a connection to Location Services,

16
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,760
Location services calls
back to OnConnected,

17
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,630
telling you that you're now
connected to the services.

18
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:55,465
And in the case of
something like location,

19
00:00:55,465 --> 00:00:58,100
you'll then create a LocationRequest.

20
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:02,350
They had passed to Location Services
to get your location details back.

21
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:05,120
And it would call you back
with OnLocationChanged,

22
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,510
letting you know that your location
request details have changed,

23
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:10,530
and there's new location
information available to you.

24
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:12,370
And you'll get a Location object,

25
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:14,660
which you can then use
to write to your screen.

26
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:17,790
So in the application that we just saw,
that location object included

27
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:21,180
a latitude, and I was able to update
my screen and write the latitude to it.

28
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:25,520
Now this programming model isn't
just limited to location services.

29
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,230
As I've said, many of the services that
you'll be using during this course

30
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:31,600
follow a very similar
programming model to this.

31
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,660
You're going to have an OnCreate and
an OnStart.

32
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:37,970
You're going to have a GoogleApiClient
that you connect to the services that

33
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:39,050
you want to use.

34
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:40,910
And then you have to
handle certain overrides.

35
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:45,850
Usually, they'll be OnConnectionFailed,
OnConnectionSuspended, OnConnected, and

36
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:48,460
then an override that's specific
to the services that you're using.

37
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:51,720
In this case, it's OnLocationChanged for
location services.
