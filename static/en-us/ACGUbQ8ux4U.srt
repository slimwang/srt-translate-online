1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,800
In this exercise we'll get more
practice drawing from a screen.

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:05,080
And this time we'll use
the value of delta for

3
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:08,180
something useful, in this case
to draw the frames per second.

4
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:10,630
If delta is the number of
seconds between frames,

5
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:13,990
then one over delta is equal
to the frames per second.

6
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:16,840
There is a lot of tasks left
up to you to do this time.

7
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:19,683
You're not expected to be able to
remember all the little details

8
00:00:19,683 --> 00:00:20,960
from memory.

9
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,190

and the solution code, as you need to.
