00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,337
The factors of 6 are 1, 2, 3 and 6. We just need to think about all the

2
00:00:05,337 --> 00:00:11,725
combinations of 2 integers that can be multiplied together to equal 6. 1 times 6

3
00:00:11,725 --> 00:00:16,765
equals 6 and 2 times 3 equals 6. So these the only 4 factors of 6.
