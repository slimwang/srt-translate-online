F of g of 5 equals 30. Great problem solving if you found this answer. Remember

2
00:00:06,054 --> 00:00:12,566
when we find the f of g of 5, you really want to find g of 5 first. We want to

3
00:00:12,566 --> 00:00:18,035
find the output for g, when the input is 5. Then we take that output and we

4
00:00:18,035 --> 00:00:22,985
plug in that the input for f. So to find g of 5, we simply take 5 and plug it

5
00:00:22,985 --> 00:00:31,980
in here. So we'll have 5 plus 5, which we know is 10. So, the g of 5 equals 10.

6
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:38,020
In other words, the output of the function g, when x equals 5, is 10. So now

7
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:44,076
that we know this entire value, we can replace g of 5 with 10. Now we can just

8
00:00:44,076 --> 00:00:49,430
find f of 10. You want to find the output of the function f when x equals 10. I

9
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:55,844
can remember that f was my tripling function. So, I'll have 3 times 10 or 30.

10
00:00:55,844 --> 00:01:01,980
So, we know the f of g of 5 equals 30. Our answer.
