1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,180
The ticket really is a capability.

2
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:06,300
The possession of that ticket
allows Alice to go in the theater.

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:09,000
Be able to access
the movie in this case.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,340
The reason it's a capability is,
it's not an Access Control Entry.

5
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:15,710
It's that, the person who's checking
the ticket doesn't even need to know who

6
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:16,414
Alice is actually.

7
00:00:16,414 --> 00:00:18,860
The mere possession of the ticket.

8
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:21,850
Remember that sounds like what we
were saying about capabilities.

9
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:25,290
Mere possession of a capability
actually allows you

10
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:26,720
to gain access to the resource.

11
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,000
In this case,
the ticket really is a capability.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,095
We don't even know the user ID of
Alice or the person who's doing

13
00:00:35,095 --> 00:00:38,725
admission control doesn't even know
who Alice is so it's not an ACE.

14
00:00:38,725 --> 00:00:42,955
Because an ACE remember requires the UID
and what kind of permissions they have.

15
00:00:42,955 --> 00:00:46,445
So this quiz the ticket is a capability.
