The answer is, you can't assign an object of a class to a variable of an

2
00:00:02,855 --> 00:00:06,683
interface type the object's class does not implement. We've seen that it's

3
00:00:06,683 --> 00:00:10,579
possible to assign an object of a class to a variable of an interface type. And

4
00:00:10,579 --> 00:00:13,159
this declaration isn't trying to assign a value of an interface type to a

5
00:00:13,159 --> 00:00:17,790
variable of a class type. We can create a rectangle without too much trouble,

6
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:22,510
but rectangle doesn't implement drawable. So we can't store the rectangle that

7
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:26,607
we created in a variable of type drawable. This is a little bit weird, since

8
00:00:26,607 --> 00:00:29,883
the rectangle actually does have a draw method, and the drawable interface

9
00:00:29,883 --> 00:00:34,823
promises that it will have a draw method and nothing else. The problem is that

10
00:00:34,823 --> 00:00:39,097
rectangle doesn't say that it implements drawable. For all Java knows, these

11
00:00:39,097 --> 00:00:43,850
two drawable methods could be completely different. If we wanted to save a

12
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:47,750
rectangle in a drawable variable, we would need to change the rectangle class

13
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:51,017
to say that it implements drawable.
