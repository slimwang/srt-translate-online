1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:01,940
This course will have five lessons.

2
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:05,300
In this first lesson we'll be giving you
an overview of what AB testing is and

3
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:06,814
what it can and can't be used for.

4
00:00:06,814 --> 00:00:10,030
We'll also go over an example
AB test from start to finish so

5
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:12,150
that you can see what
the whole process looks like.

6
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:14,864
In that example we'll first choose
a metric for an experiment,

7
00:00:14,864 --> 00:00:16,970
then review some necessary statistics.

8
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:20,290
Then we'll design our experiment and
finally we'll analyze the results.

9
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:23,810
Then each subsequent lesson of
the course will dive into more detail

10
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:25,830
on a particular part of the process.

11
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:28,450
In lesson two,
you'll be learning about how to protect

12
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:31,760
the participants of your experiment,
and what questions you should be

13
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,555
asking yourself regarding
the ethicality of experiments.

14
00:00:34,555 --> 00:00:37,020
In lesson three will go into
more detail on choosing and

15
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:40,470
characterizing metrics to use
when evaluating your experiment.

16
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:43,370
In lesson four, we'll talk more about
designing your experiment, which

17
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:47,350
includes choosing which users go in your
control group and your experiment group.

18
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:50,570
And in lesson five we'll go over lots
of examples of what your results could

19
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:54,360
look like, how to analyze those results,
and how to draw valid conclusions.

20
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:57,290
Now you won't need any prior
experience with AB testing in order

21
00:00:57,290 --> 00:01:00,320
to take this course, because we'll
be covering it from the ground up.

22
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,440
And you won't need any
programming experience either,

23
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:05,620
because this course won't cover how
to implement an AB testing framework.

24
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:08,400
It's about how to design and
analyze experiments.

25
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,370
Introductory knowledge of statistics,
on the other hand, will be required.

26
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:15,175
So if you need to brush up, check out
the links in the instructor's notes.

27
00:01:15,175 --> 00:01:17,985
Now throughout the course I'll be
going over lots of examples and

28
00:01:17,985 --> 00:01:20,385
giving you opportunities to
practice what you're learning.

29
00:01:20,385 --> 00:01:22,325
I'll also be having
conversations with Diane and

30
00:01:22,325 --> 00:01:24,539
Carrie about their
experience as an AB testing.

31
00:01:24,539 --> 00:01:25,515
Let's do that now.
