1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,550
For example, and this is a true story,

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:06,110
my entire family uses an application
that has geo-fencing in it.

3
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:09,450
And we've specified particular
environments to be geo-fenced,

4
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:12,580
such as our home,
our place of work, and our schools.

5
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:15,890
Now, whenever one of us enters
of leaves on of these areas,

6
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:18,270
a sound will play on
everybody else's phone.

7
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:22,340
So, for example, when I get home from
work a particular sound will play.

8
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:26,360
My dog has gotten to associate that
sound with one of us coming home and

9
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,650
he gets really excited as dogs do.

10
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:30,410
So if I'm feeling
particularly mischievous,

11
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:34,040
I'll play back that sound and
he'll bolt straight to the garage.

12
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:37,460
I actually have to let him into
the garage and walk him around so

13
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:39,550
that he can be sure that
somebody hasn't just come home.

14
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:41,880
He'll be looking for
them to see if he can find them.

15
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,450
Now let's roll up our sleeves and

16
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:46,599
we'll build a simple geo-fence
app like this one for ourselves.
