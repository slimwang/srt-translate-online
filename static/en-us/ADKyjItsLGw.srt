00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:06,880
To summarize then, concepts can be of many different kinds. Fro very formal,

2
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:10,820
concepts, like Axiomatic concepts, to less formal concepts,

3
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:15,020
like Exemplar concepts. Of course, we can, if we want less formal concepts,

4
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:21,155
like exemplar concepts, philosophers often talk about concepts called qualia,

5
00:00:21,155 --> 00:00:26,390
Q-U-A-L-I-A. Qualia for the raw sensations that we may get from our sensors. And

6
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:31,120
example of qualia is, bitterness. I'm sure you've come across some bitter fruit,

7
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:35,590
some time or the other. And you can even taste it, inside your mouth right now,

8
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:39,870
if you wanted to. But it's very hard to communicate what a qualia is to

9
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:44,010
anyone else, what. Your notion of a genesis to anyone else.
