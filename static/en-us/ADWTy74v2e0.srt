The cube root of x to the 12th would equal x to the 4th. Nice work if you

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:08,858
figured that one out. We use power divided by root again to get x to the 12

3
00:00:08,858 --> 00:00:15,954
divided by 3. 12 is our power and 3 is our root, or the index. It tells us what

4
00:00:15,954 --> 00:00:20,284
type of root we are taking. This should also make sense as our answer since we

5
00:00:20,284 --> 00:00:26,800
can expand x to the 12th as x to the 4th times x to the 4th times x to the 4th.

6
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,500
x to the 4th appears 3 times underneath our cube root, so that means we can

7
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:35,114
pull one of its factors out. So we're left with just x to the 4th.
