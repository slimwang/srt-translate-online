1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Here's the idea of the protocol.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
First they agree on 2 shared values.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
The first is q, some large prime number,

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
and the second is g, and g is a primitive root of q.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
What it means to be a primitive root is that for all numbers

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
in the group Zq, that is the numbers 1, 2, through q-1,

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
we can generate all those numbers by raising g to some integer power.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
If q is prime, it must have a primitive root,

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and there are ways to find these primitive roots.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
We could think of a brute force way of trying numbers until we find one.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
That would be very expensive for a large prime number,

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
but there are more efficient ways to find them, which we won't talk about.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
That's what they start with, those 2 things.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
And then here's how the protocol works.

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Alice will select a large random number, and Bob will also select

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
his own large random number.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
This is like selecting the secret paint colors.

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Then Alice will compute a value we'll call yA,

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
and she'll compute that by raising g to the xA power

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
and doing this modulo q.

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Bob will do the same thing but with his secret power xB.

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
He'll raise g to the xB power modulo q.

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
They'll exchange these values.

24
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Alice sends yA to Bob.

25
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Bob sends yB to Alice.

26
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
And then Alice will compute a key that will be shared between Alice and Bob,

27
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
and she'll compute that by raising the yB value that she received from Bob

28
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
to the xA power and do that all modulo q.

29
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
If this is a good key distribution protocol,

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
then there should be a way for Bob to compute the same key.

31
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I'll see if you can figure that out yourself by making that a quiz.

32
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
These are the possible choices.

33
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Which one of these should Bob compute to obtain the same key as Alice did here?
