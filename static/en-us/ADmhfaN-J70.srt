00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,285
The answer is p equals nc minus m. This is just a simple case of substitution,

2
00:00:04,285 --> 00:00:08,418
like we've done many times before. We do need to pay close attention to the

3
00:00:08,418 --> 00:00:12,605
money earned term right here. If Grant is only earning money from wiper set

4
00:00:12,605 --> 00:00:16,759
sales, then the money he brings in is going to be equal to the number of wiper

5
00:00:16,759 --> 00:00:19,274
sets he sells times the price per wiper set.
