1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,820
Starting with 1, 1 isn't zero, so that's going to be truthy.

2
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:09,640
Awesome is a string of more than zero characters, so

3
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:12,460
that's going to also be truthy.

4
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:14,240
Undefined is simply falsy.

5
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:18,450
-42 isn't zero.

6
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:20,449
This one's kind of tricky, but it's also truthy.

7
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:22,960
Then we come up to this object.

8
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,850
And despite the fact that its one property has a value of false, it's an object,

9
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:28,600
which means that it is truthy.

10
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:34,130
Lastly, we've got this array with a single value of false.

11
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:35,990
Because it's an array, it going to be truthy
