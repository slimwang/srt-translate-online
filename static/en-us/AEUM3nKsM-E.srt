00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,422
We're going to use the idea of area to help us understand multiplication and

2
00:00:04,422 --> 00:00:09,281
multiplying polynomials. If I want to represent the multiplication of 10 times

3
00:00:09,281 --> 00:00:13,407
12, I could set up a rectangle and call the width 10 and the length 12.

4
00:00:13,407 --> 00:00:18,021
Multiplying 10 and 12 would give me the total area of the square, that would be

5
00:00:18,021 --> 00:00:22,622
120. This might not seem like a big deal. But we're going to do something pretty

6
00:00:22,622 --> 00:00:27,126
incredible next. We're going to split up 12 into 10 plus 2. I can also set up

7
00:00:27,126 --> 00:00:31,757
another rectangle. The width will be 10, and the length will be 10 plus 2.

8
00:00:31,757 --> 00:00:36,585
Notice I've created 2 smaller rectangles that make up my larger rectangle. So

9
00:00:36,585 --> 00:00:40,869
what's the area of each of these rectangles? Write your answer here.
