1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,100
Congratulations on completing Stage1.

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:05,920
Now navigate to your Stage2 in Lesson1.

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:09,021
So, Stage2 > Source> jvm > udacity > storm and

4
00:00:09,021 --> 00:00:12,070
open your reporter exclamation topology.

5
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:15,450
If we scroll down to the topology in the main section,

6
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:21,300
we see that we're using a spout called new TestWordSpout.

7
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:25,670
If we scroll up, we see that the TestWordSpout comes from

8
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:30,780
storm Core in backtype.storm.testing.TestWordSpout.

9
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:33,730
These were the four names that we saw up here.

10
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:35,820
Using TestWordSpout is a nice start, but

11
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:39,870
let's now add a RandomSentenceSpout to visualize sentences.

12
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:42,580
Your assignment is in four parts in the reading node.

13
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:47,150
You may need to do a Ctrl+C in order to stop your storm program, but once that's

14
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:50,990
done and you get back to your command line, you're at lesson1, stage1.

15
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:58,193
And navigate to lesson1, stage2 and do cd/vagrant/lesson1/stage2,

16
00:00:58,193 --> 00:01:02,930
and LS should show your .pom files and source.

17
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:05,960
Notice if you're using Atom then you can see the file structure that I've

18
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:10,300
added in a new spout folder, then you can open and

19
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:13,210
we see the RandomSentenceSpout.java file.

20
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:16,720
In part three of the written instructions, you must modify the reporter

21
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,710
exclamation topology, to import the random sentence spout.

22
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:26,900
And please enter the import statement here in begin stage2 exercise part 1-of-2.

23
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:29,020
And don't forget the ending semicolon required in Java.

24
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:35,200
As a hint, you can look at the package structure of udacity.storm and

25
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,700
form your import statement.

26
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:40,660
Once your import statement is completed, you can go back to your command line.

27
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:43,500
Remember that you need to be in lesson1, stage1.

28
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,880
And write mvn package.

29
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:48,390
Once you have build success with your import statements,

30
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:53,190
in part four of the written instructions scroll down to your main method

31
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:58,300
where you see the TopologyBuilder builder with the spout word and

32
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:01,554
the bolt exclamation one and exclamation two.

33
00:02:01,554 --> 00:02:06,400
In part 4a, I'd like you to ignore the TestWordSpout,

34
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:10,850
add in the random sentence spout with an id or

35
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:17,090
component id of rand hyphen sentence, using a parallelism of ten.

36
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:21,780
And finally, connect exclaim one to the RandomSentenceSpout with

37
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,340
a shuffle grouping.

38
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:28,910
And again as a hint, this idcomponent should match your RandomSentenceSpout.

39
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:31,870
Finally, package your program and submit.

40
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:35,830
Once your storm project is running you can check all your visualization.

41
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:39,940
And finally, once your Storm Topology is running, you should be

42
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:45,480
able to go to your visualization, and see now random sentences being visualized.

43
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:49,050
And once you see your visualization, you know you're done with stage2.

44
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:49,710
Congratulations.
