00:00:00,605 --> 00:00:05,720
I'm going to pause here and let you think about, what are the problems with

2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:08,870
this naive implementation of this spinlock. Do you

3
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:11,060
think there is going to be too much contention?

4
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:14,070
Or do you think that it, it's not good enough because it does not exploit

5
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:16,280
caches? Or do you think that it is

6
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:19,230
going to disrupt useful work? Think about that.
