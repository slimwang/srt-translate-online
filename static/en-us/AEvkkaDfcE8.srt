00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,235
It turns out that these equations are identical. Let's see why. I can add x to

2
00:00:05,235 --> 00:00:10,151
both sides to get 2y is equal to x plus 14. Then I divide both sides of my

3
00:00:10,151 --> 00:00:15,175
equation by 2. So, I have 1y is equal to 1 half x plus 7. The second equation is

4
00:00:15,175 --> 00:00:20,233
more simple to solve for y. All we need to do is to divide each term by 6. So I

5
00:00:20,233 --> 00:00:25,358
have one y. 3 6ths of x is the same as 1 half x. And then seven. I know the left

6
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:30,222
side equation is equal to the right side of the equation, so I can just rewrite

7
00:00:30,222 --> 00:00:34,667
my equation with both sides flipped. And sure enough, I have identical

8
00:00:34,667 --> 00:00:37,291
equations. They share all the same points.
