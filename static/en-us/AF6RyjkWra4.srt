1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:04,000
As you might remember when we showed the
application earlier, geofence events,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:04,920
such as entering or

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:08,620
leaving the geofence,
generated notifications on our device.

4
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:11,570
The next step that you'll need
to do to get these notifications

5
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:14,280
is to write a sendNotification
helper method.

6
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:17,450
This takes the string you
created in the last step and

7
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:19,800
creates a notification out of it.

8
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,000
If you aren't familiar
with notifications,

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,602
you should learn more about them
in the instructor notes below.

10
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:30,050
So your next task is to write
the sendNotification helper method,

11
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:32,970
put it in the
GeofenceTransitionsIntentService.java

12
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:35,560
file, and it should take a string and

13
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:38,840
generate a notification
containing that string.

14
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,490
Check this box when you're done.

15
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:41,920
If you're really stuck, don't worry,

16
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,760
I've included an implementation
in the code for this course.
