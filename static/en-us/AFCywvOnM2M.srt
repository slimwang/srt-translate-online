1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:04,120
So Leila's made us this
MT settings activity.

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:07,657
Why don't we make one of those fancy
preference fragments we've been talking

3
00:00:07,658 --> 00:00:11,470
about and populate it with some
preferences we find in an XML file.

4
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:15,540
We'll be using the Version 7 support
library of the preference fragments for

5
00:00:15,539 --> 00:00:18,349
backwards compatibility to API level 9.

6
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:21,050
Because of that,
in the Gradle file you'll need to

7
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:24,870
add the library dependency for
version 7 preferences support.

8
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:27,600
Okay, I've added it now and
I'm going to sync.

9
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:35,409
And once that's done, let's create a new
class and call it SettingsFragment.

10
00:00:35,409 --> 00:00:39,519
This class will extend from
the preference fragment compact.

11
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,730
Make sure you are using compact, and
that it's from the Version 7 library.

12
00:00:43,729 --> 00:00:48,167
Also notice the red error problem
because we've extended this class.

13
00:00:48,167 --> 00:00:51,713
So to solve this, we can simply
implement all the methods in it,

14
00:00:51,713 --> 00:00:54,850
which is just the one
onCreatePreferences.

15
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:58,120
Now that we have this fragment,
let's make an XML preference file,

16
00:00:58,119 --> 00:01:00,879
which will define what
goes inside this fragment.

17
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:06,469
Start by creating a new folder under
the res directory and call it xml.

18
00:01:06,469 --> 00:01:09,659
And this is where our
preferences XML file will live.

19
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:13,869
Once you've done that, you can
create a new XML resource file and

20
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:15,590
call it pref_visualizer.

21
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:20,270
Any preference XML's outer tag is
always a preference screen tag.

22
00:01:20,269 --> 00:01:24,349
Within that tag you can nest other
preferences tags of different types.

23
00:01:24,349 --> 00:01:27,319
You can even nest other preference
screen tags if you want.

24
00:01:27,319 --> 00:01:30,399
This will create a nested
hierarchy of preferences.

25
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,180
What do I mean by a nested
hierarchy of preferences?

26
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:35,410
Well, here,
I'm in the found settings screen.

27
00:01:35,409 --> 00:01:37,060
And if I click on the display,

28
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:39,930
it would actually show me
another settings screen.

29
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:43,930
But for our visualizer app,
we only have a handful of preferences.

30
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:47,290
So we will be using only this
one preference screen tag.

31
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:50,252
I'm going to start by adding
a preference tag for a checkbox.

32
00:01:50,251 --> 00:01:54,697
This checkbox will ultimately determine
whether or not to show the bass circle.

33
00:01:54,697 --> 00:01:58,709
Inside that checkbox preference tag,
I'll define five attributes,

34
00:01:58,709 --> 00:02:03,379
the default value which is true, which
means show the bass circle by default.

35
00:02:03,379 --> 00:02:08,167
The key, just called it show bass,
and then the title is Show Bass.

36
00:02:08,167 --> 00:02:11,699
I'll also provide information
about the preference summary.

37
00:02:11,699 --> 00:02:15,383
A preference summary simply tells
what the user should expect when

38
00:02:15,383 --> 00:02:17,231
they check or uncheck an option.

39
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:23,376
So for that I've set the summary on to
say Shown and summary off to say Hidden.

40
00:02:23,376 --> 00:02:27,283
Now that we have the XML, let's move
back to the settings fragment file.

41
00:02:27,283 --> 00:02:32,222
In the onCreate method, you'll call
the addPreference from resource method,

42
00:02:32,223 --> 00:02:34,310
passing in your XML file.

43
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:37,469
This will generate a preference
screen from that file.

44
00:02:37,469 --> 00:02:39,373
Now that we've had all that sorted out,

45
00:02:39,373 --> 00:02:42,269
let's add this preference
fragment to our activity.

46
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:45,850
To do that, I'm just going to go to
the activity settings layout and

47
00:02:45,849 --> 00:02:50,169
replace this entire relative
layout tag with a fragment tag.

48
00:02:50,169 --> 00:02:54,129
And then point that fragment tag to
the settings fragment we just created.

49
00:02:54,129 --> 00:02:57,370
So we're almost done, just one
more quick change we need to do.

50
00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:00,920
Because we're using a preference
fragments compact library,

51
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:03,519
we need to add a theme
to the styles at XML.

52
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:09,330
So browse to the values folder, and then
open up the styles.xml and add a theme.

53
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:11,610
If you don't add this preference theme,
and

54
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:15,540
you try to go to the Settings screen,
your app will crash.

55
00:03:15,539 --> 00:03:16,900
And when you check your error log,

56
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:20,450
it will tell you you must
specify a preferenceTheme.

57
00:03:20,449 --> 00:03:21,859
Okay, enough talk now.

58
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:24,590
Let's run this code and
see if it actually works.

59
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:29,140
Once you launch the app,
you can go to the Settings screen, and

60
00:03:29,139 --> 00:03:32,059
we get to see our new
checkbox created here.

61
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:36,370
And you can tell that the summary
changes when you check or

62
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:37,990
uncheck it, sweet.
