00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,574
In this unit, we're going to look at some of the core ideas behind interactive

2
00:00:03,574 --> 00:00:07,580
rendering. First, I'll discuss interactivity, and explain concepts such as the

3
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:11,325
refresh rate and frames per second. I'll next talk about the human eye and how a

4
00:00:11,325 --> 00:00:15,484
camera works. These both relate to the idea of defining a view frustum as a way

5
00:00:15,484 --> 00:00:19,520
to see into a virtual world. I'll discuss how light travels in the real world

6
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,814
and how we simplify this physical process in our virtual world in order to

7
00:00:22,814 --> 00:00:26,558
rapidly make pictures of it. In the latter half of this unit, I'll focus on what

8
00:00:26,558 --> 00:00:30,270
the graphics pipeline is and how graphics hardware is able to interactively

9
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:34,315
render complex scenes. I'll end by discussing two rendering algorithms, the

10
00:00:34,315 --> 00:00:36,412
painter's algorithm and the Z-Buffer.
