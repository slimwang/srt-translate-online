00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
[Peter] The correct answer for this

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
is all of them but the second choice.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Let's see why.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Let's pick an example, string s.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Let's say s is duck.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
In the first example, we concatenate a with s,

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
so taking one onwards is going to give us back duck,

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
which is our original string s.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
This works. For the second choice, let's just plug in duck.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
The first character, the zeroth character in duck

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
is going to be d, and we're going to concatenate that

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:39,000
with the rest of the string, giving us back our original string duck.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
So this seems like it works, but we have to remember that s

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
can be the empty string.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
If we try taking the character at position 0,

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
we would get an error because there is no character at position 0

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
because there are no characters in s.

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Moving on, if we try adding an empty string

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
onto s, we get exactly what we had before because we're not adding anything.

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
For the last choice, it doesn't seem completely obvious

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
that it works for the empty string.

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
It seems unintuitive that taking every character from position 0 onward

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
would not result in an error because there are no characters.

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Well, we have to remember that for the subsequence operator,

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
this does not cause an error.

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Why is that the case? Because.
