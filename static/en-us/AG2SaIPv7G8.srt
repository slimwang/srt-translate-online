00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,280
To return the average score, I want to calculate the total, and divide by the

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:07,222
number of scores. I already have a method to calculate the total. I can call

3
00:00:07,222 --> 00:00:11,296
some scores, and divide by current size. But I'm not sure that this is what I

4
00:00:11,296 --> 00:00:15,606
want to return. We had that issue before, where if current size was zero, we

5
00:00:15,606 --> 00:00:20,729
ran into errors. So I'll need to handle that case. If the current size is zero,

6
00:00:20,729 --> 00:00:26,044
I want to return zero, otherwise, it's safe to calculate the actual average. We

7
00:00:26,044 --> 00:00:30,736
need to actually return the average. Compile. And now, if I enter the scores

8
00:00:30,736 --> 00:00:35,160
that I entered before, I'll get the total, and also the average. But what if I

9
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,819
wanted to remove the lowest score? We haven't talked about removing items from

10
00:00:38,819 --> 00:00:42,010
a partially filled array, yet. Kai will talk about that, now.
