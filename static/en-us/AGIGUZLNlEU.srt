00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,505
Unfortunately, sometimes requests fail.

2
00:00:03,505 --> 00:00:13,381
[NOISE] There are many reasons this could happen.

3
00:00:13,381 --> 00:00:16,094
And it's important that your app take into account errors so

4
00:00:16,094 --> 00:00:19,750
that it doesn't completely break if an AJAX request doesn't work.

5
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:22,250
jQuery gives us the .error method,

6
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:24,830
which we can change to the AJAX request we made earlier.

7
00:00:25,852 --> 00:00:30,100
This .error method goes into effect if the AJAX request fails for

8
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:31,240
whatever reason.

9
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:35,030
For this quiz, set up error handling for the New York Times request.

10
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:38,800
Your app should display New York Times articles could not be loaded,

11
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,620
if the request fails.

12
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:43,630
To test error handling, there are a few different ways you can do it.

13
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:47,650
For one, you could simply load the website and then disconnect your internet.

14
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:49,410
That will definitely fail.

15
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:51,780
Or you could always purposely mess up the URL.

16
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:57,600
In which case it's definitely going fail because nyasdftimes.com is

17
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,770
definitely not the website we're looking for.

18
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:03,850
If all goes well, or rather should I say if all goes wrong,

19
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:06,230
you should see this message appear on the page.

20
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:08,897
Check the link in the instructor notes for more on the .error method.

21
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,610
Try chaining the jQuery.error method to the end of your AJAX request and

22
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:17,300
that should take care of any failing request.

23
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:18,100
Check here when you're done.
