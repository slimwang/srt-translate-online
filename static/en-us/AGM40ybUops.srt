00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,920
>> We should multiply the equation by 3. If I multiply every term by 3, then

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:09,829
I'll get 9x. 3 times negative 4y is negative 12y, and 3 times negative 7 is

3
00:00:09,829 --> 00:00:15,301
negative 21. So this equation turns into this equation, and they're actually the

4
00:00:15,301 --> 00:00:20,343
same equation. They just look different. And wow, look at that. We can actually

5
00:00:20,343 --> 00:00:24,735
eliminate the y terms. I have negative 12y here and positive 12y here. Because

6
00:00:24,735 --> 00:00:28,843
these terms are opposite in sign, we know that they sum to zero. I'm not going

7
00:00:28,843 --> 00:00:33,161
to solve this system of equations, but if you want some more practice, go for

8
00:00:33,161 --> 00:00:37,320
it. Remember to check your answer at the end, and then you can know if you're

9
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:37,743
right.
