1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:02,310
If you're up to the challenge,
go ahead and

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:07,000
add the code to your app to send another
event to analytics using TagManager.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,770
In the ShowDinnerActivity, in
the removeMeal() method, change the code

4
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:15,690
that sends the event tracking data and
update it to use TagManager.

5
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:18,720
So here's the removeMeal method.

6
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,450
It sends an intent to start
the RemoveMealActivity, and

7
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:27,230
currently it sends a hit to
Analytics to report the event.

8
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:30,860
So, you're going to
comment all this out and

9
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:34,325
instead add the code to send
the data to TagManager.

10
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:38,710
Notice in this case the label
is not the food preference,

11
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:41,150
because we don't actually have
the food preference here.

12
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:44,200
Instead we're sending the selected
dinner, so you're going to need to

13
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,710
correct a variable in TagManager for
the selected dinner.

14
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:51,528
After you've updated the code
you'll need to go to TagManager and

15
00:00:51,528 --> 00:00:54,493
do what you need to do to send
the data on to Analytics.

16
00:00:54,493 --> 00:00:58,872
You may find you need to create a new
data layer variable, a new trigger, and

17
00:00:58,872 --> 00:01:02,470
I'm pretty sure you're
going to need a new tag.

18
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:04,920
This time, you will need to
deploy your code to the app,

19
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,550
because you've made changes to the code.

20
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:08,852
Don't forget to publish in TagManager.

21
00:01:08,852 --> 00:01:10,350
Start and stop your app.

22
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:15,580
And then look for the hits in
the TagManager real time dashboard.

23
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:20,040
Try out your app and look for
the results in the real time screen.
