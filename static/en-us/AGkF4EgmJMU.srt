00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:02,890
Let's get started with FirebaseUI.

2
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:07,198
Right now, I'm looking at the GitHub
repository for FirebaseUI-IOS.

3
00:00:07,198 --> 00:00:10,050
If you want the direct
link to the repository,

4
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:12,570
you can find it in the resources.

5
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:13,470
Scrolling down a bit,

6
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:17,700
there's a read me that gives us
general information about FirebaseUI.

7
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:20,699
There's a summary of all the ways
you can use FirebaseUI and

8
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:23,599
descriptions of which pods
to add to your pod file,

9
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,040
depending on the specific features
of FirebaseUI that you want to use.

10
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:30,969
Or, if you want to use all of
the features of FirebaseUI,

11
00:00:30,969 --> 00:00:33,879
then there is a single pod
which includes them all.

12
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:37,070
This repository and
its documentation is incredibly useful.

13
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:39,789
And there's much to be learned by
just browsing its directories,

14
00:00:39,789 --> 00:00:42,979
like this directory
called FirebaseAuthUI.

15
00:00:42,979 --> 00:00:44,989
But for now,
let's jump back into our project, and

16
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:48,410
see how easy it is to add
authentication using FirebaseUI.
