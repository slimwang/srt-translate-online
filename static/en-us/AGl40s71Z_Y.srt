1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:04,860
So input checking is a defense that's
generic for all software security.

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:06,470
That applies here as well.

3
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:11,580
And there are actually other kinds of
vulnerabilities when it comes to web

4
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:13,050
application security.

5
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:18,610
OWASP is the non-profit open web
application, security project.

6
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:22,170
They have a list of top
10 vulnerabilities.

7
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:25,450
They also talk about proactive
controls that can help

8
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:27,260
you address those vulnerabilities.

9
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:31,420
And they always talk SQL injections,
or SQL injections.

10
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:35,300
So to avoid that of course, parameter
checking, or argument checking,

11
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:37,760
input checking,
is something that is a good defense.
