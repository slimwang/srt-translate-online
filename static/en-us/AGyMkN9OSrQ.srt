1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:03,250
>> You're right I think tracking things over time, a

2
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:05,470
line chart might be better. Maybe with two lines, one for.

3
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:06,680
>> Yeah, sounds good.

4
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:12,000
>> Alright, so I changed it to a line chart, and I

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,096
think actually in hindsight, I may have liked the bar chart more.

6
00:00:14,096 --> 00:00:14,212
>> Yeah.

7
00:00:14,212 --> 00:00:16,810
>> But this is, this is good, and there was even an option for a

8
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:19,980
cumulative, so I could have kept track of the total amount of money I'd earned.

9
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:20,440
>> Yeah.

10
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:22,030
>> Up to every certain date, which is pretty cool.

11
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:22,690
>> Yeah.
