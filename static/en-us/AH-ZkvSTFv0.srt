00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Now that we know the basics of finite state machines,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
let's change them up.

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Suppose I have this finite state machine from before.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
It matches a - z, followed by 0 - 9.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I want to change it into a new finite state machine that's going to accept [a - z] + [0 - 9].

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
That is, 1 or more copies of a - z and then exactly 1 copy of 0 - 9.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
We're going to be able to do it by adding just 1 edge.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
My questions for you--fill in the blanks--

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
which state should get the edge by state number,

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,346
and what's the label for that edge going to be?
