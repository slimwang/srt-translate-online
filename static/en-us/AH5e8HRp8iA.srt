00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:01,890
Let's dive in with step one.

2
00:00:01,889 --> 00:00:04,750
Adding the correct permissions
to use the Content Provider.

3
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:05,929
In your app go ahead and

4
00:00:05,929 --> 00:00:11,089
open up the Android manifest,
right here add the following permission.

5
00:00:11,089 --> 00:00:13,169
This format is very
similar to asking for

6
00:00:13,169 --> 00:00:17,230
permission for using Internet access or
accessing the phone's camera.

7
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:23,320
I'm only asking for the read permission
from the content provider here,

8
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:26,219
since the quiz example app will
not be writing any information

9
00:00:26,219 --> 00:00:29,079
to the droidtermsexample
Content Provider.

10
00:00:29,079 --> 00:00:30,159
So why do you need to ask for

11
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,408
permissions via the Android
manifest in the first place?

12
00:00:32,408 --> 00:00:35,699
It's a security feature of Content
Providers, that they're protected by

13
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,690
the same permissioning system
that will pop-up these dialogues,

14
00:00:38,689 --> 00:00:41,439
which inform the user of
what the app actually does.

15
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:44,299
Since you must request permissions
to use Content Providers,

16
00:00:44,299 --> 00:00:47,369
this means that an evil developer
can not just get access to

17
00:00:47,369 --> 00:00:49,839
any data on the user's
phone that they want.

18
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,230
For example, they can't use
the context Content Provider to say,

19
00:00:53,229 --> 00:00:56,019
steal all of the user's friends emails.

20
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:59,280
Or at least they wouldn't be able to
do it without a dialogue popping up

21
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,270
requiring the user's consent.

22
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:02,960
