00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:06,422
The answer is, this interval. Negative 8 to 4 with the end points included. If

2
00:00:06,422 --> 00:00:09,726
we look along the y axis here, we can see that any horizontal line we drew

3
00:00:09,726 --> 00:00:13,254
going from y equals negative 8 all the way up to y equals 4, would pass through

4
00:00:13,254 --> 00:00:18,700
this line. In other words, all of the y values that lie between negative 8 and

5
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:23,520
4 have corresponding x values on this curve. In other words, if we get from

6
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:27,348
this value of y, 4, down to this value of y, negative 8, and of course our

7
00:00:27,348 --> 00:00:33,410
curve has no breaks in it. Then we must have passed through every single y

8
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:35,481
value along the way.
