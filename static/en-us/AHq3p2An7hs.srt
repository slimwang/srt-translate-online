[Norvig] And here is the answer. Look. It's only 1 line of code. Isn't that great?

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
What we did is we took the combinations function from itertools,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and that takes the combinations of a list taken n at a time.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
So we go through the hand--and here we didn't even use the fact that the hand is 7 cards,

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
so it could have been 8 or 9 cards or whatever--

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
and we generated all the combinations up from them 5 at a time

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
and then we just took the maximum of that according to the hand_rank.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
And that function does exactly the right thing and passes all the tests.
