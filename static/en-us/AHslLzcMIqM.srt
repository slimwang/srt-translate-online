1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,300
We'll now have a look at the domain name system or DNS. The purpose of

2
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:09,950
the domain name system is to map human readable names such

3
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:15,130
www.gatech.edu to

4
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:20,640
IP addresses such as 130.207.160.173.

5
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,190
A name such as this is human readable and much easier to remember and type than

6
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:27,530
an IP address. But in fact, the IP address

7
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:32,070
is what's needed to send traffic to the intended destination.

8
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:35,180
So, we need a look up mechanism that takes

9
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:37,660
a human readable name and maps it to an IP

10
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:40,210
address. The system that does this is a Domain

11
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:43,250
Name System, or the DNS. They system roughly works as

12
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:46,110
follows the client may want to look up a

13
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:50,450
domain name such as www dot [UNKNOWN] edu the network

14
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:53,590
application source code might do so by invoking

15
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:56,260
a function such as get host by name. Which

16
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:58,720
takes as an argument a domain name and

17
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:02,180
returns an IP address. The client typically has what's

18
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:05,110
called a stub resolver, and that stub resolver

19
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:08,790
takes that name and issues a query. The stub

20
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:11,660
resolver might have cached the answer or the

21
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:15,760
IP address corresponding to this name but if not,

22
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,620
the query is sent to what's called a

23
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:21,660
local DNS resolver. Your local DNS resolver, is typically

24
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:25,060
configured automatically when your host is assigned an IP

25
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:28,360
address using a protocol called the domain host control

26
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:31,700
protocol or DHCP. In your host configuration such as

27
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:34,900
this one, you can see that this local host

28
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:38,340
has two local DNS resolvers. Typically, a client will

29
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:41,060
try the first DNS resolver and if it doesn't

30
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:44,600
receive a response within a preconfigured timeout, it will

31
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,410
try sending the same query To the second local

32
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:50,430
DNS resolver as a backup. This query is typically

33
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:54,570
issued recursively, meaning the client does not want intermediate

34
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:56,900
referrals sent back to it. It only wants to

35
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:59,900
hear when it's received the final answer. The local

36
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:03,020
resolver on the other hand will perform iterative queries.

37
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:06,330
It might have the answer, to this particular query,

38
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:08,210
in the cache in which case it would

39
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:11,390
simply reply with the answer. But let's suppose for

40
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:14,250
the moment, that nothing is cached, each fully qualified

41
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:17,690
domain name is presumed to end with a dot,

42
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:21,520
indicating the root of the DNS hierarchy. Now

43
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,360
the IP addresses for the root servers, or those

44
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,820
that are authoritative for the root may already be

45
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:31,410
configured in the local DNS resolver. In this case,

46
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:33,800
the resolver may be able to query for

47
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:39,740
the authoritative server for .edu and say a.rootservers

48
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:41,550
Dot net. This would be an a record

49
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:44,840
query. The answer might return with what's called an

50
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:50,240
NS record which is a referral. In this case the answer might be a referral to

51
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,190
the edu servers. Now the local resolver issues

52
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:56,520
the same query to the edu servers and receives

53
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:00,695
a referral to the authoritative servers For

54
00:03:00,695 --> 00:03:07,390
gatech.edu. Finally the local resolver might query the authoritative name server

55
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:12,650
for gatech.edu and actually receive an A record indicating

56
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:15,970
the actual IP address that corresponds to that name.
