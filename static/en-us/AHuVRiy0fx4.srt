00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:04,590
Now, we know how easy it is to transform a function in a lot of different ways.

2
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:10,125
We can make a graph move to the left, we can make it move to the right. We can

3
00:00:10,125 --> 00:00:17,962
make it move up, and we can make it move down, too. We can even flip it upside

4
00:00:17,962 --> 00:00:22,758
down, amazing. Now, we know that this kind of flipping is called a reflection

5
00:00:22,758 --> 00:00:26,180
in the x-axis since the x-axis is the line that we're flipping the graph

6
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:32,185
across. However, we have this other axis, too, the y-axis. What do you think a

7
00:00:32,185 --> 00:00:37,036
reflection in the y-axis would look like? And how do we make that happen in our

8
00:00:37,036 --> 00:00:41,875
equation for a function? The function that we were just looking at and that I

9
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:45,843
was just transforming is this black one right here, f of x equals the square

10
00:00:45,843 --> 00:00:51,004
root of x. Now, graphs A and B here are graphs of different functions,

11
00:00:51,004 --> 00:00:55,980
functions that are different transformations of this original function. Which

12
00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:00,435
one represents this function reflected in the x-axis? And which one, for

13
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:04,952
instance this function, reflected in the y-axis? Please fill in A or B in each

14
00:01:04,952 --> 00:01:06,359
of these boxes.
