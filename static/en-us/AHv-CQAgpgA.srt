1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
And very clearly robotics is partially observable.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
We'll talk about this today a little bit more when I apply particle filters.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
It is continuous--that is all measurements are continuous and all actions tend to be continuous.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
The environment is clearly stochastic.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
It's impossible to predict what's happening next with absolute certainty.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Then you can argue back and forth whether it's adversarial or not.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
In most cases we don't treat it as adversarial. We don't think about it.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
But somethings about robotics is indeed adversarial and to some extent driving is as well.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I want to say no for now, but I'm going to accept both answers over here,

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
so you can write whatever you want,

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
because I don't want us to think about robotics as adversarial.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 99:59:59,999
At least not in the case of driving cars.
