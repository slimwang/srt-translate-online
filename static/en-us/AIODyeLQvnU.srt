00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,690
I created the Legobuilder file and
added it to the page.

2
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:07,230
To create the module, I called
angular.module and passed it the name.

3
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:11,270
Remember that to create a module, there
needs to be an array of dependencies.

4
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:14,150
There aren't any for this module so
it's just an empty array.

5
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:17,240
Now that this module is ready,
I just need to bootstrap the app.

6
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:20,160
The empty app directive is
used to bootstrap an app and

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,350
i gave it the name of this module.
