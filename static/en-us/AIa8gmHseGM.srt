00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,799
Let's revisit the challenge question
from the beginning of this section.

2
00:00:03,799 --> 00:00:08,839
We asked about which methods enable us
to find the maximum point in this graph.

3
00:00:08,839 --> 00:00:12,169
We showed that we can have problems
getting stuck in local maxima, or

4
00:00:12,169 --> 00:00:16,920
on plateaus, where there is not enough
local information to determine which way

5
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,940
to go to improve the answer, or to
determine if we've reached the maximum.

6
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:24,130
We used randomness and
three methods to get out of this trap.

7
00:00:24,129 --> 00:00:28,099
They included random restart, where we
start many particles at random positions

8
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:31,570
on the graph, hill climb and
take the best results.

9
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:35,289
Another solution was simulated
annealing, where we make an analogy

10
00:00:35,289 --> 00:00:38,659
to the process of gradually cooling
the temperature of our particle

11
00:00:38,659 --> 00:00:42,029
to make it move in progressively less
random ways while hill climbing,

12
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:44,219
until we converge on the global maximum.

13
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:47,280
Finally, we said genetic
algorithms could help us.

14
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,910
This is where we select positions,
based on their fitness,

15
00:00:49,909 --> 00:00:53,469
to breed children that mutate but
eventually converge on the solution.

16
00:00:53,469 --> 00:00:56,670
We also talked about how random restart,
simulated annealing and

17
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:00,730
genetic algorithms are combined into
the idea of stochastic beam search,

18
00:01:00,729 --> 00:01:03,049
where multiple particles
are released on the graph.

19
00:01:03,049 --> 00:01:06,079
And their children,
generated progressively less randomly,

20
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:08,929
eventually converge
to the maximum value.

21
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:12,795
We'll see these ideas repeatedly in AI
in techniques like particle filters,

22
00:01:12,795 --> 00:01:17,469
pattern recognition with hidden Markov
models and Monte Carlo Markov chains.

23
00:01:17,469 --> 00:01:20,730
Keep these ideas in mind whenever
you're creating your own algorithms or

24
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:22,299
attacking new problems.

25
00:01:22,299 --> 00:01:25,810
Sometimes letting go and embracing
randomness is the key to the solution.
