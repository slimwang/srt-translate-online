00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:04,200
starting point for building and training

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,660
neural networks actually engineers

4
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:08,339
typically use a simplified version of

5
00:00:08,339 --> 00:00:10,199
Alex net because in recent years we've

6
00:00:10,199 --> 00:00:11,759
discovered that some of Alex Nets

7
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:13,859
features aren't really necessary and so

8
00:00:13,859 --> 00:00:15,689
they've been removed but most

9
00:00:15,689 --> 00:00:17,190
implementations Alex not that you'll

10
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:19,439
find online reflect these changes since

11
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:21,868
Alex net a number of newer networks have

12
00:00:21,868 --> 00:00:23,879
been developed with even higher accuracy

13
00:00:23,879 --> 00:00:26,250
but Alex net is still one of the best

14
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:28,649
understood and most widely used starting

00:00:28,649 --> 00:00:34,969
points for computer vision
