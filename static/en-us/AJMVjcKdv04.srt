00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:01,290
To make the coins yellow,

2
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:05,720
first I'll use git show to look at the changes introduced by the color commit.

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:10,670
Scrolling down, I can see that within the Ship, the color was set to navy and

4
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:13,010
solid was set to true.

5
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:17,120
Similarly, within the Asteroid, the color was set to lightgray and

6
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,820
solid was set to true.

7
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:23,050
That probably means that I have to add lines like this to the coin object.

8
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:26,030
Next, I want to compare the first commit before coins were introduced to

9
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:27,490
the final coin commit.

10
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:33,990
I can find the IDs for those by using git log --graph --oneline.

11
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:38,900
So I'll use git diff and here's the latest commit before the coins branch and

12
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:40,540
here's the latest commit with coins.

13
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:45,080
So if I scroll down a bit, there were a lot of changes, but

14
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:47,100
I can see that the coin was introduced here.

15
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:51,830
So I'll open the file game.js and search for coin.

16
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:56,632
And once I find the correct place, then I'll add the lines,

17
00:00:56,632 --> 00:01:01,270
this.color equals yellow and this.solid equals true.

18
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:03,990
Now I'll save the file and check whether it worked.

19
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:06,680
And here's a yellow coin, so it looks good.

20
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:09,820
Now I'll double check what my changes were using git diff,

21
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:11,870
add them and commit them.

22
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:14,190
And I'll use the commit message, Make coins yellow.
