00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,870
Let me now show you some examples of
where things don't work out as well.

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:07,720
For example, here I have one image that
actually you see a lot of different

3
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:09,560
black holes and stuff like that.

4
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:11,810
And if you were to compare
this to the ground truth,

5
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:14,420
which is basically again
what I've shown you before.

6
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:18,230
You notice that there are problems and
not a lot of things are happening.

7
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:21,870
Partly it is, because in an image like
this, sometimes even a good matching

8
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:25,550
algorithm may not find matches at
the patches that you're looking at.

9
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:28,740
There's a lot of research going
on there, stereo matching and

10
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:32,159
stereo reconstruction has become
really mature these days.

11
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,040
I encourage you to
look at various sites.

12
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:37,050
And the many algorithms exist
really do a much better job of

13
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:39,000
this type of disparity computation.

14
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:43,360
Another problem exists
is there are occlusions.

15
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,130
Therefore there are no matches.

16
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:45,950
So for example,

17
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:51,450
here you notice in this instance there
is a whole lot of black spots here.

18
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:53,520
Where partly because if you note this,

19
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,970
these two regions here don't
actually appear in this one.

20
00:00:56,970 --> 00:01:01,740
And similarly there is, you know, lots
of information that's included because

21
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:04,530
as I moved the viewpoints,
different things are appearing.

22
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:07,890
So this region is missing because,
again, I just don't have

23
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:11,550
this information here, in this
viewpoint, so there are no matches.

24
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:12,930
Similarly, when you look at this,

25
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:18,180
this is caused by the fact that
while this region is appearing here,

26
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:20,370
it's not actually appearing
cleanly in both of them.
