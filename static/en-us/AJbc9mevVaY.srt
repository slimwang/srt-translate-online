1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,790
The distance from the base of the building to the foot of the ladder, or the

2
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:09,184
bottom of the ladder, is 18ft. Great solving for getting this one right. This

3
00:00:09,184 --> 00:00:13,756
one was tough. To start, we should begin with a diagram. We'll have a building

4
00:00:13,756 --> 00:00:17,290
and then we'll have a 30ft ladder stretching from the ground up to reach the

5
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:22,664
top, or near the top of the building. We need to place the foot of the ladder,

6
00:00:22,664 --> 00:00:26,885
this part, so that it's distance away from the building, is 6ft less than the

7
00:00:26,885 --> 00:00:33,079
distance up the building. So if we let this distance be x, we know this

8
00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:40,150
distance must be x minus 6. Now, this might look confusing. We see a distance

9
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:44,376
that's longer here, than it is here. Well, my drawings not to scale. Just

10
00:00:44,376 --> 00:00:48,918
because you draw a diagram, it doesn't mean it needs to be perfect. We're just

11
00:00:48,918 --> 00:00:53,278
doing a sketch of the situation so we can solve our problem. So, now that we

12
00:00:53,278 --> 00:00:56,316
have our expressions for this side and this side and, we have a length of the

13
00:00:56,316 --> 00:01:01,618
hypotenuse. We're ready to use the Pythagorean theorem. So, we'll square the

14
00:01:01,618 --> 00:01:07,108
legs, and then we'll square the hypotenuse. This gives us x squared plus x

15
00:01:07,108 --> 00:01:13,354
squared minus 12x plus 36 equals 900. Combining the like terms here we will get

16
00:01:13,354 --> 00:01:18,205
2x squared minus 12x plus 36 equals 900, then we subtract 900 from both sides

17
00:01:18,205 --> 00:01:23,971
to get this equation. Each of these terms is even, so we can divide our

18
00:01:23,971 --> 00:01:30,112
equation by a factor of two. Now we want a factor of this quadratic. We find

19
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:36,944
factors of negative 432 that sum to negative 6. Those two factors are negative

20
00:01:36,944 --> 00:01:41,520
24 and positive 18. Next, we set each factor equal to 0 and we solve for the

21
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:48,232
values of x. Positive 24 and negative 18. We know that this distance needs to

22
00:01:48,232 --> 00:01:53,474
be positive, so this answer is out. This must mean that the distance from the

23
00:01:53,474 --> 00:01:58,594
bottom of the building to the top of the ladder is 24ft. And the distance from

24
00:01:58,594 --> 00:02:03,467
the base of the building to the base of the ladder is 18ft. Great solving if

25
00:02:03,467 --> 00:02:05,622
you got all the way to the end. [NOISE]
