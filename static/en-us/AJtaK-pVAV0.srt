00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,760
Congratulations and good job! You've made it to the end of Unit 1.

2
00:00:03,772 --> 00:00:06,750
You've learned a lot about parallel computing on the GPU already,

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:11,481
both the fundamentals of the GPU programming model, and how to write your first GPU program.

4
00:00:11,481 --> 00:00:16,853
Now we're going to talk to NVIDIA Chief Scientist and Senior Vice President of Research, Bill Dally.

5
00:00:16,853 --> 00:00:19,208
Bill is one of the pioneers of parallel computing,

6
00:00:19,208 --> 00:00:21,725
so I hope you enjoy his perspective as much as I do.

7
00:00:21,725 --> 00:00:24,543
After the interview, we can dive into problem set 1,

8
00:00:24,543 --> 00:00:30,133
where you'll write a program that will transform a color image into a gray scale image,

9
00:00:30,133 --> 00:00:32,702
and we'll provide a lot of the surrounding code for this assignment,

10
00:00:32,702 --> 00:00:35,019
but you're going to write the most important part;

11
00:00:35,019 --> 00:00:41,758
the part that actually does the parallel processing on the GPU.
