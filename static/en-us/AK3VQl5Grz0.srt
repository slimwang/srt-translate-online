00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,687
Now that we have an equation to solve, I want you to figure out the time it

2
00:00:02,687 --> 00:00:06,832
takes for the slower person, and the time it takes for the faster person. Keep

3
00:00:06,832 --> 00:00:10,549
in mind that the slower person would be x and the faster person would be x

4
00:00:10,549 --> 00:00:13,824
minus 6. Good luck.
