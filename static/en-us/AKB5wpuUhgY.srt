1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:05,570
This equation represents a hyperbola that opens to the left and to the right.

2
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:09,513
Now we might not recognize the hyperbola in this form. So, let's subtract y

3
00:00:09,513 --> 00:00:14,329
squared from both sides of the equation. This'll move the y squared to the

4
00:00:14,329 --> 00:00:17,920
left-hand side, so we'll have x squared minus y squared equals positive 9 on

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:23,352
the right. We have subtraction between our x squared term and our y squared

6
00:00:23,352 --> 00:00:28,203
term, so we know this is a hyperbola. Further more, we know that this parabola

7
00:00:28,203 --> 00:00:33,438
opens to the left and to the right since the x squared term is positive. It's

8
00:00:33,438 --> 00:00:37,096
the one that comes first. Now it's not so much which one comes first, but it's

9
00:00:37,096 --> 00:00:41,886
really the one that's positive determines the direction. Since the x squared

10
00:00:41,886 --> 00:00:45,730
term is positive, we know it opens left and right. And just to be sure, I'll

11
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:51,280
show you this graph to tell you that these graphs are identical. The equations

12
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,870
represent the same hyperbola.
