1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:02,650
This is the last project of the course. We'll be

2
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:04,450
putting together everything you've learned

3
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:07,585
so far. Affordances, signifiers, conceptual

4
00:00:07,585 --> 00:00:11,730
model, system image, discoverablity, and feedback. For many of you,

5
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:13,130
this will be the first time you've thought about an

6
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:16,260
interface from the design side. You just use it. And

7
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,700
for others, perhaps you'll be thinking about stuff in new

8
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:22,850
ways. In any case, this is the capstone project for

9
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:25,700
the course, and we want you to bring it all together.

10
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:29,090
And you'll be amazed at what you create and learn in the process.

11
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:33,380
As we do this project, we'll also practice a few new key design methods

12
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:35,660
that will help you create new ideas,

13
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:38,970
faster prototypes and get feedback from users.

14
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:41,630
But don't worry about that now, you'll be doing it before you know it.
