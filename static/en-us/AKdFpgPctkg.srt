00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:16,370
that are used to set some state on the

00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:19,150
client. For example whether or not the client is logged

00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:21,780

00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:25,320
last modified and some more instructions about how the page

00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,610
can or cannot be cached. There's also a content type header

10
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:32,299
to indicate that the response is coming back in HTML format.
