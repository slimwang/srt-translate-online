00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
[Peter] So on this web page, there are 3 clickable hyperlinks.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
The first URL links to higher education.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
The second URL links to Sebastian's Wikipedia page.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
And the last one is the Digital Life Design Conference Wikipedia page.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
To go to the answers, here is the HTML page that you were given.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
The first option is this URL right here.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Although it is a URL, it's not a clickable link.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
It's not encapsulated in this prefix

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
that was described before.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
The "a" means that this is an anchor tag,

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
and the href means that it's a hyperlink reference

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
specified by the URL.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
So this is not the correct choice because it is not a link

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
that you can click on.

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
The second choice is a URL to the Wikipedia page on higher education.

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
It highlights this text as a clickable link.

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
The third option is Sebastian Thrun's Wikipedia page.

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Again, for the same reason as before, it's a link that you can click on.

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The fourth option is this quote.

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Although it's encapsulated in quotes like the other URLs,

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
it's not in a tag at all.

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
It's just plain text as displayed on the screen.

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
The last option is a URL to the Wikipedia page

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
on the Digital Life Design Conference.

25
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Like the other 2 URLs, it is a link that you can click on.
