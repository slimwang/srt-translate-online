00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:01,800
OK, so the next step is for us to

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:05,920
understand how Python knows about this thing called the turtle.

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:09,100
But before we do that, here's your task. I want

4
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:12,520
you to reproduce this entire code on your computer. And

5
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:14,200
oh, and by the way, you can customize this

6
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:18,880
turtle. You can change it's shape. You can also change

7
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,830
its color, and you can change the speed at which

8
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:25,000
it moves. Let me quickly save and show you the

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,540
output. Alright. So it seems like we've changed a few

10
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:31,990
things about the turtle. Its color, which is yellow now,

11
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:35,760
and shape and also its speed. Oh, by the way,

12
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,170
if you need more information about how to customize your turtle.

13
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:41,850
There are some helpful links in the instructor notes. After

14
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:44,630
you have created your own custom square I want you to

15
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:47,280
take a screenshot of your output and post that on

16
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,080
the forum. Make sure to check this box before you continue.
