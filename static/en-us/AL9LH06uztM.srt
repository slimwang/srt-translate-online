00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:00,880
Hey Charles.

2
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:01,780
>> Hey Michael.

3
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:04,510
>> So like I get to lecture near you today.

4
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:06,290
>> Yes you do. I can even see you.

5
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:09,250
>> This is, this is crazy. I sort of don't

6
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:11,230
have my regular pad. This makes me a little uncomfortable.

7
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:13,310
>> But you look very dashing in your nice blue suit.

8
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:15,520
>> Thanks. We're going to record some live action stuff today.

9
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:16,510
>> Mm.

10
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:18,950
>> [LAUGH] All right so. Do you remember

11
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:22,150
last time we were talking about Bayesian learning?

12
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:23,550
>> I do, because I led that.

13
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:25,210
>> Right. Good point.

14
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:29,130
And so one of the questions that I asked as a follow-up was, these

15
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:31,160
quantities, these probabilistic quantities that we're working

16
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:32,420
with. Is there's anything that we need to

17
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:35,790
know about how to represent and reason with them. And you said that I should

18
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:38,840
look into it. Yeah, because I, I just, I yeah you should look into it.

19
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:41,130
>> So I did. So, and it's cool. And so

20
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:42,720
I figured it would be fun to tell you about it.

21
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,550
>> Okay, well I look forward to it.

22
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:46,220
>> Thanks! And also I want to point out, we're

23
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:48,980
using a different color scheme today. Isn't that a nice blue?

24
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:50,290
>> It is a nice blue, its sort

25
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:54,260
of a relaxing blue. As opposed to that blue blue that we used before.

26
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:56,310
>> It's like Cerulean... Is it?

27
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:56,730
>> No.

28
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:57,900
>> It's more like periwinkle.

29
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:59,580
>> No, it's definitely not periwinkle.

30
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:01,430
>> Oh you're right, it's not periwinkle. Periwinkle's a

31
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:02,010
>> Navy.

32
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:03,270
>> No, it's too light to be navy.

33
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:08,570
>> All right, so so good, so right. It turns out that there's this concept

34
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:11,240
called Bayesian Networks, which is this wonderful

35
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:15,410
representation for representing and manipulating probabilistic quantities over

36
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:18,170
complex spaces. And so it fits in really well

37
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:19,760
with the stuff you were talking about last time.
