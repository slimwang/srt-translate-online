00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:02,560
Like any complex new feature,

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:05,530
it's pretty easy to shoot
yourself in the foot.

3
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:09,570
If you don't handle the edge cases
properly, you can find yourself with

4
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:13,990
an app that might never update because
the service worker never updates.

5
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:21,960
It's crucial that the HTTP request made
during the install event goes directly

6
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:27,280
to the network, and doesn't return
a response from the browser's cache.

7
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:31,840
Otherwise, the browser may return
the old cached version resulting in

8
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,270
a service worker cache that
never actually updates.
