1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:04,117
We've looked at some exponential functions. But, now we're going to take a

2
00:00:04,117 --> 00:00:07,362
short break from them to look at representing very small and very large

3
00:00:07,362 --> 00:00:11,356
numbers. Imagine you want to travel to the far, far regions of the known

4
00:00:11,356 --> 00:00:16,075
universe. Out past Mars, right past Pluto, out past where Voyager is sending

5
00:00:16,075 --> 00:00:21,290
back images, far beyond our own galaxy, past our nearest neighbor, Andromeda.

6
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:25,849
On, and on, and on, traveling over. Well, traveling a very long distance, a

7
00:00:25,849 --> 00:00:31,290
distance so long that it's hard to express with words. We could write this out

8
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:36,958
as 5, another 5, and then 22 zeros if you want to talk about it in miles. In

9
00:00:36,958 --> 00:00:41,560
kilometers, this would be 8, 8, and then 22 zeros, or perhaps you want to

10
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:48,902
examine some bacteria. How big is a tiny organism like this. If we wanted to

11
00:00:48,902 --> 00:00:56,405
talk about how long the bacteria is, we could write it like this, 0.0000005 m.

12
00:00:56,405 --> 00:01:00,187
Apart from it being really boring to write out all those zeros, it's easy to

13
00:01:00,187 --> 00:01:05,960
make a mistake when we write out numbers like this, and it's also hard to read.

14
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:10,870
We really need a better way to write quantities like this. And guess what,

15
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:15,417
there is one. It's called scientific notation. And as you've already seen, it's

16
00:01:15,417 --> 00:01:18,955
very useful, especially when we're talking about very big and very small

17
00:01:18,955 --> 00:01:22,039
quantities. Let's get ready to talk about it.
