00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,350
One important decision in the design of the

2
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:06,270
modern routers was to place a copy of

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:08,940
the forwarding table on each line card in

4
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:12,720
the router. Well, this introduces some complications in

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:15,630
making copies of the forwarding table. Doing so,

6
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:18,590
prevents a central table on the router from

7
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:21,840
becoming a bottleneck at high speeds. Consider an

8
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,320
alternative where the router only has one copy of

9
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,500
forwarding table. . In that case all of the

10
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:30,650
line cards would need to be performing look ups on

11
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:33,620
a central table. Which involves communication across the back

12
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:36,320
plane as well as many more look ups against a

13
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,620
central table. So while distributing the forwarding table across

14
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:43,470
line cards prevents a central table from becoming a bottleneck.

15
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:47,470
Early router architectures did not place the look up table

16
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:50,590
on each line card, and as a result, when packets

17
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:53,900
arrived at an individual line card, they would induce

18
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:57,250
a look up in a shared buffer memory which

19
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:59,560
could be accessed over a shared bus. But this

20
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,800
shared bus, of course, introduces a bottleneck as well

21
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,390
as contention between the different line cards that may

22
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:08,900
be all performing lookups to the same shared memory.

23
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:12,140
The solution, of course, was thus to remove the

24
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:15,980
shared memory and instead place copies of the forwarding

25
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:18,800
table on each line card. In summary, An

26
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,440
important innovation in the design of these router

27
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:24,220
was to eliminate the shared bus and place

28
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:26,480
the look up table on individual line bus.
