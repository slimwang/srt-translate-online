Try solving these two number puzzles. You want two factors that multiply to give

2
00:00:04,921 --> 00:00:09,583
you the top number, like 4 times 5 equals 20, and the two numbers need to add to

3
00:00:09,583 --> 00:00:14,339
the bottom number, 4 plus 5 equals 9. And it doesn't matter which order you put

4
00:00:14,339 --> 00:00:18,502
the numbers in. I could have also written five here and four here. You'll be

5
00:00:18,502 --> 00:00:19,739
correct either way.
