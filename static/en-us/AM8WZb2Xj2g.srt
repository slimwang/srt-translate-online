1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:04,202
Log in to your AWS account and
go to the EMR service.

2
00:00:04,202 --> 00:00:06,470
This is what I see all my past clusters.

3
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:08,160
Can create a new one here.

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,740
Here you see a quick set up for
clusters.

5
00:00:12,915 --> 00:00:15,185
There are two different
modes you can use.

6
00:00:15,185 --> 00:00:18,665
Either you can launch a long running
cluster or do step execution.

7
00:00:18,665 --> 00:00:22,185
Which runs all the jobs you add
then terminates the cluster.

8
00:00:22,185 --> 00:00:25,125
Here you can see various applications
you can install in the cluster.

9
00:00:26,265 --> 00:00:28,955
And this is where you select
the number of nodes and

10
00:00:28,955 --> 00:00:31,115
what type of instances you'll use.

11
00:00:31,115 --> 00:00:34,295
Before you get started launching
a cluster though let's consider how

12
00:00:34,295 --> 00:00:36,710
we're going to get data into and
out of our cluster.

13
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:39,630
Since we won't be storing
data on this thing over time.

14
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:46,410
Typically transferring data into and
out of EC2 instances costs money.

15
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:50,720
But Amazon has a service called S3 for
storing data.

16
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:53,830
Transfers between S3 and EC2 are free.

17
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:57,370
So it makes a lot of sense
to keep your data on S3 then

18
00:00:57,370 --> 00:00:59,790
transfer it to an EMR cluster for
analysis.
