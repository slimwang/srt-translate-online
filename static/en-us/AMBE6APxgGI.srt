00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:02,960
There are two fundamental
pieces of technology

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:06,990
that enable progressive web apps
to be reliable, fast and engaging.

3
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:09,950
Service workers and
the Web App Manifest File.

4
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:12,500
Let's take a look at
service workers first.

5
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:16,120
Most web apps are built
on a client-server model.

6
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:19,140
Without a server there is no web app.

7
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,140
But service workers changes that.

8
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:24,870
Service workers are a progressive
enhancement for the network staff, and

9
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:27,760
sit between the browser and the server.

10
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,270
Acting as a client side
proxy written in JavaScript.

11
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:33,910
That means you can cache assets locally.

12
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:37,130
So no matter what kind of
network the user's connected to,

13
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:40,030
apps load near instantly.

14
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:42,960
Apps can even work offline
because the service worker

15
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,270
will respond to network requests.

16
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:47,130
Once a service worker is registered,

17
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:50,200
it can do more than just
as a client side proxy.

18
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,190
You can define what
events will wake it up.

19
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,595
Events like push messages can
wake up a service worker and

20
00:00:57,595 --> 00:01:00,020
re-engage the user with notifications.

21
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:03,620
Or data can be seamlessly
synced to your servers

22
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:05,760
when a network connection is restored.

23
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,900
And what's amazing is that they don't
rely on the web app being open in a tab,

24
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:14,440
or even a browser being open on mobile.

25
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:20,930
Service workers are to progressive web
apps, as XMLHttpRequest was to Ajax.

26
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:26,250
They give progressive web apps
the power to exist beyond the browser.

27
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:31,100
The second fundamental piece of
technology is the web app manifest file,

28
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:35,840
which gives you the ability to control
how your app appears to the user

29
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,850
in areas where they would
expect to see apps.

30
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:41,740
And more importantly,
how they can launch it.

31
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:45,560
When a set of heuristics are met,
the web app install banner

32
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:50,180
will even prompt users to add
your app to their home screen.

33
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:54,970
Then when the user opens it from
the home screen, it opens full-screen,

34
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:56,460
no browser UI.

35
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:59,360
And it's a top level app
in the task switcher.

36
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,420
So it feels just like any other app.
