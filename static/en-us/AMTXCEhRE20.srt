00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:05,740
David's answer was good, but not necessarily optimal. I think he put handle as

2
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:09,920
fixed at this particular place in the explanation because the first reason here.

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:14,540
He wanted to capture the notion, that only fixed-handle cups enable drinking.

4
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:18,245
And that this spot does it. He wanted to capture the notion that only

5
00:00:18,245 --> 00:00:22,490
fixed-handle cups enable drinking and this scenario does that.

6
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:26,830
However, this not an optimal way of fixing this particular explanation. However,

7
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:30,400
this is not the best way of fixing this particular explanation because it leads

8
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:35,130
to additional decisions. It suggests that, only those things which have a fixed

9
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:39,170
handles are liftable, but of course, from the pail we know, that the pail

10
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:43,980
does not have a fixed handle and yet the pail is liftable. This suggests that

11
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:48,720
handle is fixed should go somewhere else. Perhaps above, object is liftable, but

12
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:53,130
still below object enables drinking. Agent two can figure out that this is

13
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:56,780
not the optimal case for putting case as handle as fixed. Because A,

14
00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:02,070
it voided its notion of pail, a pail is liftable, but has a movable handle.

15
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:06,450
It also voided this notion of a briefcase. This part was coming from a person of

16
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:11,450
a briefcase. The briefcase with removable handle, and it to is liftable. This is

17
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:15,120
how the agent knows this handle is fixed should go somewhere else, in this

18
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:19,340
explanation. Above object is liftable, but beneath object is enables drinking.
