1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,880
Let's start exploring
intersections with the following.

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:08,060
Given two lines in two dimensions,
where do they intersect?

3
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:09,920
First, let's make a definition.

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:13,870
Two lines are parallel,
if their normal vectors are parallel.

5
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:17,260
So for example, these lines are parallel

6
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:21,470
because their normal vectors differ
by a factor of negative two.

7
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:24,030
Whereas these two lines are not parallel

8
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:26,490
because their normal
vectors are not parallel.

9
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:30,090
It may seem strange that we are using
normal vectors in our definition

10
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:32,009
instead of direction vectors.

11
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:35,390
In two dimensions,
the definitions are equivalent.

12
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:39,490
However, in higher dimensions, there
will not be a single direction vector,

13
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:43,350
so using the normal vector will
be more extensible later on.

14
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:45,850
If two lines are not parallel,

15
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:49,550
then they will have
an intersection at a single point.

16
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:53,720
However, if two lines are parallel,
then there are two possibilities.

17
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,480
They might not intersect at all, or

18
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,520
they might turn out to be the same line,
so-called coincident lines,

19
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:04,190
in which case they will intersect
in infinitely many points.

20
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:08,890
In linear algebra, this trichotomy of
cases for intersections is the rule.

21
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:12,840
When asked whether two linear objects
intersect, the answer is that there will

22
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:17,030
either be a unique point of
intersection, there will be no common

23
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:21,160
intersection or there will be
infinitely many intersection points.

24
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:24,880
There cannot just be two or
three intersections.

25
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,720
So given two lines in two dimensions,

26
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,260
how can we tell whether
they have an intersection?

27
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:33,070
Well, first, we should check
whether they are parallel by

28
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:35,080
looking at their normal vectors.

29
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:37,380
If their normal vectors are parallel,

30
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:40,230
then we need to check whether
they are the same line.

31
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:41,660
How can we do this?

32
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:46,090
Suppose the two lines are coincident,
that is, the same line.

33
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:49,480
Then, if I take any point
from the first line and

34
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:53,150
any point from the second line,
in reality, from the same line,

35
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:57,610
then the vector connecting the two
points will be parallel to both lines.

36
00:01:57,610 --> 00:01:59,000
In other words,

37
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,550
this vector will be orthogonal
to both lines' normal vectors.

38
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:08,758
On the other hand, suppose the two lines
are not coincident, but still parallel.

39
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:11,510
Then these lines have no
common intersections.

40
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:14,440
So if we pick a point
from the first line and

41
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:19,210
a point from the second line, then
the vector connecting the two points

42
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:21,810
won't be in the direction of the lines.

43
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:24,720
In other words, this connecting vector

44
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,650
won't be orthogonal to either
of the normal vectors.

45
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:31,370
This gives us a computable test for

46
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:35,100
whether two lines are the same once
we know that they are parallel.

47
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:39,300
Two parallel lines are coincident or
equal if and

48
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:43,260
only if the vector connecting
some pair of points,

49
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:48,330
one from each line, is orthogonal
to both the lines' normal vectors.

50
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:52,270
Okay, now let's suppose we
have two nonparallel lines.

51
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:54,130
So we know they will intersect.

52
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:56,530
How do we find their intersection point?

53
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:59,580
Let's write the lines in
their standard forms.

54
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:05,050
Ax plus By equals k1 and
Cx plus Dy equals k2.

55
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:08,600
I write this left curly brace to
indicate that this is a system of

56
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,870
simultaneous linear equations.

57
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:12,810
So how do we go about
solving this system?

58
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:17,110
It would be nice to divide
the first equation through by A, so

59
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:18,820
that we can solve for x.

60
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:21,540
However, what if A equals 0?

61
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:25,020
Well if that were the case,
we could move to the other equation and

62
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:28,580
then try dividing this second
equation through by C.

63
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:31,180
But what if C is also zero?

64
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:36,604
Actually, that can't happen because
if A and C are both zero, then

65
00:03:36,604 --> 00:03:43,140
the lines are just of the form Y equals
k1 over B, and Y equals k2 over D.

66
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,890
Which are both horizontal lines, but

67
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:50,910
since we assume the two lines were not
parallel, they both can't be horizontal.

68
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:54,790
So that means either A or
C has to be non-zero.

69
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:56,160
To make matter simpler,

70
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:59,760
let's just do the following at
the beginning of the whole procedure.

71
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,660
We check to make sure
A does not equal zero.

72
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:06,030
If so, then we swap the order
of the two equations.

73
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:08,190
So A and C would swap places.

74
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:12,420
B and D swap places, and
k1 and k2 also swap.

75
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:16,310
Then we can always assume
that A does not equal zero.

76
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:19,820
So with that assumption that A is
not zero, we can go ahead and

77
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:26,130
divide through by A giving us x
plus B over Ay equals k1 over A.

78
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:27,700
Now instead of solving for

79
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:31,060
x directly, I'm going to do
something slightly different.

80
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:36,050
I will now subtract C times
the left hand side of this equation

81
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:40,310
from the second equation to maintain
the balance of the second equation.

82
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:43,540
I'll also subtract C times k1

83
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:46,930
over A from the right-hand
side of the second equation.

84
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:53,268
So now our second equation looks
like Cx plus Dy minus Cx minus Bc

85
00:04:53,268 --> 00:04:58,830
over Ay equals -Ck1 over A plus k2.

86
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:04,600
The C terms cancel, and after
collecting the y terms together we get

87
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:12,050
quantity D minus BC over A times y
equals negative Ck1 over A plus k2.

88
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:17,170
Now let's multiply through by A to make
the equation a bit nicer to work with,

89
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:24,210
and then to solve for y, we can divide
through by AD minus BC or can we?

90
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:25,698
What if AD minus BC equals zero.

91
00:05:25,698 --> 00:05:30,400
Well, if this is the case,
then let's rewrite

92
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,410
the left-hand side as a dot product
using the trick we used before.

93
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:40,770
This gives us the vector AB dotted
with a vector D minus C equals zero.

94
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:44,860
Now this first vector is a normal
vector to the first line and

95
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:50,890
the second vector D minus C is
parallel to the second line.

96
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:53,725
Looking at this geometrically,

97
00:05:53,725 --> 00:05:58,685
this means that the line Ax plus
By equals k1 is parallel to

98
00:05:58,685 --> 00:06:04,174
the line in the direction of D minus C,
which is Cx plus Dy = k2.

99
00:06:04,174 --> 00:06:08,916
But this violates our initial assumption
that the lines were not parallel.

100
00:06:08,916 --> 00:06:14,640
So AD minus BC cannot equal
zero under this assumption.

101
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:20,340
Great so that means we can divide
through by AD minus BC, so

102
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:27,450
y equals negative Ck1 plus Ak2
over the quantity AD minus BC.

103
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:31,850
Now let's use the same subtraction
process to go from this equation

104
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:33,560
back to our first equation.

105
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:38,760
If we subtract B over A times
y from the left-hand side,

106
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:44,670
then we can subtract B over A times
all of this, from the right-hand side.

107
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:51,920
This gives us the messy
looking equation,

108
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:57,710
x = ((k1 / A)- (B / A))
((-Ck1 + Ak2 / AD- BC)).

109
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:01,180
Let's pull a factor of one over
A to make it a bit cleaner and

110
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:03,320
then forming a common denominator for

111
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:08,170
the k1 term allows us to consolidate
the fraction inside the parentheses.

112
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:11,780
This lets us kill the BCk1 terms and

113
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:16,850
then cancel the factors of A to
get this final form x equals

114
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:22,020
Dk1 minus Bk2 all over AD minus BC.

115
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:25,040
So the point of intersection
of these two lines,

116
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:29,750
Ax plus By equals k1 and
Cx plus Dy equals k2.

117
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:34,022
Assuming they are not parallel lines,

118
00:07:34,022 --> 00:07:40,106
is this point x equals Dk1
minus Bk2 over AD minus BC and

119
00:07:40,106 --> 00:07:44,780
y equals -Ck1 plus Ak2 over AD minus BC.

120
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:48,610
This formula might look rather
messy at first blush, but it

121
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:52,570
actually exhibits some nice symmetries
that we'll explore a bit later.

122
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:54,060
For now though let's go ahead and

123
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:57,760
code up a function to compute this
intersection between two lines.
