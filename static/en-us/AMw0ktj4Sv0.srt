00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,380
The notion of orthogonality
is extremely powerful.

2
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:05,150
Fundamentally, it gives us a tool for

3
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:10,040
decomposing objects into combinations
of simpler objects in a structured way.

4
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:14,750
Let's explore one of the first phenomena
that are consequences of orthogonality.

5
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:18,440
For this video,
let b be a constant vector.

6
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:22,250
Or you can think of the b as
standing for the word basis.

7
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:26,150
It will be useful to think of b as
emanating from the origin and then to

8
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:31,780
imagine a line l through the origin
that contains the arrow representing b.

9
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:36,200
We're going to consider the process
of projecting a vector v

10
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,390
onto the basis vector b.

11
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:43,270
One way to describe what this means is
to let v emanate from the origin and

12
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:47,530
then imagine rotating your point of
view until you are looking at b and

13
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:49,850
v in the same plane.

14
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:54,810
Then measure the apparent magnitude of
the arrow v from this point of view.

15
00:00:54,810 --> 00:01:00,515
Unless v and b are perfectly parallel,
v will look shorter than it actually is.

16
00:01:00,515 --> 00:01:04,450
The shorter arrow is
the projection of v onto b

17
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:08,560
which we will denote by proj sub b of v.

18
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,930
Or v with two little bars next to it for
short.

19
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:16,890
Another way to describe projection
is to draw a right triangle

20
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:18,860
whose hypotenuse is
the arrow depicting v.

21
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:23,500
And one of whose legs
lies on the line l.

22
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:27,170
If we draw a vector from
the origin along this leg,

23
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:31,150
that drawn vector will also be
the projection of v onto b.

24
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:33,570
The remaining leg is
perpendicular to the line l,

25
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:36,870
and therefore orthogonal to b.

26
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:41,670
If we draw a vector along this leg,
the drawn vector is the component of

27
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:49,440
the orthogonal to b which we can denote
v with a an upside down t called v perp.

28
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:52,520
Remember a definition of
the sum of two vectors?

29
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:58,090
Since we have formed a chain of two
arrows from the tail to the head of v,

30
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:01,740
we can say that the sum of
these two vectors is v.

31
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:06,800
In other words,
v equals the parallel plus the perp.

32
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:12,010
We have written v as a sum of two
vectors, one that is parallel to b and

33
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:13,610
the other that is orthogonal to b.

34
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:17,590
This is something that
occurs often in mathematics.

35
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:21,950
Given a nonzero basis vector
we can express any vector

36
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:26,400
as a sum of two vectors, one that's
parallel to the basis vector and

37
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,400
one that is orthogonal
to the basis vectors.

38
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,320
All right, so

39
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:35,330
is there a nice way to compute the
projection of v onto the basis vector b?

40
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:37,950
Let's start by making
a simplifying assumption.

41
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:43,120
Let's assume that the angle between
v and b is at most 90 degrees.

42
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,810
If you remember soh-CAH-toa from
trigonometry remember that the CAH means

43
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:53,310
that the cos sign of the angle of
a right triangle is equal to the ratio

44
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:58,310
of the adjacent edge to the angle and
the hypotenuse.

45
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:02,680
In other words, the cosine of
theater is equal to the length of

46
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:06,270
v parallel divided by the length of v.

47
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:09,970
After some rearranging, that means
that the length of the v parallel

48
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:13,360
is the length of v times
the cosine of theta.

49
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,990
Now we're going to use our dot
product formula from earlier.

50
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:21,940
Substituting this expression in for
cosine theta we get that the length

51
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:27,600
of v parallel equals the length
of v times this expression.

52
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,880
Since we have a factor of the length
of v in the numerator and

53
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,090
denominator of the expression,
we can cancel them.

54
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:40,250
And then we can rewrite what's left
over as v.u sub b whereas u sub b

55
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:45,387
is the unit vector in the direction
of b i.e., the normalization.

56
00:03:45,387 --> 00:03:48,580
All right, so
I cleaned up some of these formulas and

57
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:53,560
just left what we need going
forward the length of v parallel

58
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:58,290
is equal to the dot product of just
v with the normalization of b.

59
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,010
Now because we made this simplifying
assumption that theta is less than or

60
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:05,600
equal to 90 degrees we know that v

61
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:09,590
parallel will point in
the same direction as b.

62
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:12,950
We also know that the normalization
of b is a unit vector.

63
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:15,140
So it will have magnitude one.

64
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:21,310
What these two facts tell us is that
if we scale the normalization of b by

65
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:27,300
exactly the length of v parallel there
will actually get the vector v parallel.

66
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:31,030
imagine taking a unit vector that's
right here and just stretching it

67
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:35,310
just the amount needed to get to v
parallel that's what we're doing.

68
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:40,380
Now let's plug in this expression for
the length of the parallel.

69
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:43,405
And what we end up with is this formula.

70
00:04:43,405 --> 00:04:46,870
V parallel is exactly
the normalization of b

71
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:52,330
times the scalar v dot
the normalization of b.

72
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:54,750
Now what if we didn't make
the simplifying assumption?

73
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:57,350
What if theta were
greater than 90 degrees?

74
00:04:57,350 --> 00:05:00,690
That negative sign from earlier will
carry through all the way to this

75
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:01,545
expression here.

76
00:05:01,545 --> 00:05:04,360
We'll also have to make a change here

77
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:09,050
because v parallel will now point
in the opposite direction of b.

78
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:13,320
Since v parallel is pointing in the
opposite direction this formula will now

79
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:19,300
become a negative but
now when we plug this expression in for

80
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:23,890
a length of v parallel then
the negative signs will cancel out and

81
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:25,610
we'll get the same formula.

82
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:29,270
So regardless of the assumptions that
we make on this angle will always get

83
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:33,410
the same formula for v parallel in other
words the projection of v on to b.
