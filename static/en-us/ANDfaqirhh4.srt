1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Obviously, there is an equilibrium at 0--f stays 0 once it becomes 0.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
This is not nothing but an equilibrium and there's two more--

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:17,000
one is at 0.55 million tons and the other is at 1.45 million tons.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
The first one is obvious, but now let's look into where these two other equilibria come from.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
If we reach an equilibrium, the amount has to become constant.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
The rate of change becomes zero, which means that the gain

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
per time has to balance the loss per time.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
The loss per time is constant but the gain per time depends on the current amount.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Let's build this type of diagram to show how the gain depends on the amount.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
If you look closely, you see that this has to be a parabola.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
If the amount of fish is zero, we are multiplying by zero here and the gain will be zero.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
That's no surprise. If there is no fish, there is no growth. We know this point.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
When the amount of fish is equal to the maximum carrying capacity, this factor becomes zero.

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
The product is zero again so we know this point.

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:18,000
As a parabola is symmetric, the maximum has to occur in the middle between the zeros.

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:25,000
This maximum sits at an amount of 1 * 10⁶ tons.

17
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
We can plug this value 1 million tons into this expression

18
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:37,000
and get that the gain here is 2.5 * 10⁵ tons per year, which is a little more than the loss,

19
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
which is 2 * 10⁵ tons per year.

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
We have one equilibrium here and one equilibrium there.

21
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:55,000
At both of these points the gain and the loss, the gain and the loss balance each other.

22
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
If you want to, you can solve this quadratic equation

23
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,000
to find that this equilibrium sits at 0.55 * 1 million tons

24
00:02:04,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and this equilibrium sits at 1.45 * 1 million tons.
