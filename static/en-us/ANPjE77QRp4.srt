00:01:06,175 --> 00:01:12,910
>> Okay. And it points out a choice that you have as a specifier here.

2
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:20,300
We could if we were given a a vector of length three and a vector of length 10,

3
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:25,580
say no they, they don't have the same elements and remember by same elements as,

4
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:29,270
we're talking about the same number of occurrence as. Or,

5
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:34,290
we could treat it as a pre-condition, okay? And say that the lengths must be

6
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:38,810
the same in order for us even to apply same elements as, as a function, and

7
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:42,030
that's the choice that we're going to, we're going to make here. Okay, so

8
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:45,010
remember that the vertical line is used for cardinality or

9
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:50,420
length. And the cardinality of x must be equal to the cardinality of y.

10
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:54,330
Now we're talking here about first order logic. We're not talking about

11
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:58,140
a programming language. So equals means equal. It doesn't mean a sign to or

12
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:01,470
anything else. We don't have to worry about anything like the C or

13
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:07,390
Java where we'd have to use two equals, symbols in order to designate equality.

14
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:10,180
So we're just going to say that the length of x equals the length of y,

15
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:14,630
and that's the precondition for, same elements as. Now, going back to

16
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:21,950
when we first asked the question to state in, in English, what it means

17
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:26,880
for the output to be the assorted version of the input, we said things like each

18
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:30,670
element in x must be found in y, each element of y must be found in x, and

19
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:34,400
the number of occurrences the elements in x must be the same as the number of

20
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:40,220
occurrences the elements in y. And we could take that and we could

21
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:44,740
go through the stage of writing out each of those parts in first order logic.
