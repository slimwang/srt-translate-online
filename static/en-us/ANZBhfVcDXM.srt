00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,140
Alright, here's what I did. I filled up the car with 20 gallons. And I drove

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:07,888
100 miles. I printed out the amount a gas in the tank. An then I need to print

3
00:00:07,888 --> 00:00:11,673
out the expected value. Well that's the hard part. Let's see what I expect. I

4
00:00:11,673 --> 00:00:17,730
drove 100 miles. I assume, 50 miles per gallon. That means, two gallons

5
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:24,012
consumed. I started out with 20 gallons, I consumed two so I should have 18

6
00:00:24,012 --> 00:00:31,890
gallons left over, let's put that in and try it out. Here is the result, the

7
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:35,670
actual gas left is 18 gallons and the expected value is 18 so, everything was

8
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:37,710
working great.
