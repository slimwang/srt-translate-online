1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:01,710
Try to apply what you've learned so

2
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:04,779
far to complete this iteration
of the genetic algorithm.

3
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:09,109
First, fill in the fitness value or the
number of non-attacking pairs of queens

4
00:00:09,109 --> 00:00:11,599
for each board state in
the initial population.

5
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:13,779
Then, choose parents according
to their fitness score and

6
00:00:13,779 --> 00:00:15,309
fill them in this column.

7
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:18,140
Order them by fitness value
where the best is on top.

8
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:20,500
Now crossover the top
two selected parents,

9
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,660
making sure they
are different individuals.

10
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:25,440
Then produce two children
using a four-four split.

11
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,140
Finally, fill in the fitness values for
the resulting children.
