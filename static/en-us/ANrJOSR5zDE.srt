Our solutions for x are 5 plus or minus 2 times root 3. Great thinking if you

2
00:00:06,412 --> 00:00:10,720
got this. Now, I know we haven't done that much practice yet. So that's totally

3
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:14,724
okay if you struggled. I'm sure you'll get the next one. We begin to solve this

4
00:00:14,724 --> 00:00:18,820
problem by taking the square root of both sides. Since we have a quantity

5
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:23,024
squared, with a variable inside it, on the left. Taking this square root undoes

6
00:00:23,024 --> 00:00:26,888
the square power. Leaving us with x minus 5 on the left hand side of our

7
00:00:26,888 --> 00:00:30,778
equation. On the right hand side, we'll just have plus or minus the square root

8
00:00:30,778 --> 00:00:36,984
of 12. Next, we'll add 5 to both sides to isolate our x variable. So, we'll

9
00:00:36,984 --> 00:00:41,678
have x is equal to 5 plus or minus the square root of 12. And again, here this

10
00:00:41,678 --> 00:00:46,135
5 is not like terms with the radical 12. So we can't add them together, we just

11
00:00:46,135 --> 00:00:50,846
list them as a sum and difference. We need to simplify the root of 12, so we

12
00:00:50,846 --> 00:00:55,153
break it into 4 times 3, this gives us our final answer of 5 plus or minus 2

13
00:00:55,153 --> 00:00:57,734
root 3.
