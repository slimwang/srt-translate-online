1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:05,000
So pandis has many
very powerful features,

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,610
among those features are the ability to

3
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:14,800
do many operations that you may
be familiar with from databases.

4
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:19,680
In particular, one that we're
going to leverage here is adjoin.

5
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:25,264
So we're going to join this data
from SPY and our empty data frame.

6
00:00:25,264 --> 00:00:29,299
And we're going to do a special
join that says, look,

7
00:00:29,299 --> 00:00:34,725
we're only interested in dates that
are present both in SPY and df1.

8
00:00:34,725 --> 00:00:39,160
And what happens is,
we end up with this data.

9
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:43,450
According to its date and
this position in our target dataframe,

10
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:46,890
and, of course,
the other two rows as well.

11
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:53,150
But note, because of the join,
these two days were missing from SPY and

12
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:57,539
the result of the join is they
are eliminated from our dataframe.

13
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:00,980
They're eliminated
because it's the weekend.

14
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:05,509
There was no trading, because we know
that because SPY is our reference.

15
00:01:05,509 --> 00:01:11,198
All right, so here's our original data
frame now after we've loaded an SPY.

16
00:01:11,198 --> 00:01:16,970
And those weekend days that were
here are gone because of that join.

17
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:22,030
Now we can add more
columns from other stocks,

18
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:26,480
here's one for instance, IBM,
by performing additional joins.

19
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,310
So after this join with data frame IBM,
bump,

20
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:36,540
we've got this new data over
here in our empty data frame.

21
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:40,830
We can repeat this process for each
additional symbol that we want to add.

22
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:44,880
So we'll add Google and GLD.

23
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,130
And again, Dave will show you
the syntax for doing that and

24
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:49,850
pandis in just a few moments.
