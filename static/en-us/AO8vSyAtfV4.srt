00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,030
Now that you've loaded
the student data into Python,

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:06,320
I want you to think about what questions
you could answer with this data.

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:09,380
For example, you could figure out how
long it usually takes students before

4
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:11,360
the submit their projects.

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,780
Or you could look at some different
characteristic of students and

6
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:17,090
try to find differences between
students who pass their projects and

7
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:18,660
students who don't.

8
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:22,080
This is a great time to let
your curiosity run wild.

9
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,990
There's a lot of really interesting
stuff you can figure out with this data

10
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:26,280
and you're about to do it.

11
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:27,600
So, start brain storming.

12
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,670
Take another look at what
data is available and

13
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:33,870
try to think of at least 5 questions
you could answer using it.

14
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:36,070
Share your thoughts with your
classmates on the forums.
