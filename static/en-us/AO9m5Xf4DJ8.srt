00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
All right, what we're going to talk about next is the idea that there're are some problems

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
such that if we could solve them fast, we could solve all problems in NP fast,

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
and we call those problems the NP hard problems.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I don't find that to be a particularly useful name, but it's the name that everybody uses

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
so I will use it as well.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
How can we say that some problem X is at least this hard,

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
at least within polynomial factors, as some other problem Y.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
To phrase it anyway--if X is at least as hard as Y, what can we do with an algorithm for X.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Well, we could use it to solve Y.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
In fact, that's maybe what we mean by saying that X is at least as hard as Y

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
that we can use as solution to X to solve Y.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
The basic picture that you can have in your head is something like this,

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Imagine that we want to solve an instance of problem Y, we can imagine building a solution

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
algorithm, an algorithm for Y, that what happen inside is instance of problem Y gets transformed

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
in some way between instance of problem X or may be multiple instances of problem X.

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Then we run an algorithm for solving problem X to get solutions to those and maybe that generates

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
more instances but after polynomial number of calls to this algorithm, what comes spitting out

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
is a solution to the original instance of problem Y.

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:23,000
We basically have solved problem Y by bringing to to bear our solution to problem X,

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:31,000
or to say it another way, problem Y has been reduced to problem X.
