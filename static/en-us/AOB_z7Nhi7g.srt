00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,640
Okay, so the design of our class Movie, is

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:04,410
here on the top right, [SOUND] and I'm going

3
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:07,410
to begin, with a blank programming file. I have

4
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:10,570
named it, media.py, and it is saved inside a

5
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:14,165
folder called, movies. Now, to write a new class,

6
00:00:14,165 --> 00:00:17,370
[SOUND] I will used the Python keyword, class. And

7
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:22,000
I will name it, Movie. You've probably notices, that

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,380
the first letter of the name of the class M,

9
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:28,900
is in uppercase. Now, this letter doesn't necessarily

10
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:31,710
need to be in uppercase, but, the Google style

11
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:34,260
guide for Python suggests that it should be.

12
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:36,500
Now, what is this thing called the Google style

13
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,960
guide for Python you ask, Well, let's Google

14
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,580
it. The first link here looks good to me.

15
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:48,370
Now, this Style Guide, provides conventions to programmers all

16
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:51,530
over the world. On how to write their programs.

17
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:54,360
If you scroll down a bit You will notice

18
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:57,120
that there are conventions on everything, from how to name

19
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,110
things, to how to write comments. By the way,

20
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:02,640
the link to this webpage, is available in the instructor

21
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,660
notes. I recommend that you read through this document.

22
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:09,150
If you click on this link called Naming, you will

23
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:12,980
notice that, when defining a class name, Google recommends that

24
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:16,700
the first letter of that name be in capital letters.

25
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:20,060
Okay, back to the code. Now, thus far, we've

26
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:24,040
encountered one new key word, called class. In fact, we

27
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,360
are going to come across several new words in this

28
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:29,220
lesson, and I want to list them all, in one

29
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:32,710
place for handy reference. The word class, is the first

30
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:35,470
one on that list. We will review, all the words

31
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:38,270
on this list before we end this lesson. So, you

32
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:41,550
may have noticed that our class, is empty thus far.

33
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:43,500
Now, to figure out what I want to do next

34
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,150
with it, I will go back to my design. So,

35
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:49,470
here I am, back with my class design. Now, I

36
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:52,790
know that eventually, I would want to create multiple instances

37
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:56,190
of the class movie. Instances like, Toy Story and

38
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:59,760
Avatar. I also know that I have previously created instances

39
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:03,930
of class Turtle. Instances like Brad, and to do that,

40
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:06,265
I had to write a piece of code that read,

41
00:02:06,265 --> 00:02:09,960
turtle.Turtle, so I guess I will have to write a piece of code like

42
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:15,270
this, to create Toy Story, an instance of class Movie. Let's do that next.
