1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:05,370
To continue, we are in fact interested in four different quantities.

2
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:07,430
One is a true positive.

3
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:09,030
A true negative.

4
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:10,780
A false positive.

5
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:12,480
And a false negative.

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:18,440
What this picture shows us here is actually what is called the confusion matrix.

7
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:23,210
This is called a confusion matrix because it makes it easy to tell whether

8
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:27,130
the classifier is confusing the positives with the negatives.

9
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:33,640
So here, the actual cases of negatives are on the top, or the x direction,

10
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:38,850
and the predicted cases by the classifiers are in this side here.

11
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:45,550
So true positive is an actual positive that has been predicted to be positive.

12
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:50,670
Similarly, a true negative is an actual negative that has

13
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:53,100
been predicted to be negative.

14
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:57,250
Now, you can also have false positives.

15
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:00,650
These are also known as type I errors.

16
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:07,770
In this case, an actual negative is classified or predicted to be positive.

17
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:12,390
Similarly, you can also have false negatives.

18
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:15,750
They're also known as type II errors.

19
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:21,250
In this case, an actual positive is predicted to be negative.

20
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:24,780
In the next video, we are going to define a few

21
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:29,750
performance metrics based on these concepts we just defined.
