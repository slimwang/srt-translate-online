1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:05,087
The center is at negative 1 comma negative 2 and the radius is 3, the square

2
00:00:05,087 --> 00:00:10,726
root of 9. Great work if you got these two right. Now, if you made a mistake,

3
00:00:10,726 --> 00:00:14,100
that's okay. Just keep in mind that the center is always the opposite sign of

4
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:19,540
what's in the parenthesis here and here. We have positive 1 here and positive 2

5
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:26,933
here. So the h must be negative 1 and the k must be negative 2.
