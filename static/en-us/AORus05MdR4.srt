1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,978
For the first one, we plug in negative 2 for x. The quantity negative 2 squared

2
00:00:04,978 --> 00:00:10,114
is 4. And 5 times negative 2 is negative 10. These numbers sum to negative 6.

3
00:00:10,114 --> 00:00:14,158
And these numbers sum to 0. For this check, we have the quantity negative 3

4
00:00:14,158 --> 00:00:20,624
squared. Plus 5 times negative 3 plus 6 equals 0. The square of negative 3 is 9,

5
00:00:20,624 --> 00:00:26,196
and 5 times negative 3 is negative 15. These numbers sum to negative 6 and these

6
00:00:26,196 --> 00:00:27,376
numbers sum to 0.
