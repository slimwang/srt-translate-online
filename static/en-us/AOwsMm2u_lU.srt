1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So now let's really prove the power of our finite state machine interpreter

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
by showing that we could figure out any finite state machine.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
You should submit, via the interpreter, values for edges and accepting those 2 key variables

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
that encode the regular expression "q*"--

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
so the empty string, "q", "qq".

6
00:00:22,000 --> 99:59:59,999
For convenience, name your start state 1.
