00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:05,620
The lower estimate, which comes from our red graph here, is 5.1 billion people.

2
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:13,180
And our upper estimate, which comes from this blue curve, is 36.1 billion.

3
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:17,110
There's such a huge difference between these two estimates, that I think if we

4
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:21,911
think about all the different factors that affect world population, we can see

5
00:00:21,911 --> 00:00:25,370
why. There's so many things that influence the number of people in the world.

6
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:30,040
For example, we've seen an increase in world population due to decrease in

7
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:34,220
death rates, as people live longer because of better health care. In the

8
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:38,330
future, we have no idea what's going to happen. Maybe a pandemic will wipe

9
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:42,355
everyone out. Or maybe we'll have food shortages due to climate change. Or

10
00:00:42,355 --> 00:00:47,330
perhaps advances in science mean an abundance of food and longer average

11
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:52,468
lifetimes. Who knows? If you're interested in this, and I personally think it's

12
00:00:52,468 --> 00:00:56,520
a pretty fascinating topic, go to the forums and talk about this with your

13
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,710
fellow classmates. I think what this illustrates is that even though we can

14
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:04,709
make models, making a long term predictions, especially based on just

15
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:09,940
equations, can be pretty difficult. It's still, however, worth discussing.
