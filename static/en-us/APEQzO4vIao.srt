00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:03,195
Here's a chance for you to see what you know. What do you think is the vertex

2
00:00:03,195 --> 00:00:07,164
for each of these parabola's and which direction do you think each parabola

3
00:00:07,164 --> 00:00:12,679
opens? Enter the vertex here for this parabola and then choose whether it opens

4
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:17,865
to the left to the right upward or downward. And if you have trouble with

5
00:00:17,865 --> 00:00:22,906
these, I highly recommend playing around in decimals. Try to create your own

6
00:00:22,906 --> 00:00:26,776
graphs and look for patterns. Maybe just start with some y equals graphs, and

7
00:00:26,776 --> 00:00:31,668
then play around with some x equals graphs, and see how they change. That

8
00:00:31,668 --> 00:00:34,440
should help you out if you get stuck. Good luck.
