1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:02,690
I'm here with Jarrod Parkes who's
a course developer at Udacity.

2
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:04,220
And Jarrod thanks so much for
talking to us today.

3
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:05,380
>> Thanks for having me.

4
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:08,420
>> We're going to talk a little bit
about student motivation in classes and

5
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:09,770
how technology can help.

6
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:12,280
So Jarrod I'll start by asking,
what kind of shaped do

7
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:15,590
you as far as motivation is concerned,
back when you were a learner in school?

8
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:19,010
So what were your experiences with
the role of motivation in education?

9
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:22,320
>> Right,
I had kind of a lucky situation.

10
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,620
I'm a twin, so for me a lot of my
motivation I think was always driven out

11
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:30,560
of that natural sense of competition
that I had with my twin brother, James.

12
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,460
But from more of what
the school was providing for

13
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:38,320
me, I think I was always
motivated by doing well.

14
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,710
It was always stressed that you want to
do well, so I tried to get to the top.

15
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:47,420
And for me that seemed to be enough,
at least to get me through grade school.

16
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:49,920
And then as learning got deeper and

17
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,290
the topics got more difficult,
I had to kind of dig.

18
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:57,760
I think more inside of
myself to find the time and

19
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:01,330
give the commitment to the topics
that you had to be successful.

20
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:03,680
>> I think you're echoing something
really important, also is that,

21
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,410
and there's actually
research that backs this up.

22
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:06,926
Is that early in education,

23
00:01:06,926 --> 00:01:10,788
students might adopt a real focus on
some of those external motivators.

24
00:01:10,788 --> 00:01:13,299
And it sounds like you're
commenting on that,

25
00:01:13,299 --> 00:01:15,630
early on it was about
doing well overall.

26
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:19,750
What was your definition of doing
well back then, you remember?

27
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:22,910
>> It was very much get As in class.

28
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:27,680
My parents made it known to my brother
and I at a very early age that we had to

29
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,120
do well in order to be
able to get to college.

30
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:34,594
So that for me was a goal from fifth
grade and on, something like that.

31
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:38,180
And so I think there's research that
confirms that early on many students

32
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:40,420
adopt this kind of external
mindset about learning.

33
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:43,920
Which isn't inherently a bad thing
because there are powerful external

34
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,920
motivators out in the world.

35
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,035
And there are very important
reasons to learn well and do well.

36
00:01:49,035 --> 00:01:52,150
But what about the tension between,

37
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:54,810
I think you mentioned this as
far as later in your career.

38
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:58,230
The tension between being motivated
by something out in the world and

39
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:01,560
being motivated by something
more internal to yourself?

40
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:05,660
>> I think that started to arise when
I got to points where I started to

41
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:09,610
question were the grades that I was
getting in class and receiving.

42
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:14,250
Truly reflective of how
I felt I was learning or

43
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:18,240
how I felt, just self worth and value.

44
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,680
I feel like I'm trying hard, but I dont
know if I want to commit the amount of

45
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,598
time it takes to get what is considered
an A, a high mark in this class.

46
00:02:25,598 --> 00:02:29,760
Whereas, I feel I'm still
learning effectively and

47
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,500
this is just added pressure.

48
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:35,190
And so, I think intrinsically,
in and of myself,

49
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:37,130
I started to think about
why am I learning?

50
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:38,350
Why do I want to learn?

51
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:40,150
I'm actually having fun doing this.

52
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:46,189
And then I started to go after and learn
and look at topics that excited me.

53
00:02:46,189 --> 00:02:49,730
Not just because somebody told me this
is what I should be interested, but

54
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:51,480
because I chose them for myself.

55
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,350
>> Yeah, it's interesting because
you're commenting on that.

56
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:56,050
I think a lot of students experience
that same thing where they find

57
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:59,650
something that they're very passionate
about and they end up pursuing it.

58
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:02,100
But it seems like it would be really
great if we could actually bring that

59
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:02,870
into the classroom.

60
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:05,600
At least in my opinion, there's nothing
inherent about the classroom that means

61
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,682
students can't be internally motivated
by something a teacher gives them.

62
00:03:08,682 --> 00:03:12,120
It's that I got it from
a teacher doesn't make it, so

63
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,690
that I'm never going to be
personally interested in it.

64
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:17,780
It's just something happens in school
that often prevents that from arising.

65
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:21,190
So do you have any thoughts on,
either from your personal experience or

66
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:24,240
what we as educational
technology analysts can do.

67
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:27,690
To try and
create that more personal motivation,

68
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:30,630
even when we're designing
well-formed interventions.

69
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:35,072
>> I think you have to keep adaptivity
at one of the highest priorities.

70
00:03:35,072 --> 00:03:38,200
I think the classroom in a lot
of ways is for a lot of people,

71
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,560
can be very rigid.

72
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:43,090
Because of that, when they find
something interesting, maybe they feel

73
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:45,860
silenced or they don't feel like
they can go and explore this topic.

74
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:49,504
And it's going to help them getting
hired or finishing school and

75
00:03:49,504 --> 00:03:50,968
getting hired whatever.

76
00:03:50,968 --> 00:03:54,345
And so being able to identify
when students have something that

77
00:03:54,345 --> 00:03:58,140
they are very interested in and
then allowing them to pursue that.

78
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:02,090
And still somehow maybe tie it back to
whatever the universal message of this

79
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:03,637
class or the learning points.

80
00:04:03,637 --> 00:04:06,710
That's something that I think
would be very beneficial.

81
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:09,700
>> So you're saying it would be good to
have a class where students can kind of

82
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,220
be given a bunch of topics to explore.

83
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:14,505
And choose which topics they'd
like to explore and when and how.

84
00:04:14,505 --> 00:04:15,350
>> Mm-hm.
Yeah.

85
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:19,040
As long as they're,
I think, dense enough and

86
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,480
they're ones that actually would
merit a good amount of work.

87
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,660
And you can make those
calls as an educator.

88
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,830
Then yeah,
that would be a great type of class.

89
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:28,710
Those were the kind
of classes I enjoyed.

90
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:30,470
>> So, Jerry would enjoy this class, so.

91
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:31,450
You don't know this, but

92
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:34,240
that's exactly the motivating principle
behind the design of this class.

93
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,580
We've given the students a library of
information, such as this interview.

94
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:40,680
To explore and kind of find what's the
most interesting and pertinent to them.

95
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,240
>> Oh, great, yeah.

96
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,450
>> So, but what about the role
of technology in all this?

97
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:45,120
It seems like,
everything we've talked about so

98
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,550
far is kind of general to education,
the classroom as a whole.

99
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:51,519
What can technology do
specifically to help us with this?

100
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:57,860
Facilitating students' personal
motivation in these topics.

101
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:02,660
>> One thing I think about is how
technology nowadays has access to so

102
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:03,330
much information.

103
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:05,230
And because they have
access to that information,

104
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:09,950
when students are being, we're
collecting responses from students and

105
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:13,360
we're analyzing their feedback,
their answers or whatever.

106
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,000
We can look at those things and
make choices about or

107
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,790
give them recommendations about
things they may become interested in.

108
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:24,150
So the technology is what would allow us
to adapt where it may be more difficult

109
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:25,830
in a traditional classroom for

110
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:29,280
professor to give that individual
attention to each student.

111
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,850
I think that's something that
technology could definitely do.

112
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:34,580
>> I agree, I think that
technology also has the benefit of

113
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:37,420
making a lot of these resources
always very easily available.

114
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:40,250
That in the past, it was a case of
if I wanted to start your class

115
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:41,560
where students can
choose their own topic.

116
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:44,480
I could say, today in class,
you're going to go to the library,

117
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:47,630
find an encyclopedia, find a book and
research it yourself.

118
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:50,280
But that means that students have
15 minutes to one day to do all

119
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,800
the research and
find their own direction,

120
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,220
which is isn't really enough time.

121
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:56,910
But now we can say you have all
semester, you have the internet.

122
00:05:56,910 --> 00:05:58,650
You have as much time as
you're willing to invest.

123
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:01,590
You can go in any direction you want
without ever leaving your office.

124
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:02,840
>> Right.
>> So I think that's really powerful in

125
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,940
making that available.

126
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:06,690
Do you have any thoughts on the role
of artificial intelligence in this?

127
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:09,860
I don't know if you have any
experience with how AI can kind of help

128
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:11,860
personalize this and if you don't,
I'll comment on it, but.

129
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:13,210
>> I don't have any deep experience, but

130
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:16,760
I think AI systems can be
the ones responsible for

131
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:20,450
finding those things that and making
those recommendations for students.

132
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:22,060
So I think that might
be a good application.

133
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:23,740
>> Yeah, a friend of mine is
actually working on a project

134
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:27,510
kind of like that that's a digital
assistant for research like this.

135
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:30,970
That if you're working for something,
it can actually connect you out to

136
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:33,470
ongoing research in the field or
similar ideas.

137
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:36,290
Or just help you kind of build
a broader knowledge of what

138
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:39,502
you're researching without having
to find everything on your own.

139
00:06:39,502 --> 00:06:40,212
>> Mm-hm.
>> So and

140
00:06:40,212 --> 00:06:43,660
do you have any final thoughts for
our students who might be worried about

141
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:47,940
facilitating motivation in the
technological devices that they build?

142
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:48,660
>> Yes.

143
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:51,840
My recommendation is for
any roadblocks that you ever

144
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:56,740
run into from a motivation
standpoint is to have friends.

145
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:58,160
Have people around you that support you.

146
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,840
I think every time that I reached
one of those blocks in my life,

147
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,460
that's what helped pull me through,
more than anything else.

148
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:05,290
>> That actually speaks,

149
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:07,510
I think to something we've commented
elsewhere in this class on as well.

150
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,670
Is that when we're building technology,

151
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:12,600
we need to be able to facilitate
interaction among students.

152
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:17,730
It's very tempting to treat my system as
the student and whatever I'm building.

153
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:20,790
But in reality, it should be the
student, their friends, their teachers,

154
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:22,680
their mentors, things like that.

155
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:25,900
And my device which is facilitating
interaction amongst all of them.

156
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:29,880
>> It's almost the intrinsic
motivation that grows out of us,

157
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:32,310
as well as the extrinsic motivators.

158
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:35,390
I think it's driven by people,
it's a people-based thing.

159
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:36,430
>> Absolutely.

160
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:38,750
Okay, well thank you so
much for talking to us today.

161
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:39,390
>> Absolutely.

162
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:40,170
>> And thanks all for watching.
