Hey there,
Jessica again with Project 3.5.

2
00:00:03,888 --> 00:00:07,096
So you've just finished
IOS Networking With Swift and

3
00:00:07,096 --> 00:00:09,056
you've built the On the Map app.

4
00:00:09,056 --> 00:00:13,596
So you've probably got web services and
APIs all running through your brain.

5
00:00:13,596 --> 00:00:17,196
So we're going to take advantage
of that at this point and

6
00:00:17,196 --> 00:00:21,472
help you choose relevent APIs and
libraries for your own app ideas.

7
00:00:21,472 --> 00:00:21,972
Good luck.
