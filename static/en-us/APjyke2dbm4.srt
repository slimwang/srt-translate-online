00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,664
The one I think is best is option A. One thing to think about when you look at

2
00:00:04,664 --> 00:00:08,060
the module[UNKNOWN] things and try to decide which is best. If it's a good

3
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:10,834
module, we should be able to give it a name. It should be conceptually

4
00:00:10,834 --> 00:00:14,988
corresponding to something we're thinking about, and if you look at the modules

5
00:00:14,988 --> 00:00:18,646
here, the way A is defined, all of the things in A are thing that you can do

6
00:00:18,646 --> 00:00:22,450
before a query comes in. These are things that you're doing based on just

7
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:26,286
building the corpus of the web. All of the things in the second module here are

8
00:00:26,286 --> 00:00:29,798
thing that you can do only after a query comes in. And it makes a lot of sense

9
00:00:29,798 --> 00:00:33,744
to divide those two phases. In version B, I've grouped lookup in the first

10
00:00:33,744 --> 00:00:38,010
module, and lookup is used by both lucky search and ordered search. It's not

11
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:42,090
used by any of the functions that build the corpus. So it doesn't really make a

12
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:45,656
lot of sense to have it here. If we have it here, the interface between these

13
00:00:45,656 --> 00:00:49,496
two modules is going to be much more complex than it would be if we put lookup

14
00:00:49,496 --> 00:00:53,604
in the second module. So that's why I prefer option A to either of the other

15
00:00:53,604 --> 00:00:57,026
two. Option C doesn't really make much sense to have lookup be all its own

16
00:00:57,026 --> 00:01:01,250
module. There are certainly other options, and I would encourage you to discuss

17
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:05,019
them in the forum, if you have another suggestion of how to modularize this.
