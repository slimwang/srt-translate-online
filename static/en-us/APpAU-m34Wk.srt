00:00:00,073 --> 00:00:02,952
What are some of the most interesting projects that you've seen done with

2
00:00:02,952 --> 00:00:06,591
CUDA from the beginnings, all the way until today?

3
00:00:06,591 --> 00:00:12,231
Yeah, you know, one of the great parts about this job is that I continuously learn about fields of

4
00:00:12,231 --> 00:00:14,784
science and computing that I had no idea existed.

5
00:00:14,784 --> 00:00:19,088
Whether it be, you know, defense, or oil and gas, or finance.

6
00:00:19,088 --> 00:00:24,503
One of my more favorite projects is the work being done in CT scanners.

7
00:00:24,503 --> 00:00:28,429
A CT scanner is actually--I don't know if you know how this works

8
00:00:28,429 --> 00:00:30,930
but it's a series of X-rays they take at different angles,

9
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:35,069
and you're taking 2D X-rays and the machine actually composits

10
00:00:35,069 --> 00:00:38,933
the X-rays together and were actually, recreates the 3D model of what's going on

11
00:00:38,933 --> 00:00:42,001
inside your lungs or heart or body or whatever.

12
00:00:42,001 --> 00:00:48,128
While it's really cool to get that 3D vision, the bad part actually is the radiation is kind of harmful.

13
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:52,596
In fact, you want to kind of use the least amount of radiation, but the more x rays

14
00:00:52,596 --> 00:00:55,009
you get the better the view of the problem you have.

15
00:00:55,009 --> 00:01:00,448
So what this one group is doing is actually, they're using GPUs and they've been able to reduce the

16
00:01:00,448 --> 00:01:08,874
amount of x-ray radiation by something like 20 X, really making it much safe as a procedure.

17
00:01:08,874 --> 00:01:11,765
And applying the power of the GPU to take many more

18
00:01:11,765 --> 00:01:17,331
lower-dosage radiation shots, and combine them together to not only get a

19
00:01:17,331 --> 00:01:21,133
clearer picture with less radiation, but you get it really quickly, in one sitting.

20
00:01:21,133 --> 00:01:25,881
You don't have to home and come back to figure out if you have x, y, z problem or issue.

21
00:01:25,881 --> 00:01:29,700
So it's really cool to see that kind of stuff truly affecting lives.
