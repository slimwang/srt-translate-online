So, I know this seems like a lot of information, and it is. But that's why you

2
00:00:04,545 --> 00:00:08,300
have this PDF. Come back to it whenever you need to, it should really help.

3
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,740
Now, the last section of this lesson that we're going to go over is how you can

4
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:14,650
measure brain activity. I'm going to pass it to Susan to explain it to you.

5
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:19,657
>> Many of the advances in understanding a link between behavior and brain have

6
00:00:19,657 --> 00:00:23,037
occurred in the last 20 years because of better techniques of measuring brain

7
00:00:23,037 --> 00:00:28,348
activity. For example, how do we know that spatial ability is related to the

8
00:00:28,348 --> 00:00:33,748
parietal area? Or that the frontal lobe is responsible for impulse control? How

9
00:00:33,748 --> 00:00:38,380
do we know the hippocampus is associated with learning and memory?

10
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:42,268
Historically, we learned about the brain function through accidents. Such as we

11
00:00:42,268 --> 00:00:46,258
saw with Phineas Gage. Since the 1940s we have been able to measure brain

12
00:00:46,258 --> 00:00:50,387
activity. But it's really been since the 1990s that we've seen better

13
00:00:50,387 --> 00:00:53,726
techniques that allow us to look at precise areas of the brain that are being

14
00:00:53,726 --> 00:00:59,157
activated. This has been such a revolution that some people call it the

15
00:00:59,157 --> 00:01:01,110
neuroscience revolution.
