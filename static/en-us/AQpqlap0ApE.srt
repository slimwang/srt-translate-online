00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,485
>> Remember that if we multiply these two binomials together, we get a general

2
00:00:04,485 --> 00:00:08,885
answer of x squared plus the quantity a plus b times x plus ab. So a plus b, we

3
00:00:08,885 --> 00:00:13,484
can see, is the coefficient of an x to the first term, which in the expression

4
00:00:13,484 --> 00:00:18,467
that we're trying to match is 8. So a plus b equals 8. Now a times b shows up in

5
00:00:18,467 --> 00:00:24,162
the constant term of this expression, which in the expression we're going for is

6
00:00:24,162 --> 00:00:26,068
15. So a times b equals 15.
