1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:04,410
First thing's first, we noticed that both endpoints that we have are filled in.

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:08,354
So I'm going to need to use square brackets for my intervals to show the

3
00:00:08,354 --> 00:00:12,846
inclusion of these points. Now, the point furthest to the left, in other words

4
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:17,097
the smallest x value that we have on this graph, is negative 4. So that's the

5
00:00:17,097 --> 00:00:21,300
lowest value of the domain for which the function has a value. Now, moving as

6
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:26,828
far right as we can along our curve. We come to this point, whose x coordinate

7
00:00:26,828 --> 00:00:31,930
is 6. So our interval goes from negative 4 to 6, including both endpoints. We

8
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:35,770
can check to make sure that our interval is right by testing a point outside of

9
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:39,946
the interval and seeing if the function has a value at that x coordinate. So

10
00:00:39,946 --> 00:00:46,290
let's say, I pick negative 8. That's right here and there is no function drawn

11
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:50,706
right here. I can't tell you what the function would equal. If you asked me what

12
00:00:50,706 --> 00:00:54,427
the value of the function was at negative 8, I could not give you any sort of

13
00:00:54,427 --> 00:00:58,500
reasonable answer. The function is just not defined for the input. In fact it's

14
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:02,603
not defined for any input other than the x values of all the points here.
