00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Here's a little quiz--for each of these pieces of text, which was generated from an n-gram model,

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I want you to try to guess if it was generated from a 1-gram model, a 2-gram, or a 3-gram.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Now, I know you won't necessarily be able to get these all right. Don't worry about that.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
The main point is just for you to get some facility in

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
kind of looking at these models and trying to understand them.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'll give you a hint--three of them were generate by a 1-gram model,

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
three by a 2-gram model, and 3 of them by a 3-gram model,

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
and one of them is an actual excerpt from the corpus of Shakespeare's work,

9
00:00:37,000 --> 99:59:59,999
And so leave that one blank. Don't mark it at all.
