1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,770
The next step is to establish the key
performance indicators, or KPIs,

2
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:06,050
for your business.

3
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:08,510
This is an important step for
you to monitor and

4
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:12,290
understand how your company's
monetization plan is performing.

5
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:19,030
>> In successful companies like it does
it in Google, we love data in numbers.

6
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:22,180
The main reason is that with
regard to monetization,

7
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:26,020
numbers give a clear picture
on where you're standing.

8
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:31,410
Numbers will tell a real, true story,
no excuses or emotion here.

9
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:33,840
All you need to do is listen and act.

10
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,250
If the numbers show that you are not
going up and to the right, but

11
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:41,320
rather decline,
you need to take action fast.

12
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:45,340
However, you can only do it
if you have meaningful KPIs

13
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:47,560
that you are constantly measure.

14
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:51,251
We are not saying that all month will
be positive in terms of monetization.

15
00:00:51,251 --> 00:00:52,007
In fact for

16
00:00:52,007 --> 00:00:56,332
every startup there are many weeks
where you encounter major problems.

17
00:00:56,332 --> 00:00:58,540
What distinguish
successful entrepreneurs,

18
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:02,370
is the way they deal with
those issues and problems.

19
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:06,730
>> So, how can you increase your odds
of building a sustainable business?

20
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:10,310
>> It's a fact that both luck and timing
play a role, but you can improve your

21
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:14,100
odds with good planning, and the agility
to maneuver when things change.
