00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,960
Meta reasoning arguably is one of the most critical process of

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:06,290
the human cognition. In fact, some researchers suggest that,

3
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:09,220
developing meta-cognative skills at an early age in life,

4
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:13,530
may be the best predictor of a student success later in life. Actually,

5
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:18,310
this makes sense. Meta reasoning is not about simply learning new information,

6
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:23,230
it is about learning how to learn. About, learning new reasoning strategies.

7
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:27,560
About integrating new information into memory structures. Meta reasoning is

8
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:32,650
also connected to creativity. In meta reasoning, the agent is monitoring its

9
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:37,040
own reasoning. It is spawning goals. It is trying to achieve them.

10
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:41,300
Sometimes it suspends a goal, sometimes it abandons a goal. These are all part

11
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:45,550
of the creative process. Creativity is not just about creating new products.

12
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:49,600
It is also about creating a processes, that lead to interesting products.
