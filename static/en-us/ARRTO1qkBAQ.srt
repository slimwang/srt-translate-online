00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,890
You may not heard of this
mention many acronyms for

2
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:05,960
Native Apps monetization but
they do exist.

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:08,130
Let's take a look at a few of them.

4
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:10,900
First, we talked about
in-app purchases a bit.

5
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:13,680
You may see this abbreviated as IAP.

6
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:20,680
Important metrics to measure,
especially with IAP are ARPU and ARPPU.

7
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:24,380
ARPU, or average revenue per user,

8
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:28,780
is calculated by dividing your total
revenue by your total number of users.

9
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:35,550
ARPPU, or average revenue per
paying user, is calculated by

10
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:40,390
dividing the total revenue by the total
number of users that made a purchase.

11
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:44,920
The advertising terms we discussed back
in the website monetization section

12
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,410
also apply here.

13
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:49,620
So if you wanted to implement ads in you
native app, we recommend you go back and

14
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:50,490
check out that content.

15
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,910
Now it's once again time to test
your memory skills with another

16
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:56,430
acronym challenge.

17
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:58,390
See if you can recall
the definitions for

18
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:00,980
each of these terms
that we just discussed.

19
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:02,780
Enter their meanings
in the boxes provided.
