1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,760
You see there are many different features we could have selected to build

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:04,570
this model.

3
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:09,150
For example, we could have looked at locations at different times.

4
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:10,902
For example, at 2 a.m.,

5
00:00:10,902 --> 00:00:11,924
or 10 p.m.,

6
00:00:11,924 --> 00:00:15,510
where a person is more like likely to be at their home.

7
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:20,750
We could also have used the (X, Y) co-ordinates instead of the distances.

8
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:24,280
Or we could have used a different distance metric.

9
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:26,960
Let's explore this a little bit further.

10
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:32,243
We could have taken the distance between point one and point two as the absolute

11
00:00:32,243 --> 00:00:37,580
value of the differences between the X and Y co-ordinates of the two points.

12
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:40,040
Think about this distance function for a second.

13
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:43,550
Within cities, only crows and pigeons and

14
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:48,650
mostly birds can move in a straight line from point A to point B.

15
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:54,390
The rest of us, non-flying people, have to cover this particular distance.

16
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:59,480
This distance is called the Manhattan distance or the taxicab distance.

17
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:03,500
What features would you have chosen to solve this problem?

18
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:04,670
Pick a couple,

19
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:09,420
then use some of the techniques you have learned in lesson two to analyze them.

20
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:13,330
For example, you could calculate the information gain both for

21
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:18,830
the Euclidean distance we chose earlier and the Manhattan distance denoted here.

22
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:21,360
Check the box when you have done this.

23
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,190
This quiz is not graded.
