The 1-D distributed breadth first search
scheme has a communication cost that

2
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:06,580
scales linearly in
the number of processes.

3
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:08,230
Here is my question.

4
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:12,380
Suppose you switch from a 1-D
scheme to a 2-D scheme.

5
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:16,790
How would you expect this linear
scaling to change in the 2-D case?

6
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:18,973
Write and
explain your answer in this box.
