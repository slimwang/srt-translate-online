1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:06,329
This expression is equal to log base b of 6. Great work if you found this

2
00:00:06,329 --> 00:00:11,360
logarithm. Now again, I think it's easiest to think about having two logarithms

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:16,927
of base b of 8, and three logarithms of base b of 4. We know that to combine

4
00:00:16,927 --> 00:00:20,372
these three logarithms, or to add them together, we'll need to multiply these

5
00:00:20,372 --> 00:00:26,540
numbers together. So, we can express the addition of these three logarithms as

6
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:32,473
the logarithm of base b of 6 times 8 times 8. Then we'll have the subtraction

7
00:00:32,473 --> 00:00:37,585
of log base b of 4, three times. When we subtract a logarithm, we really divide

8
00:00:37,585 --> 00:00:42,452
this number into this number. Keep in mind this is only true if the logarithms

9
00:00:42,452 --> 00:00:47,870
have the same base. So when I combine this logarithm with this logarithm, we'll

10
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:52,750
really just divide 6 times 8 times 8, by 4, and we'll take the log of base b of

11
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:59,733
that expression. These other two logarithms are still on the end. I notice that

12
00:00:59,733 --> 00:01:03,903
I'm going to have to repeat this process. So, if I take this logarithm with

13
00:01:03,903 --> 00:01:08,181
base b and subtract this logarithm with base b, I'm going to divide by another

14
00:01:08,181 --> 00:01:13,875
4. So, we divide by another 4, and then I still have one more logarithm on the

15
00:01:13,875 --> 00:01:19,378
end. I need to subtract this logarithm of base b of 4 from this logarithm of

16
00:01:19,378 --> 00:01:27,307
base b of this expression. So, I'm simply dividing by another 4. This gives me

17
00:01:27,307 --> 00:01:32,540
a logarithm with one number. Now, I just need to simplify. I know 8 times 8

18
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:40,105
equals 64; and 4 times 4 times 4 also equals 64. So, these factors simplify to

19
00:01:40,105 --> 00:01:44,560
1, which leaves me with log base b of 6. Our final answer.
