00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Now, here I show some data that I've gathered from sites that deal with spelling correction,

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and these are all examples of the correct spelling followed by misspelled words

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and maybe multiple of them.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,000
And from that we want to calculate the probability of a word given the correction.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:29,000
So for example, we would like to know what's the probability of P-L-U-S-E

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
being the word that's spelled when the correct word was "pulse."

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
And we do have examples of that here. We have a single example.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
But it's clear that we're just not going to have enough to cover all

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
the possible words we want to deal with and all the possible misspellings for those words.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
With only tens of thousands of examples,

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
there are so many words in English that we're not going to have them all.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Instead of trying to deal with word-to-word spelling errors,

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
let's deal with letter-to-letter errors.

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
And so let's not say that this is "pulse" misspelled as "pluse,"

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
but rather let's say this is U-L misspelled as L-U.

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Here, let's say this is the E in "elegant" misspelled as an A.

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
And we'll look at these types of edits from one word to another,

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:32,000
a transposition between 2, a replacement, or an insertion or deletion of a single letter.

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
We'll build up probability tables for those rather than probability tables for all the words.

20
00:01:37,000 --> 99:59:59,999
That's much easier to do with a smaller amount of data.
