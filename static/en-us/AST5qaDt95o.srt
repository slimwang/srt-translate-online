1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:02,360
I'll start at the top.

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:03,370
Change the title?

3
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:05,590
Mm, no, I wouldn't do that.

4
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:09,180
Right now the title is Create an Event,
and that seems pretty straightforward,

5
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:10,820
so I'll leave it alone.

6
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:14,570
Next up, consolidate inputs, definitely.

7
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:18,850
Look, right now you have to select
the time, the day, the month, and

8
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:20,452
the year separately.

9
00:00:20,452 --> 00:00:22,830
And These are all really part
of the same question so,

10
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:25,850
I think it make sense that
they're the same input.

11
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:27,930
Seems like an improvement to me.

12
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:31,790
Now, what about better
validation messages, definitely.

13
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:35,400
Here, let me show you what happens when
you try to create an event without

14
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,140
valid inputs.

15
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:41,490
I will click this button,
then I have to scroll down.

16
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:43,850
And then I get a list of errors.

17
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:47,840
This could be a lot more helpful
in a lot of different ways so

18
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,940
that should definitely be improved.

19
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:53,150
And lastly,
what about adding more questions?

20
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:56,210
Well, you really want to minimize
the number of questions you

21
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:58,870
ask if you want to keep the form simple.

22
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:03,860
So no, I don't think that adding
more is going to improve this form.

23
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:05,920
Okay, not too bad.

24
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,950
In the next video you'll see
an interview with Luke Wroblewski

25
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:11,410
who is a product director at Google.

26
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:13,412
Luke is an expert on forms.

27
00:01:13,412 --> 00:01:17,120
You're going to here him talk about
how he approaches forms as a whole.

28
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:17,620
Let's watch.
