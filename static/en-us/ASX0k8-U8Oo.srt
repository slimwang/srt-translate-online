1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,514
So if for example, Grant earns $27,000 total, what is the total amount he's

2
00:00:04,514 --> 00:00:10,172
going to have to pay in taxes? First figure out how much of his income falls

3
00:00:10,172 --> 00:00:14,130
within each of these tax brackets. Then, I have listed the tax rate for each of

4
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:17,986
those brackets over in this left-hand column. So to figure out how much he's

5
00:00:17,986 --> 00:00:22,672
going to pay in taxes from each of those brackets. Just multiply the income

6
00:00:22,672 --> 00:00:27,366
that falls within that bracket by the rate of that bracket. Once you have all

7
00:00:27,366 --> 00:00:30,660
of the taxes from each of the brackets, add all of them up to come up with the

8
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:35,408
total amount of tax Grant's going to have to pay. I'll write in a dollar sign

9
00:00:35,408 --> 00:00:37,787
for you right here, and you don't have to write them in any of these slots at

10
00:00:37,787 --> 00:00:40,669
all. Just write the numbers.
