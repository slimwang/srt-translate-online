00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Here's my answer. We've actually done this before, basically.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
For L in links, if l.id=link id, return l.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Let's give this a test real quick.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
So print link by id (24).

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
We give this a run.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
And we see our link has returned.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
And if I give it a link ID that doesn't exist--

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
let's try 50--and run this--

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
we get none, which is what we expected--nothing.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Okay, let's make this a little bit more complicated.
