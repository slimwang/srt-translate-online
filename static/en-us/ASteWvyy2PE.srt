1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,330
Now that you know about ordinal, interval, and ratio data lets take a quiz

2
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:11,190
where you decide which type of data these examples are. Lets put each of these

3
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:16,280
types of data into context. Lets say you're trying to create a dot plot showing

4
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:21,520
any trends in revolutions throughout history so you look up when revolutions

5
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:26,760
occurred. And you put dots there. Or let's say you want to figure out if

6
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:31,400
republicans and democrats are more likely to major in the sciences, humanities,

7
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:36,920
or business. Or maybe you want to find out if rats that have learned one maze

8
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:41,720
will learn a second maze more quickly than rats that never did a maze. In this

9
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:45,840
case you'd look at the time it takes for each type of rat to finish the maze.

10
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:51,060
For the final example, maybe you want to determine if your year in college

11
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:55,520
influences your reaction to stressful stimuli. So you take a sample of

12
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,570
freshman, sophmores, juniors and seniors And you look at each group's overall

13
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:05,855
reaction to stressful situations. One of more of these maybe not be either

14
00:01:05,855 --> 00:01:10,340
ordinal, interval, or ratio. Keep that in mind when you do this quiz.
