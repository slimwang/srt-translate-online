00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,100
Authentication and authorization
are the two main principles

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:05,480
of web security we will
cover in this course.

3
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:07,610
So let's first talk
about authentication.

4
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:10,260
Authentication is the process
of verifying that you

5
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,170
are who you say you are.

6
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:16,590
If you've ever logged into a website or
service, you've used authentication.

7
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:19,120
Actually you've probably used
authentication outside of your

8
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,280
computer as well.

9
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,310
For example,

10
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:24,540
we can verify a person's identify
by comparing a trusted document,

11
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:28,720
such as a license or passport, with
the physical appearance of that person.

12
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:31,930
If the picture and information match
with the person standing in front of us,

13
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:34,540
we authenticate that they
are who they claim to be.

14
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:38,010
Of course, this isn't a foolproof
system, but for many use cases,

15
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:40,390
the human eye if sufficient at
recognizing if a picture and

16
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:41,390
a person do not match.

17
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:46,650
Even in the scientific world there are
also ways to ensure the authenticity of

18
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:47,620
artifacts.

19
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:48,580
For example,

20
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:52,690
you can use carbon dating to ensure that
a fossil is indeed 300,000 years old,

21
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:56,090
and not just the skeleton of some
goldfish that died two years ago.

22
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:58,970
An example of authentication on
the Internet can be seen when we visit

23
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:00,690
verified websites.

24
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:04,860
If I land on a page that has a secure
connection, such as PayPal.com,

25
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:07,330
this green icon appears on the page.

26
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:10,130
This indication is the browser letting
us know that the website has been

27
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:12,680
verified through a trusted
certificate authority.

28
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:15,300
This means that the browser
recognizes this web page and

29
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:20,240
can verify that it is indeed the real
PayPal.com, and not an impostor page.

30
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,840
But most relevant to this class is
a website user authentication system.

31
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,460
With a unique user name and secret
password, you are proving to a website

32
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:32,190
that you are indeed who you say you are,
granting you access to the website.

33
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:35,620
While the identity information in many
cases can be public, like your email

34
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:39,420
address or user name, the password is
something that only you should know.

35
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:42,270
And since only you should know
that it serves as proof to verify

36
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:45,300
you are who you claim to be,
the owner of that account, and

37
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:47,820
therefore authenticated and logged in.

38
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,690
It's also important to note that
whenever there is a process of proving

39
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:54,750
the truth of something, there are always
people trying to cheat the system.

40
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:57,480
This is why there are many security
concerns you have to be aware of when

41
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:00,250
using, and even more,
when implementing authentication.
