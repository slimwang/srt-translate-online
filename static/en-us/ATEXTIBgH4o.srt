1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The answer is that the number of states is the cross product

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
of the numbers of all the variables, since they're each independent,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
and any combination can occur.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
For the power we have 3 possible positions.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
The camera has 2.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
The brush height has 5.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
The dirt has 2 for each of the 10 positions.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
That's 2^10 or 1024.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Then the robot's position can be any of those 10 positions as well.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
That works out to 307,200 states in the state space.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Notice how a fairly trivial problem--

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
we're only modeling a few variables and only 10 positions--

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
works out to a large number of state spaces.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 99:59:59,999
That's why we need efficient algorithms for searching through states spaces.
