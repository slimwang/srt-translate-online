00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Welcome to Applied Cryptography.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Cryptography is a branch of mathematics

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
and computer science--that's a lot of fun--it's about

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
using secrets to solve problems.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
In this class we're going to learn about

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
some of the foundations of cryptography

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and we're also going to learn to use cryptography

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
to solve problems in computing,

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
like how to send messages securely,

10
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
how to manage accounts on websites,

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
and how to do things like perform computation

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
where you can keep your data secret

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
and still get the result of a function

14
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
that depends on your data and some other data.

15
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
The name cryptography has two parts:

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
crypto comes from the Greek root for secret--to hide--

17
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
and cryptography's all about using secrets.

18
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
The second part comes from the root meaning writing--

19
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
this is the same graphy that appears in telegraphy or photography.

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
What we do in this course, and what we do in cryptography

21
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
involves a lot more than just secret writing.

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
It's really everything to do with secrets.

23
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
So a better name for the course would be cryptology.

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Cryptography is used so frequently in practice, though,

25
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
that it makes more sense to use the name cryptography,

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
even though our concern is with the much larger goal

27
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
of understanding how to use secrets in general.

28
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
And cryptology is the science of secrets

29
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
which is really what this course is all about.

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
So that's enough to answer the first quiz,

31
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
and the first quiz will check

32
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
that you understand the definition of cryptology.

33
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
So the question is, which of these involve cryptology?

34
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Check all of the answers that do.

35
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Opening a door--and I mean a traditional door,

36
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
using a traditional key.

37
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Playing a game of poker.

38
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Logging into your account at Udacity,

39
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
or doing a search using google.com,

40
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
and I should be a little more specific for this last one,

41
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
this assumes you're doing the search today,

42
00:01:43,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and you're already logged in to one of your Google accounts.
