00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,680
Looking at the diagram, you can see that we're achieving the exact same thing as

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:05,939
before but with less repeated code.

3
00:00:05,939 --> 00:00:10,320
The Van and the Cop functions produce the same kinds of objects they always did,

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,320
but they're allowing Car function to do most of the work for them first.

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,310
But in addition to providing a basis for the Van and the Cop

6
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:22,060
constructor functions, the Car function is also a full-fledged class itself.

7
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:25,480
If my code ever needed to make simple Car objects that lack the more

8
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:29,450
specific Van and Cop methods, then we could just call car directly.

9
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:33,900
And with that we have completed our refractor to include a super class and

10
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:35,550
two sub classes.

11
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:39,270
Interestingly, the car class now looks exactly the way the van class did

12
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:41,930
before we introduced the whole idea of cops into our program.
