1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:04,390
Let's suppose there's a rectangle here,
as A, B, C, D.

2
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:08,650
And you want to know the value
of the sum of the pixels in that

3
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:10,910
rectangle, okay?

4
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:14,110
So what you do is, and that you want to
know the value in the original image.

5
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:16,800
So what you do is you take
a look at that rectangle, and

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,660
you go over to your integral image,
all right?

7
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:23,534
And you realize the sum of that
rectangle compu, in the original image,

8
00:00:23,534 --> 00:00:27,620
is computed by looking at just these
four locations in the interval image.

9
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:30,950
And it's written down that the sum is
equal this will go through that, right?

10
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:31,630
You start with A.

11
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:32,240
Well, what's A?

12
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:38,100
A is the sum of everything up
to here in the original image.

13
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:41,860
Okay, but I don't want everything there.

14
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:44,140
Right?
Like, I don't want this stuff, and

15
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:46,060
I don't want that stuff.

16
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:46,970
So you say, okay!

17
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:48,170
No problem!

18
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:50,160
I'll subtract off B!

19
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,680
B is just this stuff, right?

20
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:56,010
B, the value at the location B,

21
00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:00,660
in the integral image is the sum of all
of these pixels in the original image.

22
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:06,770
So if I just take A minus B, it was
this whole thing, minus that part.

23
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:08,255
So it's just that region.

24
00:01:08,255 --> 00:01:11,440
Okay well, I still have got
a section in there I don't want.

25
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,260
Namely I don't want this.

26
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:14,460
Well that's easy.

27
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:15,100
That's C.

28
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:18,180
Okay, so I subtract off C.

29
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:21,620
And I'm almost done.

30
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:26,400
The observant of you will notice that
I've now subtracted this region off

31
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:26,940
twice.

32
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:28,730
So what do I have to do?

33
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:30,300
I have to put it back in once.

34
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:34,960
Well, do I have some value that's
the sum of that little square?

35
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:35,760
Of course.

36
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:36,980
That's D.

37
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:41,870
And that's why adding D back
in gives me the sum of that,

38
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:45,360
of the pixels in that rectangle
in the original image.

39
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,590
So only three additions,
and/or subtractions, right?

40
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:54,530
I have to add, subtract C,
subtract B, and then add D to A.

41
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:59,650
So I access the image four times,
do three addition, subtractions,

42
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:04,890
and I get the sum of any size rectangle!

43
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:09,080
So once I compute the integral image,
and that's actually very quick to do,

44
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:12,910
because the integral image,
that means I'm going across the top row,

45
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:15,860
I just look at the current pixel, and
I know the sum of everything behind me

46
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:17,580
because I've already computed that,
just add that in.

47
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:20,630
So it's recursively very quick
to compute the integral image.

48
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:23,320
So I can compute any
size rectangle quickly.

49
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:30,050
What this does mean by the way is,
if I'm looking to, for big faces and

50
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:34,750
small faces, I don't want to change the
size of the image that I'm looking at,

51
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:38,480
instead just change the size of
the features that I'm looking at because

52
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,970
it's really easy to look at a small
rectangle or a big rectangle

53
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:45,620
once I've computed an integral image
over, for that original image.
