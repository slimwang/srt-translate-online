00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Let's take a look at getting customers for physical channel. Now, what does that mean.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Imagine you're JetBlue and you now have a new airline route going from LaGuardia

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
in the United States in New York City down to Orlando, Florida and you really want to get

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
people to know about this new airline route,

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
well the first you're going to use is earned and paid media.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
You might run TV ads, you might run radio spots, newspapers, or your website,

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
you might send out email and the first thing you're doing with this paid media

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
is you're trying to get people aware that you even have a flight from New York to Orlando.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
This first step in a physical channel is generating awareness.

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
People just need to know that this thing exist.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Now the bad news is that your ad agencies or whatever could tell you how many people

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
this ad will reach, but they can't quite tell you yet how many will purchase

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
but you're interested in--okay, did they hear this.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
The next thing that you might want is to know are they interested.

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Nowadays, even in physical channels, we could see--did anybody hit the JetBlue website

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
and did they push the button on fares from Orlando and New York to Orlando,

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
is there some interest or do they call your 1-800 number but really

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
we're finally gets engaging in a physical channel.

19
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Is there people actually asking for the schedules and are hitting the "How much does it cost" page.

20
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
In fact, what you really want to be tracking is--are people calling reservations

21
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
or if this was a car dealership--are they showing up in the dealer, taking the car out for a test drive--

22
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
that's consideration.

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
In the physical channel, it's really interesting to measure the differences between

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
how many people did my ads or free media reached versus how many did I get in

25
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
to my physical channel to actually consider the product.

26
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
How many showed up in the store, how many showed up on my website,

27
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,000
how many called the 800 number, and it's this space between actually doing and this

28
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
is what makes it so hard in physical channels.

29
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
It's all the effort on paid and earned media.

30
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
You really don't know where those customers are until they're physically inside you channel

31
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
considering the purchase, and then of course, when they click "I'll buy it"

32
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:23,000
or tell a dealer "I'll take the car," or in JetBlue's case actually say, "I'll but this fair" or "Book a seat,"

33
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
you'll finally understand whether you have the order or not and that's what acquisition looks like

34
00:02:28,000 --> 99:59:59,999
in a physical channel--awareness, consideration and purchase.
