1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:05,580
The second primary method of clustering
is called the k-centroid method.

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:10,027
It is called this because,
as opposed to the hierarchical method,

3
00:00:10,026 --> 00:00:14,550
with this method you need to specify
the number of clusters you want in

4
00:00:14,551 --> 00:00:18,170
the solution,
which is the k in k-centroids.

5
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:22,679
The other difference is the methodology
is built around assigning an object

6
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:28,050
to the closest centroid, which is
essentially the center of the cluster.

7
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:32,759
This centroid is repositioned
after each change to the clusters.

8
00:00:33,909 --> 00:00:38,817
This example is fairly basic with
just two variables, and dividing into

9
00:00:38,817 --> 00:00:43,893
two clusters, but it will help visualize
what occurs during the process.

10
00:00:43,893 --> 00:00:46,033
With the k-centroid process,

11
00:00:46,033 --> 00:00:51,769
the initial positions of the centroids
is generally chosen at random.

12
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:56,080
The objects to be clustered are then
assigned to the closest centroid.

13
00:00:57,189 --> 00:01:02,048
And then the centroid is
repositioned to become the new

14
00:01:02,048 --> 00:01:04,802
center of the formed cluster.

15
00:01:04,802 --> 00:01:05,876
With each step,

16
00:01:05,876 --> 00:01:10,719
this reoccurs where the objects are
reassigned as needed to the centroid.

17
00:01:11,819 --> 00:01:16,733
And the centroid is then moved again,
until the reassignment and

18
00:01:16,733 --> 00:01:19,599
centroid shift becomes negligible.
