00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,633
We need to start off with our new equation for g, the total number of gallons

2
00:00:05,645 --> 00:00:11,493
that Grant is going to buy. Since n stands for the number of orders that Grant

3
00:00:10,892 --> 00:00:16,899
is expecting to get, we need to substitute 550 in the spot of n. Then, we just

4
00:00:16,911 --> 00:00:22,750
need to simplify the right-hand side of the equation, to solve for g. 55 plus 20

5
00:00:22,762 --> 00:00:25,243
is 75. So, the answer is 75 gallons.
