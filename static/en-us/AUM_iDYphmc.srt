1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:02,360
So here's our addGeofencesButtonHandler.

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:03,910
It's pretty straightforward
what it does.

3
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:06,830
So first of all, we check if our
Google API client is connected.

4
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:10,060
And if it isn't we just throw an error
at the user and let them know.

5
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:13,920
If it is, then we go to our addGeofences
that we've been discussing.

6
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,760
We pass it the API client.

7
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:18,300
We pass it the result of
getGeofencing request,

8
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,920
which of course is
a Geofence request object.

9
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:23,760
And we pass it the result of
getGeofencePendingIntent which is our

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,310
pending intent.

11
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:29,280
And once we've passed it these we
then set the result callback to this.

12
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:32,509
And by doing so the results will be
called back into the onResult that we

13
00:00:32,509 --> 00:00:34,470
created just a moment ago.

14
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:37,310
When doing this you gotta
put it in a try catch loop.

15
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:39,480
And we want to catch
a securityException.

16
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,229
And if we get one,
we're just going to log it.

17
00:00:41,229 --> 00:00:42,140
And that's it.

18
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:45,070
That's everything we need to do
to have our Geofences configured

19
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:47,540
when we push the button
within this application.

20
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:50,430
And then the services will
monitor the Geofences for us.

21
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:54,299
And inform us when we enter or
exit a Geofence.
