00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:02,800
Now that you've learned how
to make an engaging game,

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:05,400
let's talk about the best
ways to make money with it.

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,230
How do you build a profitable game?

4
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:11,730
>> The most obvious way is to
price a game, say, at $0.99.

5
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:15,550
Then anyone who wants to play your
game has to pay to download it.

6
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:17,290
These are called Premium games.

7
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:20,530
>> I've seen a few games
like that in the App Store.

8
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:22,220
But mostly I see free games.

9
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:25,090
How to games that are free
to download make a profit?

10
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:27,520
>> Those are called Freemium games, and

11
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:32,250
they use a combo of ads and
in-app purchases to make money.

12
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:35,470
>> And in this lesson, we'll learn
more about monetization strategies for

13
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:38,220
both Freemium and Premium games.

14
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:40,660
>> We'll see what works and
what doesn't for

15
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:46,320
each model, and even show you how to
implement your ads In an Android game.

16
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,100
>> After this lesson,

17
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,700
you'll be able to choose the best
ways to monetize your game.
