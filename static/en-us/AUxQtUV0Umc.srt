1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:04,490
So here, let's actually build this
by simply using the two image pairs.

2
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:08,750
Now, if you notice in these two image
pairs, the object of interest has

3
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:14,015
significantly changed, but some of the
local details are, of course, the same.

4
00:00:14,015 --> 00:00:20,170
Notice the same toy giraffe, and we
can basically see some of the details,

5
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:23,050
even though, of course, some of
the details are significantly different.

6
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:23,790
Also, in this case,

7
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:27,310
just to prove a point,
that the intensities are also different.

8
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:31,090
First, of course, by running through it,
we basically now want to come and

9
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:35,120
compute the color response function
as we've looked at this image.

10
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:39,300
This basically starts giving us all of
these responses, and I've just colored,

11
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:42,890
I mapped them a little bit to point out
where the higher cost-functions are,

12
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:45,190
which are all of the bright red ones,
and

13
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:49,410
that's where most of the interesting
corners have been found in this image.

14
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:52,180
And again, they are found
in both these image pairs.

15
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:55,290
Of course, now we can actually
take those bright spots, and

16
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:58,330
find points with the largest
corner response.

17
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:02,070
In essence, now that basically says,
I know what the R value is, I'm going to

18
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:05,415
threshold out and get rid of everything
else that's below a certain threshold.

19
00:01:05,415 --> 00:01:10,265
That allows me to find these
regions again in both of them

20
00:01:10,265 --> 00:01:13,815
that are just a higher rate,
or higher intensity, of Rs.

21
00:01:13,815 --> 00:01:14,945
This image should be hard for

22
00:01:14,945 --> 00:01:18,115
you to see because the points
are now very small in here.

23
00:01:18,115 --> 00:01:19,575
Let's start to zoom in.

24
00:01:19,575 --> 00:01:23,515
But basically, this is finding
the local maximum of each and

25
00:01:23,515 --> 00:01:25,185
every point that we have looked at.

26
00:01:25,185 --> 00:01:27,765
And again, at this scale,
they get to be really small.

27
00:01:27,765 --> 00:01:29,000
Let's zoom in.

28
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,650
And if you zoom in,

29
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:34,010
you should be able to see some simple
white spots all over this image.

30
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:34,980
Don't fret if you don't see them,

31
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:39,030
because what I've done now is basically
just use contrast announcement and

32
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:40,530
now you can see these points here.

33
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:43,300
Of course,
they're still kind of hard to see.

34
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:45,050
So let's look at them overlaid.

35
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:48,490
So, in this case now I've basically
taken the same image again, pair, and

36
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:50,530
here you can see small red spots here.

37
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:52,590
Of course, some are found here.

38
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:55,400
That region is not there, so,
of course, they're not found here.

39
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:59,130
But you can see, for example,
there are some features at the nose.

40
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:02,710
There are some features
at the tips up there.

41
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:05,910
And you can see similar features, and
actually, now you can start seeing

42
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:10,850
that it found features here and
here, and also found features, for

43
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:13,870
example, here and there, even though
the image is a little darker.

44
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:16,800
So this is the output we're looking at.

45
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,710
We want to find features like this.

46
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:20,680
That's what we want to do
with Harris detection.
