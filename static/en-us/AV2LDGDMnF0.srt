1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,420
We just decided that we need to add a 1 into this expression, in order to

2
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:09,125
complete the square. So we're going to want to have x squared plus 2 x plus 1

3
00:00:09,125 --> 00:00:14,119
inside these parentheses. My question is can we go ahead and replace x squared

4
00:00:14,119 --> 00:00:18,831
plus 2 x with x squared plus 2 x plus 1, without changing anything else in our

5
00:00:18,831 --> 00:00:21,150
equation? Please answer yes or no.
