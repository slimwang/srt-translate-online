00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,540
When we talked about quadratic inequalities, it referred to things called

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:07,351
critical numbers. These are the numbers that divided up our number line into the

3
00:00:07,351 --> 00:00:11,103
different intervals that we could consider to figure out which ranges of values

4
00:00:11,103 --> 00:00:15,302
satisfied our inequalities. For quadratic inequalities, we got these numbers

5
00:00:15,302 --> 00:00:19,586
from factoring and depending on what rational expressions we have that maybe the

6
00:00:19,586 --> 00:00:23,850
case as well. But we can generalize about it. You remember that for quadratic

7
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:27,946
inequalities, we found our critical values by figuring out which values of x

8
00:00:27,946 --> 00:00:32,107
would cause the quadratic expression to equal 0. And we basically have the same

9
00:00:32,107 --> 00:00:35,703
requirement for rational inequalities except that this time, we have one

10
00:00:35,703 --> 00:00:39,984
polynomial divided by another polynomial. So, you have two different sources of

11
00:00:39,984 --> 00:00:44,239
critical numbers. In either case, whether we're talking about the numerator or

12
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:48,271
the denominator, we'll come up with a critical value for every value of x that

13
00:00:48,271 --> 00:00:52,509
will make either one of those 0. Considering this method for finding critical

14
00:00:52,509 --> 00:00:56,730
numbers, what critical numbers do you find for this inequality that we were just

15
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:01,144
talking about? If you happen to find more than one critical number, then please

16
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:02,556
separate them by commas.
