Let's look at the answer to our on-chip directory

2
00:00:03,763 --> 00:00:05,990
quiz. We said that we might run out of these

3
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:08,979
partial directory entries, and the question is what do we

4
00:00:08,979 --> 00:00:12,320
do now? And the answer is, the same thing we

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,384
did when we ran out of room in a

6
00:00:14,384 --> 00:00:19,340
cache. And that is replace an existing entry, possibly using

7
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:23,652
a replacement policy such as LRU. The really interesting question

8
00:00:23,652 --> 00:00:25,636
is what do we need to do when we replace

9
00:00:25,636 --> 00:00:26,730
a directory entry?
