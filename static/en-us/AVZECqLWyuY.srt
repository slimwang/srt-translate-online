1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:04,040
You're going to use a dynamic broadcast
receiver to change the UI depending on

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:06,057
whether the device is plugged in or not.

3
00:00:06,057 --> 00:00:08,772
When the app is not plugged in,
as we can see here,

4
00:00:08,772 --> 00:00:11,451
then this charger icon
down here should be gray.

5
00:00:11,451 --> 00:00:15,470
But when it is plugged in,
as we can see up here, it is now,

6
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:19,015
this charger icon down here
should change to pink.

7
00:00:19,015 --> 00:00:23,755
To do this, you're going to create
a method that changes the plug to either

8
00:00:23,754 --> 00:00:25,422
a grey icon or a pink icon.

9
00:00:25,422 --> 00:00:28,010
Make an intent filter for
the charging status.

10
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:32,273
Make a broadcast receiver that updates
the UI to pink if the broadcast receiver

11
00:00:32,273 --> 00:00:36,200
is triggered because the phone
is charging, and gray otherwise.

12
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:36,790
Create and

13
00:00:36,789 --> 00:00:40,549
register this broadcast receiver with
the intent filter that you just made.

14
00:00:40,549 --> 00:00:43,549
And clean up the broadcast
receiver in onPause.

15
00:00:43,549 --> 00:00:47,117
This exercise is going to take place on
the MainActivity so let's open that up.

16
00:00:47,118 --> 00:00:49,998
The first thing I'm going to do is
create a new method called showCharging

17
00:00:49,997 --> 00:00:51,809
which takes in a boolean.

18
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:57,170
What I'll do in this method, is check
that if the boolean passed in is true,

19
00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:00,950
what showCharging will do is it'll
take the boolean that's passed in, and

20
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:04,650
use it to determine the source image
of the image view for the charger.

21
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:09,907
So if it's charging, we're going
to set the image view to pink.

22
00:01:09,906 --> 00:01:14,822
Otherwise, it's not charging, and
we'll set the image view to grey.

23
00:01:14,822 --> 00:01:18,442
All right, now that I'm done with this,
I'm going to create an intent filter.

24
00:01:18,441 --> 00:01:21,556
And I'm not going to create it
in the manifest like you saw.

25
00:01:21,557 --> 00:01:22,996
I'm going to make it dynamically.

26
00:01:22,995 --> 00:01:26,329
Up top here, I'm going to make
a new variable for my IntentFilter.

27
00:01:26,329 --> 00:01:30,340
And then down here in the onCreate I'm
going to actually exsanguinate it.

28
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:33,060
Up here, I'm going to create
a variable for my IntentFilter.

29
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:36,680
And then down here in OnCreate.

30
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,455
I'm going to actually instantiate it.

31
00:01:38,454 --> 00:01:40,658
I'm going to take my intent filter and

32
00:01:40,659 --> 00:01:45,890
I'm going to use the addAction method
to add the action powerConnected.

33
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:48,570
I will also add the action
powerDisconnected.

34
00:01:48,569 --> 00:01:52,279
This intent filter is now set up
to catch when either the device is

35
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,710
connected to power or
disconnected for power.

36
00:01:54,709 --> 00:01:59,231
Cool, but my intent filter is not super
useful without a broadcast receiver, so

37
00:01:59,231 --> 00:02:00,572
let's make that next.

38
00:02:00,572 --> 00:02:03,972
Now because I'm only going to be using
the broadcast receiver in this main

39
00:02:03,972 --> 00:02:06,362
activity class I'm going to
make it an inner class.

40
00:02:06,362 --> 00:02:09,104
So we're going to scroll
down to the bottom, and

41
00:02:09,104 --> 00:02:13,605
I'm going to make a private class
called ChargingBroadcastReceiver, and

42
00:02:13,604 --> 00:02:17,194
it's going to extend
BroadcastReceiver as you see here.

43
00:02:17,194 --> 00:02:19,784
Now I'm going to implement
the onReceive method,

44
00:02:19,784 --> 00:02:23,370
and inside of here I want to call my
ShowChargingMethod to update the UI.

45
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:27,242
And I am going to use my ShowCharging
method to update the UI.

46
00:02:27,241 --> 00:02:31,068
Now inside onRecieve I want to be able
to use my ShowCharging method to update

47
00:02:31,068 --> 00:02:34,819
the UI but how do I know whether
it's actually charging or not?

48
00:02:34,819 --> 00:02:39,447
Well, because I plan on using this
broadcast filter with this intent

49
00:02:39,447 --> 00:02:40,096
filter.

50
00:02:40,096 --> 00:02:43,259
I know the intent that my
broadcaster receiver gets,

51
00:02:43,259 --> 00:02:47,900
Will only be an intent that either has
the action ACTION_POWER_CONNECTED or

52
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:49,969
ACTION_POWER_DISCONNECTED.

53
00:02:49,969 --> 00:02:52,626
That intent is passed down here.

54
00:02:52,626 --> 00:02:55,933
So what I can do is I
can get a String_action,

55
00:02:55,933 --> 00:02:59,329
and set it equal to the intent's action.

56
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:04,980
And then whether it's charging or
not will be equal to whether that action

57
00:03:04,979 --> 00:03:08,069
is equivalent to
a POWER_CONNECTED action here.

58
00:03:08,069 --> 00:03:11,909
And then finally I can take this
boolean that I just made, and

59
00:03:11,909 --> 00:03:13,689
pass it on to showCharging.

60
00:03:13,689 --> 00:03:18,295
So isCharging will only be true if
the broadcast receiver received a system

61
00:03:18,295 --> 00:03:21,525
intent with
an ACTION_POWER_CONNECTED action.

62
00:03:21,526 --> 00:03:23,330
Otherwise, it'll be false.

63
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:26,917
If showCharging receives true here, it's
going to update the plug to be pink,

64
00:03:26,917 --> 00:03:29,069
otherwise, it should be gray.

65
00:03:29,069 --> 00:03:30,930
Now that I have this broadcast receiver,

66
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:33,780
let's actually make
an instance of it in onCreate.

67
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:36,616
Here at the top, I'm going to
make a new instance variable for

68
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:40,040
my broadcast receiver and then down
here, I'm going to instantiate it.

69
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:43,050
I still need to actually register
the receiver to receive updates.

70
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:48,109
I'm going to register the receiver in
onResume, and unregister it in onPause.

71
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:51,282
This is because the receiver only
really needs to update the UI

72
00:03:51,282 --> 00:03:53,358
when the activity is in the foreground.

73
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:57,753
So here, I'll call registerReceiver
with my broadcastReceiver and

74
00:03:57,752 --> 00:03:58,949
my intent filter.

75
00:03:59,979 --> 00:04:05,579
And here in the onPause I will call
unregisteredReceiver with my receiver.

76
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:07,758
And with that I'm almost done.

77
00:04:07,758 --> 00:04:09,697
Let's run the code.

78
00:04:09,697 --> 00:04:12,536
So I'm going to use some ADB
commands to simulate plugging and

79
00:04:12,536 --> 00:04:13,682
unplugging the phone.

80
00:04:13,682 --> 00:04:15,930
So right now the phone's unplugged.

81
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:18,180
And now I'm going to plug the phone in,
and woohoo,

82
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:19,399
it updated to pink, that's great.

83
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:21,360
Now we can see here it's plugged in.

84
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:25,927
And then if I unplug the phone it's
gray again which is also good.

85
00:04:25,927 --> 00:04:29,293
But you might notice,
if you navigate away from the app, and

86
00:04:29,293 --> 00:04:31,737
say plug in the phone,
like I just did here.

87
00:04:31,737 --> 00:04:33,247
And then go back to the app.

88
00:04:33,247 --> 00:04:37,346
You get in a kind of inconsistent state,
because the phone is plugged in, but

89
00:04:37,346 --> 00:04:38,112
this is gray.

90
00:04:38,112 --> 00:04:39,925
We're going to be fixing that bug next.

91
00:04:39,925 --> 00:04:42,285
But for now, go ahead and
finish this exercise.

92
00:04:42,285 --> 00:04:44,933
When you're done you should
be able to see that while

93
00:04:44,932 --> 00:04:47,774
the app is in the foreground
this changes effectively.

94
00:04:47,774 --> 00:04:51,576
I've also added some helpful commands
for simulating plugging in the phone and

95
00:04:51,576 --> 00:04:54,705
unplugging the phone, in both
the emulator and the live device.

96
00:04:54,704 --> 00:04:55,519
Okay, good luck.
