1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:01,859
And now for those steps.

2
00:00:01,859 --> 00:00:04,520
First, we drag a table into
the view from the object menu.

3
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:09,450
It'll automatically expand
to fill the whole view.

4
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:12,715
You'll want to drag this upper border
down a bit so that it ends up a.

5
00:00:12,715 --> 00:00:14,275
Below the status bar.

6
00:00:14,275 --> 00:00:18,905
Next we bring up the constraints menu,
and add constraints for the borders.

7
00:00:18,905 --> 00:00:22,045
And once the table's in place,
we can connect the data source.

8
00:00:22,045 --> 00:00:25,800
So Ctrl-click on the table to open
up the pop-up connections menu.

9
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,330
Then you can drag from this data source
property to the view controller icon.

10
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:33,070
You're probably familiar
with those steps by now.

11
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:35,010
Here come the two new steps.

12
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:38,970
Add a cell to the table by going
to the attributes inspector, and

13
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:40,970
setting prototype cells to one.

14
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:46,450
If you click on the cell,
you'll see it needs a reuse identifier.

15
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:48,180
Let's go into the project navigator so

16
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:51,280
we can double check what the cell was
called in the Villan view controller.

17
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:54,145
Here you can see the VillanCell.

18
00:00:54,145 --> 00:00:55,205
Is being dequeued.

19
00:00:58,845 --> 00:01:02,195
So, here we can see our reuse
identified to be VillainCell.

20
00:01:04,785 --> 00:01:07,920
By the way, when you're
entering text into these cells.

21
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,490
Make sure you always hit return.

22
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:12,950
Otherwise storyboard won't save it.

23
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:17,140
This is weird behavior, and the source
of a lot of frustration for both new and

24
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:19,240
accomplished developers.

25
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:22,510
And those are the steps for
setting up a table view in storyboard.

26
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:25,030
So let's run it and see how it looks.

27
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:27,640
So you can see that the pictures and
names are there, but

28
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,290
not the evil schemes.

29
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:31,550
That's because of the cell style.

30
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:33,520
If you go back into
the attributes inspector,

31
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,870
you will see this drop
down menu labeled style.

32
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:39,540
Here you can see your options for
cell styles, and

33
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:42,040
we'll have more details on
that in the next section.
