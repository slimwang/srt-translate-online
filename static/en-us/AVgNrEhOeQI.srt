1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:05,612
This hyperbola is centered at 0,0. It has an a value of 3 and a b value of

2
00:00:05,612 --> 00:00:11,770
positive 5. Nice work if you got these correct. Now, let's check your graph.

3
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:15,457
We'll start with an ellipse. So, this ellipse will be centered at the origin

4
00:00:15,457 --> 00:00:20,965
and will go 3 units in the x direction. And 5 units in the y direction. We'll

5
00:00:20,965 --> 00:00:24,100
draw a dashed box around our ellipse, so that way we can start to draw a

6
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:30,274
hyperbola. Next, we'll draw in our two diagonals across our rectangle. We want

7
00:00:30,274 --> 00:00:33,460
to extend these along the graph, so that way we can draw in our hyperbola

8
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:38,725
branches. So now we're ready to cut the ellipse open. We turn each of the

9
00:00:38,725 --> 00:00:43,781
pieces out. And then we can see we have our hyperbola. And notice again, that

10
00:00:43,781 --> 00:00:49,316
we can get our rectangle, just by looking at the a value and the b value. We

11
00:00:49,316 --> 00:00:53,464
start with the origin and we move 3 units in the x direction for a and 5 units

12
00:00:53,464 --> 00:00:58,910
in the y direction for b. This hyperbola opens to the left and to the right

13
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:04,310
since the x squared term comes first. Whichever term is positive, the x squared

14
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:09,110
term or the y squared term. That will determine which way our hyperbola opens.

15
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:14,213
Since the x squared term here is positive, then we know that it opens left and

16
00:01:14,213 --> 00:01:16,070
right.
