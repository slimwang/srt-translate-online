00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,440
In this session we discussed
variables and constants.

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:07,560
They're indeed two of the most basic
ingredients of any application.

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:11,660
As you've seen, you can accomplish many
simple tasks using just variables and

4
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:12,680
constants.

5
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:16,190
But soon you'll start combining
variables into larger constructs

6
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:18,520
to build solutions to
more complex problems.
