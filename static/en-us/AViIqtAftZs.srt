00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,551
So we just found the graph of y plus 13 equals 3 times x plus 1 squared. But

2
00:00:04,551 --> 00:00:09,020
what if I want to change the sign of a leading coefficient? Let's make it

3
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:13,576
negative 3 instead of positive 3. Which graph matches this new equation?
