00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,040
So this is what I've come up with. We captured all

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,350
the content of the page in the document object model. We

3
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:09,110
captured all the styles of the page in the CSS Object

4
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:13,470
Model. And then we merged the two and the blender tree?

5
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:14,800
>> You mean the render tree?

6
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:19,470
>> Oops. The render tree. Then in the layout step we compared the

7
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:22,260
position of every element and calculated its.

8
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:25,490
Dimensions against the layout viewport. Once we

9
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:28,940
finish that, we handed layout to paint which rendered the pixels

10
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:33,100
on the page and with that, we're done. There's the page. Pshoo.
