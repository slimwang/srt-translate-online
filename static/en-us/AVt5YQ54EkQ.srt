1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,290
So, with the way formulas work, and

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:05,400
how they can grab fields off related objects.

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:05,845
>> Uh-huh.

4
00:00:05,845 --> 00:00:08,320
>> Unfortunately, you can't grab the user's email.

5
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:08,830
>> Okay.

6
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:11,780
>> But, that's only from this pick list. Instead of using

7
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:15,320
the, run this rule for criteria met, change that pick list to,

8
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:18,620
if the formula evaluates to true. And this'll be another place

9
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:21,120
that we can create a formula, in order to add some logic.

10
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:21,630
>> I've seen this before.

11
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:21,720
>> Yeah.

12
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:24,860
>> Cool. So if the following formula evaluates to true,

13
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:26,750
should I go to user?

14
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:29,360
>> So we want to still go in maitenence ticket.

15
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:29,730
>> Okay.

16
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:33,640
>> But we can treverse through that technician field.

17
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:34,490
>> Oh cool.

18
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:36,640
>> In order to grab fields off of the technician.

19
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,640
>> Technician, nice. Okay. So this is the

20
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,700
field that represents the email address of the technician.

21
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:43,330
>> Exactly.

22
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:46,510
>> And how do I check to see if it exists or not?

23
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:50,740
>> So, we can first add an if statement like we had before.

24
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:51,160
>> Okay.

25
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:53,820
>> So paste that technician email.

26
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,980
>> I'm going to do sum logical test with technician email.

27
00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:00,170
>> This is another one of those. There's a

28
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:03,000
fancy little method out there for checking if it's null.

29
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:03,350
>> Okay.

30
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:07,070
>> So, you can actually see it right there on the right, is null.

31
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:07,470
>> Is null.

32
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:10,620
>> But I want technician email in this place where it says expression.

33
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:10,890
>> Exactly.

34
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:16,520
>> So I'm going to cut and paste. Value if true, value if false.

35
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:19,180
>> So, we can just those parameters manually. We can

36
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:21,220
put, if the value is true, set it to true,

37
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:23,460
if it's false, set it to false. And so, if

38
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:28,950
this if statement evaluates to true, then the workflow will run.

39
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:31,340
>> and then the formula, okay, the formula value is true.
