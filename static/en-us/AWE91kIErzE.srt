00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,769
If the line we're looking for is parallel to the line y equals one-half x plus

2
00:00:05,781 --> 00:00:11,570
3, it needs to have the same slope as this line, which is one-half. So, you can

3
00:00:11,582 --> 00:00:17,296
start off by writing y equals one-half x, since this is y equals mx. And then,

4
00:00:17,308 --> 00:00:22,833
we just need to figure out B, the y coordinate of the y intercept. However, we

5
00:00:22,845 --> 00:00:26,890
know the y intercept we're looking for. It's 0, negative 2. So we just add a

6
00:00:26,902 --> 00:00:31,480
minus 2 to the end of this equation. Let's graph this, just to see what it looks

7
00:00:31,492 --> 00:00:36,227
like. And sure enough, we can see that this orange line, which corresponds to

8
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:41,141
our new equation, has the same slope as the original line. But it's translated

9
00:00:41,153 --> 00:00:45,868
down so it has a different y intersept. These lines are definitely parallel.
