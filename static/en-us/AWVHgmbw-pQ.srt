1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:04,490
Now that we have looked at the data can we ask some more questions?

2
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:07,480
So the first question we want to ask is can we

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:11,960
identify people based on their location patterns?

4
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:15,350
We have discussed in the previous video that we could use some distance

5
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:21,700
functions measured at different times to determine a person's location pattern.

6
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:26,360
To answer this question, we can start using simply x and

7
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,740
y coordinates for their location.

8
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:33,630
Or use something like a taxicab distance or a Euclidean distance.

9
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:38,120
We have already discussed the formulas for the taxi cab and

10
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:40,230
the Euclidean distances.

11
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:44,920
As you see, we will continue using the flow diagrams to map our

12
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:48,670
progress through the iterative model building process.

13
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:52,300
After looking at the data we can quickly draw the following

14
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:54,060
conclusions about it.

15
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:56,420
First, the data is labeled.

16
00:00:56,420 --> 00:01:01,120
Secondly, the labels are categories and not numerical.

17
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,980
So we can cast this as a classification problem.

18
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:07,830
Of course, we can use location and

19
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:11,770
distance over time to make this classification.

20
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:15,510
The next thing we need to decide is whether we want to

21
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:19,680
build a model that is linear or not.

22
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,428
We can use some nonlinear methods.

23
00:01:22,428 --> 00:01:27,990
For example, kernels or artificial neural networks.

24
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:31,910
However, for this problem we will not go down this route.

25
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:34,040
We will go down the linear route first.
