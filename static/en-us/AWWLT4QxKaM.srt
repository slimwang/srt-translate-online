1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,069
so I've been working on neural network

2
00:00:02,069 --> 00:00:04,859
since 2006 when I took my first day I

3
00:00:04,859 --> 00:00:07,378
class in grad school but neural networks

4
00:00:07,378 --> 00:00:09,960
actually have a much longer history they

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,669
go back all the way to the nineteen

6
00:00:11,669 --> 00:00:14,759
fifties that's a great point one of the

7
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:16,739
fascinating things about neural networks

8
00:00:16,739 --> 00:00:19,050
at least to me is how long they've taken

9
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:22,109
to become an overnight success as far

10
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:23,760
back as the late nineties there was a

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,010
network called the Lynette built by yon

12
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:28,528
lagoon that the post office and banks

13
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:30,809
used to read digital on mail and checks

14
00:00:30,809 --> 00:00:33,570
and it was incredibly important but even

15
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:36,030
after one that not a lot of interest

16
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:38,280
picked up in neural networks deporting

17
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,869
is only really taken off in the last

18
00:00:39,869 --> 00:00:41,520
five years

19
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,200
it's kind of a puzzle why it took so

20
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,229
long yeah that's a good question the

21
00:00:46,229 --> 00:00:48,149
answer boils down to the increase

22
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:50,609
availability of labeled data along with

23
00:00:50,609 --> 00:00:52,170
the greatly increased computational

24
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:54,869
throughput of modern processors for a

25
00:00:54,869 --> 00:00:56,909
long time we didn't have the huge

26
00:00:56,909 --> 00:00:58,679
labeled data sets that we needed to make

27
00:00:58,679 --> 00:01:01,289
deep learning work those datasets only

28
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:03,090
became widely available with the rise of

29
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:05,188
the internet which made collecting and

30
00:01:05,188 --> 00:01:08,459
labeling huge datasets feasible but even

31
00:01:08,459 --> 00:01:10,469
when we had big data sets we often

32
00:01:10,469 --> 00:01:12,118
didn't have enough computational power

33
00:01:12,118 --> 00:01:13,409
to make use of them

34
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:14,938
it's only been in the last five years

35
00:01:14,938 --> 00:01:16,799
that processors have gotten big enough

36
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:18,390
and fast enough to train large-scale

37
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:24,170
neural networks
