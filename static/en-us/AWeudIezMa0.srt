1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:04,200
Wow, that was a lot of stuff,
and too many animals.

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,090
Next lesson,
we'll get out of the zoo and

3
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:10,570
get back on the web, without
bringing any exotic spiders with us.

4
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:14,360
In this lesson, you've seen the basics
of two SQL statements, select for

5
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:19,080
fetching data from the database, and
insert for adding rows to the database.

6
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:23,430
You've applied joins and aggregations
to answer a variety of questions.

7
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:26,270
In lesson three, you'll be
connecting your database powers to

8
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:28,110
your python programming skills,

9
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:32,420
by adapting an existing web service
to use a back end database.

10
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:35,050
You're going to be running that
service on your own computer.

11
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:38,620
So before we go on, you'll need to
download the database software, and

12
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:40,600
an environment to run it in.

13
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,320
I've put a link about how to do that,
in the instructor notes below.

14
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,980
Once you have that
software downloaded and

15
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:48,150
installed, I'll see you
again in less than three.
