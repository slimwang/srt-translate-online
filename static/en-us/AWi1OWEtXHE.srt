1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
This was a trick question, which was totally nontrivial.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Multiplying something with A+b modifies the mean in a very straightforward way.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
So this is the valid expression here, aµ+b. So 6 would've been the right answer over here.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
You already know that adding a constant doesn't change the spread of a distribution.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
So the result should not have a b inside. That takes out this term and all those terms.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
We also know that the spread has nothing to do with the mean so this term is out.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
So the question really is, is it aσ² or a²σ²?

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
And if you remember correctly when we did the salary raise by a factor of 10%,

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
we noticed that the standard deviation goes up by this factor.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Therefore, the variance goes up by the square of this factor

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
and 1 is the right answer here and not 7.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
And that's interesting because in doing arithmetic with the mean and the variance,

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
you have to be very conscientious as to whether you use the variance or the standard deviation.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 99:59:59,999
If you get that wrong, then you've got the wrong answer.
