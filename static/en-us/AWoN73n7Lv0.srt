00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Here I've written down four claims.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
A context-free grammar always produces just a finite number of utterances.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
A context-free grammar can capture the language a^N and b^N, where N is the same.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Context-free grammars are more powerful than regular expressions,

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
and context-free grammars can tell if a program declares a variable before using it.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Or equivalently, I could use a context-free grammar

7
00:00:23,000 --> 99:59:59,999
to determine if a program declares every variable before he uses it.
