1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:06,861
So let's take a look at the new tag
that you created to send an event hit.

2
00:00:06,861 --> 00:00:10,610
Click New to create the tag,
you know that by now.

3
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:13,750
I call mine
Send Daily Special EVENT Hit, so

4
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:16,610
I can tell it distinctly
from the Screen View Hit.

5
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:20,330
Configure the tag to get the Tracking ID
for the analytics account,

6
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:23,300
which is from the variable
we configured earlier.

7
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:24,960
Track type is event.

8
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,890
I called my category, Button clicks.

9
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:29,740
It doesn't matter what
you called your category.

10
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:31,690
I called my action, Show Daily Special.

11
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:33,710
You can call it what you like.

12
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:39,010
And then this one, the label, food pref,
notice how we use the variable.

13
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:42,630
Actually, the way you get the variable,
you just click the button, and

14
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:44,860
you go down to food prefs.

15
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:46,340
It's in here somewhere.

16
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:49,600
Go up to food pref and you insert it.

17
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,150
And because it's a data layer variable
it's available to us in that fashion.

18
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:54,720
No value.

19
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:57,940
If you do specify a value
make sure it's an int.

20
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:00,864
If you set the value and
it's not an int,

21
00:01:00,864 --> 00:01:03,617
the hit will not show up in Analytics.

22
00:01:03,617 --> 00:01:05,093
And then the firing,

23
00:01:05,093 --> 00:01:09,800
it's actually going to fire the same
as the Screen View hit did.

24
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:14,940
I want it to fire when
the event equals openScreen and

25
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:18,590
when the screen name
equals Show Daily Special.

26
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:19,730
And save the tag.
