1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:02,184
So what's with these lenses anyway?

2
00:00:02,184 --> 00:00:05,100
Well they serve a pretty
simple function actually.

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:08,770
Each lens makes it possible for

4
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:12,250
your eye to focus on a screen that
is extremely close to your face.

5
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:17,210
As an experiment,
try holding your phone screen

6
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:20,770
a couple centimeters from your eyes and
see if you can read anything.

7
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:23,694
Go ahead, I'll wait here.

8
00:00:23,694 --> 00:00:31,787

9
00:00:31,787 --> 00:00:33,133
Did you try it?

10
00:00:33,133 --> 00:00:37,510
Well you probably noticed that you
can't read anything on the screen.

11
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:39,520
It's incredibly blurry.

12
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,440
All right.

13
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:45,630
Now take your cardboard device,
look through it and

14
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:48,034
hold your phone up against the lenses.

15
00:00:48,034 --> 00:00:58,034

16
00:01:02,594 --> 00:01:07,469
Now if you did that you'll probably
notice that the image popped into nearly

17
00:01:07,469 --> 00:01:08,545
perfect focus.

18
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:11,920
By using specialized lenses,

19
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,620
VR headsets focus the light from
a near eye display onto your retina.

20
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:22,270
You'll also notice that the lenses
greatly magnify the image shown on your

21
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:23,960
phone, just like this.

22
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:30,620
You might even be able to see
the individual pixels on the display.

23
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:36,770
The exact size, shape and
placement of these lenses can have

24
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:39,660
a huge impact on the final
quality of your VR experience.

25
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:45,650
Each headset manufacturer has to choose
a lens that makes the best trade off

26
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:49,821
between field of view,
focal length, comfort,

27
00:01:49,821 --> 00:01:53,450
optical distortion, and finally cost.

28
00:01:54,892 --> 00:01:58,920
All right, now let's dive
even deeper into the headset.

29
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,740
Let's look at VR display technology.
