1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,555
If the distance between x and 4 needs to be less than 5, then we can either

2
00:00:04,555 --> 00:00:09,421
count up 5 from 4, which takes us to 9, and draw a round parenthesis there. Or

3
00:00:09,421 --> 00:00:14,195
we can count down from 4 and 5, which takes us to negative 1, and we can write a

4
00:00:14,195 --> 00:00:19,256
round parenthesis there as well. Any area between these two points is fine as a

5
00:00:19,256 --> 00:00:24,242
value of x. Looking at this interval, this is something we definitely know how

6
00:00:24,242 --> 00:00:29,103
to handle. These solutions go from negative 1 to 9, non inclusive. And we can

7
00:00:29,103 --> 00:00:32,775
also write this as negative 1 is less than x is less than 9.
