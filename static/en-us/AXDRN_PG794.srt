1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Now, that last one was easy. Let's do one more.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Here we have a game, and the payoff to max is 3,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
6, 5 and 4.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
And I want you to tell me what the strategy is,

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
whether it's pure or mixed.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
What are the probabilities that max should play 1 and 2,

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
and what are the probabilities that min should play 1 and 2?

8
00:00:22,000 --> 99:59:59,999
And what is the value of the game to max?
