00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:03,250
Welcome to 2D game
development with libGDX.

2
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:06,430
I'm Jeremy, lifelong gamer and
course developer at UDACITY.

3
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:08,783
>> And I'm James, UDACITY's
game depth curriculum designer.

4
00:00:08,783 --> 00:00:13,040
In this nano degree, you'll learn how to
use the libGDX framework to create games

5
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:17,740
that run anywhere from your desktop
to web browser to android or iOS.

6
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:21,820
First, you'll explore the basics of the
game loop and drawing to create icicles.

7
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:24,450
A game where you control
a character dodging an avalanche.

8
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:27,790
>> Then for your first project,
you'll create a breakout clone called

9
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:29,280
Outbreak
>> Next,

10
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:32,020
you'll learn to direct the complex
orchestra of entities and

11
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:36,410
interactions that make up a platforming
game featuring our hero, Gigi Gal.

12
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:37,620
>> And for your second project,

13
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:41,410
you apply these skills to a tap down
shooter called Space Kerfuffle.

14
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:43,930
>> There are many ways to have
a career in game development.

15
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:45,210
You can join an established studio.

16
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:47,920
Or, if you're interested in
becoming an indie developer,

17
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,410
you'll need to learn how
to monetize your games.

18
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:53,560
>> The best way you can do that is to
make games that are fun and engaging.

19
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:56,350
And you'll learn how to
integrate services for ads,

20
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:59,050
in app purchases, and even leaderboards.

21
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:01,950
>> Then, you'll learn to use even
spicier features that will really make

22
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:04,150
your game stand out,
like physics and II.

23
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:08,700
>> Finally, for your capstone project
you'll use all of these skills to make

24
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,740
a game of your own design.

25
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:12,740
>> Building games is challenging, but

26
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:14,980
at least you can always
procrastinate by testing a game.

27
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:17,610
>> Best of luck in the nano degree.

28
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:19,320
We can't wait to see
what you come up with.
