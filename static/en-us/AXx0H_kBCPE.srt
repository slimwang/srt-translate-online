00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hi again. It's great to see you again.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
We talked a lot about basic methods of AI,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
and from today on we'd like to go into applications.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Specifically, today we'll talk about computer vision.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Computer vision is a very bright field

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
that concerns itself with making sense out of camera images or video.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Many devices today are equipped with cameras, such as cell phones or cars,

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
and making sense out of image data has become a really important subfield

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
of artificial intelligence.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Today I'll teach you some of the very basics.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
It's not as deep as my graduate level class on computer vision,

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
and I hope you get a chance to take that in the future,

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
but I hope to enable you to apply some of the very basic methods

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
to, for example, use images and classify them using artificial intelligence technology

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
through feature extraction and other techniques

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
and also to start doing some of the more 3D-oriented tasks

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
such as 3D constructions.

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
So let's start with the very, very basics

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
and ask ourselves what is a camera.

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Cameras come in all sizes and shapes.

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
This is my beautiful Nikon D3 camera [shutter clicks],

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
but I don't use it much because it's very heavy, even though it takes beautiful pictures.

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
This is the camera I use the most. It's a cell phone camera.

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
It's an 8 megapixel camera over here with a flash,

25
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,000
and I can start it, and you get to see whatever is underneath,

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
like this pen over here.

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I can also activate the front camera, and you get to see the way I've been recording

28
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
all those wonderful online lectures over all those weeks

29
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
with this little camera over here.

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
In all of those cameras there is a lens and there's a chip,

31
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
and the light is captured from the environment and focused through the lens on the chip,

32
00:02:08,000 --> 99:59:59,999
which raises the question, how does a lens and a chip really work?
