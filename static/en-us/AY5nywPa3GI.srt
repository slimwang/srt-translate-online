00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,719
Now that we've heard from Mora about the benefits of alternate

2
00:00:02,719 --> 00:00:06,240
bandwidth, let's try it for ourselves. Looking at the histogram we created

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,360
earlier, we can see that it's skewed. We've just zoomed in

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,200
on the left side of the graph from the histogram from before.

5
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:15,750
Working from his new histogram, let's add some better labels and

6
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:19,190
some binning. To adjust the binwidth, I can pass the binwidth parameter

7
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:22,440
to QPLY. And for this data, I'm going to choose a value of

8
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:26,140
25. That seems pretty reasonable since we're going from zero to 1000.

9
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:28,290
The other thing that I want to do is break up this x

10
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:31,770
axis every saved 50 units. To do that, I'm going to pass the

11
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:35,380
breaks parameter to our scale to x scale continuous layer. Breaks is

12
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:38,740
going to take a sequence that has a starting point, an ending point,

13
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:42,310
and a step or the interval space we want on our axis.

14
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:44,770
So in this case, I'm going from zero to a 1000, and

15
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:48,320
I want to step every 50 units. You can learn more about

16
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,370
how to manipulate the scale and the breaks on the x or y

17
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:54,380
axis by reading the link in the instructor note. When

18
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:56,240
I run the code I can see that I get

19
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:00,320
a completely different histogram. Taking a closer look, it's easy

20
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,360
to see that many users have less than 25 friends.

21
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:06,140
These users are probably new. Now let's ask a more

22
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:10,280
interesting question. Which gender group on average has more friends

23
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:13,150
men, or women? To answer this question we need to

24
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:16,840
split this histogram into two parts for males and females.

25
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:17,870
Let's see if you can do that.
