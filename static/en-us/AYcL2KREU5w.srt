The two main brain regions involved in schizophrenia are the prefrontal cortex

2
00:00:04,283 --> 00:00:08,980
and the hippocampus. If you remember, the prefrontal cortex is involved in

3
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:12,824
working memory, paying attention and staying focused and organizing our

4
00:00:12,824 --> 00:00:17,520
thoughts. People suffering from schizophrenia have disfunction in this region

5
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,451
of the brain. Secondly, people with schizophrenia often have smaller

6
00:00:21,451 --> 00:00:24,928
hippocampi, which affects learning and memory and can lead to some of the

00:00:24,928 --> 00:00:28,710
disorganized thinking seen in schizophrenia.
