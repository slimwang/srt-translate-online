This one is 0,3, and this one is 2,4. We can see to go from this point to the

3
00:00:09,271 --> 00:00:14,104
next point, we should move up one. And then write 2. We moved one unit up in a

4
00:00:14,104 --> 00:00:18,937
positive direction. So we know the rise is positive 1. And then, we move two

5
00:00:18,937 --> 00:00:23,087
units to the right, in a positive direction. So, the run is positive 2. These

00:00:23,087 --> 00:00:27,377
direction arrows can help me associate the positive and negative signs for the

00:00:27,377 --> 00:00:31,710
rise and the run. There are, of course, other ways to find the slope. If you've

00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:36,043
found other ways to find the slope, share your thoughts on the forum. We'd love

to see what you did.
