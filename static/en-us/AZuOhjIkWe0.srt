1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:03,807
And the classic example here is the Rorschach ink blot test, which you see

2
00:00:03,807 --> 00:00:08,738
here, which is simply symmetrical ink blots. And, the job for the person is

3
00:00:08,738 --> 00:00:11,962
just to look at that and tell the psychologist what he or she sees in that ink

4
00:00:11,962 --> 00:00:13,530
blot.

5
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:16,428
>> And after doing this for about 10-12 ink blots, a licensed psychologist can

6
00:00:16,428 --> 00:00:20,706
interpret the results. They look for unconscious patterns, in the themes, that

7
00:00:20,706 --> 00:00:25,200
a person gives them. For example, they might have a hostile, and agressive

8
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,310
theme, or a sexual theme, in all the ink blots.

9
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:33,252
>> That's right. For example, a person who is depressed may see self destrucive,

10
00:00:33,252 --> 00:00:37,974
or perhaps sad images. A person who is anxious may see something that causes

11
00:00:37,974 --> 00:00:40,965
them excessive worry, or even fright.

12
00:00:40,965 --> 00:00:44,215
>> The problem with scoring projective tests, however, is that you need to find a

13
00:00:44,215 --> 00:00:47,540
valid and reliable way to interpret the results.

14
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:51,040
>> That's right. And so for reliable, we would have to have multiple judges giving

15
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,515
the same responses across time.

16
00:00:53,515 --> 00:00:56,665
>> And for validity, say a psychologist found somebody with a hostile theme to

17
00:00:56,665 --> 00:01:01,572
their interpretations of the ink blot. They would have to have external

18
00:01:01,572 --> 00:01:05,980
evidence, from friends, or family, or peers to confirm their hostility.
