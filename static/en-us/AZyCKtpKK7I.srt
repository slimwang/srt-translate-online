00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:04,542
Now, the key is we weren't really solving for x here. We know x equals 2 the

2
00:00:04,542 --> 00:00:10,455
4th, or 16. We wanted to convert this to logarithmic form. So we'll use the

3
00:00:10,455 --> 00:00:16,418
base of 2, will be the base of our logarithm. So log base 2 of x equals 4, our

4
00:00:16,418 --> 00:00:21,510
exponent. If you always remember that this base becomes the base of the

5
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:26,148
logarithm. And that this power becomes the answer to our logarithm, then you

6
00:00:26,148 --> 00:00:30,975
you know that this must be the argument of the logarithm. This is the number

7
00:00:30,975 --> 00:00:36,892
that we take the logarithm of. So 2 to the fourth equals x is the same thing as

8
00:00:36,892 --> 00:00:40,643
log base 2 of x equal to 4.
