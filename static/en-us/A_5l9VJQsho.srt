1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,660
Well, if you had actually highlighted it now, the answer really is that

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:09,460
both these images would require some sort of common set of coverage.

3
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:14,390
Basically, meaning is, this image in here have something similar.

4
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:16,920
Similarly, this board here is similar.

5
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,900
So, there have some matches between these two that are essential for us to use.

6
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:23,160
However, this one and this one are too far apart.

7
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,780
So, these were next to each other.

8
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:26,220
This was one side of the side.

9
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:27,690
The other one on the other side.

10
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:30,000
And yes while there is a green things of common.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,320
If you really look at it there is no comparative matches that would happen here.

12
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,040
So these two things, if they were to actually match and

13
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,680
align they would be wrong.

14
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:41,750
These would be a better pair so, the answer would be of course, A.
