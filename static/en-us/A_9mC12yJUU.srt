00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:06,373
>> Okay 50% of 320 pixels is going to be 160

2
00:00:06,373 --> 00:00:11,446
pixels. Next, we have the paragraph node which is 100% of

3
00:00:11,446 --> 00:00:16,395
its parent, so that's also going to be 160 pixels. The em

4
00:00:16,395 --> 00:00:20,359
is 50% of its parent, so that's going to be 80 pixels.

5
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:27,580
And finally, span is 25% of its parent, so that's going to make it 40 pixels.

00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:30,400
