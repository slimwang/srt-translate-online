00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,300
Frames are typical character of human cognition. Let us consider three

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:09,720
specific ways. First, frames are a structured knowledge representation.

3
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:15,500
We can think of production systems as being atoms of knowledge representation,

4
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,100
and frames as being molecules of knowledge representation.

5
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:24,430
A production rule captures a very small amount of information. A frame can

6
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:29,540
capture a large amount of information in organized manner as a packet.

7
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:34,210
Second, frames enable me to construct a theory of cognitive possessing which is

8
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:38,410
not entirely bottom-up, but is partially top-down. I have to see a lot of data

9
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:43,720
from the world. But not all of the cognitive processing is bottom-up. The data

10
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:48,500
results in the retrieval of information from my memory. That information,

11
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:51,950
that knowledge in the form of frames then help to make sense of the data.

12
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,820
It has been generating expectations of the world.

13
00:00:57,020 --> 00:01:02,290
So then the processing becomes not just bottom-up, but also top-down. Third,

14
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:05,910
frames capture the notion of stereotypes. Stereotypes of situations, stereotypes

15
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:11,368
of events. Now, stereotypes can sometimes lead us to incorrect inferences. Yet

16
00:01:11,368 --> 00:01:15,210
you and I have stereotypes of whereas kind of events and situations. So

17
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:19,270
why do we have state effects, because they're cognitively efficient. And

18
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:22,950
why are they cognitively efficient? Because instead of reasoning about

19
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:27,450
the world anew each time, they already have default values associated with them.

20
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:32,030
That's the property of frame. All the default values then,

21
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:35,940
enable me to generate certain number of expectations very rapidly.

22
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:40,580
That's cognitively efficient. Here are three formative connections between

23
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:44,570
frames and human cognition. There are a lot more that we'll get into slowly.
