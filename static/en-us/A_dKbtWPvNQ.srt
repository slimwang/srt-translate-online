00:00:01,150 --> 00:00:03,960
Welcome to lesson six. At this point, you guys can build

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:07,580
just about anything. You collect data from users. You can build pretty

3
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:10,390
web pages. You can store all of this stuff in databases. You

4
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:13,465
can manipulate this database. You can build log-ins, all sorts of cool

5
00:00:13,465 --> 00:00:16,700
things. And when you think about it, just about every website

6
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:20,350
on the Internet is some combination of the things you've already learned

7
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:23,040
how to do. So it's pretty cool that you can, you've gotten

8
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:26,290
this far. Now, one of the things we haven't touched on yet,

9
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:29,330
is how to build websites that operate at a larger scale.

10
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:33,260
That is that more than just a couple of people can use.

11
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:36,450
When you start having websites operating at a big scale, lots

12
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:39,490
of things can break down. You can run out of disk space

13
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:41,680
for your data. You can run out of bandwidth, to serve

14
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,140
all of the amazing stuff that you have. Or you can run

15
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:48,030
out of you know, processor time to actually generate all of the

16
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:49,980
amazing computations you're doing. Right? There's

17
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:51,750
all sorts of different things that

18
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:54,960
can, that are limiting factors in how your website functions. And we're

19
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,020
going to learn how to address each of those things. How to use

20
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:59,528
multiple machines if you need to, and that sort of thing. So

21
00:00:59,528 --> 00:01:03,940
that you can actually build a large-scale website. So, let's jump right in.
