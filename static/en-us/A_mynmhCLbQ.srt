00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,190
One of the most useful questions to ask
when you're building a low fidelity

2
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:03,780
prototype.

3
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:07,235
Is whether a user can easily make the
app do the thing it's supposed to do.

4
00:00:07,235 --> 00:00:10,550
This may sound like a very
basic question, and it is.

5
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:13,240
But it's actually the most vital
thing to ask at this point.

6
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:15,830
For instance, one of the things
a user might want to do in

7
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:19,150
our example app is check off
a task they've completed.

8
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:21,880
We need to think about how a user will
achieve this task from the starting

9
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:24,440
point of, I have opened this app.

10
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:27,360
For a first time user, we may need
to have an instruction screen, but

11
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:30,130
in general there are three common
patterns for dealing with user flow.

12
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:34,450
The first is to have an app
that does only one thing and

13
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:36,460
so only have that one screen.

14
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:38,589
A good example of this is
your common calculator app.

15
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:43,230
The second is to have a main screen
that functions as a menu of options for

16
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:45,720
various things the user
can do in the app.

17
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:48,690
And then have each task
occur on its own screen.

18
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:51,650
Finally, you can have the first
screen of the app be a place where

19
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:55,630
the users can complete the most
common task the app will be used for.

20
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:57,960
And have a secondary screen for
the menu.

21
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,140
So, in our case,

22
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:02,820
we can't use the first pattern since
our app has multiple functions.

23
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:06,980
That leaves us with a choice between a
user flow which starts on a menu screen.

24
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:10,230
And having a user flow which starts on
a screen on which the user can check

25
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:11,970
off tasks.

26
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:16,130
As time has gone on, the second
pattern has become much more common.

27
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:20,000
It is generally better to be able to
isolate the most common use cases and

28
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,880
have those achievable from
the main screen like this.

29
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,020
For the same reason,

30
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:28,990
mobile notifications are best when the
user can perform some action directly

31
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:31,630
from the notification,
without opening the app itself.
