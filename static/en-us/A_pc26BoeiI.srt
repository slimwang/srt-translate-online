00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:03,877
Now I want to present you with three questions. I really want you to think

2
00:00:03,877 --> 00:00:07,468
about this and discuss it with your peers on the forum. First, I want you to

3
00:00:07,468 --> 00:00:10,300
think about how old your parents were when they got married, if they got

4
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:14,510
married. Now does this significantly differ from when you got married, or from

5
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:19,675
when you actually want to get married? Why yes or why no? Here’s the second

6
00:00:19,675 --> 00:00:24,164
question. Why do you think there’s a shift in the age people get married? And

7
00:00:24,164 --> 00:00:27,851
the last question. What are the main things that make you think that you are,

8
00:00:27,851 --> 00:00:32,956
will be, or were ready to get married? So go to the forum and let’s talk about

9
00:00:32,956 --> 00:00:35,797
this. I’m really excited to see what you guys say. I think this is going to be

10
00:00:35,797 --> 00:00:37,200
a great discussion that we can have.
