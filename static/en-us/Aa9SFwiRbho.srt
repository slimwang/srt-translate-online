1
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:03,319
I'm going to answer a pretty
common interview question,

2
00:00:03,319 --> 00:00:04,730
what motivates you in the workplace?

3
00:00:06,115 --> 00:00:08,150
Well there's a few different
things that motivate me.

4
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:10,620
One is just passion for what I do.

5
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:13,610
I'm pretty lucky that I really
do enjoy what I'm doing so

6
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:15,290
that's a great natural motivator.

7
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:20,810
Another thing I would have
to say is my distaste for

8
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:23,800
missing deadlines or
being pushed to the last minute.

9
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,720
So, I'm motivated to do things early.

10
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,400
That way I have
the opportunity to review and

11
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,650
iterate on something
before missing a deadline.

12
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:36,373
And then finally, probably the most
important thing for me is my desire for

13
00:00:36,373 --> 00:00:38,987
I want to be a good colleague,
as a great motivator.

14
00:00:38,987 --> 00:00:43,823
I know my previous company,
me completing what I'm doing and

15
00:00:43,823 --> 00:00:48,870
doing that well allows my
colleagues to complete their job.

16
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:53,850
So if somebody's job is contingent
on me doing my job well and on time,

17
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:57,730
that's a really great motivator, because
you always want to be a good colleague.
