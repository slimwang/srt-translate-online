1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:04,210
So the candy bowl example is actually a simplified case of a field of

2
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:06,760
study called consumer choice modeling.

3
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:10,105
In consumer choice modeling, our goal is to understand and

4
00:00:10,105 --> 00:00:13,800
characterize how consumers make choice decisions.

5
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:16,540
In order to answer this, we try to understand first,

6
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:20,660
is it even possible to find preference ordering for product brands?

7
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:25,690
Second, can we infer even that there exists a preference between brands?

8
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:29,430
So let's look at a simple real life version of this problem.

9
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:33,140
We will see how building a model can help us understand if there

10
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:35,900
exists user preference between brands of candy.
