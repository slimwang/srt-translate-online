1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:03,130
Configuration is a kind of design

2
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:07,340
that assigns values to variables
to satisfy certain constraints.

3
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:11,060
Design in general can be very
complex and sometimes very creative.

4
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:14,300
Configuration is a kind
of very routine design.

5
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:18,830
The kind of everyday mundane design,
which is very very common.

6
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:22,310
While in design in the beginning,
you do not know the components or

7
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:24,560
the arrangement of
components looks like.

8
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,910
In configuration,
you already know all the components.

9
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:29,540
You simply have to figure out
an arrangement that will satisfy

10
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:30,660
constraints.

11
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:31,490
As an example,

12
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:34,860
consider the furniture in the room
in which you are sitting right now.

13
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:38,430
All the components, all the pieces
of furniture are already known.

14
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:39,440
The room is fixed.

15
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,100
You can't change the room either.

16
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:42,910
But you certainly can move
the furniture around.

17
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:44,820
There might be some constraints.

18
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,090
For example,
if the room has a couch and a TV,

19
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:51,120
then you might impose a constraint that
a couch has to be in front of the TV and

20
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,320
a certain number of feet away from it.

21
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:57,220
Given the constraint that all the
furniture must somehow fit into the room

22
00:00:57,220 --> 00:01:01,730
as well as the constraint that the TV
must be in front of the couch,

23
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:06,180
you might first decide to place the TV
and the couch at specific locations.

24
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:08,750
And then having decided on
the location of the TV and

25
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:12,350
the couch, decide on the location
of the other pieces of furniture.

26
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:16,660
David, given the configuration is so
common, can you think of other examples?

27
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:19,130
>> So, it seems like we could talk a lot
about the physical arrangement of things

28
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:20,390
in different types of rooms.

29
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:23,010
For example, when an airline
configures a new airplane they

30
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:25,600
have to configure the arrangement of the
seats, the arrangement of the window,

31
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,810
the arrangement of the emergency
exits and various things like that.

32
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:31,800
But I think configuration really goes
beyond just configuring the physical

33
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,330
layout of items.

34
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:35,420
So, when I'm taking a picture with
my camera phone, for example,

35
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:38,310
I have to configure different
options like the focus, whether or

36
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:40,980
not the flash is on, my distance to
what I'm taking a picture of, and

37
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:43,320
a few other different things like that.

38
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,580
In doing so I'm still balancing
different restrictions.

39
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:48,580
So, for example, if I'm taking a picture
of a landmark I can only be so

40
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:49,690
close to it.

41
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:52,100
And therefore I might need to make
different decisions based on the focus

42
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:55,900
or the flash in order afford for
how far I can be from the landmark.

43
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:59,230
>> Design in general is a very common
information processing activity.

44
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:02,040
And configuration is the most
common type of design.

45
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:05,340
Now that we have looked at
the definition of a configuration task,

46
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:08,580
we're going to look at methods for
addressing that task.

47
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:13,990
Once again recall that the components in
case of configuration are already known.

48
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:16,740
We are deciding on the arrangement
of those components.

49
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:20,900
We are assigning values to specific
variables of those components, for

50
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:21,730
example, sizes.
