1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The answer is obviously 1.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
This is the key dimension over here.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
The orthogonal dimension in this direction carries alomst information,

4
00:00:07,000 --> 99:59:59,999
so it suffices, in most cases, to project the data onto this 1 dimensional space.
