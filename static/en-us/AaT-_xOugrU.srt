When you declare a variable, it's important that you give it an initial value.

2
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:12,610
Look at this variable. It's name is rocketSpeed. It's type is called double.

3
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:17,888
And I'll talk about what double means in just a minute. What I want to show you

4
00:00:17,888 --> 00:00:23,562
first is over here, the last part of the variable declaration. And that's the

5
00:00:23,562 --> 00:00:27,700
initial value. And it really is important that you always supply an initial

6
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:33,294
value when you declare a variable. Because if you forget, and later use the

7
00:00:33,294 --> 00:00:39,674
rocketSpeed variable, that would be an error. Every variable that you used must

8
00:00:39,674 --> 00:00:44,885
really have a value. The best time to set the value is right when you declare

9
00:00:44,885 --> 00:00:50,443
it. Now, back to the curious type double. That means it's a number that can

10
00:00:50,443 --> 00:00:55,110
have a decimal point, such as here, 24,724.573. So, when you see the word

11
00:00:55,110 --> 00:01:01,110
double, you should simply think a number with a decimal point. And ignore the

12
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:07,441
curious name. Now, look at this variable declaration. The name is

13
00:01:07,441 --> 00:01:16,821
sallyRidesBirthday, the type is the Day class, and the initial value looks like

14
00:01:16,821 --> 00:01:24,933
this. You will see soon exactly what this syntax means, but when you look at

15
00:01:24,933 --> 00:01:30,540
it, it seems intuitively clear, we make a new Day object with a date 1951, May

16
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:33,539
26.
