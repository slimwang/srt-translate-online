1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:06,530
Well it started as a US DOD effort,
at or the orange book, then with time

2
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:10,900
multiple countries sort of recognized
this importance of software procurement,

3
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:14,350
they had to worry about security
that they can evaluate for

4
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:15,630
those software products.

5
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:19,020
That evolved into what's called
the Common Criteria which is Is

6
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:20,390
an international standard.

7
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:24,320
Common Criteria came from efforts

8
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:31,940
in Europe, in Canada, and
the US one that we talked about.

9
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:37,336
The idea Is that you are consumer of
the system or user of the system,

10
00:00:37,336 --> 00:00:43,221
you're going to specify what needs you
have or what requirements you have.

11
00:00:43,221 --> 00:00:46,132
Vendor going to sort of
implement a solution and

12
00:00:46,132 --> 00:00:51,550
going to make claims about that solution
meeting your needs or your requirements.

13
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:54,530
And in particular, we're talking about
sort of security requirements or

14
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:55,720
security properties.

15
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:59,310
So whoever is going to evaluate is
going to determine whether the vendor

16
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:04,060
actually, the claims that they make
are claims that you can believe.

17
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:06,420
And these claims actually
allow you to say,

18
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:10,462
well, my needs that I
had specified are met.

19
00:01:10,462 --> 00:01:15,790
So there's three entities, you have
some requirements, a vendor who provides

20
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:20,090
the solution makes a certain set of
claims how they meet those requirements,

21
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:23,700
and somebody who evaluates has
to then assess those claims,

22
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:29,900
and the reason we should be able to
trust whatever those claims are about.

23
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:33,930
Based on that, we're going to
give it an assurance level,

24
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:36,810
which rates the trustworthiness
of the systems.

25
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:41,830
Evaluation assurance level or
EAL, we will be

26
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:46,930
able to use that to rate a system,
in particular, how well

27
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:52,280
it meets the claims about security
properties that are important to us.

28
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:56,147
So similar to division D,
we said, basically,

29
00:01:56,147 --> 00:02:00,760
it didn't do very much EAL1 is
the most basic one and EAL7 is

30
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:05,580
the most rigorous or the highest level
of trustworthiness that you can get.
