Let's take a look at keeping customers for the web/mobile channel.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Web/mobile works almost exactly like physical channels--keeping customers.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
It's exactly the same idea--we might want to offer loyalty programs, contests and events,

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,000
blogs, RSS and email, or social media--all designed to engage customers.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Why do you want to think about keeping customers is that customers are

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
a lot more expensive to acquire over here than they are to keep.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
And the key thing that you want to worry about is churn or sometimes called customer attrition.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
And here is why--so imagine if you are losing 5% of your customers a month,

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:52,000
well in 3 years you'll only have about 16% of them left, but imagine if you can reduce churn to 1%,

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
so that every month only 1% of these customers left.

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:03,000
After 36 months with 1% attrition, you'd have 70% of your customers left.

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Just think about it, with 5% attrition, your average customers sticks around for about 20 months,

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
but with 1% attrition, they stick around for 100 months.

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
You get 5 times more revenue from the same customers by just working

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
on keeping these customers around.

16
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Now, by the way in reality, financial people discount the cash flows

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
from customers later in this life cycle.

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The actual value you get is somewhat less--how much less depends on your industry

19
00:01:30,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and cost of capital, but we'll leave that for the accounting to set in a more detailed price
