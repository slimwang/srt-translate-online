1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:07,732
And the answer is easily derived from the basic projection equation, here without the minus sign.

2
00:00:07,733 --> 00:00:17,066
So if we move the object closer to the camera, which means Z decreases, then the size will increase.

3
00:00:17,067 --> 00:00:21,332
If Z decreases, yes, the size will increase.

4
00:00:21,333 --> 00:00:26,366
If you use a camera with a longer focal length, then the size of the projection will increase.

5
00:00:26,367 --> 00:00:31,366
If you increase F, then yes, X will increase as well, in the same proportion.

6
00:00:31,367 --> 00:00:38,799
If you double the distance to the object, which means Z is twice as large as before, the projected image will be half as large.

7
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:44,566
And yes, if we divide by something that's twice as big, then the result will be half as large.

8
00:00:44,567 --> 00:00:51,766
And finally, the ratio of the focal length, F, over the distance of the object, Z,

9
00:00:51,767 --> 00:00:56,032
is the same as the projected size of the object in the camera plane, x.

10
00:00:56,033 --> 00:01:06,666
This specific statement, we really forgot about the object size, uppercase X, which plays a big role in this particular equation.

11
00:01:06,667 --> 00:01:09,833
Therefore, this statement is false.
