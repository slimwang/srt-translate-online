1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,442
So when adding GeoFences
to LocationServices, so

2
00:00:02,442 --> 00:00:04,995
they can monitor them for you,
there were a number of steps that

3
00:00:04,995 --> 00:00:07,620
you had to follow, and
you've done all of these now.

4
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:08,200
Most notably,

5
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:12,595
you were calling the addGeoFences
method on the GeoFencingApi object.

6
00:00:12,595 --> 00:00:16,400
You're passing it a GoogleApiClient,
a Geofencing Request and

7
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,905
a Geofencing Pending Intent.

8
00:00:17,905 --> 00:00:22,190
Now, whenever you add one of
the Geofences to the services,

9
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:26,500
the service will callback onResult(),
and will pass you a status code.

10
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:29,910
You can then check this status
code to see if the GeoFence was

11
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:32,590
added successfully, or
if there was an error.

12
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:36,020
In the next step you're going to
implement this onResult(), and

13
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:37,700
check this box when you're
ready to go forward.
