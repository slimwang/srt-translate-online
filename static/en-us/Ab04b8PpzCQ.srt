1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,510
The move planner app that you'll be building will require three

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:05,630
different asynchronous requests.

3
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:09,330
It will require data from Google street-view, The New York Times, and Wikipedia.

4
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:11,790
When the user types in an address,

5
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:15,250
the street-view of their new potential home will become the background, and

6
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:18,080
they'll see related New York Times and Wikipedia articles below.

7
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:20,740
But, before we start building,

8
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:23,780
we really need to break down the components of asynchronous requests.
