1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,920
Okay Michael, so, feels like we've relaxed almost

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:06,942
everything we could relax except for one thing. We're

3
00:00:06,942 --> 00:00:09,252
now going to look at two player non zero

4
00:00:09,252 --> 00:00:12,530
sum. None possibly none deterministic games of hidden information.

5
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:13,220
>> Cool.

6
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:15,524
>> And that's going to turn out to be messy, but

7
00:00:15,524 --> 00:00:18,404
get us to the place where I've secretly been trying to

8
00:00:18,404 --> 00:00:21,430
get us all along. So, let me describe a game

9
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:25,650
for you. Very carefully, and let's see where it leads us.

10
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:30,490
Okay, here's the game, you've got two people. These two people are criminals.

11
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:34,450
>> Oh no! Are they smooth criminals?

12
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:36,300
>> One of them is.

13
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,454
>> [LAUGH]

14
00:00:39,454 --> 00:00:43,026
[MUSIC]

15
00:00:43,026 --> 00:00:45,540
>> [LAUGH] Oh, you're terrible. Okay, so

16
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:47,780
we have two people. They're criminals. Okay,

17
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:50,260
and unfortunately they've both been captured by

18
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:51,558
the cops. I have actually no idea how

19
00:00:51,558 --> 00:00:56,270
to draw that, but lets just try to draw that like this. The cops come along, and

20
00:00:56,270 --> 00:01:01,590
capture them both because they are suspected in a particular robbery. Okay?

21
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:02,932
>> Hm.

22
00:01:02,932 --> 00:01:04,540
>> And they take them and put them both in jail.

23
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:07,990
So those are jail bars.

24
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:08,168
>> [LAUGH]

25
00:01:08,168 --> 00:01:10,690
>> Okay? But they don't just put them

26
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:12,710
in jails. They put them in two separate jails.

27
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:14,640
>> Oh no.

28
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,406
>> Okay. And one cop goes to one criminal and says

29
00:01:19,406 --> 00:01:24,730
listen, here's the deal. We know you did it. Okay? We know you did.

30
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:32,480
And your friend over there, he's currently singing, singing like a bird. And he,

31
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:37,380
is going to pin it all on you. So this is your last chance to give us a little

32
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:43,010
help and admit that you two did it. Or, that the other guy did it.

33
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:47,140
You admit that the other guy does it, you say it was his fault, then we'll cut

34
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,610
you a deal. Now to make it worse, the

35
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:52,080
cop tells him that there's another cop over there.

36
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:56,173
>> [LAUGH]

37
00:01:56,173 --> 00:01:58,520
>> Who's talking to the smooth criminal, and

38
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,430
is offering him the same deal.

39
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:00,530
>> Hm.

40
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:04,562
>> And whoever, goes first, whoever pins it

41
00:02:04,562 --> 00:02:08,840
on the other guy first, gets to walk. Okay?

42
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,340
>> Hm.

43
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:15,840
>> So, if I can get the curly-head guy to defect, okay?

44
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,786
>> Hm.

45
00:02:16,786 --> 00:02:23,220
>> Then, I am going to let him walk and he will spend zero months in jail.

46
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:23,380
>> Okay.

47
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:24,240
>> Okay. On

48
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:27,560
the other hand, if the other guy defects, then he's going to

49
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:31,110
get to spend zero time in jail. And since we've got all

50
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:33,410
that we need. We got a confession. To get this guy to

51
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:37,280
go to jail. He's going to go to jail for nine months. Okay?

52
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,380
>> Negative nine months?

53
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:42,710
>> Yeah. Oh, that's a cost in months. I see. Uh-huh. [CROSSTALK]

54
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:44,284
>> Yeah that's a cost in months. Okay? So

55
00:02:44,284 --> 00:02:49,900
if, curly-head guy defects before the other guy does,

56
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:54,370
then zero. He walks. He pays no cost, other than

57
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:56,255
the cost he's already paid for a life of crime.

58
00:02:56,255 --> 00:02:58,208
>> [LAUGH]

59
00:02:58,208 --> 00:03:01,440
>> Now if he refuses to drop a dime on the other

60
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,740
guy, but the smooth criminal decides to defect he's going to lose nine months.

61
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:08,370
That make sense? And the other guy's going to walk. So he's

62
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:10,900
getting the same deal, they're both getting the same deal. You got it?

63
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:11,620
>> Yeah.

64
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:14,900
>> All right, now. It's a little more complicated

65
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:16,870
than that, all right? But I, I hope that you're

66
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:18,150
getting all, keeping all of this in your head. It's

67
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:21,040
a little more complicated than that. There's actually four choices

68
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,080
here, not just two. It's not just a case of. I

69
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,780
defect or the other guy defects. I defect, the other

70
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:30,950
guy doesn't. I don't defect, the other guy does. Okay? You

71
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:33,440
could both refuse to drop a dime on the other.

72
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:37,180
You could cooperate, or you could both rat out the other.

73
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:40,310
>> At the same exact moment?

74
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:41,601
>> At the same exact moment.

75
00:03:41,601 --> 00:03:45,014
>> So, there's a big thick wall here. Curly guy doesn't know what

76
00:03:45,014 --> 00:03:49,020
smooth guy is doing, and smooth guy doesn't know what curly guy is doing.

77
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:49,590
>> Right.

78
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:54,020
>> So the question is, if you have a choice between either defecting or.

79
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:55,830
>> Which means blaming the other guy? Which means

80
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:57,836
blaming the other guy you defecting from your friendship.

81
00:03:57,836 --> 00:04:01,617
>> Oh. Or you can cooperate, that is be true to your

82
00:04:01,617 --> 00:04:05,890
friendship. I can, we both people can defect, both people can cooperate,

83
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:07,320
one person can defect and the other person

84
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,090
cooperate, so there's actually four different options there.

85
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:11,200
>> I fee, I feel a matrix coming on.

86
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,380
>> Yeah, I think there's a matrix

87
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:14,140
coming on. So let's draw the matrix, because

88
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:16,320
I think that makes it easier to see. But you have the background here, right?

89
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,010
>> I think so, yeah.

90
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:19,709
>> The key piece here is that each person has

91
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:22,230
a choice of either defecting from their friendship or trying

92
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:27,220
to cooperate. Keeping their mouth shut, and, they don't know

93
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:30,910
what the other person is doing. So, what are all

94
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:32,430
the costs here? What are the worst case things?

95
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:33,541
Let's just draw it all out as a matrix.
