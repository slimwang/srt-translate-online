1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,120
There's 2 cases here; so let's say the graph does have a clique the size of m,

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:06,370
then what will happen is the following.

3
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:08,410
So it contains exactly 1 vertex

4
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:11,970
that corresponds to a variable in that clause,

5
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:13,620
and what we also know is

6
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:16,230
because we constructed the graph this way,

7
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:21,060
that we can not have 2 vertices connected here in this graph

8
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:24,620
where there's a conflict, so what we can not have in this graph, for example

9
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:28,120
is 1 vertex that represent not x2

10
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,500
and another vertex that represents x2,

11
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,150
because we avoided this in the construction

12
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:35,810
but this directly shows us how we can

13
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:39,020
satisfy this Boolean formula here,

14
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:42,150
so if we have a not x2 here, we just set it to 0

15
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:44,720
so we could just set this one to false,

16
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:47,510
so that not x2 becomes true,

17
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:49,730
then this clause here is satisfied

18
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:52,340
and also this one over here would be satisfied.

19
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:55,640
And x1--that's a separate variable,

20
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:58,280
so we can set it as we want,

21
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:00,940
and we could set this one to false.

22
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:03,020
So we have x2

23
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:06,890
and we can set that to false so not x2 becomes true.

24
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:09,320
So that becomes true,

25
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:11,290
that one becomes true,

26
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:12,820
that one here is false.

27
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:14,250
Over here, we have not x2 as well,

28
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:16,760
so there's no conflict here.

29
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,660
x1--we haven't yet talked about x1,

30
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:21,290
but can just do the same thing; we can set x1 to false,

31
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:24,440
so the whole thing not x1 becomes true.

32
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:26,700
We have set it to false,

33
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,760
and we haven't even looked at x3,

34
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,890
but all of the clauses are already satisfied,

35
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:33,130
and that's actually the cool thing to notice here.

36
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:35,060
x3 is also not contained in the clique,

37
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:37,590
so the vertices in the clique tell you

38
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:39,700
how to set the variables

39
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:43,140
so that the Boolean formula can be satisfied.

40
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,840
So what if this graph here does not have a clique of size m?

41
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,740
Well in this case, it means that

42
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:49,300
we have 1 clause group

43
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:52,620
which is not contained in the clique

44
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:55,240
and if we have 1 clause group that is not contained in the clique,

45
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,550
this means that there's no vertex

46
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:00,240
in the clause group

47
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,650
that has connections to all of the other vertices in the smaller clique

48
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:05,400
that we're looking for,

49
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,860
and that means, due to the way we constructed the graph,

50
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:09,960
that every vertex

51
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,290
has a conflict with

52
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:13,920
another vertex in the clique

53
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,430
so if there's no large clique,

54
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:18,380
this means that every assignment

55
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:21,470
of true and false of the variables will lead to a conflict

56
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:24,600
such that at least 1 of the clauses

57
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,140
can not be satisfied.

58
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:29,120
So then the Boolean formula does not have a satisfying assignment.

59
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,460
So now that we have this reduction,

60
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:33,260
we know that clique is

61
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:35,280
NP complete,

62
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,840
which of course makes Bob a little unhappy.

63
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,230
So now what about vertex independent set?

64
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:42,080
Are those problems NP complete

65
00:02:42,080 --> 99:59:59,999
or are we not sure yet?
