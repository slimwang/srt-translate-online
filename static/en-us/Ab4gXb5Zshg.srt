1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,300
In this exercise,
you'll set up a cron job to periodically

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:06,950
update the announcement about
conferences that are almost sold out.

3
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:09,550
Since you've already written
the function to create the announcement,

4
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:12,790
pretty much all you're going to need
to do is to configure the cron job.

5
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:16,370
And you do that in a configuration
file called cron.yaml.

6
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:20,630
So you need to create a new file in your
project directory called cron.yaml, and

7
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:21,920
to find the cron job.

8
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,050
You need to provide the URL and
schedule, and option lay description.

9
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:28,970
The URL is the path to
the task to be run.

10
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:31,750
The description, which is optional,
describes the task so

11
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:33,735
you can figure out later what
your code was supposed to do.

12
00:00:33,735 --> 00:00:36,995
And the schedule indicates
how often to run the task.

13
00:00:36,995 --> 00:00:39,445
There are a variety of ways
to set the schedule, but

14
00:00:39,445 --> 00:00:41,985
you must strictly follow the syntax or
the cron job won't run.

15
00:00:41,985 --> 00:00:45,705
I recommend checking the format for
the schedule in the developer docks.

16
00:00:45,705 --> 00:00:48,475
Note this says every 1 hours.

17
00:00:48,475 --> 00:00:51,725
It would sound correct if you were
saying every 12 hours or every 2

18
00:00:51,725 --> 00:00:56,500
hours but it turns out that even for 1,
you have to say every 1 hours, not hour.

19
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:01,370
You can see the defined cron jobs in the
cron job tab in the task queue section.

20
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:04,180
You can see the schedule, and
when it was last run, and

21
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:07,150
whether it was successful, and
you can also trigger to run it manually.

22
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:11,010
And now for your task in the exercise,
you should create the config file and

23
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:15,550
make it run, the /crons/set_announcement
URL every minute so

24
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:16,770
you can see it working.

25
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:19,920
But after you've tested your cron job,
you should set it to run much less

26
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,290
often, for example,
once every hour or two.

27
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:25,160
In general, you shouldn't run cron
jobs more often than necessary,

28
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:27,310
as they do consume resources and quota.

29
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:29,650
So after you complete each step here,
check it off.

30
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:32,610
Make sure, again, to change your
cron job from every minute to

31
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:34,710
every hour after you've seen it run.

32
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:38,380
And then, as a syntax check, how would
you schedule it to run every two hours?

33
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:39,190
Put that down here.
