Now you make think it's a bunch of trouble to add all these comments into your

2
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:07,510
code but let me show you something. Here is a part of the documentation of the

3
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:11,780
java string class. When you scroll through it you'll see someone wrote a lot of

4
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:16,129
documentation here, and actually let me tell you who that someone was. You can

5
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:19,580
get the source code for the string class, it's a part of the java development

6
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:23,290
kit. So, here is a part of the actual source code, here is a method and over

7
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:28,648
here. The programmer wrote a pretty long java.comment and not just one. If you

8
00:00:28,648 --> 00:00:33,940
scroll through this file, you will see that every method has a comment. Here's

9
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:37,620
another one and you'll see that every method has a comment so if the programmer

10
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:41,499
that give us java can write those comments, so can you.
