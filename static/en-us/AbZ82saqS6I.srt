You might be thinking, great we solved our equation. But remember, we've only

2
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:08,680
solved for u so far. What we really want to solve for is our original variable,

3
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:15,210
x. Since u was actually equal to e to the x, what we really have here is e to

4
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:20,590
the x equals 3 and e to the x equals 2. However, you know how to solve each of

5
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:25,680
these equations. So, please solve for x and round each of your answers to three

6
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,019
decimal places.
