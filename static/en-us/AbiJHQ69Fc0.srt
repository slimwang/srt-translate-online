During roughly the elementary school years, from about seven to 11, give or

2
00:00:03,808 --> 00:00:07,560
take, children move into the third stage of cognitive development according to

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:13,822
PAJ. He called this stage the Concrete Operational Stage. Now, we already

4
00:00:13,822 --> 00:00:18,937
defined operation, as the ability to figure things out just in ones head. So,

5
00:00:18,937 --> 00:00:23,000
this is the primary skill at this age. One of the best examples of this, is how

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,948
children at this stage can do basic math just in their head. For example, 5

7
00:00:27,948 --> 00:00:31,982
plus 5 is 10. They no longer need to count, add or subtract using their fingers

8
00:00:31,982 --> 00:00:36,658
or other objects. Conservation is now possible because of the mental capability

9
00:00:36,658 --> 00:00:41,064
of saying something, like, oh. Well, those 2 look different. But I know that

10
00:00:41,064 --> 00:00:45,431
that's really the same. Concrete refers to the fact that children in this stage

11
00:00:45,431 --> 00:00:52,044
reason and think about concrete things. Not abstract ones. Abstract ideas and

12
00:00:52,044 --> 00:00:55,938
reasoning happen in the next and final stage of cognitive development, Formal

13
00:00:55,938 --> 00:00:59,210
Operations, which begins in adolescence.
