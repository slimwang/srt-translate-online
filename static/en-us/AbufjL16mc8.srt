1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:02,740
Hello.
You all know Catherine.

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:04,270
We've been making the course together.

3
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:06,700
Today, we have a really
special guest for you.

4
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:10,290
Alice works for Google and
has been working there for-

5
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:11,200
>> 11 plus years.

6
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,100
>> 11 plus years.

7
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:17,220
So, we're going to talk about Alice's
journey in terms of her first interview,

8
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:22,770
how she solves bugs, and
some advice Alice would

9
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:28,300
give herself, from way back when, when
she was wanting to learn programming.

10
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:29,500
Shall we begin.

11
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:33,050
>> So, Alice, can you tell us
about your role at Google now?

12
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:35,220
>> Sure.
So, right now, I'm a TL for

13
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:36,320
a new project.

14
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,410
TL is for tech lead.

15
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:38,060
>> Oh, okay.

16
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:39,670
>> For a new project on Android.

17
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:43,090
It's in the very early stages so

18
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:45,940
I can't really talk about
exactly what the project is.

19
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:46,611
>> [LAUGH]
>> Wow.

20
00:00:46,611 --> 00:00:48,341
>> But I can tell you a little bit about

21
00:00:48,341 --> 00:00:51,130
what I've been doing the last few years.

22
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:52,470
>> So,
let's start at the very beginning.

23
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:53,100
>> The very beginning.

24
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,920
>> So, you come in and
what happens the first few years.

25
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,930
>> So, the first six years at Google,
I was in AdWords, AdWords front end.

26
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:02,722
So, AdWords is basically
how Google makes money.

27
00:01:02,722 --> 00:01:04,072
So, when you do a Google search,

28
00:01:04,072 --> 00:01:06,009
all those ads that pop up
on the right hand side.

29
00:01:06,009 --> 00:01:08,903
So, I worked on, and AdWords back then,

30
00:01:08,903 --> 00:01:12,791
it was like the first group
at Google who was doing Java,

31
00:01:12,791 --> 00:01:17,286
all the other engineers were
C++ engineers, like on search.

32
00:01:17,286 --> 00:01:18,029
>> Oh, I didn't know that.

33
00:01:18,029 --> 00:01:20,908
>> Yes, so, we were the first Java team.

34
00:01:20,908 --> 00:01:25,034
And we set a lot of standards
about how Java was going to,

35
00:01:25,034 --> 00:01:30,371
setting the Java coding style, for
example, and what tools to use.

36
00:01:30,371 --> 00:01:31,994
So yeah, it was very fun.

37
00:01:31,994 --> 00:01:34,710
I think it was, back then, it was small.

38
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:38,150
I remember carrying the pager for
AdWords.

39
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:41,450
On weekends, all the engineers
take turns carrying the pagers.

40
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:45,022
So, if a server goes down,
you have to be prepared to log in,

41
00:01:45,022 --> 00:01:46,297
reboot the machine.

42
00:01:46,297 --> 00:01:49,675
It was before we had SREs.

43
00:01:49,675 --> 00:01:53,401
SREs means site reliability engineers,
I believe.

44
00:01:53,401 --> 00:01:54,040
>> Okay.

45
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:58,480
>> So, yeah, it was very different from-
>> I had never imagined that

46
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:01,400
when a server goes down
there are literally pagers

47
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:01,960
going off-
>> Oh yes.

48
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:04,770
>> In the background where people
are sort of hustling to try and

49
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:06,230
get the machine up again.

50
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:09,150
>> Yes, they can go off like
any time of the day, 4:00 AM.

51
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:09,720
>> Mm.
>> So,

52
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,668
it's kind of like
a doctor being on call.

53
00:02:11,668 --> 00:02:12,339
>> Mm-hm.

54
00:02:12,339 --> 00:02:15,790
I'd imagine that as
thrilling as it was for

55
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:19,350
you to get the job,
some parts of the job may be stressful.

56
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:22,510
Like this idea of this pager
is going to go off and

57
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:25,762
interrupt the fun that
you were perhaps having.

58
00:02:25,762 --> 00:02:29,962
Do you recall any instances where you
felt like this is really stressful and

59
00:02:29,962 --> 00:02:31,571
hard work that we are doing?

60
00:02:31,571 --> 00:02:34,747
>> So,
I think when I was on Android Gmail,

61
00:02:34,747 --> 00:02:39,530
I think that was actually pretty
stressful time of being TL.

62
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:44,770
>> Okay, so we moved on from AdWords, so
you're now doing Gmail, but for Android.

63
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:45,300
>> Android, yes.

64
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,960
>> Okay.
>> So, actually, Catherine and

65
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,840
I worked together on Android.

66
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,170
>> Oh, nice!
>> That's how we met,

67
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:50,470
that's [INAUDIBLE] together.

68
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:55,910
But, yes, so,
Android is very different from AdWords.

69
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:58,460
I think mainly because it's
a consumer product, so

70
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:03,640
it's just a different set of users,
it's a lot more users.

71
00:03:05,042 --> 00:03:11,318
And on Gmail particularly, because it's
one of the most used apps on Android,

72
00:03:11,318 --> 00:03:15,637
just the pure number of bugs
that we get is just insane.

73
00:03:15,637 --> 00:03:19,304
At Google we have this
thing called dog fooding.

74
00:03:19,304 --> 00:03:24,461
That means if your app is ready
to release, your new version,

75
00:03:24,461 --> 00:03:29,036
then you test it internally,
among all the Googlers.

76
00:03:29,036 --> 00:03:32,299
So you kind of dog food your own
products, eat your own dog food.

77
00:03:32,299 --> 00:03:38,107
And for Gmail, every time we dog
food a new version people will be so

78
00:03:38,107 --> 00:03:41,410
passionate and found so many bugs.

79
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:47,372
We move one button from top right corner
to the bottom right corner, and there

80
00:03:47,372 --> 00:03:53,250
will be like 20 people complaining about
it changes their work flow, for example.

81
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:58,125
So I think making those
decisions was really tough,

82
00:03:58,125 --> 00:04:01,020
because it's hard to find
a solution that pleases everyone.

83
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:04,070
>> So, it may be surprising for
some of our students to understand, but

84
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:08,950
this idea of feeling frustrated
because a bug has been encountered,

85
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:11,900
is not something just the novice
programmers are feeling.

86
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:16,730
Even expert programmers like you
Alice can get bogged down by them.

87
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:21,620
Do you have a strategy or tool you
follow when you say come across a bug?

88
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:23,230
>> So, it depends on the type of bug.

89
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:27,186
So, bugs can be very different,
the most I

90
00:04:27,186 --> 00:04:32,720
guess important or high priority
bugs are crashes, for example.

91
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,205
Your app is just not functional.

92
00:04:34,205 --> 00:04:36,945
And those are probably ones
that will get looked at first.

93
00:04:36,945 --> 00:04:39,735
They'll flag that as P0s or P1s, and

94
00:04:39,735 --> 00:04:42,980
also it depends on how
reproducible it is.

95
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:43,990
>> P, in that stands for
priority, I imagine.

96
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:45,534
>> Priority, exactly, yes.

97
00:04:45,534 --> 00:04:48,996
P0, P1, P2,
>> An engineer who received the bug,

98
00:04:48,996 --> 00:04:50,036
think of a bug, and

99
00:04:50,036 --> 00:04:53,938
what would be your strategy to going
about fixing something like that.

100
00:04:53,938 --> 00:04:58,710
>> Bug fixing is one of the most,
it's like a very easy way, or

101
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:00,640
quick way to feel like.

102
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:04,310
You fix this bug and it's very rewarding
because I can mark it as fixed and

103
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:06,160
it's like I accomplished something.

104
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,110
I think usually, first off,
is trying to reproduce it.

105
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:11,500
So, if it's reproducible,
then it's much easier to fix.

106
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,221
>> Mm-hm.

107
00:05:12,221 --> 00:05:14,743
>> The hardest bugs
are the non-producible ones,

108
00:05:14,743 --> 00:05:17,880
something that on Catherine's Android
device you saw, but

109
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,299
then on my phone I was
never able to reproduce.

110
00:05:20,299 --> 00:05:21,658
So, that's much harder.

111
00:05:21,658 --> 00:05:26,949
So, if it's reproducible,
then I can easily just look at the logs,

112
00:05:26,949 --> 00:05:29,518
ADB logcats on Android devices.

113
00:05:29,518 --> 00:05:32,398
And then see what happens.

114
00:05:32,398 --> 00:05:36,510
If it's a crash then there would
be a very obvious stack trace.

115
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:38,943
>> So, you're like an investigator,
you're looking at clues for

116
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:40,237
why this thing might be breaking?

117
00:05:40,237 --> 00:05:41,238
>> Exactly.
Yes.

118
00:05:41,238 --> 00:05:44,834
And Android bug reports
are actually notorious for

119
00:05:44,834 --> 00:05:47,599
being really cryptic and hard to read.

120
00:05:47,599 --> 00:05:48,516
Yes.

121
00:05:48,516 --> 00:05:50,834
>> It's not just us.

122
00:05:50,834 --> 00:05:52,680
[LAUGH] Oh no, yes.

123
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,048
>> I find them to be very verbose and
cryptic also.

124
00:05:55,048 --> 00:05:59,510
>> Yes, I think it's one of
the big challenges actually.

125
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:01,960
So, that's where experience comes in.

126
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,126
So, if you're an experienced
Android programmer,

127
00:06:04,126 --> 00:06:06,063
you know exactly which
keywords to search for.

128
00:06:06,063 --> 00:06:08,385
It's impossible to just
read line by line by line.

129
00:06:08,385 --> 00:06:13,100
I usually just like prep for or
search for certain keywords.

130
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:13,646
>> I see.
So,

131
00:06:13,646 --> 00:06:16,816
you're scanning through the entire
log and you're looking for

132
00:06:16,816 --> 00:06:18,360
keywords that you can Google.

133
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,258
>> Yes.
>> Okay,

134
00:06:19,258 --> 00:06:21,901
why are you Googling these things?

135
00:06:21,901 --> 00:06:25,210
>> Well, I do a search locally,
just like a find.

136
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:29,820
But Google comes in handy because
often if there is an error and

137
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:33,350
it's something I'm not familiar with,
it could be like Android Framework doing

138
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:37,275
some illegal state exception or
something that I've never seen before.

139
00:06:37,275 --> 00:06:38,563
>> Mm-hm.
>> So, the first thing I would do is

140
00:06:38,563 --> 00:06:39,283
actually Google it.

141
00:06:39,283 --> 00:06:39,841
>> Okay.

142
00:06:39,841 --> 00:06:43,589
>> And yeah, and
usually on let's say, stack overflow,

143
00:06:43,589 --> 00:06:48,240
there's almost always somebody
else who has encountered the same.

144
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,749
>> Is to follow similar processes.

145
00:06:49,749 --> 00:06:51,218
>> Yeah.
>> Where they find a bug,

146
00:06:51,218 --> 00:06:54,172
they try to identify a key word
that they can search on Google?

147
00:06:54,172 --> 00:06:54,787
>> Yes.

148
00:06:54,787 --> 00:06:57,640
>> And try and interpret those results,
and try and fix the bug.

149
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:00,832
Now, what's really satisfying,
at least for me as a teacher,

150
00:07:00,832 --> 00:07:04,560
here to learn is that the process that
we're teaching our students is being

151
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,242
followed by an expert 11
years into their program.

152
00:07:07,242 --> 00:07:08,193
>> Yeah, yes.

153
00:07:08,193 --> 00:07:10,990
[LAUGH]
>> And you mentioned a statement which

154
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:15,196
was really emphatic to me, which is,
if I don't know something.

155
00:07:15,196 --> 00:07:16,135
>> Mm-hm.

156
00:07:16,135 --> 00:07:19,544
>> And that's really important to
understand, that even after 11 years of

157
00:07:19,544 --> 00:07:22,570
expertise, there are so
many things that one might not know.

158
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:24,755
>> Yes,
it's impossible to know everything.

159
00:07:24,755 --> 00:07:30,410
And, yeah, I realize, there's something
new to learn every day actually,

160
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:34,580
and at my job I feel like I do indeed
learn something new every day.
