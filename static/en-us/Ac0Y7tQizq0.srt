1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,960
Here, the solution was negative infinite to negative 3 or 1 half to positive

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:10,320
infinity. Nice algebra skills if you got these two integrals. To begin to solve

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,649
this quadratic inequality, we want to subtract 3 from both sides. So we have 0

4
00:00:14,649 --> 00:00:19,614
on the left and the quadratic expression on the right. We can flip the entire

5
00:00:19,614 --> 00:00:26,170
inequality around, so we'll have 2y squared plus 5y minus 3 is greater than 0.

6
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:30,035
These two statements here are exactly the same. They're just written in the

7
00:00:30,035 --> 00:00:34,954
reverse order. Once we have this inequality, we want to find the 0s. If we find

8
00:00:34,954 --> 00:00:40,000
the 0s, we can set up our number line with three intervals. So we'll factor the

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,757
left-hand side of the equation to get 2y minus 1 times y plus 3. We set each

10
00:00:44,757 --> 00:00:50,592
factor equal to 0 and we solve for the values of y over here. In this case, y

11
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:55,229
could equal 1 half, and in this case, y could equal negative 3. We use positive

12
00:00:55,229 --> 00:01:00,243
1 half and negative 3 to create the intervals on our number line. For interval

13
00:01:00,243 --> 00:01:05,348
I, we'll try the number y equals negative 5. When we substitute negative 5 in

14
00:01:05,348 --> 00:01:11,226
for y, we'll get the statement 22 is greater than 0. We know this is true, so

15
00:01:11,226 --> 00:01:16,258
this is included for our solution set. For interval II, we'll try the number y

16
00:01:16,258 --> 00:01:21,747
equals 0. When we plug in 0 for y, we'll be left with negative 3 greater than

17
00:01:21,747 --> 00:01:26,403
0. We know this is not true, so any of these numbers within this region are not

18
00:01:26,403 --> 00:01:31,180
part of our solution. And finally, for the third interval, we can try the

19
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:37,620
number y equals 1. When we plug in 1 for y, we'll get 4 greater than 0. This is

20
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:41,650
a true statement, so we can include these values as part of our solution set.

21
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:45,544
We use parentheses at negative 3 and positive 1 half, since we need to be

22
00:01:45,544 --> 00:01:51,922
greater than 0, we can't be equal to it. So our final solution is negative

23
00:01:51,922 --> 00:01:56,370
infinity to negative 3 or 1 half to positive infinity.
