1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:01,942
Okay.
For displayName, well,

2
00:00:01,942 --> 00:00:03,325
that's a String Property.

3
00:00:03,325 --> 00:00:04,620
[INAUDIBLE] There, right?

4
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:07,755
Names are strings, and datastore
supports Unicode strings just fine.

5
00:00:07,755 --> 00:00:11,410
MainEmail, well,
that's another String Property.

6
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:14,120
Later on, you might want to subclass
String Property to make sure that we're

7
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:16,320
only storing valid
email addresses there.

8
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,820
But for now, String Property is the
correct type for this, and teeShirtSize.

9
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,070
At this point,
this may not be any kind of surprise.

10
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:24,670
This will also be a String Property.

11
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:28,740
Even though this is an enum in the API,
to the datastore, it's just a string.

12
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:30,570
So, not too much variety here.

13
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:32,075
Everything ended up
being a String Property.

14
00:00:32,075 --> 00:00:35,260
But we've made some progress defining
our app, and that's awesome.

15
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:38,372
The code for this is going to go
into the file called models.py.

16
00:00:38,372 --> 00:00:41,445
The name indicates just where we're
going to put our data models.

17
00:00:41,445 --> 00:00:43,255
You already saw this in
the previous lesson when I

18
00:00:43,255 --> 00:00:44,955
introduced the profile class.

19
00:00:44,955 --> 00:00:47,122
Now, back to Magnus for
some more about datastore keys.
