1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:03,540
Android Studio is an incredibly
powerful piece of software.

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:05,630
It has an editor with
sophisticated code completion,

3
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:07,670
and static analysis features.

4
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:10,780
It also has a suite of tools for
integrating with Android devices and

5
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:11,800
emulators.

6
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:15,510
The one thing it doesn't have, however,
is an integrated build system.

7
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:19,370
Android Studio delegates the entire
build process to Gradle.

8
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:21,500
That's everything that happens
to turn your sources and

9
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,500
resources into an APK that you
can install on your device.

10
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,560
Gradle itself doesn't inherently
know anything about Android.

11
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,220
That capability's provided by Google in
the form of an Android Gradle plugin.

12
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:37,340
Android Studio is actually happy to
import and work with any Gradle project.

13
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:39,720
We can use it to do all
sorts of interesting things,

14
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:43,089
like build Java libraries or deploy
a backend service to Google App Engine.

15
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:46,630
Even though Android Studio
isn't building your project,

16
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:48,940
it still needs a deep
model of your project, so

17
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:52,180
it can provide features like code
completion, and auto importing.

18
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:54,916
It maintains its own internal
model of your project, and

19
00:00:54,916 --> 00:00:57,709
when a project is loaded or
a Gradle build script changes,

20
00:00:57,709 --> 00:01:02,180
Android Studio needs to synchronize its
internal model with Gradle's model.

21
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:04,190
When you get a "failed to sync" message,

22
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:06,660
it usually means you've just got
an error in one of your build scripts.
