00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:03,600
The first thing I want to say about
high performance computing is that it's

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,200
the dumbest name ever.

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,900
I mean, like seriously?

4
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:09,790
High performance?

5
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:11,453
As opposed to what exactly?

6
00:00:11,453 --> 00:00:13,977
Low performance?

7
00:00:13,977 --> 00:00:15,781
Unfavourable performance?

8
00:00:15,781 --> 00:00:17,653
Sober performance?

9
00:00:17,653 --> 00:00:21,840
2.5 out of 4 stars performance?

10
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,510
So I went and I talked to a bunch of my
colleagues from all over the world, and

11
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:26,898
I asked each one of them,
what do you think about HPC?

12
00:00:26,898 --> 00:00:31,588
One of them, John Shalf, from Lawrence
Berkeley National Labs, had this to say.

13
00:00:31,588 --> 00:00:33,933
>> Well first off,
I like to call it super computing.

14
00:00:33,933 --> 00:00:36,840
HPC sounds kind of boring.

15
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,980
Super computing, now that is compelling.

16
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:41,850
>> Well said, John.

17
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:43,290
I couldn't agree more.

18
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:44,995
So with that, let's go super compute.

19
00:00:44,995 --> 00:00:46,144
[SOUND]
