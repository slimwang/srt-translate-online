00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,950
Let's come at this from the bottom up, in terms of the atomic elements out of

2
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:07,920
which connectors are built. The base element is called,

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:12,850
in the meta-paper, ducts, as in air-conditioning ducts. Okay? This,

4
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:17,120
this is the channel, has no associated behavior, with it.

5
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:19,810
It could, for example, be some kind of internet connection. Or

6
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:25,315
it could be all on one machine in terms of the underlying electronics.

7
00:00:25,315 --> 00:00:28,280
It could be provided by the program language implementation, for

8
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:32,720
example in a virtual machine. It could be the operating system through some kind

9
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:36,980
of system call. Okay? Or it could be an inter machine communication, for

10
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:43,350
example with sockets. Ducts provide the mechanisms for transmitting the data,

11
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:46,650
and it could also be control information among the components.

12
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:51,940
Connectors go beyond ducts, by providing the protocol used by the ducts for

13
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:54,710
doing that communication. That is the sequence of interactions.

14
00:00:55,720 --> 00:01:00,110
In addition to ducts, connectors may include internal mechanisms. For example,

15
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:04,849
some storage,uh, like, like would be used for buffers. Or computation,

16
00:01:04,849 --> 00:01:06,990
computational elements such as might be involved if you,

17
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:11,640
if the, if the connector were fighting some kind of translation capability.
