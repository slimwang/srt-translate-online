1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
And the answer is 0.0333 or a 1/3 and now we're going to

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
apply the entire arsenal of inference we just learned about.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:18,000
The joint probability of cancer and positive is 0.1 * 0.9. That's the joint that's not normalized.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
So let's normalize it and we normalize it by the sum of the joint

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
for cancer and the joint for non-cancer.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Joint for cancer we just computed but the joint for non-cancer assumes the opposite prior 1-0.1

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
and it applies the positive result of a non-cancer case.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Now because the specificity first is negative, we have to do the

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
same trick as before and multiply it with 1-0.8.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:01:00,000
When you worked this out, you find this to be 0 to 0.9 divided 0 to 0.9 + 0.9 * 0.2 that is 0.18

11
00:01:00,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So if you put these all of this together, you get exactly a third.
