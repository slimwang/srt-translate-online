1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,750
So would you should have noticed is that
the data you entered ended up missing.

2
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:06,280
So their current knowledge,

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:10,650
the information always saved in our app
only lasts as long as the app is around.

4
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:12,000
So if we close the app,

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,020
then all the information
the application will be cleared out.

6
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:18,100
Remember this is because the system
will begin clearing up memory.

7
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:21,640
So closing up apps, if we haven't
gone back to them in a while,

8
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:24,360
in order to make room for
apps that currently need that memory.
