00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,738
You've just practiced with Sara how to find the public interface of another

2
00:00:03,738 --> 00:00:08,386
class, now let's go back to our car class. We had discovered the public

3
00:00:08,386 --> 00:00:13,240
interface that you see over here and now our goal is to implement it. So

4
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:17,834
imagine a car object and let's have a look at the add gas method. We're adding

5
00:00:17,834 --> 00:00:21,254
a certain amount of gas and what should that do to the car. Well, remember,

6
00:00:21,254 --> 00:00:24,956
it's not a real car and it's not real gas. This car is just an object in a

7
00:00:24,956 --> 00:00:29,670
computer, and it remembers some information. In particular, in order to add

8
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:34,660
gas, the car needs to remember how much gas it has. In Java, you use variables

9
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:39,365
to remember anything. And here's is how you write such a variable, a variable

10
00:00:39,365 --> 00:00:42,704
has a name just like the variables that you've seen in the previous lesson as

11
00:00:42,704 --> 00:00:47,704
well as a type. And then there is this key word private here that simply means

12
00:00:47,704 --> 00:00:52,495
that the variables of an object are a part of the private implementation. The

13
00:00:52,495 --> 00:00:56,043
programmer who uses the public interface doesn't need to know about that. You

14
00:00:56,043 --> 00:00:59,760
will always want to declare instance variables as private. Let me tell you why

15
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,805
they're called instance variables. Let's have a look at another car object, or

16
00:01:03,805 --> 00:01:08,176
as we say, another instance of the car class. Of course, it also needs to

17
00:01:08,176 --> 00:01:12,046
remember how much gas it has. And the amount of gas that this object has will

18
00:01:12,046 --> 00:01:17,043
be different from the amount of gas of the other object. So each of these

19
00:01:17,043 --> 00:01:20,103
objects, or each of these instances of the car class needs to have its own

20
00:01:20,103 --> 00:01:24,303
variable to store that information. That's what it means to be an instance

21
00:01:24,303 --> 00:01:28,709
variable. It's a variable that occurs in every instance of the class. Now

22
00:01:28,709 --> 00:01:32,980
there's another thing that each car object should remember, namely its mileage.

23
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:36,792
Here's how you can define the variable, we give it a name, miles driven. It's

24
00:01:36,792 --> 00:01:41,179
type, it's again a number. And once again, each instance of the car class has

25
00:01:41,179 --> 00:01:46,496
its own value, so it needs its own copy of that variable. These are the two

26
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:50,060
instance variables that we need for the car class. You will soon see how the

27
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:54,794
methods of the car class update or read those instance variables. But first, go

28
00:01:54,794 --> 00:01:58,250
ahead and practice with Sarah how to discover the instance variables that we

29
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:00,560
need for the person class.
