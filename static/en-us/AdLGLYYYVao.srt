1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:06,726
Again, if 0.1% is out here, then this must mean that this yellow or orange

2
00:00:06,726 --> 00:00:14,114
region is 99.9%. So that means we're going to look for 0.999 in our z table.

3
00:00:14,114 --> 00:00:23,630
Here's 0.999 and that's at 3.10. You'll notice that there are a few 0.999's. We

4
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:28,830
want the first one, because that's the one that's closed to 0.999. And then the

5
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:33,332
others will just get bigger. So this one's 0.99905, I don't know, something

6
00:00:33,332 --> 00:00:39,550
like that, we can't really tell. But we know that this first one is going to be

7
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:48,124
closest to just plain old 0.999. And so that is at 3.08.
