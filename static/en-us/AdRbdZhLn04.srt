00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,730
The grammar of graphics is a formalism surrounding the principles of

2
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:05,850
creating visualizations.

3
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:09,540
Leland Wilkinson invented the theory in his seminal book,

4
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:11,916
the Grammar of Graphics in 1999.

5
00:00:11,916 --> 00:00:15,500
To make reasoning and thinking about graphics and charts easier.

6
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,696
You might be asking yourself, what exactly do you mean,

7
00:00:18,696 --> 00:00:22,434
when you say the grammar of of graphics is a visualization theory?

8
00:00:22,434 --> 00:00:26,834
I thought visualizations had to be physical, with lines,

9
00:00:26,834 --> 00:00:31,059
circles, axis, and represents some underlying data.

10
00:00:31,059 --> 00:00:35,519
Well, Leland Wilkinson invented this theory in his seminal book titled by

11
00:00:35,519 --> 00:00:40,320
the same name to make reasoning and thinking about graphics easier.

12
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,700
Think of it as defining a set of best practices for

13
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:47,180
developing and iterating on a data visualization.

14
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:50,170
At its most fundamental level,

15
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:55,240
the grammar of graphics makes a distinction to separate content from aesthetic.

16
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:59,450
Or in our case our data from our visual presentation of it.

17
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:04,000
Now this may not seem like a groundbreaking theory but before the grammar of

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,970
graphics researchers, artists, and developers often coupled the information they

19
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:12,870
were trying to communicate very tightly with their medium of communication.
