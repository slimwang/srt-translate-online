1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Let's start with the output of that software.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
For reference, this is the result of the forward Euler method with a step size of half a day.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
You already saw that the Euler method had step sizes of 2 or more.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
But there's a price to pay for the stability of the backward Euler method.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
The code gets really complex as opposed to the code of the forward Euler method.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
You really do need pencil and paper to derive these equations. That's what we're going to do now.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
The equation for R, the number of recovered persons, is the easiest one.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
We'll start with that and to save space let me write under score 1 for the current quantities

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
and subscript 2 for the quantities of the next step.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
The forward Euler method would turn this into the following.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:51,000
The value of R one step later is the current value of R plus step size

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:58,000
times the current rate of change, which is 1/5 days times the current value of I.

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I₁ in my new notation.

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
This would be the forward Euler method but now we're concerned with the backward Euler method,

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,000
which means that we have to use the rate at the end of that step meaning I₂ has to go in here.

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
And now we're done. We know the current value of R.

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
We have computed the next value of I in the lines before,

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
and that's all we need to compute the next value of R.

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Next up is S. If we were using the forward Euler methods, this would work as follows.

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The next value of S is its current value plus the time step times its current rate of change

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:46,000
meaning -5x10⁻⁹ per day and person times I at the current step and S at the current step

22
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
if we were doing forward Euler.

23
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
But now that we're doing backward Euler, this has to be I one step after that

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
and S one step after that.

25
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:04,000
We bring this down to the left hand side because we're interested in S₂ and we factor out S₂.

26
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:12,000
So the factor of 1 times S₂ and now it's plus this coefficient times I₂ times S₂.

27
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:22,000
5x10⁻⁹ divided by day person I₂ and all that remains on the right hand side is S₁

28
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
and now that is simple to solve.

29
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:31,000
S₂ equals S₁ divided by the very same expression that we've got here.

30
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I'm lazy. I don't spell it out. This completes the computation of S₂ for which we need I₂.

31
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
But we have computed that in the line before.

32
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,000
And now the equation for the rate of change of I, the number of infectious persons.

33
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Those persons that is infected persons become infectious with a certain time constant

34
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
and infectious persons recover with another time constant.

35
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
If we were implementing forward Euler, it would be doing the following.

36
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I₂ the value of the next step equals the current value plus the time step

37
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:16,000
times the current rate of change, which is 1/1 day E₁ minus 1/5 days I₁

38
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
but now we want to implement the backward Euler method,

39
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:25,000
which means that we have to use the values for the next time step and this rate of change.

40
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I bring this term with the I₂ over to the left hand side and factor out the I₂.

41
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:35,000
This leaves me with one I₂ plus h times 1/5 days.

42
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:42,000
On the right hand side, I₁ remains and h times 1/1 day and E₂ remains.

43
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:48,000
And now we can divide by this expression and find I₂ equals the right hand side

44
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:57,000
divided by this expression I₁ plus h times 1/1 day times E₂ divided by this expression.

45
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
This completes the equation for I.

46
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
The main message here is that implicit methods come at a price.

47
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Solving these equations can get very ugly.

48
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:12,000
If you are convinced at this moment, you may want to skip the rest of the segment.

49
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Otherwise, stay with me to see how we can compute E₂,

50
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
which by the way is needed to be able to compute I₂.

51
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
A trick to find the value of E for the next time step

52
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
is to look at these two differential equations and parallel.

53
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
For the first one, the backward Euler method says the value for the next time step

54
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:38,000
is the value for the current time step plus the time step times our estimate of the rate of change

55
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:49,000
for the next time step which is 5x10⁻⁹ per day and person times I₂ S₂ backward Euler

56
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
minus 1/1 day E₂ backward Euler again and not E₁.

57
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,000
And for S the new value is the old one plus the time step times

58
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:10,000
minus our coefficient 5x10⁻⁹ per day and person times I₂ S₂ backward Euler again and that's it.

59
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:18,000
If you now form the sum of these two equations, you'll get E₂ plus S₂ equals E₁ plus S₁.

60
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
This ugly expression cancels with that ugly expression, and we are left with h times

61
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
minus 1/1 day E₂.

62
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
So this is what we have reached by now. E₁ the current value is known.

63
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:36,000
S₁ the current value is known. We want to determine E₂, the next value.

64
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
At this point, we do not yet know S₂.

65
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:46,000
But luckily enough, we derived an equation for S₂ to be for namely S₂ equals S₁ divided by

66
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:56,000
1 plus the step size times 5x10⁻⁹ divided by days and persons times I₂.

67
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:05,000
And we have an equation for I₂ that says I₂ equals I₁ plus step size times 1/1 day E₂

68
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,000
divided by 1 plus step size times 1/5 days.

69
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:16,000
If you use this equation to express I₂ and then insert this result as S₂,

70
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:25,000
you end up with an equation that contains E₂ and E₁ and S₁ and it can be solved for E₂.

71
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:31,000
E₂ appears in three places and with a little edge ??? you can turn the resulting equation

72
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:37,000
into a quadratic equation which is the standard solution formula for quadratic equations.

73
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
The result is what you see in the code.

74
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Hopefully, this is now really convincing that working with implicit servers

75
00:06:43,000 --> 99:59:59,999
requires quite some effort with pen and paper.
