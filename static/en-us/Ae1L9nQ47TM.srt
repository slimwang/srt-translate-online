00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:05,850
Think about this. Everything you see, hear, feel, taste, and touch all happen

2
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:12,578
because of our nervous system. So every day, millions of sensory stimuli enter

3
00:00:12,578 --> 00:00:17,255
our brains. Our brains interpret those and allow us to engage in our behaviors

4
00:00:17,255 --> 00:00:22,704
and be successful. Every minute, thousands and thousands of neurons are firing,

5
00:00:22,704 --> 00:00:26,067
and it makes our behaviour seem fluid and effortless, when in fact it's

6
00:00:26,067 --> 00:00:31,838
actually quite complicated. Let's take a look at an everyday example that shows

7
00:00:31,838 --> 00:00:37,354
how our nervous system allows us to be successful human beings. Something

8
00:00:37,354 --> 00:00:41,738
amazing is about to happen. Lauren is about to see and then touch a dog, you

9
00:00:41,738 --> 00:00:47,494
may think amazing, how boring and everyday. But in fact, it really is an

10
00:00:47,494 --> 00:00:52,646
amazing process. Let's take a look at it a little more carefully. First, Lauren

11
00:00:52,646 --> 00:00:57,978
sees Sputnik. The light waves enter her eye, stimulate sensory neurons in the

12
00:00:57,978 --> 00:01:03,689
retina, which then send neuro impulses to the back of the brain. The visual

13
00:01:03,689 --> 00:01:08,375
cortex in the occipital lobe lobes or the information get interpreted and made

14
00:01:08,375 --> 00:01:13,607
sense of Sputnik. Next, Lauren decides to be friendly with Sputnik and reaches

15
00:01:13,607 --> 00:01:17,190
down to pet him. For that to happen, something else needs to happen in Lauren's

16
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:22,139
brain. It has to send a signal to the motor cortex involved in moving her hand

17
00:01:22,139 --> 00:01:27,499
to reach down and touch Sputnik. This impulse gets transmitted from the motor

18
00:01:27,499 --> 00:01:31,919
cortex in the frontal lobe to the arm via inter-neurons in the spinal cord, and

19
00:01:31,919 --> 00:01:37,373
motor neurons in the arm. Which contract muscles in the arm and move it back

20
00:01:37,373 --> 00:01:42,824
and forth. When she actually touches Sputnik, sensory neurons in her fingertips

21
00:01:42,824 --> 00:01:48,175
send neural signals back to her brain's sensory cortex. Here she has the

22
00:01:48,175 --> 00:01:53,512
conscious sensation of furriness. At each step in this process, hundreds of

23
00:01:53,512 --> 00:01:59,746
thousands of interconnected neurons are firing up to 200 times per second. This

24
00:01:59,746 --> 00:02:03,640
whole process, from when Lauren first sees Sputnik to petting him, lasts all of

25
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:08,651
a few seconds. But look at what took place in these two to three seconds, that

26
00:02:08,651 --> 00:02:12,769
allow for all of this to happen. Now, perhaps you can see why we call this

27
00:02:12,769 --> 00:02:14,599
every day event, amazing.
