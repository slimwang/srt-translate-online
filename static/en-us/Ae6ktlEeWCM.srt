2
00:00:06,745 --> 00:00:08,888
By using the Elsa model.

3
00:00:08,888 --> 00:00:12,320
So you want to create some events
inside of your organization.

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,510
This doesn't require a lot
of permission seeking.

5
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:20,710
What this requires is really
an understanding for the problem.

6
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:24,840
Some small scale experiments to try to
solve the problem and then some data

7
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:30,270
that you can share and so I love this
because it uses the model in the small.

8
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:33,450
You create a small event you
have some language around it and

9
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:37,320
you deliver that that event
back into your organization and

10
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,470
this will start to affect the structure.

11
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:44,590
I guarantee you if you lead
with the language of change.

12
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:47,990
The structure will not give way.

13
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:52,680
So it's very very hard to get the kind
of agency that you that need to do

14
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:58,730
the whole thing when you haven't
started with even the very basics.

15
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:02,480
So oftentimes people feel when they
share this the first response is,

16
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,950
man I've got to do something.

17
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:06,430
What I really want to do is
I want to convince people.

18
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:08,070
I want to get them to
change their attitude.

19
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:13,690
Well, attitude changes is good,
but it's hard.

20
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:16,720
And it's maybe the least effective
in terms of how we can change

21
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,150
how we can move behavior.

22
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:22,090
So my favorite example of this is I
wanted to become a marathon runner.

23
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:27,270
So I went out and I bought the shoes and
I bought the outfit and

24
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:31,080
I really developed this strong
attitude that I'm going to be awesome.

25
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,780
And then I sat on the couch and
I ate Lucky Charms and

26
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:38,740
I watched a lot of marathons in my
new shoes and my new running outfit.

27
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:43,450
What changed was my attitude but
what didn't change was my behavior.

28
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:46,930
And so
the event helps to shape two things.

29
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:48,950
It provides language
to talk about it but

30
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:52,130
it actually gives us a vision of what
good looks like and it gets us started.

31
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:54,400
I think it's BJ Fogg
who talks about this,

32
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:57,790
if you want to be a runner,
you need to hire a running coach.

33
00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:01,260
You might need shoes too, like you might
need a cool outfit, but the first thing

34
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:03,600
you do is you need someone who's
going to show up at your house.

35
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,590
And take you running and I think the
same idea works inside the organization.

36
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:11,910
Find some small area of
improvement that you can do.

37
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:17,630
Do it and then share that
result with the organization.

38
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:18,560
I wouldn't go big or

39
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,100
broad and I wouldn't spend a lot
of time trying to convince.
