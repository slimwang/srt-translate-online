00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,618
Now that we have the standard error, lets calculate the t-statistic. Calculate

2
00:00:04,618 --> 00:00:08,950
the positive value. So lets do the average number of shoes owned by females

3
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:14,280
minus that for males, and then divide it by the standard error. What do you

4
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:14,730
get?
