1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:03,020
For this quiz I want you
to make a prediction.

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:08,020
What will happen to performance if you
change the styles of different elements?

3
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:12,120
Will the performance cost of changing
styles stay the same no matter how many

4
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:13,200
elements you have?

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,120
Will the performance cost go up
linearly with the number of elements?

6
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:20,060
Will the performance cost go up
exponentially with the number of

7
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:22,610
elements, or does it just totally vary

8
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:26,500
in that the performance cost is just
random with the number of elements?

9
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:27,630
Pick one of these four answers.
