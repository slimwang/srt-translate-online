00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
There is a solution. The solution is to fake it or more precisely to add fake data.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
So what I'll ask you to do is to take the original data for the coin,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
and add two fake data pointsâ€”one heads and one tails.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
So if my data was a single observation of heads, give me first the maximum likelihood estimate.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
And in the second box, give me an estimator that has one fake data point.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
And on this fake data, apply its maximum likelihood.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So this is the one without fake data. This is the one with the fake data.
