1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,119
We know that the vertex is a special point on a parabola. Because if you

2
00:00:04,119 --> 00:00:08,864
remember, there's a line of symmetry that runs right through the center of the

3
00:00:08,864 --> 00:00:13,076
vertex, and divides the parabola in 2. We saw that tangent lines on opposite

4
00:00:13,076 --> 00:00:16,918
sides of the parabola at the same vertical position have opposite slopes. In

5
00:00:16,918 --> 00:00:20,818
other words, if we folded this parabola in half, down this side of the line, the

6
00:00:20,818 --> 00:00:24,238
two halves this is divided in two right now, would match one and other

7
00:00:24,238 --> 00:00:28,176
perfectly. Let's see if we can make any other general statements about the

8
00:00:28,176 --> 00:00:31,956
behavior of the function on this side of the graph versus on this side the

9
00:00:31,956 --> 00:00:36,505
graph. For a moment, let's just look at this right half. The corner for the

10
00:00:36,505 --> 00:00:41,243
vertex as I showed you in the last problem were negative 0.75 and negative 2.25.

11
00:00:41,243 --> 00:00:45,787
So for now we're just going to only consider the domain in the region where x is

12
00:00:45,787 --> 00:00:50,394
greater than negative 0.75. As you can tell on the right side of the graph, as x

13
00:00:50,394 --> 00:00:54,596
gets bigger, f of x gets bigger as well. So I'd like you to complete this

14
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:59,338
sentence property. On the interval of the domain negative 0.75 to infinity, so

15
00:00:59,338 --> 00:01:03,977
in other words, this half of the graph we've been talking about. What is

16
00:01:03,977 --> 00:01:09,441
happening to the value of the function? Is f of x increasing, decreasing, or

17
00:01:09,441 --> 00:01:14,637
constant? So remember that we read graphs from left to right, so this is asking,

18
00:01:14,637 --> 00:01:19,411
what is happening to the behavior of f of x, of the value of the function, the

19
00:01:19,411 --> 00:01:23,716
dependent variable, as the independent variable x, increases?
