00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:04,350
The answer to this is yes, because
with the split device driver model

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:07,620
we are consolidating
all of the request for

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:13,150
device access to the surface VM,
where we can make better decisions and

4
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:17,950
enforce stronger policies in
terms of how the device is share.

5
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:22,830
Without perhaps relying to specific
support for desired behavior,

6
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:26,630
for desired sharing behavior
on the actual physical device.
