I'm here at the Autodesk Gallery today in San Francisco. There are some really

2
00:00:04,158 --> 00:00:07,460
great objects here that have been made with the aid of computer graphics. Jesse

00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:11,194
Harrington Au is here today to explain what these objects are about. So Jesse,

4
00:00:11,194 --> 00:00:14,108
first of all, what's your background? >> : So, my background's actually in

5
00:00:14,108 --> 00:00:17,790
industrial design. A long time ago, I was an illustrator. And then I started

6
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:21,309
doing these crazy exhibits, and weird things in warehouses. Started getting

7
00:00:21,309 --> 00:00:24,522
involved very early on in the maker movement and then went back to school for

8
00:00:24,522 --> 00:00:28,760
industrial design. Started doing product design, then do a little exhibit design

9
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:33,080
and that's fortunate enough to get picked up by autodesk. And where I get to

10
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:36,765
make a bunch of cool stuff around young entrepreneurs everyday in a place called

11
00:00:36,765 --> 00:00:37,263
tech shop.
