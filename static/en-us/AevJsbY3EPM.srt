We can transform the equation, Y equals X squared plus 5x plus 6. Using

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:10,576
completing the square, to instead read, y plus 1 over 4 equals x plus 5 over 2

3
00:00:10,576 --> 00:00:15,916
squared. The first step that I do is make sure that what's on the right hand

4
00:00:15,916 --> 00:00:21,042
side isn't already the square of binomial. Which is, if you remember, the form

5
00:00:21,042 --> 00:00:25,023
that we want the right-hand side of the equation to be. You should always check

6
00:00:25,023 --> 00:00:28,768
this first just to make sure you don't do a ton of unnecessary work. Anyway I

7
00:00:28,768 --> 00:00:32,424
subtract 6 from both sides. Then I figure out what term I need to add on to x

8
00:00:32,424 --> 00:00:36,268
squared plus 5 x to make this the perfect square of two terms added together,

9
00:00:36,268 --> 00:00:37,457
and then I just factor.
