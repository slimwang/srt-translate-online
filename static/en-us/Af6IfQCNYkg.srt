1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:05,666
It sounds like being able to decide on a good topology involves being able

2
00:00:05,666 --> 00:00:09,123
to analyze what the performance of one topology is.

3
00:00:09,123 --> 00:00:13,693
So does Storm provide like real-time analytics.

4
00:00:13,693 --> 00:00:14,395
>> Real-time analytics.

5
00:00:14,395 --> 00:00:17,649
>> For when you want to run a topology.

6
00:00:17,649 --> 00:00:20,301
>> Yeah, I mean we certainly have that.

7
00:00:20,301 --> 00:00:20,832
>> Okay.

8
00:00:20,832 --> 00:00:25,969
>> But not in using Storm, but we have this separate stack that allows you to

9
00:00:25,969 --> 00:00:29,305
know how much resources each instance is taking.

10
00:00:29,305 --> 00:00:30,601
>> I agree.

11
00:00:30,601 --> 00:00:34,346
>> Memory as well as JVM, and how much CPU is being used, how many

12
00:00:34,346 --> 00:00:38,975
tuples are emitted and consumed, how much time is spent on each one of them.

13
00:00:38,975 --> 00:00:40,754
We have a whole can of metrics that you can look at it.

14
00:00:40,754 --> 00:00:41,380
>> Okay.

15
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:45,450
>> So that if there are some problems, then it's an issue, yeah.

16
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:48,523
>> But then you're saying it's external to Storm itself.

17
00:00:48,523 --> 00:00:50,098
>> That is external to Storm, yes.

18
00:00:50,098 --> 00:00:50,958
>> Okay.

19
00:00:50,958 --> 00:00:52,299
>> Yeah.

20
00:00:52,299 --> 00:00:53,193
And that is a,

21
00:00:53,193 --> 00:00:57,602
that is a good way to see barely work, especially we use for topology.

22
00:00:57,602 --> 00:00:58,337
>> Right.

23
00:00:58,337 --> 00:01:02,818
>> Because, I mean, a lot of teams like yours, when you write the topologies and

24
00:01:02,818 --> 00:01:06,535
evaluated we have some issues here we don't know how to figure out.

25
00:01:06,535 --> 00:01:10,250
Then we look at these huge humongous charts to figure out, okay, there it is.

26
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:10,830
This is the issue.

27
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:11,600
>> Yeah.

28
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:15,850
>> And one other problem that we face often is distributed debugging.

29
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:19,100
Especially with this case of running on so many nodes.

30
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:22,390
Then if one bolt is misbehaving how do you figure out which bolt is

31
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:23,260
misbehaving, right?

32
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:24,960
So that's very hard to do.

33
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,425
So, one of the things that we, and

34
00:01:27,425 --> 00:01:31,678
Storm architecture also makes it more complex, because of

35
00:01:31,678 --> 00:01:37,308
the fact that the Storm workers are running multiple tasks in a single worker.

36
00:01:37,308 --> 00:01:41,396
So when I see the logs that you get, because each one can have a log,

37
00:01:41,396 --> 00:01:42,937
a JVM based log, right.

38
00:01:42,937 --> 00:01:46,557
All the logs are kind of an aggregation of

39
00:01:46,557 --> 00:01:50,280
logs coming from these separate tasks.

40
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:53,580
So I don't know which one is spewing what logs, right.

41
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:56,090
So it's very hard to debug that.

42
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:56,770
>> Yeah.

43
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:58,200
>> So and, so because of that,

44
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:03,280
we have come up with an analytic system called log indexing, so that

45
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:08,740
all the logs that we produce about these topologies are indexed separately so

46
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:13,052
that I'm, each task is given a unique ID and the topology name is unique.

47
00:02:13,052 --> 00:02:15,651
And you have [INAUDIBLE] topology name, this task, this task,

48
00:02:15,651 --> 00:02:18,468
then to bring up the log that is pointing to that.

49
00:02:18,468 --> 00:02:21,330
So at a one single place I can go and take a look at it.

50
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:23,256
Otherwise it becomes very hard to even debug anything.

51
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:28,610
And you can spend hours and even days to debug a particular issue.

52
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:30,420
And sometimes, you are not able to even figure that out.
