00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,791
The next topic I want to talk about is voting.

2
00:00:02,791 --> 00:00:06,070
Voting involves lots of cryptographic issues

3
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:08,256
and there are many interesting security

4
00:00:08,256 --> 00:00:09,822
properties that a voting system should

5
00:00:09,822 --> 00:00:11,970
provide. One property that many voting

6
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:16,070
systems desire to provide is anonymity that

7
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:17,854
it shouldn’t be possible for an adversary to

8
00:00:17,854 --> 00:00:21,221
know who someone voted for. The other

9
00:00:21,221 --> 00:00:23,487
property a voting system should have is that

10
00:00:23,487 --> 00:00:26,052
the count is verifiable. These are shorter

11
00:00:26,052 --> 00:00:28,106
than opposition. Verifying the count would

12
00:00:28,106 --> 00:00:30,493
be easy as each voter would be willing to

13
00:00:30,493 --> 00:00:32,491
publicly declare their vote and someone

14
00:00:32,491 --> 00:00:35,195
could look at all of those votes. But if you

15
00:00:35,195 --> 00:00:37,104
want to keep the votes anonymous and

16
00:00:37,104 --> 00:00:39,438
have a notion of private ballot, well then

17
00:00:39,438 --> 00:00:42,451
verifying the count becomes more challenging.

18
00:00:42,451 --> 00:00:45,004
Another property some voting systems want to provide

19
00:00:45,004 --> 00:00:47,584
is coercion-resistance. What this really means is that a

20
00:00:47,584 --> 00:00:51,219
voter can't prove who they voted for if votes are secret

21
00:00:51,219 --> 00:00:54,486
and there is no way to prove for whom one votes, well

22
00:00:54,486 --> 00:00:57,736
then, there is no way to coerce the voter into voting a

23
00:00:57,736 --> 00:01:00,224
particular way.

24
00:01:00,224 --> 00:01:04,146
And then we have all the usual goals of reliability

25
00:01:04,146 --> 00:01:07,986
and security. These things are hard to achieve.

26
00:01:07,986 --> 00:01:09,686
There are good ways to achieve them with

27
00:01:09,686 --> 00:01:13,289
paper ballots if we have trusted ballot boxes

28
00:01:13,289 --> 00:01:16,704
guarded by trusted election officials and if we

29
00:01:16,704 --> 00:01:19,021
have enough trusted third-parties, well maybe

30
00:01:19,021 --> 00:01:21,421
we can trust them to report the right tally.

31
00:01:21,421 --> 00:01:22,792
We’re going to look at one interesting cryptographic

32
00:01:22,792 --> 00:01:26,392
way to do voting, but I want to emphasize that this is

33
00:01:26,392 --> 00:01:29,544
not a solution to the real problems that are

34
00:01:29,544 --> 00:01:32,775
necessary to running election. But it solves this

35
00:01:32,775 --> 00:01:35,175
issue of can you keep votes anonymous and still

36
00:01:35,175 --> 00:01:37,864
have a way to verify that the count is correct.
