00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,352
If we plot these 3 critical numbers on our number line, you can see that they

2
00:00:04,352 --> 00:00:08,918
split the number line into 4 intervals. One to the left of negative 10, the one

3
00:00:08,918 --> 00:00:13,533
in between negative 10 and negative 2, the one between negative 2 and 2, and the

4
00:00:13,533 --> 00:00:15,922
one to the right of 2. So the answer is 4.
