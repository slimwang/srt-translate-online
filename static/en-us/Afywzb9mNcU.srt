1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:04,990
That concludes our lessons max
matching in bipartite graphs.

2
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:07,570
If the topic of matchings
is interesting to you.

3
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:10,160
I suggest exploring
matchings in general graph

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,250
instead of just the bipartite
ones we studied here.

5
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:15,070
And also taking a look at minimum cost

6
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:18,100
bipartite matchings in
the Hungarian algorithm.

7
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:20,060
