The purpose of ARP is to allow a

2
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:06,170
host to discover the Mac address corresponding to a

3
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:09,520
particular IP address. And the host doesn't know

4
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:12,760
which host on the LAN owns that particular Mac

5
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:15,550
address. So, ARP allows the host to send

6
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:18,990
a broadcast query asking about who owns a particular

7
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:22,250
IP address. And the response comes from the owner

8
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:25,390
of that particular IP address and the response is

9
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:26,160
the Mac address.
