00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,393
Now that you know how to implement methods, let's move on to constructors. You

2
00:00:03,393 --> 00:00:08,100
want to be able to create variations of objects. For example, a car that's very

3
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:13,100
fuel efficient or a car that is less so. In Java you use constructors to

4
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:17,805
initialize objects, here is an example. In the body of the constructor we

5
00:00:17,805 --> 00:00:21,748
simply initialize the instance variables. The first two here are set to a

6
00:00:21,748 --> 00:00:25,974
constant value. When a car is first created, it has not driven any miles and

7
00:00:25,974 --> 00:00:30,685
its tank is empty. This instance variable is set to a parameter, and that

8
00:00:30,685 --> 00:00:36,355
allows you to construct cars with different properties. Here, we construct a

9
00:00:36,355 --> 00:00:41,988
car with 60 miles per gallon. The value 60 is passed into the parameter

10
00:00:41,988 --> 00:00:47,890
variable. And is then set the instance variable here. Over here we construct a

11
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:51,784
car with 5 miles per gallon and again, the 5 is passed into the parameter

12
00:00:51,784 --> 00:00:57,636
variable. And then used to initialize this instance variable. A couple of

13
00:00:57,636 --> 00:01:02,210
things to pay attention to, when you define the constructor, note the name.

14
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:05,864
It's the same as the class name. The class is called car, the constructor is

15
00:01:05,864 --> 00:01:11,114
called car. Also note that there's no return type at all not even void. The

16
00:01:11,114 --> 00:01:15,060
constructor is not a method. It does not return any value. Instead the job of

17
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:19,398
constructor is just to initialize the instance variables. You can have more

18
00:01:19,398 --> 00:01:23,196
than one constructor and you'll get a change to write one right now. Here is

19
00:01:23,196 --> 00:01:26,917
our constructor in BlueJ, you see the statements that we had just before,

20
00:01:26,917 --> 00:01:32,328
together with a couple of statements that set's the car's picture. Now this

21
00:01:32,328 --> 00:01:37,101
constructure always takes the same picture to construct the car. It would be

22
00:01:37,101 --> 00:01:40,759
much nicer if we could choose a different picture for every car, so let's do

23
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:46,334
that. I'd like you to write another constructure that takes two arguments, the

24
00:01:46,334 --> 00:01:51,920
fuel efficiency and the picture file to be used. Go ahead and do that in the

25
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,870
coding environment and submit your answer.
