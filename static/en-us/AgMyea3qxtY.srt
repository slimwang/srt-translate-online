00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:02,150
So the question for this quiz is, which of

2
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:05,380
the following will evaluate to negative 1. So here

3
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:08,500
we have the string test invoking find, passing in

00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:11,780
the string lowercase t. Here we have the string

test in double quotes, using find to search for

6
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:18,660
the string st. Here we have the string test

7
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:21,530

8
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:25,570
