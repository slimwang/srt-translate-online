00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:01,066
In this lesson,

2
00:00:01,066 --> 00:00:04,640
we will first discuss the IP layer
security protocol called IPSec.

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:07,850
We will cover the main
mechanisms of IPSec.

4
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:10,660
And the Internet key exchange
protocol that is used to set up

5
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:12,550
the IPSec security parameters.

6
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:16,030
We will then briefly discuss
the transport layer security protocol.

7
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:19,420
These protocols are based on
the cryptographic operations and

8
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:22,950
security protocols that we have
covered in previous lessons.
