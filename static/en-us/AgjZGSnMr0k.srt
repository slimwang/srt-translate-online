00:00:00,215 --> 00:00:02,630
Let's take a look at
the life cycle of APT.

2
00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:06,630
It starts by identifying
the attack target.

3
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:11,570
For example, the target can be
a automobile or aerospace company.

4
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:15,230
Then, the attacker will research
about the target, in particular,

5
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:19,590
obtaining information about a target
organization, that can help the attack.

6
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:21,950
For example, using network scanning and

7
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:26,010
analysis, the attacker can learn
the target organization's network, and

8
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:29,500
therefore, the vulnerabilities
of his network services.

9
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:33,550
Such as, the possible security
flaws of it's web servers.

10
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:36,160
And by researching the web,
the attacker can also

11
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:40,810
learn the organization's C level
executives and their email addresses.

12
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:45,790
For example, many companies list their
C level executives on their webpages.

13
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:47,210
And once you know their names,

14
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:51,528
it is not hard to find their email
addresses by doing some web search.

15
00:00:51,528 --> 00:00:54,520
Then, the attacker code can
develop a method to penetrate

16
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,250
the organization's network.

17
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:59,990
He can make sure that the attack
will go through, without detection,

18
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:03,880
by utilizing the knowledge he has
learned about the organization.

19
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:07,525
For example, the attacker can
exploit a new vulnerability

20
00:01:07,525 --> 00:01:09,445
of the organization's web server.

21
00:01:09,445 --> 00:01:12,965
And since, the vulnerability is
unknown to the security community,

22
00:01:12,965 --> 00:01:17,605
the network defenses at the organization
won't be able to detect this exploit.

23
00:01:17,605 --> 00:01:19,372
Or, the attacker can send a so

24
00:01:19,372 --> 00:01:24,530
called deficit email to the chief
marketing officer of the organization.

25
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:28,240
It is called, spear fishing,
because the attacker has spent time

26
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,050
learning about the organization and
the individual.

27
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:33,800
And so,
the email would appear to be legitimate.

28
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:39,380
Once the the exploit succeeds, now the
APT has a foothold in the organization.

29
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:42,450
It can then communicate back
to the attacker, for example,

30
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:46,980
it can accept new malware updates,
receive commands, et cetera.

31
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:50,410
For example, it can now exfiltrate
valuable data, such as,

32
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:52,220
the design of a new airplane.

33
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:57,076
The APT will try not to raise any
suspicion, so that it can go undetected.

34
00:01:57,076 --> 00:02:00,425
For example, he wouldonly exfiltrate
data from the server only,

35
00:02:00,425 --> 00:02:04,075
only when there are other legitimate
network connections, from that server,

36
00:02:04,075 --> 00:02:05,605
to the Internet.

37
00:02:05,605 --> 00:02:06,845
And it does not operate,

38
00:02:06,845 --> 00:02:11,209
on any other server, if that server
is not useful to the current task.

39
00:02:11,209 --> 00:02:14,945
That is, he would keep his footprint,
as small as possible, whereas,

40
00:02:14,945 --> 00:02:18,240
the previous generations of malware,
including bottom worms,

41
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,730
would try to infect as
many machines as possible.

42
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:23,860
This cycle repeats and continues.

43
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:27,470
For example, the attacker,
based on information sent from the APT

44
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:31,020
inside the organization,
now learns that there is another part

45
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:35,180
of the organization that also
holds even more valuable data.

46
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:40,320
The attacker now identifies that part
of the organization as a new target,

47
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,990
and this cycle continues.
