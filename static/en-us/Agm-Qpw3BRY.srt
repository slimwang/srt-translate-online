00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,190
Now for the next question.

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:05,550
Which the following statements
are necessarily true about a system of

3
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:08,370
equations that has a unique solution and

4
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:12,860
which statements are sufficient to prove
that a system has a unique solution?

5
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:15,910
Again let's assume that we're only
talking about systems of equations in

6
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:18,590
three dimensions and also for

7
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:23,300
this quiz we'll assume that the letter
K refers to a non zero number.

8
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:27,850
The first statement is the planes
defined by the equations in the system

9
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:30,370
all have a common intersection point.

10
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:34,510
Second there are no equations
of the form 0 equals 0 or

11
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:38,190
0 equals K found during
Gaussian elimination.

12
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:42,130
Third there are exactly three
equations in the system and

13
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:45,280
four after reaching triangular form

14
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,520
each variable can be found as
the lead variable in an equation.

15
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,620
Let's also assume here for number four
that we don't run into any equations of

16
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:57,570
the form 0 = K if we do
Gaussian elimination,

17
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:01,130
since that would automatically
mean the system has no solution.

18
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:03,370
Check the appropriate boxes
next to each statement.
