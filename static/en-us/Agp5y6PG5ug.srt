Congratulations, you've now learned
some of the most important concepts in

00:00:04,166 --> 00:00:05,823
search and are ready to apply them.

00:00:05,823 --> 00:00:09,114
In this upcoming lab,
you'll implement breadth-first search,

00:00:09,114 --> 00:00:12,242
depth-first search and
A star search in the world of Pac-Man.

You'll help Pac-Man find food and

00:00:14,082 --> 00:00:16,544
other objects in his world
in an efficient way.

This is a great chance to create
a beautiful visual project to place on

00:00:19,856 --> 00:00:21,349
your portfolio.

00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:22,730
