1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Now, you might say that the answer will depend in part on what we see the response

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:16,000
is being but to simplify this let's assume that 55% still will support candidate A.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Well that won't quite be right. So to answer this question, we'll need to solve this formula for n.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Let's call the margin of error e. We can actually simplify this.

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:41,000
If we just square and divide, we get e²/1.96² is equal to the old variance 0.55*0.45/n.

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
We actually know e. We specify that is going to be 0.05.

7
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:59,000
That gives us, if we multiply through by n, so if we calculate this out we get 380.3.

8
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Now since it's pretty hard to ask a fraction of a person, we actually have to ask a bit more.

9
00:01:05,000 --> 99:59:59,999
We have to ask 381 people.
