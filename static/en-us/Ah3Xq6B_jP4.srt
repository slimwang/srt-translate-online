1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:05,263
[SOUND] Oh, hey Colt,

2
00:00:05,263 --> 00:00:08,468
what's up?

3
00:00:08,468 --> 00:00:10,610
>> [INAUDIBLE].

4
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:12,085
>> Yeah can I get a latte?

5
00:00:12,085 --> 00:00:16,230
>> [INAUDIBLE]
>> Oh, you're right, yeah.

6
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:19,810
Dude, by the way, I have to say, Java's
manage memory is so cool, I saved so

7
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:21,865
much time not having to care about
when my objects are released.

8
00:00:21,865 --> 00:00:24,220
>> [INAUDIBLE]
>> Yeah,

9
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:26,070
it's like the perfect setup for
a programmer.

10
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:27,740
Allocate objects,
this doesn't freeze them.

11
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:29,615
I can focus on doing cooler stuff.

12
00:00:29,615 --> 00:00:30,180
>> [INAUDIBLE].

13
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:33,315
>> Yeah and the best part, it's for
free, the system just does it.

14
00:00:33,315 --> 00:00:36,040
>> [INAUDIBLE].

15
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:38,454
>> No, seriously, the manage memory is
free, you don't have to pay a cent.

16
00:00:38,454 --> 00:00:41,826
>> [INAUDIBLE].

17
00:00:41,826 --> 00:00:44,695
>> Oh, dude, just embrace it,
I can write code however I want,

18
00:00:44,695 --> 00:00:46,307
Garbage Collector does the rest.

19
00:00:46,307 --> 00:00:53,691
>> [INAUDIBLE].

20
00:00:53,691 --> 00:00:54,388
>> Oh.

21
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:55,758
>> [INAUDIBLE].

22
00:00:55,758 --> 00:00:56,501
>> Yeah.

23
00:00:56,501 --> 00:00:58,725
>> [INAUDIBLE].
>> You're right.

24
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:00,760
>> [INAUDIBLE].

25
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:03,095
>> Oh, I see, so you're saying there's
a tax for garbage collection events.

26
00:01:03,095 --> 00:01:04,220
>> [INAUDIBLE].
>> Yeah when they happen

27
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:05,084
in a short period of time.

28
00:01:05,084 --> 00:01:08,130
>> [INAUDIBLE].

29
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:09,965
>> Okay, yeah I'll be more
careful when I write my loops.

30
00:01:09,965 --> 00:01:10,750
>> [INAUDIBLE].

31
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:15,775
>> Yeah, I totally hated to have
draining into my apps framerate.

32
00:01:15,775 --> 00:01:17,700
>> [INAUDIBLE].

33
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,755
>> Oh so
how do I spot these problems then?

34
00:01:19,755 --> 00:01:23,460
>> [INAUDIBLE].

35
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:24,855
>> Run the tools, got it.

36
00:01:24,855 --> 00:01:29,500
>> [INAUDIBLE]
>> Okay, sounds good, I'll see you.

37
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,570
Oh, hey wait, make it a double,
I'm going to need it.
