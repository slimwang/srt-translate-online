1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,949
Now we need to add the buttons for slow

2
00:00:01,949 --> 00:00:05,160
and fast playback of the audio.

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:06,480
Before we get started, make sure you have added all

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,250
the images to PitchPerfect that we've

5
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:10,949
provided in the resources.

6
00:00:10,949 --> 00:00:12,449
If you haven't done this already, you can still download

7
00:00:12,449 --> 00:00:14,669
them from resources and you need to add

8
00:00:14,669 --> 00:00:17,429
them to the asset catalog. I've included

9
00:00:17,429 --> 00:00:19,260
a link where we did this earlier if you

10
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:21,989
need a refresher. Alright, assuming you

11
00:00:21,989 --> 00:00:23,429
have the images, the first thing we're

12
00:00:23,429 --> 00:00:25,710
going to do is add two UI buttons.

13
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:27,929
One for playing audio slow and one for

14
00:00:27,929 --> 00:00:31,410
playing the audio fast. With the

15
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:33,479
Main.storyboard opened and the Play Sounds

16
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:35,549
View Controller selected, let's search

17
00:00:35,549 --> 00:00:37,649
for button in the object library in the

18
00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:44,878
bottom-right. Drag a UI button to the

19
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:46,530
Document Outline directly under the

20
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:53,399
Horizontal Stack View. With the button

21
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:55,530
selected in the Document Outline, look in

22
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:58,289
the attributes inspector, and remove the

23
00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:02,100
word “button” for its title. And make sure

24
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,899
you press Enter for the changes to take effect.

25
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:07,590
In the image drop-down, find the

26
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:10,579
image named “Slow”.

27
00:01:10,579 --> 00:01:12,739
In the Document Outline, we can rename

28
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:15,140
this button to Slow or Snail Button,

29
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:18,620
which ever you prefer. Just single click

30
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:24,079
on the word “Button” and then change its

31
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:24,799
name.

32
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,569
We now have our first button on the

33
00:01:26,569 --> 00:01:29,299
playback screen. Now let's add the Rabbit

34
00:01:29,299 --> 00:01:38,390
Button with the same steps.

35
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:40,489
Drag a UI button under the Horizontal Stack View

36
00:01:40,489 --> 00:01:44,359
under our Slow/Snail button, then in the

37
00:01:44,359 --> 00:01:46,760
attributes inspector, remove the “Button” title

38
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:49,939
and select the Fast image of our Rabbit.

39
00:01:49,939 --> 00:01:53,810
Finally single click on the new

40
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:55,430
button in the Document Outline and

41
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:57,680
change its name to Fast Button Rabbit

42
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,299
Button or whatever you prefer.

43
00:01:59,299 --> 00:02:02,180
Awesome, that's all it takes to add

44
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:04,340
buttons into a Stack View. Next we'll add

45
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:06,019
the buttons for playing the recorded

46
00:02:06,019 --> 00:02:08,118
audio with high and low pitches in

47
00:02:08,118 --> 00:02:14,560
another Horizontal Stack View.
