1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The answer is yes.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
In nearly all cases of mapping, we have robot uncertainty in motion.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
That uncertainty might grow over time.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
We need to address this; otherwise the map looks really bad.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Let me give an example .

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Suppose a robot drives down a corridor, and it senses surrounding walls.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
If this robot has a drift problem and because of uncertainty it its motion,

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
it actually believes it drives a trajectory like this.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Then the surrounding map would look very much like that.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Now, these might be indistinguishable at first glance,

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
but if this robot ever comes back to the same place,

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
then it has an opportunity to correct all this.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
A good SLAM technique is able to understand not just the fact that the environment

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
is uncertain but also the robot itself runs on an uncertain trajectory.

15
00:00:48,000 --> 99:59:59,999
That makes it hard.
