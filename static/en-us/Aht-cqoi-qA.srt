00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
In this problem, given a list that possibly contains lists,

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
we want to count all of the elements in all of the lists.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
So to go through an example, the black list has 2 elements.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:20,000
This blue list has 3 elements, and the pink list has 2 more elements,

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
leaving us with the total of 7 elements.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
So this is what we want to compute, and we can take a second to think about

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
how we're going to do that.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
We're basically going to start with the length of this list,

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
and then we're going to iterate through each element

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
and repeat the process for every sublist.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Let me show you how that works.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
We're going to start with our sum at 0,

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
and then we're going to iterate through each element.

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
For every element we see, we increase the sum by 1,

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
and if it's a sublist, we're going to do deep_count on the sublist.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Once we've gone through every list, we're going to return the sum.

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
[Mouth sound mimicing explosion] I've got to get like a catch word, like pow!
