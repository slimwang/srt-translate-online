1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:02,790
Think back now to our original problem.

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:08,430
What is the present value
of a future dollar, FV,

3
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:13,560
delivered some number of years in the
future, where i is how many years it is?

4
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:19,840
And we use IR, or the interest rate,
as a factor that affects this value.

5
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:24,860
The analogy for this to real companies
is that real companies pay dividends.

6
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:27,510
In other words,
if you own a share of a company,

7
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:31,790
you will get some cash payment
each year or each quarter.

8
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:36,161
As an example,
if you own one share of Apple stock,

9
00:00:36,161 --> 00:00:38,470
it pays you about $1 a year.

10
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:43,450
Consider that you'll get that
payment every year into the future.

11
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:46,950
What is the value of
that payment over time?

12
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:52,650
What this interest rate relates
to is how risky the company is.

13
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:56,390
In other words, you're as sure that it's
going to pay you that dollar every year

14
00:00:56,390 --> 00:01:01,730
as you are sure that the US government
would pay you a dollar on a bond.

15
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:08,400
Then, this IR interest rate should be
the same as the US government bond rate.

16
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,170
However, if you're less certain
that this company is going to

17
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:16,400
pay you at that rate, this interest
rate needs to be a little bit higher.

18
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,688
In other words,

19
00:01:17,688 --> 00:01:23,117
you need to expect that the company is
going to pay you more in the future or

20
00:01:23,117 --> 00:01:28,940
that it's going to be more likely to
pay you that dollar in the future.

21
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:31,390
This is called the discount rate.

22
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:36,110
The discount rate is higher if
you trust the company less or

23
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:37,940
you think it's more risky.

24
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:41,380
The discount rate is lower
if it's more certain to

25
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:42,850
pay you that dividend every year.

26
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,810
Let's suppose that after
considering all the factors,

27
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:50,370
you feel that it's
appropriate that a company

28
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:54,950
should pay you a 5% interest
rate considering its risks.

29
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:59,570
Now based on that,
if you want to calculate

30
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:04,800
what the value of the company is
based on the dividends it's paying,

31
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:08,020
you can take that into
account in the following way.

32
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:12,780
Essentially, what you want to
do is compute what is the value

33
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:16,750
of all the future dividends
that it's going to pay me?

34
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:21,960
So that's the sum of the dividend
it'll pay you in a year.

35
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:26,050
The dividend it'll pay you a year after
that, and the year after that, and

36
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:27,270
the year after that.

37
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:31,820
In fact, you want to sum those
all the way out to infinity.

38
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:37,290
So what we're looking for
is the sum of this equation,

39
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:39,799
but over all i going into the future.

40
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:45,712
We can draw on this infinite sum,
in other words for i = 1,

41
00:02:45,712 --> 00:02:50,206
1 year to infinity years,
of the sum 1 over n to the i.

42
00:02:50,206 --> 00:02:54,702
So this n here is this value, and

43
00:02:54,702 --> 00:03:01,040
we can replace 1 here with future value.

44
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,420
So this is not a math class,
I'm just going to give you the answer.

45
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:07,420
The answer is that this infinite sum,
in other words,

46
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:12,360
some future dollar paid each
year in the future over

47
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:17,460
an infinite number of years,
is that value divided by n minus one.

48
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:21,910
Which is equal to future value
divided by discount rate.

49
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:24,050
So in the case of our dollar machine,

50
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:28,540
we're paying one dollar each year
in the future at 5% interest.

51
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:32,675
So the value of our dollar
machine is $20 overall.

52
00:03:32,675 --> 00:03:38,190
What we've just described,
where future value is the dividend

53
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:42,550
we're going to pay at regular
intervals and DR is discount rate.

54
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:43,149
In other words,

55
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:50,400
what the risk of the stock equates to in
terms of an interest rate we should pay.

56
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,090
This equation tells us
the intrinsic value of the company.

57
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:58,290
In other words, if we're
going to pay that future value or

58
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:03,570
dividend every year or
every quarter going into the future,

59
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:09,220
what's the value of the company on
that basis, this is intrinsic value.

60
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:11,910
And in the example of the company
we were talking about,

61
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:13,455
that creates a $1 every year.

62
00:04:13,455 --> 00:04:17,950
It's the value of the $1 in
one year from now, next year,

63
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:25,220
next year, next year, next year,
continuing ad infinitum into the future.

64
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:26,380
And that's 20 bucks.
