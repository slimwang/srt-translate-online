1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:01,740
And in terms of

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:04,260
looking at the idea itself-
>> Yeah.

3
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:06,300
>> What would be, if you had two ideas,

4
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:10,050
what would you look in terms of this
is a better idea than the other idea?

5
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:15,770
>> For me, it changes.

6
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:18,260
I don't think I can just
say this idea or that idea.

7
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:23,230
I think one of the things I really look
for is someone building a product or

8
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:27,790
a company that's focused on
a market that's growing, or

9
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:30,780
that will grow because
that product exists.

10
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:36,570
I don't really love products that are
entering super mature markets because,

11
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:42,600
at that point, startups lose
a lot of their nimbleness and

12
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:43,710
a lot of their advantages.

13
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,820
Because if you're going
into a mature market,

14
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:48,920
basically what gets you noticed
is advertising dollars.

15
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:52,440
And you're just fighting for
a slice of a pre-existing pie.

16
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,170
But if you build something that's
going to cause a market to grow or

17
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:58,680
building something for a market that
is growing, you're fighting for

18
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,080
a slice of an ever expanding pie.

19
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:03,020
And that is so much more interesting.

20
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:04,099
It let's you play around more.

21
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:05,129
The rules aren't written.

22
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:07,480
There's all these things you can do.

23
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:10,370
So I like those kinds of things more.

24
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:13,060
But that's not to say that there aren't
great businesses to be built in mature

25
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:14,080
markets, as well.

26
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,780
And it also depends on how you
think about what's a mature market,

27
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:18,220
what's not.

28
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:23,513
And I also like companies
that make me think honestly,

29
00:01:23,513 --> 00:01:27,070
that make me look at a problem
from a brand new perspective.

30
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:31,100
Something that makes me say, huh,
I didn't realize you could do that.

31
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:31,930
>> Very Cool.
>> You know,

32
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:35,420
and that's tough to do, right,

33
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:39,670
because we spend all day thinking about
ideas and thinking about new companies.

34
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:41,390
But when you see one of those,

35
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:44,390
that's the kind of thing that
you get really excited about.

36
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:47,580
>> So, what would be an example
of an early stage market versus

37
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:48,250
a mature market?

38
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,190
>> So, mature market, and

39
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:55,960
this is kind of a silly example, but
junk food or something like that.

40
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,180
It's like a pretty mature market, right?

41
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:02,530
So, if a company came to us and said I'm
going to make a new kind of potato chip.

42
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:04,710
Now, there's a bunch of reasons
we probably wouldn't fund it.

43
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:08,740
But one of the things is, all right,
it's potato chips, what more can you do?

44
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:12,790
Now, you look at the last 10 years and
well, look at Pringles, right?

45
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:14,520
They built a really big company,
I think,

46
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,460
I actually don't know how big they are.

47
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:20,770
They built a big company but
it's primarily a marketing challenge.

48
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:25,980
In software, there’s some things
that are also mature markets.

49
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:26,870
So CRM, right.

50
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:28,675
Customer Relationship Management
software.

51
00:02:28,675 --> 00:02:30,890
It's actually a pretty mature market.

52
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:35,910
Now Salesforce disrupted it, in a lot
ways, to build a very large company.

53
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:37,770
And there’s still things
that can be done.

54
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:40,770
But it takes something
really insightful and

55
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:44,570
really new to figure how to build
the next great CRM company.

56
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:46,250
And I think there will be more of them.

57
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,678
It's a lot harder.

58
00:02:47,678 --> 00:02:51,530
Not to say it's a bad idea but
it takes a little more thinking and

59
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:56,230
a little more, I think,
a much deeper insight.

60
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:01,190
Some newer markets that
are really immature.

61
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:03,029
One that I like to think about, drones.

62
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:06,790
>> Drones.
>> Everyone likes to talk about them but

63
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:10,070
I think it was something like
500,000 drones were sold last year.

64
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:14,280
And the market's growing by some
ridiculous percentage every single year.

65
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,710
That is such an underdeveloped market,
and

66
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:21,120
we think about all the applications
that drone have yet to touch.

67
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,385
It's kind of mind-boggling.

68
00:03:22,385 --> 00:03:26,900
I mean we're talking everything
from crop analysis, right.

69
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:29,970
Flying a drone over a field which they
typically do with fixed-wing aircraft

70
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:37,680
now, just to see how healthy crops are,
all the way to tracking shots in movies.

71
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,120
There's all these things and
we don't know what that's going to do.

72
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,120
Not to mention unmanned
drones giving the Internet

73
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:50,190
to places which Facebook and Google are
both working on, or transporting people.

74
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:50,990
>> Right.

75
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:51,510
>> I don't know.

76
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:52,210
>> That's going to be cool.

77
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:54,421
>> It's going to be really cool.
