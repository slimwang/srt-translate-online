1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,151
So putting it all together, so maybe
you construct the initial eigenbasis as

2
00:00:04,151 --> 00:00:06,860
your way of, of doing this,
this tracking.

3
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:10,870
You pick some initial location,
remember, we had some prior location.

4
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:14,670
From that location,
you generate possible new locations.

5
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:17,670
You evaluate those possible
new locations, and

6
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:19,570
then you select the most likely one.

7
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:21,930
Remember we're not taking
the entire distribution,

8
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:23,920
we're just taking the most likely one.

9
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,780
And then, in the incremental part,

10
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:31,060
we're going to update the eigenbasis
using that new detected location.

11
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:33,650
And then we just go back up and
go over again.

12
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:34,880
That's why it's called tracking.
