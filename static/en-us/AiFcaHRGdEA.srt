1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,459
An effective resume is
targeted to a specific job.

2
00:00:03,459 --> 00:00:05,500
An employer needs you to tell
them what you're looking for,

3
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:08,210
and then they're going to match
your resume to the job description.

4
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:13,210
You need to make this process easy for
them by having concise resume

5
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:17,230
that directly connects to
what's being asked for the job.

6
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:20,690
Even if you're uploading your resume
to a job board it still needs to be

7
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:22,880
targeted to a specific job role,

8
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:25,299
otherwise you may not
turn up in searches.

9
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:28,460
I have a one-page resume
that I work on continuously.

10
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:32,380
Whenever I apply to a job, I make
a copy of that resume and tweak it.

11
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:36,330
Sometimes I rearrange things to
emphasize certain skills are for others.

12
00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:39,100
Sometimes I'll rewrite a bullet
point to make it more relevant.

13
00:00:40,329 --> 00:00:43,699
Remember that a resume is meant to
be the first step in getting a job.

14
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:47,170
There will be opportunities later
on such as during your interview

15
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:48,980
to expand on any of your experiences.

16
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:54,805
A resume is a one page summary of your
professional background which includes

17
00:00:54,804 --> 00:00:57,646
jobs, and projects,
education and skills.

18
00:00:57,646 --> 00:00:59,620
A resume is not
the summary of your life,

19
00:00:59,621 --> 00:01:01,838
things like your hobbies
should be left off.

20
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:06,750
You do not need to include extraneous
information like your references

21
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:09,280
because this information is
requested later on in the process.

22
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:14,560
When building your resume,
keep the scenario in mind.

23
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,752
Imagine you are applying to
the same job as five colleagues.

24
00:01:17,751 --> 00:01:20,769
Briefly on paper your
resumes may look the same.

25
00:01:20,769 --> 00:01:23,670
So how can a recruiter
pick whom to interview?

26
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:26,280
Since your individual
experience is unique,

27
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,960
focus on what might make you stand out.

28
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:32,188
Now, let's go through each
section of a typical resume.

29
00:01:32,188 --> 00:01:35,170
Don't worry so much about order, you'll
be provided with rubrics later on.
