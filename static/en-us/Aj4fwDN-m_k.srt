00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,149
It'll be really great if we could draw the graph of Athena's function, and we

2
00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:07,390
are actually really close to being able to do that. First however, I'd like to

3
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:11,849
know what domain makes sense for the concert hall situation. This is the

4
00:00:11,849 --> 00:00:15,062
original equation we had, written in a slightly different form, since I've

5
00:00:15,062 --> 00:00:19,702
Factored out a two from both the numerator and the denominator. It's important

6
00:00:19,702 --> 00:00:23,733
to remember here what our variables stand for. T of course is the reverberation

7
00:00:23,733 --> 00:00:28,935
time, measured in seconds as a matter of fact. And X here more importantly,

8
00:00:28,935 --> 00:00:34,380
stands for the depth of the stage in the concert hall measured in feet. So what

9
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:38,410
restrictions based on what x stands for, do we need to place on the values of

10
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:42,050
x, or on the domain? Use your common sense here.
