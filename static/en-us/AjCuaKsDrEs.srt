00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,983
Alright, so the skeleton of this code is pretty much what you've already done before,

2
00:00:04,995 --> 00:00:08,686
but we're going to introduce a few other things here. First of all, we

3
00:00:08,686 --> 00:00:13,695
set this caller variable to be the caller of xhrGett. Now, this is a special

4
00:00:13,695 --> 00:00:19,682
thing in Javascript and what it does is, whoever ends up calling xhrGet, will be

5
00:00:19,682 --> 00:00:24,861
set as this xhrGet.caller parameter, and you can grab that as necessary. Next,

6
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,155
we do the same thing that we've done this entire time, create a new XMLHttpRequest

7
00:00:29,167 --> 00:00:33,598
and call the open method, then we check the type: if it exists, then we

8
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:37,995
set it, otherwise, we assume by default that it is just text. Now the onload

9
00:00:38,007 --> 00:00:42,210
function is where things get interesting if we set a callback then we go ahead

10
00:00:42,222 --> 00:00:46,330
and try and call it otherwise we don't do anything and this try catch block is

11
00:00:46,342 --> 00:00:50,689
something that some of you might be familiar with. We try to do what is in this

12
00:00:50,701 --> 00:00:55,285
try block here and if it fails then we catch the error and throw an exception.

13
00:00:55,285 --> 00:00:59,358
Now this is basically just going to print out a whole bunch of information about

14
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:03,590
the exception. And this is where caller comes in as well. You can see that we

15
00:01:03,602 --> 00:01:08,371
print out the exception. The response text and the caller just for debugging

16
00:01:08,383 --> 00:01:13,966
purposes. Finally, we call xhr.send, and that's it. And if we load this up in

17
00:01:13,966 --> 00:01:18,393
our browser, we can see we make both calls. The first one takes a lot less time

18
00:01:18,405 --> 00:01:23,235
than the second one, since it's only JSON. We can see our output JSON in the

19
00:01:23,247 --> 00:01:27,291
console. And our song starts. [MUSIC]
