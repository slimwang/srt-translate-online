00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,566
The path through the maze is clearly not partially observable because you can see the maze entirely at all times.

2
00:00:06,567 --> 00:00:10,166
It is not stochastic. There's no randomness involved.

00:00:10,167 --> 00:00:14,899
It isn't really continuous. There's typically just finding many choices, go left or right.

4
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:18,933
And it isn't adversarial because there's no real adversary involved.
