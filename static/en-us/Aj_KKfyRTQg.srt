1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,390
Another very important part of your
nanodegree experience is that you're

2
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:04,800
part of a cohort.

3
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:07,740
This is basically a group of students
who are starting the program with you

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:09,080
and will stay with you
until the very end.

5
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:11,920
They'll be your community for
the whole time you're in the program,

6
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:15,120
and you'll be working on the same
timeline for your projects.

7
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,660
You'll interact with each other almost
every day throughout the program, so

8
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:19,480
we highly recommend getting to
know each other right away.

9
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,400
Your community will share a forum,
which is the first place you should go

10
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,170
whenever you need to get help,
or have questions.

11
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:28,760
It's important to get to know these
people because they'll be your support

12
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,290
network now, and the start of your
professional network in the future.

13
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:34,520
We'll help you stay in touch with each
other after you graduate, as well.

14
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:37,830
The cohort you're part of at
the beginning of the program

15
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:39,200
is based on the month
that you're starting.
