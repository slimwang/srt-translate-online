1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:04,059
There are much better
options than dropdowns.

2
00:00:04,059 --> 00:00:07,770
Check the links in the instructor
notes if you still don't believe us.

3
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:11,500
After watching Cam having
terrible time with dropdowns,

4
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:15,200
you should be asking yourself,
how do I pick the right ones?

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,960
How do I decide what input to pick?

6
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,720
These are great questions.

7
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:24,510
Luckily the HTML five star includes
a number of input types tailored for

8
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:25,940
every situation.

9
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:29,510
You can find a link to the list
in the instructor notes.

10
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:33,740
Consider these the tools or
building blocks for your forms.

11
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:35,870
This should look pretty familiar.

12
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:39,040
Here is on the left is the phone input.

13
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:43,780
So here on the right is the Email and
in the middle you could see the URL.

14
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:45,195
And of course we have many more.

15
00:00:45,195 --> 00:00:48,200
Notice how each specialized input

16
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,960
contains the buttons
that the user needs.

17
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,690
Nothing more, nothing less.

18
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:56,940
This is great because we don't have too
much real estate on a mobile device and

19
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:59,660
we want to enable our users
the most convenient way

20
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:01,830
to type the information they need.

21
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:07,040
In the next quizzes, Cam will challenge
you to research on your own and

22
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,300
pick the best input types for
your forms.
