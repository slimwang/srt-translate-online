1
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:04,410
Why don't you try doing some basic analysis on our Sochi Olympic

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:05,010
medal count data?

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:10,260
Using the data frame you created in the previous exercise, compute the average

4
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:14,220
number of bronze medals earned by countries who earned at least one gold medal.

5
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:20,080
Save this to a variable named avg_bronze_at_least_one_gold.

6
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,120
Your code should go here
