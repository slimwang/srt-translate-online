1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:05,660
As you may have guessed, the right choice is, the most clicked results in a CPU

2
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:09,070
interrupt. That's the first thing that happens, and

3
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:13,258
once the interrupt has been delivered to the CPU,

4
00:00:13,258 --> 00:00:16,490
there are domino effects that may eventually result

5
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:19,360
in some program running to read the spacial coordinates.

6
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:21,390
But the thing that happens when you click

7
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:24,670
the mouse is it results in a CPU interrupt.
