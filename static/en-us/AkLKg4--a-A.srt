The correct answer is that maps
will show empty grid squares.

2
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:04,480
And here's it in action.

3
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:08,600
When I drop the network connection and
I start dragging around,

4
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:11,660
you'll see that we have these empty
grid squares that cannot be loaded.

5
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:14,770
Now this is actually better
than not crashing, obviously,

6
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:17,900
so we might call this
behavior failing gracefully.

7
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:21,050
And in cases like this when our
network connections completely gone,

8
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:22,620
this is a great option.

9
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:25,640
I like to think of the approach like
this, to keep the user from not

10
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:29,200
panicking your app shouldn't panic
either, just fail gracefully.
