1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:02,080
Okay, so to get started,

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:06,450
let's look at some alternatives you
have available to monetizing your app.

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:08,210
And when we go through
these alternatives,

4
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:12,308
let's look at how easy it is to start
making money using this alternative.

5
00:00:12,308 --> 00:00:17,060
How it supports a good business model
where you can make long-term revenue,

6
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:20,970
and finally, what value this
monetization model provides to the user.

7
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:24,310
So, let's start with our first
alternative, paid downloads.

8
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:26,900
This is where the user needs
to pay in order to even

9
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:28,940
download the app to the phone.

10
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:32,110
So how about easy to launch for
paid downloads?

11
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:35,190
Well perhaps it's kind of obvious
that this is very difficult to do.

12
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:38,730
And you have to have an app where the
user really knows the value of your app

13
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:41,690
beforehand and is willing to pay for it.

14
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:45,760
Compared to overall number of apps,
there are very few that can do this.

15
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,800
So a paid downloads monetization model
is definitely not easy to launch.

16
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:52,205
What about long-term revenue?

17
00:00:52,205 --> 00:00:54,990
Well, once the user
has paid up front for

18
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:57,700
the app,
they don't expect to be charged anymore.

19
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:01,490
So only using paid downloads will
limit your revenue to the number of

20
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:03,280
users downloading the app.

21
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,701
So paid downloads has a limitation
when it comes to sustaining long-term

22
00:01:07,701 --> 00:01:08,415
revenue.

23
00:01:08,415 --> 00:01:10,240
Then what about user value?

24
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,270
A paid download definitely
has a high use of value.

25
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:17,170
After all, the user is willing
to pay up front to get this app.

26
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:19,000
So they really want it.

27
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,280
All right, let's look at another
alternative, subscription.

28
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:26,620
This is where the user pays a certain
amount regularly, for example, monthly.

29
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:30,070
So is a subscription monetization
model easy to launch?

30
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:32,140
The answer is definitely not.

31
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:35,190
Again, you're asking the user
to pay up front, and even more,

32
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:38,220
you're asking them to pay,
for example, every month.

33
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:40,739
It is a huge decision for
the user to want to do this.

34
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,210
So what about long-term revenue?

35
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:46,230
Yes, spot on.

36
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:49,880
The user will continue to pay for
your app as long as it provides value.

37
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:53,300
So you will continue to get revenue
from all users of your app,

38
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:56,330
not only at the time
when they downloaded it.

39
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:58,210
And what about user value?

40
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:00,080
Same thing as for paid download.

41
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:03,460
You have a user that is willing to
make an up front financial commitment

42
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:04,400
to use your app.

43
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:09,180
So obviously, your app provides a very
specific and high value to the user.

44
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:11,880
And both these monetization models,
paid downloads and

45
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:16,340
subscription, can be configured in
the Play store when you deploy your app.

46
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:19,680
Okay, now let's look at
displaying ads in your app.

47
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,930
Is this monetization
model easy to launch?

48
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:23,910
Yes it is.

49
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,770
In particular, if there is no charge for

50
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:29,640
the app, users understand that you
have to make money from something.

51
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,880
What about long-term revenue?

52
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:34,320
The answer is yes to this one too.

53
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,570
As long as your app is used,
you will be paid for displaying ads, so

54
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:40,520
this supports a long
term business model.

55
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,600
What about user value?

56
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,402
As it turns out,
ads do provide great value to the user.

57
00:02:45,402 --> 00:02:49,559
As we will see, AdMob, the platform
that we will look at in this course,

58
00:02:49,559 --> 00:02:53,820
is very good at serving ads
which are relevant to the user.

59
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:56,180
And ads which are relevant
to you is a good thing.

60
00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:01,330
And now for the last alternative we
will look at, in-app purchases enable

61
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:05,480
you as a developer to advertise and
sell digital goods right in your app.

62
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:09,580
For example, they can mean new levels or
items in a game.

63
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:11,162
So is this model easy to launch?

64
00:03:11,162 --> 00:03:14,530
Yes, in-app purchases
are very easy to launch.

65
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:16,880
The user does not have to pay for
anything up front.

66
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:20,121
What about long-term revenue?

67
00:03:20,121 --> 00:03:23,849
Well since you can offer and engage
the user with new digital goods all

68
00:03:23,849 --> 00:03:28,590
the time, in-app purchases have
a great long-term revenue potential.

69
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:30,570
Then what about user value?

70
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:34,209
Well since the user is engaging with the
app, and you control what to advertise

71
00:03:34,209 --> 00:03:38,290
and sell, it will be very relevant to
the user, so great user value as well.

72
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:43,200
All right, so those are some of
the monetization alternatives available.

73
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,915
And as you can see, ads and

74
00:03:44,915 --> 00:03:48,710
in-app purchases provides a great
way to make money from your app.

75
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:51,880
They are easy to launch, they provide
great long-term revenues, and

76
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,579
they align well with the user values.

77
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,470
And in this lesson,

78
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:57,840
we will be specifically be
looking at displaying ads.
