1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,850
Let's create a route where we can view
the details of each of our menu items.

2
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:07,020
Remember that all of the items
share the item template.

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:08,310
Let's generate the item route.

4
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:14,970
This updates the router, creates an item
route and template file and a test file.

5
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:17,169
Remember that this is just shorthand for
this.

6
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:22,770
To add a dynamic segment for
this route, we need to modify the path.

7
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:27,130
Remember that dynamic segments
have to start with a colon.

8
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:28,710
This will hold the name
of the menu item.

9
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,740
Let's add something to the item template
so we'll have something to see.

10
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:38,800
I'm hard coding in a menu item's name,
image, rating, and description.

11
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:43,280
We need some way to get to
the item page from the menu, so

12
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,630
let's add a link to each item.

13
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:47,480
Now we can get to an item's detail page.

14
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:51,850
Right now though we've hard coded this
menu item into the item template.

15
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:57,180
So even if I try to view the strawberry
pudding, I'll still get the ham and

16
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:58,365
goat cheese croissant.

17
00:00:58,365 --> 00:00:59,210
We'll fix this in a bit.
