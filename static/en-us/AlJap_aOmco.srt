00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:04,030
So we've, we've been over constraints, we've been over navigation,

2
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:08,230
the third main element of OCL is collections. I've hinted at what that is.

3
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:11,340
There's, there's four built in collection classes.

4
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:15,630
We already talked about sets, and bags, and sequences a little bit.

5
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:20,150
There's an abstract class that sits above them all called the collection class.

6
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:24,820
These four classes are organized with the collection class being a parent class,

7
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:31,580
and the collection class has various operators such as, size which we saw and

8
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:36,600
count, and sums, and ways of interrating over the collection and so on.

9
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:42,480
That are inherited by all of the three other collection classes. Moreover, those

10
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,650
collection classes, those three other concrete collection classes may themselves

11
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:52,380
have some specialized operations. The OCL reference manual has a complete list

12
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:55,630
of all the operations that are available to you for dealing with collections
