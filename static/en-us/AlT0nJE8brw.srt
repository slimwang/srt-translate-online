00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,166
Now I want you to try this, match the following brain structures to the type of

2
00:00:03,166 --> 00:00:09,545
memory. Again, we have the cerebellum, striatum, amygdala, and hippocampus. And

3
00:00:09,545 --> 00:00:12,155
here are the type of memories, so one type of memory would be your first

4
00:00:12,155 --> 00:00:16,406
heartbreak. What part of the brain would be involved in this type of memory. If

5
00:00:16,406 --> 00:00:20,438
I asked you what happened during World War II what part of your brain would you

6
00:00:20,438 --> 00:00:25,653
use to recall this information? If you had to remember how to ride a bike, what

7
00:00:25,653 --> 00:00:29,529
part of the brain would you use? Type the corresponding letter to the type of

8
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:32,220
memory that this brain structure is involved in.
