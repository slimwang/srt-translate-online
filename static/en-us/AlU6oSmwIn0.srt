1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,650
So up to this point, we've created
our code almost purely from scratch,

2
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:06,939
using a few internal libraries
like HTTP Base Server and

3
00:00:06,939 --> 00:00:09,750
external libraries like SQL Alchemy.

4
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:12,540
Creating a website from scratch really
shows that you have a good grasp of

5
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:16,800
underlying programming concepts and
are able to utilize the power of Python.

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:17,990
But as we make our website more and

7
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:21,710
more complex, the code becomes
repetitive and difficult to maintain.

8
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:25,280
Frameworks are collections of code that
simplify the web development process.

9
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,070
They take care of repetitive tasks and

10
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:30,200
allow us to focus on the more
unique features of our project.

11
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:30,880
At the moment, some of

12
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,970
the most popular frameworks out there
are RubyonRails.net and Django.

13
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:37,970
But if we take a look at this Wikipedia
article, we see that there are hundreds

14
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:41,480
of frameworks developers have created to
code web applications more efficiently.

15
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:42,380
Frameworks may rise and

16
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:44,720
fall in popularity but
the same underlying concepts for

17
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:48,190
developing web pages applies for
all of these technologies.

18
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:51,070
Think of a framework as
a box of prepared cake mix.

19
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:53,570
We could make a cake using all
of these items from scratch and

20
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:56,540
would probably have a better
understanding of how to make cakes.

21
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:59,010
But if we have several cakes to
make in a short period of time,

22
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:01,920
finding a good cake mix simplifies
the preparation process and

23
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,640
helps us focus on other things.

24
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,190
Like frosting.

25
00:01:05,602 --> 00:01:09,310
In lesson two you built a website with
the raw ingredients of web development.

26
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:10,100
Now it's time to see how we

27
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:12,230
can use frameworks to improve
our development process.
