1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
And here are the answers: For the error introduced by a lack of enough sampling,

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
all these problems are true.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
If you don't have enough samples,

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
it might make the utility too high; it might make the utility too low--

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
and it could certainly be improved by taking more trials.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
But with the differences due to having not quite the right policy,

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
The answers aren't the same.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
So yes, if you don't have the right policy,

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
that could make the utilities too low--if you're doing something silly,

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
like starting in this state and the policy says,

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
"Drive straight into the minus 1"

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
that could make the utility of this state lower than it really should be.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
But it can't make the utility too high.

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
So we really have a bound on the utility here.

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
The bound is: what does the optimal policy do?

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
And no matter what policy we have,

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
it's not going to be better than the optimal policy;

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
and so we can only be making things worse

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
with our policy, not making them better.

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And finally, having more N won't necessarily improve things.

21
00:01:00,000 --> 99:59:59,999
It will decrease the variance, but it won't decrease or improve the mean.
