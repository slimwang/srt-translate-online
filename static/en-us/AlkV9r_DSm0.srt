1
00:00:00,048 --> 00:00:03,378
So what we learned last week was that scan can be computed efficiently

2
00:00:03,378 --> 00:00:06,843
on n elements with run time proportion to n.

3
00:00:06,843 --> 00:00:12,082
And we also learned that it can be completed with a number of steps proportional to log n.

4
00:00:12,082 --> 00:00:15,273
This is something we can implement very efficiently on the GPU.

5
00:00:15,273 --> 00:00:17,836
And because we can implement it efficiently, what we'll find today

6
00:00:17,836 --> 00:00:21,738
is that it's the core of a significant number of interesting parallel parameters.

7
00:00:21,738 --> 00:00:24,114
And we're going to start with one called compact.
