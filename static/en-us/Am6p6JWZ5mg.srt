1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:00,840
Did you get it?

2
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:03,719
>> Yeah I did actually. so, so this one

3
00:00:03,719 --> 00:00:08,150
I think I understand completely. So we know that from

4
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:10,360
the last discussion we had about how you would recover

5
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:13,120
the joint, that what you're saying on the right of

6
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,850
this equation probability y times probability of x given y means that

7
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:20,020
the probability of y, the variable y doesn't depend on

8
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:23,320
anything. So, between those two graphs the one on the

9
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:25,500
right is the one where you're saying that. You don't

10
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,770
need to know the value of any other

11
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:28,890
variable in order to determine the probability of y.

12
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:30,030
>> Good.

13
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:33,650
>> So it has to be the one on the sec, the second and just to make sure

14
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:36,230
if you look at the second product the probability

15
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:40,237
of x given y the second multican? Is it multican?

16
00:00:40,237 --> 00:00:41,817
>> Hm, factor.

17
00:00:41,817 --> 00:00:45,150
>> Factor? Let's say factor. The second factor,

18
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:47,240
this says that while you determine the probability

19
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:50,580
of x given the value of y and there is an arrow from y to x

20
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:53,810
so, the second one is in fact correct.

21
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:56,130
>> Yeah. So this is actually just one way you could just read this

22
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:59,590
network is to say what is this node x with an arrow coming into it?

23
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:03,580
That is the probability of x. But, the, the things pointing into it are what's

24
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:05,459
exactly being given. What it's being conditioned

25
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:07,240
on. So that's exactly right, the second one.

26
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:10,160
>> Right. So this, this, so this makes sense to me. This is why when

27
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,450
you look at a network, a Bayesian  network, it's very

28
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:15,350
hard not to think of them as dependencies.

29
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:18,210
Even though they're not dependencies, they're conditional independencies.

30
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,170
>> Well the arrows are a form of dependence but it's not a causal

31
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:24,670
dependence necessarily, it's it's again it's just

32
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:27,480
the way the probabilities are being decomposed.

33
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,340
>> Hm.

34
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:31,270
>> And the last of these three equations just Bayes rule,

35
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:35,440
this time written correctly where the denominator has to be the probability

36
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,350
of x, and we've gone over this a couple of times. I

37
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:40,700
don't, I don't need to, to describe it again, but what Would

38
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,210
like to, just, bring to your attention to

39
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:44,350
this three together turn out to be kind

40
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:47,320
of our, you know, three musketeers in working

41
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,150
out the probability of various kinds of events.

42
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,190
>> Excellent.
