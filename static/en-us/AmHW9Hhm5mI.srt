00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,410
Designing a responsive site,
uses the same concepts and

2
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:06,640
processes that you go through for
a non responsive site.

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:10,120
Except instead of drawing
a single wide design,

4
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:13,700
there are a few more to accommodate
different screen sizes.

5
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:18,220
I like to start my design with the
smallest form factor, usually a phone.

6
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:21,370
Once that one's complete,
I move up to the next.

7
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:25,640
And as each design is completed,
I ask my self is there a need for

8
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:28,240
a design for a wider screen?

9
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,830
At some point, there's really
no need for a bigger design.

10
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:35,710
By starting small I really have to
prioritize what's important for

11
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:36,900
my users.

12
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:39,710
What's the most important
thing that they want to do, or

13
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:42,110
that they're going to see on screen?

14
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:44,920
When starting big and
then designing down.

15
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:49,390
It can be too easy to just cut or
hide content that may be important.

16
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:52,300
Instead, by prioritizing content and

17
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:56,390
working up, the key content
is always on the page and

18
00:00:56,390 --> 00:01:00,400
users get the full experience,
no matter what device they're using.

19
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:04,550
The design for one hardware store
prioritizes information about

20
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:07,640
the nearest store,
it's address, hours, and

21
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:12,210
phone number and puts those right at
the top so I can find them easily.

22
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:17,100
Beyond designing from small to large,
I also code from small to large.

23
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:20,520
This way, I know that my core styles,
and layout will work for

24
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:25,530
any device, even on legacy browsers
that don't support media queries.

25
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:31,245
But probably my favorite reason to start
from small and work up is performance.

26
00:01:31,245 --> 00:01:34,005
By designing for
the smallest view port first,

27
00:01:34,005 --> 00:01:37,515
I'm forced to think about
performance from the beginning.

28
00:01:37,515 --> 00:01:41,605
I have to make a conscious decision
about prioritizing content, and

29
00:01:41,605 --> 00:01:43,425
how much data I'm sending to the user.
