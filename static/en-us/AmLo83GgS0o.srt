1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:05,860
To analyze this line, we need to know where it hits the y axis, and at what

2
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:11,160
angle. This angle is generally referred to as the slope. Which is essentially

3
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:17,930
the amount that y changes, when x changes by 1 unit. In other words, when x

4
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:26,150
moves 1 unit from here to here, y changes from here. Note that this is a

5
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:32,810
positive relationship, and we want to find, what's the change in y when x

6
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:38,950
increases by 1 unit. That's the slope, but remember in the case of regression,

7
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:44,820
this line represents how much y is expected to change, when x changes by 1

8
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:49,850
unit. Therefore, when we write the equation for this line, we denoted it by y

9
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:55,320
hat. There are many ways to symbolize the y-intercept and slope. You may have

10
00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:00,870
learned the generic y equals mx plus b, which at least in the United States, is

11
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:05,504
usually how it's taught. That's where m represents slope, and b represents the

12
00:01:05,504 --> 00:01:10,830
y-intercept. But really, we can symbolize them any way we want. The important

13
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:15,190
thing is that once we decide on how to denote them, you have to remember that

14
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:20,020
and continue to use that later. We can also write it like this, because

15
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:26,880
addition can go in any direction. 2 + 3 is the same as 3 + 2. The slope times x

16
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:32,300
plus the y-intercept is the same as the y-intercept plus the slope times x.

17
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:36,800
Sometimes one of these, the slope or they y-intercept, might be negative. So

18
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:41,060
it's just important to keep that in mind. As long as we keep those negatives

19
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:44,845
and positives signs correct, the order doesn't matter. The slope and

20
00:01:44,845 --> 00:01:49,590
y-intercept are called regression coefficients. And sometimes when we use

21
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:53,790
software to calculate their regression line, they'll present it in this first

22
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:59,770
way. For this lesson, we're going to use b to symbolize the slope, and a to

23
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:04,910
symbolize the y-intercept. Given this, what will be our generic equation for

24
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:07,780
the regression line? Select all that apply.
