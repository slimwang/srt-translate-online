Well I know this negative exponent will move to the numerator. So I have y to

2
00:00:04,482 --> 00:00:09,301
the 5th times y to the 4th, next we add the exponents together to get y to the

3
00:00:09,301 --> 00:00:14,062
9th. Excellent work if you got that one correct. If you use exponents rules you

4
00:00:14,062 --> 00:00:18,866
would have done y to the 5th minus negative 4. We subtract the second exponent,

5
00:00:18,866 --> 00:00:21,835
this also leaves us with y to the 9th, our answer.
