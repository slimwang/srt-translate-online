1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:02,250
All right, you're done.

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:04,200
Let's take a look at my solution.

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:09,120
First, we add a function to utility to
reset the location status to unknown.

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,750
Note that we use the shared preferences
editor apply function rather than

5
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:15,870
commit, since this will be
called from the UI thread.

6
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:19,860
Next, we call that function to reset
the location status if the user

7
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:23,270
changes the location
within settings activity.

8
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:26,730
Next, we add the location
status invalid.

9
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:31,820
Remember, we have to add the constant
and then add it to the indef annotation.

10
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:37,870
Next, in get weather data from Json,
we add the message code Json definition.

11
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:40,210
Now let's check to see
if we have an error.

12
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:41,850
If the message code is 200,

13
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:45,750
which happens to be the same as HTTP_OK,
we can continue.

14
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:49,200
But if the message code
equals HTTP not found,

15
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,090
then we set the location
status to invalid.

16
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:56,010
If it is any other error, we assume
a server failure of some kind and

17
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:58,220
set the status to server down.

18
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:03,200
And then we add a string to display,
when this case happens.

19
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:06,650
Finally, we add this new
case to update empty view.

20
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:07,570
Done.

21
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:09,280
Let's test this.

22
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,210
All right, let's first of all
run this on our emulator.

23
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:14,010
All right,
let's put an invalid location.

24
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:18,670
London.
And then we get our new message.

25
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:20,310
No weather information available.

26
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:24,020
The location in settings is not
recognized by the weather server.

27
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:24,520
Awesome.
