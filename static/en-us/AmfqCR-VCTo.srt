00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
In this final question, I'd like you to learn the position parameters of Markov chains.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
There's a Markov chain over here with two states.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
There is an initial state distribution for the time step 0.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Then there is conditional state distribution from time T to time T + 1.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
You might go from A and stay in A.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
You might go from A to B.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
You might go from B and stay in B and go from B to A.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
What we observe is the sequence A, A, A, A, B.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
This is our sample for the initial state and all these transitinos over here

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
are samples for the state transitions in this Markov chain.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I want you to compute all the parameters, which is the initial distribution,

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
and the transition distribution out of state A and out of state B.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
However I'd like to do this with Laplacian smoothing with k=1.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
It is not maximum likelihood.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
It is Laplacian smoothing, which can be applied just exactly

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
the same way we saw it in class in various contexts.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'd like you to learn these parameters of the Markov chain from the observed sequence.

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Again, the only sample for the initial state is

19
00:01:09,000 --> 99:59:59,999
the very first measurement observation in this sequence over here.
