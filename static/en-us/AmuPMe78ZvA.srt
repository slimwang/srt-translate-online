1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,120
We take in over 5,000 animals each year.

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,790
Each individual animal has their
own profile within our system, and

3
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:11,140
we utilize that information as far
as their behavior assessments or

4
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:15,430
their medical history to match
them up with a potential adopter.

5
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:19,240
Other ways that we utilize this
information would be tracking the amount

6
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:24,830
of animals that we have come into our
shelter as strays or owner surrenders.

7
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:29,030
There will be a ZIP Code associated
with the area that they came in from.

8
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:34,840
We've utilized the ZIP Codes to
create programs specifically based

9
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:38,060
in those ZIP Codes to
implement free spay and

10
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:42,090
neuter for animals within those areas
to help minimize the amount of animals

11
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:43,870
that are coming in through
those particular areas.
