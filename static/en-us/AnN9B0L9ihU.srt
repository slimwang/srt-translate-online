00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:03,510
Statecharts are a precise way of modeling the behavior of

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:07,870
complex reactive systems. Such systems are ubiquitous and

3
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:11,790
errors can lead to safety, security, and usability problems. In this lesson,

4
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:15,940
we will go through an exercise in modeling the behavior of a common clock radio.
