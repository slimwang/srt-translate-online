1
00:00:00,295 --> 00:00:04,450
Awesome, now your app has multiple
versions of each trouble resources

2
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:06,660
separated by their image densities and

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:08,261
this is what it should look
like in Android Studio.

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,890
Let's review how you made that happen.

5
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:14,510
First we follow the link
to the GitHub Repo and

6
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:16,120
then click the download ZIP button.

7
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:19,110
Next to extract the zip folder and

8
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:22,138
I just extracted it directly
to the Downloads folder.

9
00:00:22,138 --> 00:00:24,640
But you could also extract
it to your desktop or

10
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,250
another folder as long as
you know where it's going.

11
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:30,962
Now with that done we'll
navigate into the folder and

12
00:00:30,962 --> 00:00:34,687
highlight these subfolders
to be copied and pasted.

13
00:00:34,687 --> 00:00:37,650
So I'm going to right-click and Copy.

14
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:41,085
Now let's navigate
back to Android Studio.

15
00:00:41,085 --> 00:00:45,286
As you a note here, I'm taking a look
at the project in my Project view.

16
00:00:45,286 --> 00:00:49,521
I'm going to navigate to the res
directory and then right-click and

17
00:00:49,521 --> 00:00:52,750
Paste in the five folders
that I just copied.

18
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:53,680
So I'm going to click OK here.

19
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:58,130
Once all the folders are copied over,
we can click them open and

20
00:00:58,130 --> 00:00:59,500
take a look at any of the images.

21
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:04,160
So here in Android Studio we
see a preview of the image and

22
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:07,670
in the top right corner we can also see
the size of the image in pixels as well.

23
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,165
Now before we move on,

24
00:01:10,165 --> 00:01:14,065
let's make sure the app still runs
with all these new files included.

25
00:01:14,065 --> 00:01:17,055
So here's my device with this
version of the app running.

26
00:01:17,055 --> 00:01:18,702
Let's navigate into Numbers.

27
00:01:18,702 --> 00:01:19,889
[BLANK_AUDIO]

28
00:01:19,889 --> 00:01:22,025
And good, so
it looks like it's still working.

29
00:01:22,025 --> 00:01:24,835
Now our next task will be to get
the images to show onto the screen.
