00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:03,900
As Tali said, you don't need a lot
of money to get media attention.

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:07,220
But like other things with startups,
when you spend less money,

3
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:10,115
you'll have to work harder
yourself to make things happen.

4
00:00:10,115 --> 00:00:11,670
A best practice to get prepared for

5
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:14,525
media coverage is to
have your own press kit.

6
00:00:14,525 --> 00:00:18,150
The press kit holds all of the things
you want to share with the press when

7
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:19,365
they cover your story.

8
00:00:19,365 --> 00:00:23,865
You're going to want to make sure
your press kit has quality assets.

9
00:00:23,865 --> 00:00:26,937
This is simply an information
packet about your business or your

10
00:00:26,937 --> 00:00:30,867
product with images, screenshots, icons,
and other media you want to share.

11
00:00:32,097 --> 00:00:35,595
You should include general information
about your startup, your product, and

12
00:00:35,595 --> 00:00:36,117
your team.

13
00:00:36,117 --> 00:00:39,991
You should also include high
resolution files with your logo,

14
00:00:39,991 --> 00:00:42,330
icons, screenshots of your app, and

15
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:46,777
other marketing images such as
people using and enjoying your app.

16
00:00:46,777 --> 00:00:48,757
The goal here is to make
your product shine.

17
00:00:48,757 --> 00:00:50,660
So include whatever does that.

18
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:52,591
You could also include
a picture of your team,

19
00:00:52,591 --> 00:00:55,250
especially if it's an A+
team you want to brag about.

20
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:58,400

additional examples of press kits.
