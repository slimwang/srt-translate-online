00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,540
So, when I decided to take a look at what websites had

2
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:07,160
a slow layout. I came to nbcnews.com. This website has different stories

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:10,040
laid out in sort of a grid on the screen. Let's see

4
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:12,370
what happens if we change the size of the grid. And, we

5
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:15,700
can see that the stories, instead of being stacked next to each

6
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:19,070
other are now stacked on top of each other. Let's make this

7
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:21,990
full screen again. And, we can see that the stories moved out

8
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,160
to their original horizontal orientation. Let's take a look at what this

9
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:28,670
looks like in Dev Tools. I'll Cmd+Option+i to open up

10
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:32,600
dev tools. Alright, where I have the HTML, let's go

11
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,230
over to the timeline. And, I'm going to hit the record

12
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:37,950
button, and start changing the size of the screen and watching

13
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:41,830
what happens with layout. We'll make it small. Okay, it

14
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:44,010
looks like the stories have moved. Let me go ahead

15
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:47,110
and make it full screen again. Cool. And, I can

16
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:50,160
go ahead and stop the recording. Alright. So, we have quite

17
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,950
a bit of data here in the timeline. I'm not

18
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:55,820
sure what we exactly we need to look at, so let's

19
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:58,660
go ahead, well instead of searching through, just filter out

20
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:02,100
what we don't want. Layout happens in Rendering, so let's get

21
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:06,090
rid of Painting, Scripting and Loading. We only see these

22
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:08,850
purple events here. Let's go ahead and take a look at

23
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:11,670
this section, we can see a few Layout events. Clicking

24
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:15,600
on this one we can see that it took 113 milliseconds,

25
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,440
which is definitely a noticeable amount of time.
