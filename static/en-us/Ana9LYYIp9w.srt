1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:00,940
All right.

2
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:03,140
Here we are again with
another handy tool.

3
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:05,630
Now looking at a heap view of
your apps' memory allocations

4
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:08,440
is a great way to understand where
most of the data is going and

5
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:10,660
what type of data is being allocated.

6
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:14,120
This helps you find data that is
allocated and maybe shouldn't be.

7
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:17,160
But sadly, heap viewer doesn't
tell us exactly where in your code

8
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,860
that data is being allocated.

9
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:22,050
So for that, we need a tool
called Allocation Tracker.

10
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:25,640
As usual, go ahead and start
Android Studio, connect your device, and

11
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,660
load Sunshine into the foreground.

12
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:28,285
Okay.
So if we

13
00:00:28,285 --> 00:00:32,530
want to get to the tool in Android
Studio, we can click on the Android tab,

14
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:37,490
which is at the bottom left of
a standard Android ID window.

15
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:39,430
This is going to open
the Android DDMS tab.

16
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:42,510
I'm going to go ahead and enlarge
this so we can see this a bit easier.

17
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:48,760
So, the DDMS tab shows the devices and
logs related to your device.

18
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:51,320
Now depending on what you've been
working on in Android studio,

19
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,460
this tab will show different views.

20
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:56,720
Make sure the Devices tab is
the one that you have selected.

21
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:59,670
And we'll go ahead and
select the Sunshine app.

22
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:03,570
Now next in the left margin go ahead and
click the bottom most icon.

23
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:05,129
This one right here.

24
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:08,500
The icon has a start
allocation tracking tool tip.

25
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:09,890
Okay.
So, the DDMS tab

26
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:12,070
shows the devices and log.

27
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:14,530
Depending on what you've been
working on in Android Studio,

28
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:16,950
this tab will show different views.

29
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:20,900
Make sure the Devices tab is
selected and select Sunshine.

30
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:23,490
Next, we're going to want to
go to this left margin and

31
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:25,610
click the bottom most icon.

32
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:28,540
This has a tool tip that says
start allocation tracking.

33
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:30,300
I'm going to go ahead and click it.

34
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:34,630
And see,
we're enabling allocation tracker here.

35
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:37,300
All right, so go ahead and
bring up your Sunshine application and

36
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:39,880
go ahead an interact with your app for
a little bit.

37
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:45,460
So let's go ahead and take a look at
what the weather is like in Cleveland.

38
00:01:46,945 --> 00:01:51,355
Unfortunately looks like there's some
rain tomorrow, but a high of 74,

39
00:01:51,355 --> 00:01:52,125
humidity is 93.

40
00:01:52,125 --> 00:01:53,205
Ooh, sticky.

41
00:01:53,205 --> 00:01:56,555
And we see rain Wednesday,
still pretty warm.

42
00:01:56,555 --> 00:02:00,280
And then rain on Saturday,
but still pretty warm.

43
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,260
Fortunately, less humidity then.

44
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:04,850
Looks like you got warm and
rainy weather, Cleveland.

45
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:09,038
All right so go ahead and you can finish
interacting with your app a few times.

46
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:11,690
And when you're done,
click on the same button as before.

47
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:15,440
And the tool tip should say
Stop Allocation Tracking.

48
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,380
Now depending on how long
you've been doing stuff.

49
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:19,030
Processing the data might
take a little while.

50
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:21,320
And the button will stay depressed.

51
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,040
Don't click it multiple times.

52
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,430
Just be cool and hang out for a bit.

53
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:27,650
All right.
It looks like our's finished.

54
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:31,740
Now if you look closely up here,
a new tab was created in our IDE.

55
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:36,020
It's labeled something like
DDMS followed by a large number

56
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:36,930
that we have it right here.

57
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,910
Now, this view lists all the allocations
that occurred during that sampling

58
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:43,420
period when you were interacting
with your application.

59
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:47,300
And each row in this view
represents distinct allocation.

60
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,910
Now the order column
is going to tell you.

61
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:51,340
When the allocations happened.

62
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:55,770
The allocated class column is going to
show you what type of data was being

63
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:59,860
allocated, the size of it, and you'll
also have some information telling you

64
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:02,810
what thread made that
specific allocation.

65
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:07,130
Lastly, the allocation site column
tells you what function in your code

66
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:08,410
actually allocated that memory.

67
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:10,760
For example here, we select integer.

68
00:03:11,966 --> 00:03:15,230
The value of method is what made
this allocation of this integer.

69
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:19,710
Now if you click on an allocation,
you can see its full call stack.

70
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:21,950
There's a lot of
information in this table.

71
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:25,310
If you don't see everything,
you may need to resize the panels.

72
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:28,170
Now, you can also move the columns
around to your fitting

73
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:30,960
to get the ones that you
care about within view.

74
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,840
Or you can sort columns by clicking
on the header of a column.

75
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,210
Now obviously this tool is super
handy for tracking down memory churn.

76
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:38,860
Let's go ahead and
take a look at this in practice.
