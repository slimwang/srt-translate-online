1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:04,170
So, we've gotten a lot of feedback
now from a couple of different users.

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:08,050
Next, we need to figure out if
the prototype did well or poorly.

3
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:10,560
Remember, we don't need to
have users love our app

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:12,570
design as a whole at this point.

5
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:15,830
We are working with a low fidelity
prototype, so our goal is simply to get

6
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:19,110
a sense of whether the story
of the app makes sense.

7
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:22,020
Could users go through and
actually make sense of the app?

8
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:23,930
Could they do the things
we wanted them to?

9
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:27,728
When considering whether the prototype
got us the information we needed,

10
00:00:27,728 --> 00:00:31,040
we need to look at whether we have
answers to all the critical questions

11
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,560
around our app's story.

12
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,710
Questions about how to fix flaws in
our app, after we have found them,

13
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:36,820
may also become critical.

14
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:42,490
The only way to find this out is to look
at the feedback we got from our users.

15
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:45,070
Here I have the notes I took from
the conversation with Hugh and

16
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:48,860
Poornima about this, and it looks like
we got pretty solid feedback on that.

17
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:51,430
Both of them jumped straight to
the floating action button, and

18
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:53,420
were certain that it
did the right thing.

19
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:55,530
We can call that part
of our app a success.
