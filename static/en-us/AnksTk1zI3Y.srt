00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,010
So here is one possible answer,
using the older join format.

2
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:07,526
Select animal set name,
from animals join diet,

3
00:00:07,526 --> 00:00:13,440
on animals.species equals diet.species,
where food equals fish.

4
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:17,530
And here's one using
the new simple join syntax.

5
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:20,103
Select name, from animals comma diet.

6
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:25,287
Where animals.species
equals diet.species.

7
00:00:25,287 --> 00:00:27,820
And, diet.food equals fish.

8
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:31,430
So here, not only do we find
all of the fish eating animals.

9
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:36,940
We also found out that the columns that
you use in a join, in either form, don't

10
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:40,780
actually have to be among the columns
that you asked for in the query result.
