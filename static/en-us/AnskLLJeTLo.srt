00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:03,939
Two-way associations are trickier than one-way association.

2
00:00:03,939 --> 00:00:08,330
One approach is to just duplicate the approach we had with one-way associations.

3
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:15,300
That is have your attribute in class A pointing to an instance in class B and

4
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:20,370
have in class B, an attribute which points to an instance in class A.

5
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:21,428
Or you could do these with,

6
00:00:21,428 --> 00:00:24,300
with vectors if there's many, too many relationships.

7
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,010
You can use this approach if

8
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:30,260
if you don't run into referential integrity constraints.

9
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:33,240
If you have referential integrity constraints, you have to make sure, for

10
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:37,300
example, when you're deleting an element from a vector in instance of class A,

11
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:41,220
that you also go over and find the instance in class B.

12
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:44,950
And look in its vector to find the back pointer over to the instance in

13
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:46,770
class A and make sure that's deleted.

14
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:49,410
Puts an extra burden and complexity on your program.

15
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:52,880
An alternative to having a symmetric solution is to

16
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:56,200
just have pointers in one direction.

17
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:00,996
If you want to traverse in the other direction, you have to do a search.

18
00:01:00,996 --> 00:01:04,160
So, let's say we'd like to go from an instance in class B

19
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,200
to an instance in class A.

20
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:09,430
First you have to find that instance in class B and

21
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:14,030
from it go back and find the instance in class A.

22
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:15,190
It's extra work.

23
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:18,740
And a third approach I want to mention is to use associations themselves

24
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:19,430
as objects.
