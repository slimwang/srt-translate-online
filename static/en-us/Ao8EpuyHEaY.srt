1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,910
The next step is to create
the Geofencing pending intent.

2
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:07,160
So, the best first thing to do is create
a function that returns a pending

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:09,330
intent, like this.

4
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:12,724
You can call it whatever you like, but
I've called it getGeofencePendingIntent.

5
00:00:12,724 --> 00:00:13,864
Inside this function,

6
00:00:13,864 --> 00:00:16,947
you're going to create a new intent
with some kind of parameters.

7
00:00:16,947 --> 00:00:18,539
What do you think they may be?

8
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:22,682
And then, you're going to return a
PendingIntent.getService with some kind

9
00:00:22,682 --> 00:00:23,690
of parameters.

10
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:25,450
What do you think they may be?

11
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:27,560
Give it a shot, and
then check this box when you're done.
