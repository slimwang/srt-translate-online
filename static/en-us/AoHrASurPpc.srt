00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,859
So to help us understand this,

2
00:00:01,859 --> 00:00:04,310
here's a simple quiz I want you to play around with.

3
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:08,270
I have two different smaller six by six sample images here, and

4
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:10,550
we want to blend them or merge them together.

5
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:13,780
And here my question to you is, where would we find the best seam?

6
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:17,969
So here is a simple example of two simple six by six images, and the question we

7
00:00:17,969 --> 00:00:21,706
want to look at is, which are the best possible seams where would we cut

8
00:00:21,706 --> 00:00:26,440
these two images, the left image and the right image, to generate a new image.

9
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:30,000
The output we want is basically an image that's blended like this.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,190
Just mark out the pixel boundaries in this example where you

11
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:36,440
think these seams should be.
