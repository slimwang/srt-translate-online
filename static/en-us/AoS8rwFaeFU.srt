00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,770
So welcome to Unit 2. In the last unit we encountered three computer scientists

2
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:08,400
as I hope you'll remember, Alice, Bob, and Carol.

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:13,640
And as you'll recall, all three were working on rather tough problems

4
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:16,470
for which they weren't able to find an efficient algorithm.

5
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:23,180
Alice was working in telecommunications, and her task was for the network of her employer

6
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:29,160
to find the minimum number of monitoring devices that needed to be installed

7
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:33,110
to monitor all cables in the telecommunications network.

8
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:39,950
Bob was working in bioinformatics, and his job was to find clusters of data in genetic analysis.

9
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:44,910
And finally, Carol was working in finance and she has been tasked with

10
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:50,080
selecting a portfolio of assets that consists of as many assets as possible

11
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:55,600
but it has to observe a number of restrictions, which assets she can put together in one portfolio.

12
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,560
Now, at the end of the last unit, we stated these problems as problems on graphs

13
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:04,709
and we're going to do a little recall quiz here to see if you remember

14
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:08,360
which problems they were working on when we stated this as a graph problem.

15
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:13,380
The three problems we're looking at were called independent set, clique, and vertex cover

16
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:18,300
and all of those three problems took as input a graph with n vertices.

17
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:22,840
For independent set, you were then looking for the maximum number of vertices

18
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:26,420
where none of those vertices you have selected are connected to each other.

19
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:29,320
For clique, you were looking for a maximum number of vertices

20
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,420
where all of them are connected.

21
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:36,360
And for vertex cover, we were looking for a minimum number of vertices to cover all edges

22
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:42,800
meaning that every edge must have at least one endpoint in the set of vertices that we selected.

23
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:47,390
So here's our first quiz and I would like to see if you remember

24
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:50,770
which of these computer scientists, so Alice working in telecommunications,

25
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:54,310
Bob working in bioinformatics, and Carol working in finance,

26
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:58,600
which of these computer scientists were working on which of these problems here?

27
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:02,700
And they way I want you to answer this is for each of the problems just select if

28
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:06,880
that was the problem that Alice was working on, or the problem that Bob was working on,

29
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,919
or the problem that Carol was working on.

30
00:02:08,919 --> 99:59:59,999
And the same here for clique and vertex cover.
