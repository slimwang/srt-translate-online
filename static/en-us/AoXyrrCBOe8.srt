00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,839
Great, we're almost done.

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:04,580
The last step is to write
a method that will use the result

3
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:08,780
of the computeValue method to
determine which action, a, b, or

4
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:12,400
c, is the best first action for the MDP.

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,540
Here is the stub for
the method bestFirstAction.

6
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:17,390
I'll leave it up to you to fill it in.

7
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:20,920
As always, refer to the Java docs for
help finding any methods or

8
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:23,580
objects that will help
in solving the problem.

9
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:27,050
Also, feel free to add more fields or
helper methods if you need to.

10
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:27,550
Good luck.
