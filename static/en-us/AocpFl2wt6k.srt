00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:06,125
Now you learned before that in a normal distribution, about 68% are within one

2
00:00:06,125 --> 00:00:12,088
standard deviation of the mean and 95% are within two standard deviations of the

3
00:00:12,088 --> 00:00:17,350
mean. But this is for regular, normally distributed population. Here we're

4
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:21,890
talking about the sampling distribution. So each score in the data set is a

5
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:28,100
mean, and the standard deviation is the population standard deviation divided by

6
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:35,242
the square root of the sample size N. So 95% of sample means will fall within

7
00:00:35,242 --> 00:00:41,313
two times the standard error of the population mean.
