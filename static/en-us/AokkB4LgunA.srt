00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,860
I think that the push ID
sounds like a good idea.

2
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:06,150
The end goal is that we're going to
make a value event listener.

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:09,090
And we need to have a Firebase
location to do this.

4
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:12,210
The shopping list name is not
part of the Firebase location.

5
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:15,800
I can actually show you that the list
name is not part of the list location

6
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:19,960
by going into the database,
clicking on one of these lists and

7
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:22,750
we can see our URL location up here.

8
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:26,270
It's the base URL, active lists,
and then the push ID.

9
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:28,030
There's no name in here.

10
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:30,330
So shopping list name
is not a good choice.

11
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:33,290
Now we could try to use a Firebase
reference object that's pointing

12
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:34,780
to the right location.

13
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:38,100
But putting anything in an intent,
other than a primitive value or

14
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:43,150
a string, requires serialization of one
form or another, which adds code bulk.

15
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:47,750
The push ID is the only changing part
of the location of a shopping list and

16
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:49,990
it's essentially just a fancy string.

17
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:53,610
So this is easy to pass
in an intent extra.

18
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:55,050
So push ID makes the most sense.
