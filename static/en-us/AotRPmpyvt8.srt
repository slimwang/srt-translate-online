1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:03,650
All right, so were actually two
correct answers to this question and

2
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:07,580
they were padding and layout_margin.

3
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:10,850
So you could have select either one
of these but you don't need both.

4
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:12,460
Let me show you why.

5
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:15,030
In practice, a lot of times,
a view that uses

6
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:18,830
padding will look very similar to
a view that uses layout_margin.

7
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:21,550
Let me actually draw
the view borders for you.

8
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:23,148
Once you draw the view borders,

9
00:00:23,148 --> 00:00:26,651
you could actually see the difference
between these two situations.

10
00:00:26,651 --> 00:00:27,815
In the case of padding,

11
00:00:27,815 --> 00:00:31,438
you're making the actual view larger
by adding space inside of The view.

12
00:00:32,494 --> 00:00:35,875
In the case of layout_margin,
you're adding space around the view, but

13
00:00:35,875 --> 00:00:37,685
not actually changing
the size of the view.

14
00:00:38,835 --> 00:00:42,185
Now, you might be wondering when
does this even come into play?

15
00:00:42,185 --> 00:00:44,375
Why have two different attributes?

16
00:00:44,375 --> 00:00:47,655
Well, if I were to do something
like add a border or a background

17
00:00:47,655 --> 00:00:51,080
color to both of these views,
they'd actually look pretty different.

18
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:54,190
In our case, though, we're not adding
a border or background color, so

19
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:57,060
you can pick either padding or
layout_margin.

20
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:59,260
It just wouldn't make
sense to pick both.

21
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:03,050
Since we can choose either, I'm going to
go ahead and, a bit arbitrarily,

22
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:04,700
choose to add padding.

23
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:07,110
Let's see what this would
look like in Android Studio.

24
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:09,990
All right,
here we are back in activity_main.

25
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:12,990
Now the padding attribute is something
that we want to add to the TextViews

26
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:15,790
to move them farther away
from the side of the screen.

27
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:19,580
Padding and layout_margin
add space on all four sides.

28
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:20,680
All right, let's go ahead and add it.

29
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:25,090
And remember, I said that I wanted
there to be 20dp on all sides, so

30
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:27,110
that's what I'm putting
right here as the value.

31
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:29,990
My preview is updated to
show the added space,

32
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:31,710
I'm going to go ahead and scroll down.

33
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:34,654
All right, and I'm feeling a little bit
playful, so I'm going to go ahead and

34
00:01:34,654 --> 00:01:37,880
add layout_margin to this
TextView instead of padding.

35
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:40,520
All right, and
that also scooted the TextView out.

36
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:41,150
Notice, though,

37
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:45,370
that the TextView's size didn't increase
when I changed the layout_margin,

38
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:51,040
whereas up here in this TextView, the
size of the actual TextView has changed.

39
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,780
Now what happens if I add both
layout_margin and padding.

40
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:54,350
Let's take a look.

41
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:58,226
Well, now my text is
40dp away from the wall.

42
00:01:58,226 --> 00:02:02,244
It's 20dp here and
then another 20dp of padding here.

43
00:02:02,244 --> 00:02:04,322
All right, but
we don't want 40dp away from the wall.

44
00:02:04,322 --> 00:02:05,822
So I'm going to go ahead and
delete this.

45
00:02:07,634 --> 00:02:10,780
Okay, 20dp of padding in the From,
Lyla TextView.

46
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:14,020
And 20dp of padding and
the Happy Birthday, Ben text view.

47
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:15,460
Awesome, let's run this on our phone.

48
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:19,970
All right, and may I present to you
the finished Birthday Card app.

49
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:20,910
Let's get some jazz hands.

50
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:24,780
And with that, we complete
the last thing in our to-do list.
