00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,530
So a word is just something that has meaning that speakers

2
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:07,290
of a language will understand. We could define words as just

3
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:09,460
what's in the dictionary, and then there would be a clear

4
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:11,440
answer for that. But certainly there are lots of things that

5
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,360
are words that aren't in the dictionary. And the important thing

6
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:17,530
about words is that we have rules for making new words.

7
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:20,140
For example we have a rule that says if we have

8
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:25,310
a word, we can make a new word by adding counter in

9
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:26,240
front of the old word.

10
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,415
I'm using the same notation that we used back in unit

11
00:00:31,415 --> 00:00:34,950
one. This is a BNF replacement grammar. If you need a refresher

12
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:37,750
on this, please go back to the video that introduced that

13
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:41,420
in unit one. But the basic property is that we can replace

14
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:43,690
what's on the left side with what's on the right side.

15
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:47,020
So, anytime we have a word, we can replace it with counter-word.

16
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:49,450
And the meaning of the new word is something that goes

17
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:54,110
against the original word. So, if we started with the word, intelligence,

18
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:56,950
and I mean this in the sense of spy

19
00:00:56,950 --> 00:01:00,340
craft. Not in terms of smarts. Well then, we can

20
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:05,680
use the rule. We can make the word, counter-intelligence. Intelligence

21
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,080
was a word. We added counter in front of it

22
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,350
to make counter-intelligence. And that means trying to thwart

23
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:14,910
intelligence from the enemy. We can use the rule again,

24
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:18,230
so now this is a word, and we can replace

25
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:21,270
this word with counter in front of that word, and

26
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:25,420
we get counter-counter-intelligence. And that would be trying

27
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:28,610
to thwart the enemy's counter intelligence, that's preventing you

28
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:31,340
from getting intelligence. And we could keep doing

29
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:37,060
that. We could have counter-counter-counter-intelligence. And so forth, and

30
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:38,980
these are words that, once we get up

31
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:40,970
to at least three counters, it's not something that's

32
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:44,010
used before. But it's still something that has

33
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:46,400
a sensible meaning, and we could do this for

34
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:50,475
other words. So we saw that one of the very long words was this

35
00:01:50,475 --> 00:01:58,340
hippopotomonstrosesquippedaliophobia.

36
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:03,120
And if you knew that this word meant fear of long words. Even if you've never

37
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:07,845
seen the words counter in front of that before. So now we can make the new word

38
00:02:07,845 --> 00:02:17,845
counter-hippopotomonstrosesquippedaliophobia.

39
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:26,810
Quite a mouthful. But even though you've never seen

40
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:28,710
that word before. And I expect most of you

41
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:30,600
have never seen that word before. Well, you could

42
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,960
guess that this is something that goes against the fear

43
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,690
of long words. Maybe, there's some new medication that

44
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:39,536
cures people of this phobia. And you could also figure

45
00:02:39,536 --> 00:02:43,336
out, well, if there was a counter-counter-hippo and so

46
00:02:43,336 --> 00:02:48,355
forth phobia. Well that would be something that counteracts the

47
00:02:48,355 --> 00:02:51,450
counter-hippo, and that might be something where this

48
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:53,840
new drug doesn't work if you have too much

49
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,250
coffee. Then coffee would be a counter-counter-hippo so

50
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:01,520
forth phobia. So the point is, because English has

51
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,930
this rule that allows us to make new

52
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:07,590
words from old words. There's no such thing as

53
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:09,170
the longest word, we can always make a

54
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:12,510
longer word, starting from any word that we have.

55
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:17,030
If you remember how BNF grammars work, then

56
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,040
you should be able to answer the next quiz.
