1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,390
There are various types of
ad formats that game and

2
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:06,117
app developers can put into their apps.

3
00:00:06,117 --> 00:00:11,120
The first and
most familiar to people are banners.

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:15,930
And probably the newest that
you'll see used are video ads.

5
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:18,600
There's different reasons you
might want to choose each.

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,110
Of course,
it depends on the type of app,

7
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:22,010
but there are also some other factors.

8
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,820
What's the location of
most of your users?

9
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:29,180
Do you have an in game economy if you're
trying to offer rewarded, videos for

10
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:29,740
instance?

11
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:32,350
You have to take those into accounts.

12
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:35,740
Understanding the payouts is a really
important part of understanding your

13
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:37,870
game monetization strategy.

14
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:41,810
So ads pay according to
how the advertiser bids.

15
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:44,220
These completely range.

16
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:48,590
Understanding all of these
is important because

17
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,830
they're going to determine when
you're looking at your analytics.

18
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:52,550
Why you are or are not getting paid?

19
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:54,900
And then you can optimize the ads, so

20
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:59,280
that it's a greater likelihood
somebody's going to engage with them.

21
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:04,269
If it's a cost for per completed view
and your doing a rewarded video ad then

22
00:01:04,269 --> 00:01:08,440
maybe you want to show your video ads
right at the point where somebody needs

23
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:13,590
whatever say your offering
them extra life in your game.

24
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:17,390
Well you want to show that video
ad right where somebody needs it.

25
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:19,700
So that they're more likely
to complete the view,

26
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:20,960
so you're more likely to get paid.

27
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:28,970
If you're say, monetizing from cost
per install ads then you probably

28
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:33,210
don't want to bombard your users with
interstitials pop up ads because

29
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:37,710
they're going to see them, accidentally
click on them and then never install.

30
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:41,955
The ad networks themselves are going to
be optimizing based on the performance

31
00:01:41,955 --> 00:01:44,800
of the ads within your app or game.

32
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:49,200
So if they see something that looks odd
or has a really low conversion rate,

33
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,860
you're less likely to get ads served or

34
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:55,350
even high quality ads
served to your app or game.

35
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:57,970
So it's really important to keep
an eye on those analytics and

36
00:01:57,970 --> 00:01:59,650
then work with whoever
the providers are,

37
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:03,130
to make sure that you're
delivering the right results.

38
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:04,910
Mainly when choosing an ad partner,

39
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:08,680
it's important to choose ones that
offer features that you're looking for.

40
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:11,480
These features might be cross promotion.

41
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:16,330
So if you want to have the ad network do
double duty for you so that you can also

42
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:21,360
do things like promote in game items or
perhaps promote your next title.

43
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,480
It's important to choose an ad network
that can satisfy those objectives.

44
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:29,390
Another feature that some ad networks
have that people like to choose from

45
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:31,160
are things like transparency.

46
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:34,340
Can I see all of the ads that have
been shown if I have a kid's game, for

47
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:35,250
instance?

48
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:39,990
I want to make sure that the ads that my
players are seeing are age appropriate.

49
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:43,350
If I have a really sophisticated
back end that I'm working with,

50
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:47,600
I might want to choose an ad network
that has APIs that I can work with.

51
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:51,290
Perhaps I want to choose an ad
network that functions well with

52
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:53,400
other elements within my game.

53
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:59,310
For instance, If I'm using something
like Unity to build my game,

54
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:02,880
a development platform then I want to
choose ad networks that have plugins.

55
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:06,390
If I'm using a mediator, I want to
choose ad networks that I can then

56
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:09,140
plug into that mediator and
that all work nicely together.
