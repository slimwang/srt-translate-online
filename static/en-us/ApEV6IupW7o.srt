Hi and welcome to Descriptive Statistics. Whether you're

2
00:00:03,469 --> 00:00:06,910
a financial advisor, sports coach, or the everyday person,

3
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:10,100
statistics allows you to summarize data and shapes how

4
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:12,550
we make decisions. In the first half of our

5
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:15,160
statistics series, you will learn how to compute

6
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:17,960
values from data by hand, and by using Google

7
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:20,990
spreadsheets. By the end of this course, you'll have

8
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:26,100
the tools necessary to gather, organize, compute and visualize

9
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:29,530
information from a data-set. And for the final project, you'll

10
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:33,010
use the tools you have learned to compute statistics hidden within

11
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:35,720
a deck of cards. So I'll let Katie Corminick take

12
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:37,870
over from here so you can get started with the class.
