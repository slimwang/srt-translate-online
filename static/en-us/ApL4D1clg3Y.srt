1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:04,148
So, how do these different sequences result in different traits, like for

2
00:00:04,148 --> 00:00:07,269
example you have blue eyes and I have brown?

3
00:00:07,269 --> 00:00:10,899
>> Right, so obviously not everyone has the same genetic sequence for every gene,

4
00:00:10,899 --> 00:00:15,892
the stuff that codes for us. Now, in the example of eye color, the eye color

5
00:00:15,892 --> 00:00:19,865
gene can come in different versions. Now, in genetics, we have a word for this

6
00:00:19,865 --> 00:00:23,904
and it's called and allele. So, you could have the sequence that codes for

7
00:00:23,904 --> 00:00:28,300
brown eyes and we would call that the brown allele or the brown version.

8
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:32,234
Alternatively, you could have the sequence that codes for blue eyes. We call

9
00:00:32,234 --> 00:00:35,760
this the blue allele or the blue version of the gene. Now, if we carry this out

10
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,162
in an experiment, like a thought experiment, where you get one brown allele

11
00:00:39,162 --> 00:00:42,672
from one parent and another brown allele from another parent, what color eyes

12
00:00:42,672 --> 00:00:46,790
do you think the children are going to have?

13
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:47,330
>> Brown.

14
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:50,859
>> Right. They're going to have brown. So, it's pretty simple. We could also do

15
00:00:50,859 --> 00:00:53,900
the experiment with the blue alleles. If you get one blue allele from mom and

16
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:57,610
one blue allele from dad, what color eyes do you think you're going to have? >> Blue.

17
00:00:57,610 --> 00:01:01,065
>> You're going to have blue. But it gets interesting when we have to figure out

18
00:01:01,065 --> 00:01:03,810
what happens in the mixed situation, where you get a brown allele from one

19
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:08,528
parent and a blue allele from another parent. In this case, what color eyes do

20
00:01:08,528 --> 00:01:10,760
you think the children are going to have?

21
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,380
>> I don't know, why don't you answer this one.
