1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,150
And here is my solution. These are two update

2
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:03,810
lines. They’re basically identical except one

3
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:05,900
goes in one direction and the other direction.

4
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:07,961
Let’s look at the first; we have an update

5
00:00:07,961 --> 00:00:11,946
weight over here. We add two times our

6
00:00:11,946 --> 00:00:14,762
new constraint with the index I minus 1. This

7
00:00:14,762 --> 00:00:18,845
is the subtract part. We subtract I minus 2 and

8
00:00:18,845 --> 00:00:21,295
we subtract the original on the right side over

9
00:00:21,295 --> 00:00:23,912
here. It’s exactly the math I’ve given you.

10
00:00:23,912 --> 00:00:26,492
Same over here. If you won this math , you

11
00:00:26,492 --> 00:00:28,445
get this new smooth curve. I should warn you,

12
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:30,599
this can be unstable, it can give you results that

13
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:32,659
are very poor you have to adjust these parameters

14
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:34,862
very carefully and this is one of many ways to

15
00:00:34,862 --> 00:00:36,260
smooth. There is many other ways to smooth,

16
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:38,954
but the nice thing that you achieve here is that

17
00:00:38,954 --> 00:00:41,259
you get actually smooth two points that they

18
00:00:41,259 --> 00:00:42,902
are holding fixed, which is actually

19
00:00:42,902 --> 00:00:46,000
really, really useful.
