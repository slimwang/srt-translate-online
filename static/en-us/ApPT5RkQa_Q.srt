1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:04,620
The first two are equal to negative 1, the 3rd one is equal to positive 1, and

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:08,788
the last one is something else. We know these first two are equal to negative 1

3
00:00:08,788 --> 00:00:13,040
since each rational expression contains opposite polynomials. The x terms are

4
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:17,284
opposite in sign here, and the y terms are also opposite in sign. So we know

5
00:00:17,284 --> 00:00:21,930
that this fraction can simplify to negative 1. The same is true for this

6
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:26,546
fraction. The b squared terms are opposite in sign, the 5b terms are opposite in

7
00:00:26,546 --> 00:00:31,091
sign and the constant of 1 is also opposite in sign. I didn't show the factoring

8
00:00:31,091 --> 00:00:34,910
here, but we know that it will equal negative 1 if we remove a factor of

9
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:39,398
negative 1 from the denominator and cancel our trinomial. In our third example,

10
00:00:39,398 --> 00:00:43,666
the y terms have the same sign, and the x terms have the same sign. So really,

11
00:00:43,666 --> 00:00:47,926
this fraction is the same expression. In this third rational expression, the y

12
00:00:47,926 --> 00:00:52,592
terms have the same sign, as do the x terms. If we switch the order of addition

13
00:00:52,592 --> 00:00:57,194
in the numerator, we'll have x minus y divided by the quantity x minus y. We

14
00:00:57,194 --> 00:01:01,802
know these expressions are exactly the same, so we really have 1 divided by 1,

15
00:01:01,802 --> 00:01:06,034
or just positive 1. For this last expression, we know it needs to equal

16
00:01:06,034 --> 00:01:10,570
something else. We can't just square each term and call it a day. We know that

17
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:16,308
this is really x plus 2 times x plus 2. When we square a binomial, we get a

18
00:01:16,308 --> 00:01:21,230
perfect square trinomial. Looking at this numerator and denominator, we know

19
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:24,634
that our fraction doesn't equal positive 1 or negative 1.
