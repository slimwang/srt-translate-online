00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,105
Many of you are probably already
familiar with the idea of MOOCs.

2
00:00:03,105 --> 00:00:06,235
MOOCs stand for
Massive Open Online Course.

3
00:00:06,235 --> 00:00:09,364
MOOCs are courses that are delivered
to the masses without scaling up our

4
00:00:09,364 --> 00:00:12,250
teaching resources to match
the number of students who register.

5
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:14,800
Doesn't matter if 100
students register or 100,000.

6
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:18,810
We still have the same initial
resource allocation for that course.

7
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:20,560
A lot of companies nowadays
are producing MOOCs.

8
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:21,810
Coursera is producing MOOCs.

9
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:23,050
edX is producing MOOCs.

10
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:25,220
Udacity actually got
started producing MOOCs,

11
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:28,990
although has since has pivoted away
on a more credentialed approach.

12
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:31,520
There are a lot of interesting
constraints that we wrestle with when

13
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:32,380
producing MOOCs.

14
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:34,810
For one thing,
many of them are available for free.

15
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:36,362
And when it's available for free,

16
00:00:36,362 --> 00:00:38,750
we need to minimize our
initial resource investment.

17
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:42,640
So that means we really need to be very
clever about how we design our MOOCs.

18
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,695
We need to be clever about how we design
our video material, so that we're not

19
00:00:45,695 --> 00:00:48,468
expending a whole lot of money to
produce really excellent lectures or

20
00:00:48,468 --> 00:00:49,740
anything like that.

21
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:51,780
We need to be clever about how
we design our assessments.

22
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:54,360
Assessments in MOOCs can
often be kind of trivial,

23
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:57,270
if they're just based on some
little multiple choice questions.

24
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:01,820
How do we design good assessments that
don't require us to hire an army of TAs,

25
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:05,170
or an army of graders to
evaluate all those assessments?

26
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:08,170
These are all very interesting issues
that we face when developing good,

27
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:09,660
massive open online courses.

28
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:12,310
And then really what we're
going to focus on in this lesson.

29
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:15,880
How do we develop good video material,
good assessments, good grading,

30
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:19,360
good things like that without
investing just a lot of money into

31
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,490
reaching all these students?
