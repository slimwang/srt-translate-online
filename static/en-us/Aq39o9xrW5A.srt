1
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:04,260
I wanted to revisit the chart that we created at the end of

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:06,340
the last live coding session.

3
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:11,280
Hopefully one thing that you noticed that was conspicuously absent was any

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,190
sort of context around the chart.

5
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:18,880
The most extreme example of this might be a chart without any labels or

6
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:23,640
axis, or even a title, but this may seems silly.

7
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,530
Most charts would at least have axis and tick marks, but

8
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:32,509
even with axis and tick marks, and values at those axis and

9
00:00:32,509 --> 00:00:38,540
tick marks, unless we label with the y and with the x coordinates, represent.

10
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:43,018
It's very hard for a reader to interpret what's actually being displayed.

11
00:00:43,018 --> 00:00:47,210
You always want to make sure that any chart you create has both

12
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:49,070
clearly displayed units.

13
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:55,490
In this case, millions for the attendance, and years for the x axis.

14
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:57,680
As well as informative labels.

15
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:01,170
That shouldn't require any additional explanation.

16
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:06,260
If I label the x axis year, it should be readily understandable to a reader.

17
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:10,570
And the same applies to the y axis of attendance.

18
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:15,200
But even with these additions of label tick marks with clear units.

19
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,310
And labels on the y and x axis.

20
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:23,229
A reader still left in the dark about what's actually being displayed.

21
00:01:23,229 --> 00:01:29,007
For this chart, before we add the title, even though we have an idea

22
00:01:29,007 --> 00:01:35,930
some attendance plotted against years between 1930 and 2014.

23
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:39,065
We don't know what the attendance actually represents.

24
00:01:39,065 --> 00:01:41,132
The chart's quite meaningless.

25
00:01:41,132 --> 00:01:43,653
As you can see even the simplest additions,

26
00:01:43,653 --> 00:01:47,471
can have profound effects on how interpretable your chart is, and

27
00:01:47,471 --> 00:01:50,436
how effectively you convey your overall message.

28
00:01:50,436 --> 00:01:55,120
And while dimple.js might be great for many common chart types, and

29
00:01:55,120 --> 00:02:01,240
allows us the flexibility to adapt them by exposing the underlying d3 objects.

30
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:05,160
We will begin to start customizing and adding to our chart, enough so

31
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:08,758
that it makes sense to work at the level of d3 itself.

32
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:13,460
Part of this is due to the fact that d3 is much more flexible, and allows for

33
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:17,650
complex interaction and animation in your graphics.

34
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:21,480
And the third point while it may not be relevant to someone who's

35
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:25,590
creating graphics in production, or has already learned d3,

36
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:30,770
this being a course to learn about visualization by working with d3, it really

37
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:36,460
helps you to understand what higher level libraries are doing such as dimple JS.

38
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:40,780
How to debug their issues when they do arise, and to feel more confident about

39
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:44,560
what's going on with the library itself and how to adapt it.
