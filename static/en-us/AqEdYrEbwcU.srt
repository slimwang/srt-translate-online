00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,349
We know the b represents the y-intercept. We can see the y-intercept was 3 or

2
00:00:04,349 --> 00:00:08,924
positive 3 and here the y-intercept was negative 1 just like in our equation. So

3
00:00:08,924 --> 00:00:13,548
the only thing that changed between these two equations was the y-intercepts and

4
00:00:13,548 --> 00:00:15,462
we can also see that on the graph.
