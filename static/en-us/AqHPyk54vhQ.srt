1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:03,545
And I'd like to talk about another pattern that's very common when designing

2
00:00:03,545 --> 00:00:08,635
classes. We'll say that the class has a property if it has a value that one can

3
00:00:08,635 --> 00:00:16,394
simply get and set. Look at a person, a person has a name. That's a private

4
00:00:16,394 --> 00:00:20,796
instance variable, so we'll have a getter that returns the name and here we

5
00:00:20,796 --> 00:00:25,127
have a setter that you can use to set the name to a new name incase the person

6
00:00:25,127 --> 00:00:32,835
for whatever reason is unhappy with the previous one. It's very very common to

7
00:00:32,835 --> 00:00:37,175
have this pattern instance variable getter setter there some variations

8
00:00:37,175 --> 00:00:41,585
sometimes you do some error checking in the setter here we check that the new

9
00:00:41,585 --> 00:00:49,180
name, is not the empty string, cause no one's name should be the empty string.

10
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:54,120
Or, maybe, in a particular application it just shouldn't be allowed to change

11
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:59,470
the name, in that case, there wouldn't be a setter. This is a read only

12
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:03,314
property in this example where we just have, the instance variable and the

13
00:01:03,314 --> 00:01:10,480
corresponding getter. Now, properties, meaning private instance variables with

14
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:14,980
getters and maybe setters are very common. But that doesn't mean that you

15
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:20,626
should make every instance variable a property with a getter and setter. Only

16
00:01:20,626 --> 00:01:25,915
use the getters when there is a need for the user of the class. To read the

17
00:01:25,915 --> 00:01:30,075
instance variable and only supply a setter when there is a need for the user to

18
00:01:30,075 --> 00:01:36,331
modify it, many instance variables do not have getters and setters. Well let's

19
00:01:36,331 --> 00:01:40,556
practice that with yet another variation of the car class, this car class has a

20
00:01:40,556 --> 00:01:44,651
number of instance variables and I'd like you to look it over and add getters

21
00:01:44,651 --> 00:01:48,876
and setters for those where it's appropriate, and not add them for those where

22
00:01:48,876 --> 00:01:52,583
it's not.
