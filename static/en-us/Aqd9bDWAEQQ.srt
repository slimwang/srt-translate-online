1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:04,460
The biggest threat to Diffie-Hellman
key exchange is the so-called

2
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:06,090
bucket brigade attack.

3
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:08,520
It is a kind of
man-in-the-middle attack.

4
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:10,910
That is Trudy, the adversary,

5
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:15,640
can intercept the message
you that Alice sends to Bob.

6
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:20,580
And instead,
Trudy sends her own yx to Bob.

7
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:24,930
And fooling Bob to accept this as you.

8
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:30,270
Likewise, Trudy intercepts
Yb that Bob sends to Alice,

9
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:34,050
and instead sends her own Yx to Alice.

10
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:39,280
Fooling Alice to believe
that Yx is actually Yb.

11
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,940
And the result is that the shared
key that Alice computes,

12
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:47,940
is actually the shared key
between Alice and Trudy.

13
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:51,320
And likewise,
the shared key that Bob computes,

14
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:55,080
is actually the shared key
between Trudy and Bob.

15
00:00:55,080 --> 00:01:01,100
In other words, Trudy Plays Bob
to Alice, and Alice to Bob.

16
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:05,019
This man in the middle attack is
possible because the Diffieâ€“Hellman key

17
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:09,640
exchange protocol does not
authenticate Alice or Bob.

18
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,830
For example, there's no way for

19
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:16,570
Alice to know that the message that
she receives is really from Bob.

20
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:18,650
There are a number of ways to fix this.

21
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:22,960
For example, everyone, for
example, Alice and Bob,

22
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:27,990
can publish her or
his public key, you or Yx.

23
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:32,620
That is, instead of having to send it
and risk interception and forgery,

24
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:38,350
just publish you or
Yb at a public trusted site.

25
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:44,850
Or, if Alice has already published her
RSA public key, she can signed you when

26
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:50,500
she sends it to Bob, so that Bob would
know that you is really from Alice.

27
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:54,730
Because Bob can verify that
uses Alice's RSA public key.
