00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,459
>> All scores in the distribution affect the mean. Think of the mean like a

2
00:00:04,459 --> 00:00:09,275
teeter-totter. Where should the pivot go so that it balances? These rocks or

3
00:00:09,275 --> 00:00:13,872
balls represent the salaries of the Geography majors. Now, if this were a

4
00:00:13,872 --> 00:00:18,986
teeter-totter, where should the pivot go so that it balances? That's basically

5
00:00:18,986 --> 00:00:24,056
the mean, which in this data set of the salaries of Geography majors is 47,718,

6
00:00:24,056 --> 00:00:29,329
like you calculated. Now, if we were to add another ball, say here, then the

7
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:34,833
teeter-totter would tip, therefore, the pivot would have to move this way so

8
00:00:34,833 --> 00:00:40,185
that it keeps balancing. So, you can see that all scores affect the mean. You've

9
00:00:40,185 --> 00:00:45,268
also seen that the mean can be described with a formula. We describe the sample

10
00:00:45,268 --> 00:00:50,187
mean as x bar, which is the sum of the values divided by the number of values.

11
00:00:50,187 --> 00:00:55,562
And the population mean, sum of the values, divided by the number in the

12
00:00:55,562 --> 00:01:01,105
population. This is also true that many samples from the same population will

13
00:01:01,105 --> 00:01:06,425
have similar means. For now, I'll just show you this applet again where if we

14
00:01:06,425 --> 00:01:12,339
pick a sample of size 5, we get that the mean is roughly in the middle. And if

15
00:01:12,339 --> 00:01:27,112
we do it again, again, we get that the mean is roughly in the middle. Let's do

16
00:01:27,112 --> 00:01:39,944
it a few more times. Now, we've calculated ten simulated means from this

17
00:01:39,944 --> 00:01:49,228
distribution and they're all roughly similar. This is actually a very important

18
00:01:49,228 --> 00:01:53,421
and awesome concept. And we're going to go into this in a lot more depth later

19
00:01:53,421 --> 00:01:57,732
in the course. Also, the mean of a sample can be used to make inferences about

20
00:01:57,732 --> 00:02:02,036
the population it came from. This relates to this last property of the mean

21
00:02:02,036 --> 00:02:06,176
because you saw that all the samples are pretty similar and that they roughly

22
00:02:06,176 --> 00:02:12,209
approximated the population. It's only the last one that's not a property of the

23
00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:17,554
mean. If we bring up the pivot example again, let's say, we add a stone way out

24
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:22,690
here. Is this going to change the mean? You betcha. It's going to have to go to

25
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:28,091
the left somewhere so that this will still balance. Let's explore this point a

26
00:02:28,091 --> 00:02:29,016
little more.
