1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:02,740
So switching over to Android Studio,

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:07,080
I've created a little app to demonstrate
extracting a pallet from an image.

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:12,350
The first thing we need to do in our
apps file is add the support library for

4
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:14,520
a pallet as a dependency.

5
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:17,550
So after we receive an image
resource identifier for

6
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:21,430
an image, we can load it into our
view and convert it into a bitmap

7
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:25,570
that the palette will use to
generate the color swatches.

8
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:29,650
Alternatively, If we've taken a photo,
we'll receive a bitmap from

9
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:33,200
the camera without the need for
that conversion step.

10
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,700
These color swatches fall into two
different areas, either vibrant or

11
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:39,130
a muted color.

12
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:39,820
The type and

13
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:43,470
number of swatches is dependent
on the composition of your image.

14
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:45,520
And how much of it is
in a certain color and

15
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,040
how that color contrast to
other colors in the image.

16
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:52,880
If you want to read more about that,
you can check the instructors notes for

17
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:55,870
a link to the java docs,
for the palette library.

18
00:00:55,870 --> 00:01:00,200
So right here in this code, I take
the palette and I'm looking through

19
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:05,000
all of the different swatches to see if
they exist before returning a hash mat.

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,900
So let's check it out on a device.

21
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,950
If we hit this floating action
button and pick an image,

22
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:14,790
let's pick something from our
Android Nanodegree kick off.

23
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:16,908
We can see that it's
created a palette for us.

24
00:01:16,908 --> 00:01:19,715
Now, one of the interesting colors here

25
00:01:19,715 --> 00:01:22,865
is this vibrant color from
these Android stickers.

26
00:01:22,865 --> 00:01:27,095
When I click the item it shows
us how many pixels in the image

27
00:01:27,095 --> 00:01:29,205
were from that color.

28
00:01:29,205 --> 00:01:31,695
Next, Roman is going to talk
to you about typography.
