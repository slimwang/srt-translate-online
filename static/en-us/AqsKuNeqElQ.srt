1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,060
Once you finish each project,
you'll submit it to us, and

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:04,340
we'll send it back to you with feedback.

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,140
This feedback will come from
professional iOS developers.

4
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:11,410
You'll submit your entire Xcode project
directories and they'll review your

5
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:14,640
work, line by line, and help you
determine the project's strengths and

6
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:17,920
weaknesses and
find areas where you can improve.

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,190
>> Your evaluation will tell you either
that your project met our specifications

8
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:22,600
or that it hasn't yet.

9
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,760
However, you can submit each project
as many times as you need to for

10
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,640
it to meet our specifications.

11
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:30,800
We believe that projects are a super
important part of your learning process.

12
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,050
Because that process of getting feedback
and making changes in accordance with

13
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:36,870
it, is something that developers
do in the real world all the time.

14
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:40,490
>> No one, not even the most expert
engineer writes perfect code

15
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:41,290
the first time around.

16
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:45,120
So we want you to get in the mindset and
practice of iterating on your work now.
