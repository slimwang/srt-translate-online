00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:06,040
It's usually comforting to break down
a complex task into small doable steps.

2
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:10,150
For instance,
build Tetris isn't a doable task so

3
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:12,190
let's try breaking it down a bit.

4
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:16,129
One of the sub-tasks of building Tetris
would be to draw the tetrominos.

5
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:18,390
Then we need to make
the tetrominos fall.

6
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:20,080
Another aspect would be to make it so

7
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:24,210
that the tetrominos rotate when
you press the left or right keys.

8
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:28,070
And another aspect of Tetris would be to
play a sound when a line in the field of

9
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:29,370
play is complete.

10
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:31,110
Especially if you're
newer to programming,

11
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:35,170
this might just look like breaking down
one impossible thing into a whole bunch

12
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:37,970
of little impossible things.

13
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:39,840
So, as lazy programmers,

14
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,670
what do we do when we come
across an impossible problem?

15
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:46,390
Well, of course, we go find a library
that just does this for us.

16
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:49,610
Actually, since there are a bunch
of capabilities that are often used

17
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:53,000
together in games,
we can usually find a game engine

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,850
that packages up a ton of libraries
into a whole system we can use.
