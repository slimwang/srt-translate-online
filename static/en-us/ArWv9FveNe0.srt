00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,190
One feature of shadows that is not captured well by basic shadow mapping is how

2
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:07,220
lights truly cast shadows. All lights have an area, but shadow mapping assumes

3
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:11,597
the light comes from an infinitesimal point. Unless the real light itself has

4
00:00:11,597 --> 00:00:14,810
an extremely small filament and no diffusing bulb surface, treating it as a

5
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:19,344
point of light is a weak approximation at best. The area fully in shadow, where

6
00:00:19,344 --> 00:00:23,124
no part of the light is visible, is called the umbra. Real lights cast shadows

7
00:00:23,124 --> 00:00:26,500
with areas that are neither fully in shadow nor fully in light. This area of

8
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:29,872
the shadow is called the penumbra. An interesting way to look at the problem is

9
00:00:29,872 --> 00:00:32,518
from the point of view of a location in the penumbra, however much of the area

10
00:00:32,518 --> 00:00:37,489
of the light is visible correlates to how much light the location receives. For

11
00:00:37,489 --> 00:00:40,198
example, the green point on the ground here can see about half of the emitter

12
00:00:40,198 --> 00:00:44,335
above, so it will receive about half the emitter's light. You have the worry

13
00:00:44,335 --> 00:00:47,173
about the angle of the surface normal to the light, the light's distribution of

14
00:00:47,173 --> 00:00:49,796
energy and so on, but the major factor is how much of the light's surface is

15
00:00:49,796 --> 00:00:52,349
visible to each point.
