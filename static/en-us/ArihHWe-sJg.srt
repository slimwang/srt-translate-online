00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,906
In this next quiz you're
going to draw a flower.

2
00:00:02,906 --> 00:00:06,867
You're going to start out by drawing
the stem, with a rect line, and

3
00:00:06,867 --> 00:00:11,030
then draw a couple of leaves
using rotated rectangles.

4
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:13,625
Then finally,
you're going to generate a bunch of

5
00:00:13,625 --> 00:00:16,420
petals by generating rotated
rectangles in a loop.

6
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:20,010
Check out the code in the course
repository and give it a try.
