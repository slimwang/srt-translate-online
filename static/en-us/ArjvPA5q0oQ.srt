00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Here we have a demonstration that the implementation of this algorithm into actual code

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
is not that much more complicated than the mathematical formulas I just described to you.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Here's the function segment, which takes a text, and it does what we just said.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
So it splits the text up into all possible first and rest components,

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
and then the candidates will be the first word plus the best segmentation of the rest,

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and then out of all those candidates we just take the maximum

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
according to the probability of the words

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
where the probability of the words is just the product of the probability of each individual word.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
So that's the naive Bayes assumption coming into this definition,

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
and this is just the definition of how to split something up into a first and rest.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
And you can follow the links in the note to see the source code for this

12
00:00:50,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and play with it on your own if you like.
