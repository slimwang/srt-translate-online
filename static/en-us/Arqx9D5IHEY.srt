00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,963
Let's try to find the zeros then. We can use the rational zero theorem to come

2
00:00:03,963 --> 00:00:08,250
up with some ideas for what our zeros might be. So what are all of the possible

3
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:12,194
rational zeros this test tells us about. Please write them in this box and

4
00:00:12,194 --> 00:00:16,222
separate them by commas. Don't forget the negative numbers.
