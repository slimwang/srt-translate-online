1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Now, in a world where basically that's all you do is you create demand on the left side of the funnel

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
and somebody purchases on the right, you could kind of like measure how much it cost to do that

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
and then we'll talk about customer acquisition cost a little later, but there's a little magic accelerator

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
on the bottom of this funnel, and that's called the viral loop.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,000
A viral loop could be something as simple as somebody bought one of your products in the store

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
and could not wait to tell their friends--wow, this was the greatest thing ever,

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
you can't wait to get them boom.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
You now have kind of a magnifying effect, a viral effect,

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
about selling your product based on users loving it.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Well, this happened for a hundreds of years, but now we could sometimes engineer this viral loop

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
by saying--is there anything that we can do, any incentives, any ways to kind of get rebates,

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
is there a way to turn our customers into sales people to kind of accelerate this purchase

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
to help us get new customers.

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
And Smart Startups think about this loop all the time, so viral loops are something

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
that startups want to see if it's possible to create.

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Now, just don't feel bad if in your company it's really not possible to do viral--

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
for example, in dating sites.

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Not everybody wants to announce to their friends that they are actually visiting a dating site.

19
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
So in some cases it might not be possible, but in other you should always keep your eye out--

20
00:01:31,000 --> 99:59:59,999
is it possible to make this funnel more efficient.
