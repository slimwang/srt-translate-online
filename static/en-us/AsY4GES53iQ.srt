The answer is, inside the for loop. Around this line, I need to check, whether

2
00:00:05,275 --> 00:00:10,420
I'm on an even or an odd count, before I decide what to print. If the counter

3
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:15,772
mod two is one, then I'm on an odd number. On odd numbers, I want to print out,

4
00:00:15,772 --> 00:00:22,485
the counter, and eat. Otherwise, on the even numbers I want to print out sleep.

5
00:00:22,485 --> 00:00:27,670
Lets' see how this works. Looks like I missed the quotation mark. I get what we

6
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:35,499
wanted. Here I could have just said if counter is 1 or 3 or 5. Like this. And

7
00:00:35,499 --> 00:00:39,944
this would still work, as long as I only print six numbers. But if I wanted to

8
00:00:39,944 --> 00:00:46,225
print 12 items, Eliza's list wouldn't have eat after the sixth item.
