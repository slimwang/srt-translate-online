1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:05,860
So let's work a simple example, all right, of finding the fundamental matrix.

2
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:09,280
And bunch of them out there, one that I'm going to show here is

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,490
one that's a little bit different, because it's not as sort of trivial.

4
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:16,530
Here's the one of the, the two side-by-side stereo views.

5
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:18,010
We'll do them a little different.

6
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:23,050
And remember, a fundamental matrix gives a corresponce between any two views.

7
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:27,070
It doesn't matter where the cameras are taken, okay?

8
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:30,940
So, for example, my images could look like this.

9
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:32,860
And you might say whoa.

10
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:34,890
Okay, you might not say whoa because that would be only if you

11
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:36,730
were born in the late 60s, or maybe early 60s.

12
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:41,930
But here I have a picture and the white lines drawn on it are meant to

13
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:45,970
be sort of nominal epipolar lines, I took a picture and

14
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:49,090
then the camera moves forward, and then I take another picture.

15
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:51,110
Can I do a fundamental matrix for that?

16
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:52,530
Of course I can.

17
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:55,643
In fact that's what this geometry is meaning to show here, it's a,

18
00:00:55,643 --> 00:00:57,425
it's a little hard to see, all right.

19
00:00:57,425 --> 00:01:04,110
What I have here is that I took one picture and my camera center was there.

20
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:08,920
And then I take another picture and my camera center is moved forward and

21
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:15,310
if you connect those and slice the image, those are the epipoles.

22
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:17,010
So all the epipolar lines,

23
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:21,820
have to go through the epipole and that's what this is showing you, right.

24
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:23,950
The epipole is right in the middle of my picture.

25
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:25,485
It's not exactly the middle, it's off to,

26
00:01:25,485 --> 00:01:29,020
to the top, it's actually to the side a little bit, I'll show you in a minute.

27
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:31,930
But all the epipolar lines have to go through the epipole, and

28
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:33,660
that's another way of saying is.

29
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:36,440
You know, just think about that intuitively, if I move straight ahead and

30
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:40,780
I'm looking straight, the points move along that diagonal out from the center.

31
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:44,850
So that means that if you give me one point in, in the first image,

32
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:49,060
it's going to be somewhere along that line in the second image.

33
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:52,690
And how far it's along that line will be a function of its depth, okay?

34
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:56,750
Because remember, the amount that the points move, between one image and

35
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,080
the next, function of depth, going way back.

36
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:02,730
Remember disparity, the closer something is, the more it'll be disparate.

37
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:05,640
Something that's very far away like the moon doesn't change much at all.

38
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,350
Okay?

39
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:10,470
So they're going to move along the epipolar lines.

40
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:14,030
So we're going to use this as an example because it'll be very clear whether you

41
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:16,710
got the epi polar lines right or you got the epi polar lines wrong
