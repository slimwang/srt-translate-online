00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,940
If you choose to use MATLAB for

2
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:07,360
this course, you will need base MATLAB along with the image processing toolbox.

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:12,090
Head over to the MathWorks website and look for the latest release.

5
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:17,670
We recommend getting a student edition.

6
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:23,904
You can either choose the MATLAB and Simulink Student Suite,

7
00:00:23,904 --> 00:00:27,860
which includes the image processing toolbox, or, you can

8
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:33,260
choose the base MATLAB portion, and the image processing toolbox separately.

9
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:36,310
Know that you may need MATLAB or

10
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:40,760
specific toolboxes for other courses, so choose wisely.

11
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:45,810
Your institution may also have a volume licensing agreement with MathWorks.

12
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:48,460
So find that out before you download it for yourself.

13
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:53,900
Once you have MATLAB installed, try out a few simple commands.

14
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:56,890
The command window is connected to an interpreter.

15
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:59,870
This is where you will spend most of your time.

16
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:05,980
You can type in arithmetic expressions that are evaluated on the spot.

17
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:08,440
You can also create variables.

18
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:11,930
Note how it printed out the value of the variable here.

19
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:14,789
If you want to suppress that, use a semicolon at the end.

20
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:20,330
You can also create vectors and matrices and run operations on them.

21
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:24,480
You might have noticed this workspace being updated.

22
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:30,402
It lists all the variables currently in memory and the value assigned to them.

23
00:01:30,402 --> 00:01:34,240
There is also a file browser that lists the files in the current folder.

24
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,860
MATLAB has built-in functionality to read images.

25
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:41,490
We will use the imread command.

26
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:44,305
Note that you can use tab completion to make your life easier.

27
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:49,590
Tab completion also works with file names in the current directory.

28
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:51,820
You can display an image using imshow.

29
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:56,630
The image processing toolbox contains several useful commands for

30
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:58,440
working with images.

31
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,830
One of these is rgb2gray.

32
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:05,560
It converts a red-green-blue colored image into a grayscale or monochrome image.

33
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:12,350
The MATLAB website provides great resources to help you get started, including

34
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:19,050
code examples, webinars, and extensive documentation.
