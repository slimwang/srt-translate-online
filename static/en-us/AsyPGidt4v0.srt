1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:05,339
These types of visualizations are a good
way to communicate the story behind

2
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:10,210
the clusters in a way that is more
understandable by management, and

3
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:13,089
the users of the segmentation solution.

4
00:00:13,089 --> 00:00:17,449
Since most business users of your
solution will be more interested

5
00:00:17,449 --> 00:00:21,750
in how the clusters effect their part
of the business, making it easy for

6
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:25,070
them the understand the differences
between the segments,

7
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:27,469
gets them to that point a lot quicker.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,670
It can even be a good idea to start
out the report of the results

9
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:36,939
with some brief names of the clusters
that summarize the findings.

10
00:00:36,939 --> 00:00:39,619
So, in our example exercise,

11
00:00:39,619 --> 00:00:45,119
we could describe Cluster one as the
Grow Anything Anytime segment of stores,

12
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:50,739
or Cluster five could be the Lots
of Snow Half the Year segment.

13
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:55,789
A good example of this is how Experient
handles their consumer segmentation.

14
00:00:55,789 --> 00:01:00,460
They divide up the United States
into 71 different segments, and

15
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:03,579
have given each a name
that provides the user

16
00:01:03,579 --> 00:01:07,519
with a way to quickly understand
the basic makeup of the segment.

17
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:12,799
They have segment names like fast
track couples for newly marrieds,

18
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:17,039
and settled and sensible for
those maybe getting close to retirement.

19
00:01:18,209 --> 00:01:21,599
Then if you need to understand
what is behind those designations,

20
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:24,119
you can dig more thoroughly
into the details.

21
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:29,250
You can download a PDF of their
segment names in the instructor notes.

22
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:31,609
Of course,

23
00:01:31,609 --> 00:01:35,540
after the cluster solution has been
agreed upon by management, the real

24
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:40,219
validation of the solution is through
testing it out in the real world.

25
00:01:40,219 --> 00:01:43,439
In the case of our exercise,
this would be done through

26
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:47,390
the allocation of product
using the created segments.

27
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:48,980
Depending on the business and

28
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:53,870
the use case, it may be appropriate
when starting with segmentation, to run

29
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:58,800
the tests on a limited number of the
objects first for further validation.

30
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,679
This mitigates the risk, for

31
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:04,500
some reason, of being totally
off with the segments, and

32
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:10,120
making the mistake of applying an
invalid solution to the entire business.

33
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,240
As mentioned in an earlier lesson,

34
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:16,820
you could use the method known as
AD Testing for this kind of process.

35
00:02:16,819 --> 00:02:20,459
This provides the truest
form of external validation.

36
00:02:21,659 --> 00:02:25,614
But even then, clustering should
remain an iterative process.

37
00:02:25,614 --> 00:02:28,620
Whatever your use case for
segmentation and

38
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:32,280
clustering, remember that
whatever you are segmenting, and

39
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:37,360
whatever variables you are using to
cluster, these will continue to change.

40
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,900
Which means that a clustering solution
that is good today, may start

41
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:46,620
moving after a couple of years, and
should be re-evaluated as time goes by.
