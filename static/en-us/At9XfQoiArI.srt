00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,860
Okay, now that you have a basic
understanding of Q learning,

2
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:07,939
let's consider how we can turn
the stock trading problem

3
00:00:07,939 --> 00:00:10,950
into a problem that Q
learning can solve.

4
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:14,750
To do that we need to
define our actions,

5
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:19,400
we need to define our state, and
we also need to define our rewards.

6
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,139
Let's start here first with actions.

7
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:24,090
It's actually pretty easy.

8
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:28,860
We just have three actions,
buy, sell or do nothing.

9
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:32,945
So let's consider how that might
play out with an actual stock, and

10
00:00:32,945 --> 00:00:38,390
let's suppose we've already
trained our Q learner what to do.

11
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:39,746
Let's see what's likely to happen.

12
00:00:39,746 --> 00:00:45,560
So usually what's going to happen most
frequently is that we do nothing.

13
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:50,230
There will occasionally be buys and
sells, but usually nothing.

14
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:52,600
Well, at least, that's my expectation,

15
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:56,170
we'll have to see when we create
these learners what actually happens.

16
00:00:56,170 --> 00:01:01,650
So we are evaluating
the factors of the stock.

17
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:05,970
In other words, we compute, say,
several technical indicators.

18
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:08,600
That is our state.

19
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,080
We consider that state and
we do nothing.

20
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:14,020
So let's suppose we do nothing for

21
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:17,450
quite a long period here,
but somehow or another,

22
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:21,500
after a little while, boom, something
triggers and says we should buy.

23
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:25,540
So we buy the stock
here we're holding it.

24
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:29,700
We do nothing, nothing, nothing,
nothing, nothing, nothing, and

25
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:33,910
boom, our very intelligent Q learner
says, hey now is the time to sell.

26
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:39,320
And we continue like that through
the rest of our time series.

27
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:40,960
Let's consider now what these buys and

28
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,020
sells, how they affect
our portfolio value.

29
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:47,620
So we start out with whatever
we've got in the bank and

30
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:49,330
there's no trading for a while.

31
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:51,520
Suddenly there's a buy, and

32
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:55,250
then we see an increase in our
portfolio value until we hit that sell.

33
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:57,890
Then nothing.

34
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:02,440
Again, another buy, and a sell.

35
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,250
Then nothing.

36
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:05,820
So you see this sort
of stepped behavior.

37
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:09,289
Now of course, because I was drawing
this and I wanted us to look good,

38
00:02:09,289 --> 00:02:12,820
I was choosing opportunistic
times to buy and sell.

39
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:17,980
Your real strategy is
probably not going to be so

40
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:21,430
good, but ideally this is the kind
of thing we'd like to see.
