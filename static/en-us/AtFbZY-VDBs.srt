00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:05,030
For this lesson, you'll be focusing on practicing DOM manipulation methods.

2
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:09,880
You'll start by accessing data about existing nodes and modifying that data.

3
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:12,220
You'll finish by adding and removing DOM elements.

4
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:16,040
I won't be covering all of jQuery's methods, but

5
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:19,050
most of them follow pretty much the same pattern.

6
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:20,130
And after these examples,

7
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:22,610
you won't have any problem tackling additional methods.

8
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:26,090
This is the jQuery API documentation.

9
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:29,380
On the left, you can see the main types of jQuery methods.

10
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:35,210
I want to start by modifying the class attribute, so I'll click on Attributes.

11
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:37,090
I can see a few methods.

12
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:39,370
I'll go ahead and start with addClass,

13
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:42,880
which does pretty much exactly what you think it does.

14
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:46,010
It adds a specified class to a DOM element.

15
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:50,080
This black box shows the main function signature, which tells you what to

16
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:54,350
pass in as an argument to this method to get it to work properly.

17
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:56,440
This description is pretty useful.

18
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:59,650
It looks like this method takes in a string of a class name and

19
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:01,760
adds it to selected elements.

20
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,080
So if I passed in blue to this method,

21
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,220
I'd add the blue class to the element with the ID of item.

22
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:11,615
Inside the black box, you could find different ways of using the method,

23
00:01:11,615 --> 00:01:14,708
including this one, where you could pass a function to addClass.

24
00:01:14,708 --> 00:01:16,580
Huh, that seems kind of weird.

25
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:22,450
If I read further though, we see that this function must return a string.

26
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:25,186
It could be a string of a single class name or

27
00:01:25,186 --> 00:01:28,389
it could be many class names separated by spaces.

28
00:01:28,389 --> 00:01:32,800
And then below, we have some in-depth discussion and some examples.

29
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,300
That's pretty cool.

30
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:36,706
In other examples, like .parents, for

31
00:01:36,706 --> 00:01:40,480
instance, you'll see parameters inside square brackets.

32
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:43,880
The square brackets mean that the parameter is optional and

33
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:47,150
the method will work just fine with or without it.

34
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:49,250
Now that I've walked you through the documentation,

35
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:52,600
I want you to try parsing some documentation for yourself.

36
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,680
You're going to start by modifying some data in the DOM.
