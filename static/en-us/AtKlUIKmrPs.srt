00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:03,320
There are a few major steps
in a launch checklist.

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:06,130
Creating your basic website,
or even just the landing page,

3
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:09,780
which you should have already done or
updated in lesson two.

4
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:13,230
Creating you social media pages,
Facebook, Twitter, Google Plus,

5
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:16,910
LinkedIn, Instagram, or whatever makes
sense for your audience behavior.

6
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:19,900
Getting some media attention,
whether you do it with a PR firm or

7
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:21,280
do it yourself.

8
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:24,710
Creating a press kit that you'll
use to share with the press.

9
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:27,090
And starting to build your user base.

10
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:29,480
And you'll be doing that
by using promo offers, and

11
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:32,900
being active in the relevant groups and
events.

12
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:34,330
