1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
The answer is 30--as I go to the scatter plot that graphs age versus income,

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
you'll find that up here is the very first time someone had the maximum wage.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
That specific number occurs 4 times--here, here, here, and here among the older crowds

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,000
of 35-pluses might made it--my own age isn't even on the diagram anymore.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 99:59:59,999
But the correct answer would have been 30, and it's really easy to see from the scatterplot.
