1
00:00:00,233 --> 00:00:03,074
We haven't shown you code for
responding with a cache entry, but

2
00:00:03,074 --> 00:00:05,929
you've seen caches.match for
getting things out of the cache.

3
00:00:05,929 --> 00:00:09,960
And you've seen event.respond with,
so time to put them together.

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,800
If you've completed the last task,
your project is in the correct state for

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,030
this task.

6
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:16,990
If not, you can go to the project
directory in your command line and

7
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:20,910
run git reset --hard to remove
any local changes you have,

8
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:24,540
then git checkout task-cache-response.

9
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:27,360
Once again, the work happens
in the service worker script

10
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:31,910
in public/js/sw/index.js.

11
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:35,460
First, you'll need to clear up any code
in the fetch handler you already have.

12
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:39,200
We don't need any of the special four of
four handling from the previous tasks.

13
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,950
Then, your task is to
respond to the request

14
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:44,520
with an entry from
the cache if there is one.

15
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,470
Otherwise, fetch it from the network,
here's a hint.

16
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:50,900
You need to call event.respond with,
synchronously.

17
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:54,030
You can't call it within a promise
handler, that's too late.

18
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:56,510
Once you've coded it up,
reload the page.

19
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:59,480
Remember to have DevTools open and
use force update on reload, so

20
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:01,541
you only need to refresh
once to see changes.

21
00:01:01,541 --> 00:01:04,117
You'll know it's working
because you'll be able to put

22
00:01:04,117 --> 00:01:06,486
the site into Offline mode and
still get a response.

23
00:01:06,486 --> 00:01:09,616
Once you've got it working,
head over to the settings page and

24
00:01:09,616 --> 00:01:12,940
type cache- served into
the test field and press Enter.

25
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:14,220
This will confirm it's all working.
