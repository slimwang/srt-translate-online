00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,992
Let's check our new answer. So we're going to plug in 3 plus or minus 4 i in the

2
00:00:05,992 --> 00:00:12,003
spot of x in our equation. So remember this is either 3 plus 4 i or 3 minus 4 i.

3
00:00:12,003 --> 00:00:18,052
So for now let's just pick one. Let's pick the plus. So if we let x equal 3 plus

4
00:00:18,052 --> 00:00:22,461
4 i then. What does x minus 3 squared simplify to?
