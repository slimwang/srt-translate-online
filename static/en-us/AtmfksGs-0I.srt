00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:02,995
To create this plot, we're going to use our ggplot

2
00:00:02,995 --> 00:00:07,240
function.We'll pass it www likes received to the x variable, and

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:11,090
we'll pass likes received to the y variable. Then we'll set

4
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:14,260
our data frame equal to our pseudo Facebook users and then

5
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:16,460
we'll tell ggplot that we want that we want

6
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:19,500
a gm point or scatterplot. Now I actually forgotten something to

7
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,030
do here, I need to wrap my x and y variables

8
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:25,650
inside the aesthetic wrapper. So I'll add that in. Now you

9
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:27,970
might not have used the ggplot syntax,

10
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:30,070
but I highly encourage you to continue to use

11
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:31,590
it and to get practice with it throughout

12
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:34,002
this lesson. We'll be making more use of the

13
00:00:34,002 --> 00:00:36,310
ggplot syntax in the next lesson, so

14
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:38,090
it's important that you really know it backwards and

15
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:41,170
forwards. Try making some other scatter plots with

16
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:43,650
different variables to get more familiar with the syntax.
