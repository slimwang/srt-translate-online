1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,870
Okay, so we want to find two weights,
A and B.

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:09,880
Such that when you multiply them by
their betas, the sum turns out to be 0.

3
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:14,820
Now keep in mind,
that we're going to short B, so

4
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:17,070
this one needs to be negative.

5
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:19,590
And we're going to long A, so
this one needs to be positive.

6
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:24,520
Just keep that in mind as we go forward
so, let's solve for A initially here.

7
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:29,180
So we know that the weight of A should
be equal to -2 times the weight of B.

8
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:33,880
We also know that the sum of A and

9
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:38,166
B, well the sum of the absolute values
of A and B, should be equal to 1.

10
00:00:38,166 --> 00:00:43,770
If we plug thi minus 2 weight of B and

11
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:48,780
for weight of A we get this,
or long story short.

12
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:52,430
The absolute value
the weight of B = 1/3.

13
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:55,640
So I know the weight of B has to be
negative, so we get minus one third for

14
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:56,870
the weight of B.

15
00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:59,170
And coming all the way back up here,

16
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:03,660
we know that the weight of A is equal
to Negative two times the weight of B.

17
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:05,600
So we get this.

18
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,945
So finally, the answers are: 2/3 for
the weight of A.

19
00:01:08,945 --> 00:01:10,850
-1/3 for the weight of B.
