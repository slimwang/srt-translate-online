1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:04,059
The course itself is structured in these sort of ten overall units.

2
00:00:04,059 --> 00:00:07,880
Don't worry, they're not all as equally long and pedantic as this introduction.

3
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:10,970
We'll start off early by doing some image processing because you have to

4
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:14,970
manipulate images to do a variety of types of interaction with them later.

5
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:16,930
And we actually have a problem set early on there that

6
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:21,510
goes from image processing to getting some basic structure.

7
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:24,930
Then we'll talk about the geometry of cameras and camera models, and what

8
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:28,740
happens when you have multiple views and how you can relate them to each other.

9
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:32,662
We'll get down to the image and talk about features, computing something about

10
00:00:32,662 --> 00:00:36,369
one image and figuring out where in the other image those same points occur.

11
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:39,102
because once you can do that, there's a lot you can do in terms of

12
00:00:39,102 --> 00:00:43,942
thinking about either transforming images or computing geometry between them.

13
00:00:43,942 --> 00:00:47,160
We'll spend just a little bit of time talking about how images get formed in

14
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,460
the first place, what we call lightness and brightness.

15
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:52,638
How does light interact with material and

16
00:00:52,638 --> 00:00:57,187
then come to your imaging sensor in order to make a picture?

17
00:00:57,187 --> 00:01:00,372
We'll spend a bit of time talking about motion, remember we talked about not

18
00:01:00,372 --> 00:01:03,460
just static images, but we can actually have sequences of images?

19
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:06,240
So the question of how things are moving can be looked at.

20
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,230
And these are sort of separated into motion in the image, and that,

21
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:13,880
that is sort of how the pixels change, and then tracking the object.

22
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:17,140
And we'll focus a bit on tracking as well.

23
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:20,100
Then we'll get to something which we're going to do just a little bit of,

24
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:22,390
of classification and recognition.

25
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:25,740
And some of you may be saying, aw that's disappointing.

26
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:27,750
No, no, no, it's not disappointing, okay?

27
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:33,550
A lot of classification recognition is deeply steeped in machine learning.

28
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:36,590
So what we'll do is, we'll do some of it here, sort of some basic pattern

29
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:39,500
recognition, and then computer vision applied to recognition.

30
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,890
And then if you want to do more in the recognition universe,

31
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:45,460
you'll have to learn some machine learning as well.

32
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:50,100
The course concludes with just some extra stuff that is just useful to know,

33
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,100
if you're actually going to do computer vision work.

34
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:55,160
And then finally, because I can't help myself and neither can Arpin,

35
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:58,840
because he has true inspiration from biological systems,

36
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,450
we'll talk a little bit about how the human vision system works.
