1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,772
Okay, let's prepare to look
at the actual methods.

2
00:00:02,772 --> 00:00:06,395
You remember the textField should
change characters and range method.

3
00:00:06,395 --> 00:00:09,504
Notice that the first
perimeter of the methods

4
00:00:09,504 --> 00:00:13,579
in the textField delegate was
always the textField itself.

5
00:00:13,579 --> 00:00:16,648
It will be the same in
the tableViews two protocols,

6
00:00:16,648 --> 00:00:20,647
notice that the tableView method
has an argument named indexPath.

7
00:00:20,647 --> 00:00:24,838
This is a struct with two members,
row and section.

8
00:00:24,838 --> 00:00:28,138
By the way, for more on structs,
see the instructor notes or

9
00:00:28,138 --> 00:00:30,873
peak ahead into the Swift
section in lesson five.

10
00:00:30,873 --> 00:00:33,049
When the table wants to get the cell for

11
00:00:33,049 --> 00:00:35,837
a particular row,
it invokes a method asking for

12
00:00:35,837 --> 00:00:39,928
the cell and it passes in an indexPath
object with the row property set.

13
00:00:39,928 --> 00:00:44,283
Similarly, when a table wants to alert
its delegate that a row was selected.

14
00:00:44,283 --> 00:00:46,721
It invokes the appropriate method and

15
00:00:46,721 --> 00:00:50,387
passes in an indexPath object
with the row property set.

16
00:00:50,387 --> 00:00:54,225
Remember, we're interested in the
following three questions that the table

17
00:00:54,225 --> 00:00:54,755
will ask.

18
00:00:54,755 --> 00:00:56,062
How many rows?

19
00:00:56,062 --> 00:00:57,565
What is the cell for each row?

20
00:00:57,565 --> 00:01:00,154
And what should happen
when a cell is selected?

21
00:01:00,154 --> 00:01:03,440
Which method signatures
corresponds to these questions?
