1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,518
So now we have this wonderful straight
forward equation for the amount of money

2
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:07,159
that Grant's friends are going to pay him
once they buy their glasses, wiper, and

3
00:00:07,171 --> 00:00:10,894
their spray nozzles. However just when we
think we're starting to figure things out

4
00:00:10,906 --> 00:00:14,757
for him situation gets a little bit more
complicated. Even though this means more

5
00:00:14,769 --> 00:00:18,663
work for us, this is great for Grant,
because more of his friends have asked if

6
00:00:18,675 --> 00:00:22,731
they can buy his products. The day after
his first round of requests came in, even

7
00:00:22,743 --> 00:00:26,483
more of his friends and his friend's
friends heard about his new incredible

8
00:00:26,495 --> 00:00:30,969
inventions, and asked him to add to them,
to the list of people to buy his products.

9
00:00:31,073 --> 00:00:35,950
51 more people requested glasses wipers,
and 25 more people wanted to buy 2 spray

10
00:00:35,962 --> 00:00:40,613
nozzles each. This equation no longer
tells us the total amount of money that

11
00:00:40,625 --> 00:00:45,650
Grant's going to earn from his friends,
and his friend's friends buying his wipers

12
00:00:45,662 --> 00:00:50,270
and nozzles. So, what we need to do is
create a new equation. We need to come up

13
00:00:50,282 --> 00:00:54,845
with a different way to express a that
takes into account this new information

14
00:00:54,857 --> 00:00:58,135
that we have, but also doesn't forget what
we had before.
