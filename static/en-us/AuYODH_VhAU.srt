00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,977
Throughout this unit, we've learned how to graph linear equations and linear

2
00:00:03,977 --> 00:00:08,172
inequalities. We're going to wrap this unit up by talking about functions. All

3
00:00:08,172 --> 00:00:12,330
the linear equations that we've encountered are actually functions and we're

4
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:16,024
going to learn why. Functions take some sort of input like Bob, they do

5
00:00:16,024 --> 00:00:20,500
something mysterious to it, and then get an output like o. This mysterious part

6
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:24,690
is the part we're trying to figure out. It's the description or rule that

7
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:28,995
changes Bob into o. Here is the list of the names of some people. These are

8
00:00:28,995 --> 00:00:32,977
going to be my input and here is a list of outputs. I'm going to pair each

9
00:00:32,977 --> 00:00:37,751
person with an output by showing some errors. Bob goes to the letter o, Jill

10
00:00:37,751 --> 00:00:42,581
goes to the letter i, and Ralph goes to the letter a, and so on. So in this

11
00:00:42,581 --> 00:00:48,457
relation, what's the relationship between these inputs and these outputs? Finish

12
00:00:48,457 --> 00:00:51,360
out this sentence using the best choice.
