1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:05,060
A binary variable is one that has
a yes or a no, a 1 or a 0 or a true or

2
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:07,720
false type of value associated with it.

3
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:10,870
Therefore, those binary
problems would be

4
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:12,810
identifying if an email is spam or not.

5
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:19,190
On the other hand, non-binary variables
are one's that are categorical.

6
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:21,560
Meaning there are values
that take on names, or

7
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:26,930
labels such as red, green, blue,
or small, medium and large.

8
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:29,470
The non binary problems would be,

9
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:32,980
what land cover type is a pixel
from a satellite image?

10
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:36,020
As well as,
what color shirt looks best on me?

11
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:40,680
When looking at the land
cover classification problem,

12
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:44,870
there are typically more than two land
cover types, such as grass, trees,

13
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:48,150
agriculture, water, urban, etc.

14
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:50,510
We can claim this as non binary then.

15
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:55,520
But for the shirt problem, there are
obviously more than two colors we can

16
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,390
choose from making this
a non-binary problem.
