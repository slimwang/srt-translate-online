Here is my answer. There is a lot of variation in exactly how you want the grammar to look.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
But I just went through the grammar on the json.org webpage,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
started to write it down, made sure I wrote it in the correct order.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
They had things like members goes to pair or pair, members,

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
and I had to make sure to put the longer element first,

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
because that's the way our parser works.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Other than that, it was straightforward.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I abbreviated a little bit.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I didn't get into spelling out the individual digits.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I kind of stuck them together into longer regular expressions

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
to take advantage of that rather than break it out all the way.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
But either way you did it, if you get it to parse, you've done the job and congratulations.
