1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:03,490
Time for
you to modularize your joke telling app.

2
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:06,120
You'll create an app for
displaying jokes and

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:10,630
then you'll make two Java libraries
to supply the jokes, one by hand and

4
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:12,910
one using the Android Studio wizard.

5
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:15,880
Then you'll add project dependencies
between your Android app and

6
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:17,660
your Java libraries.

7
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:20,730
When you're done,
you'll be able to answer this question.

8
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:24,910
When a Java project is run as a project
dependency, what tasks are run?

9
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:29,230
CompileJava, processResources,
classes, assemble, jar, build.
