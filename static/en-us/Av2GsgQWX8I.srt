1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,250
the name kenny refers to john f kennedy

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:04,049
who developed this edge detection

3
00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:06,929
algorithm in 1986 with edge detection

4
00:00:06,929 --> 00:00:09,210
the goal is to identify the boundaries

5
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:11,820
of an object in an image so to do that

6
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:16,440
first I'll convert to grayscale alright

7
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:21,510
and next I'll compute the gradient nice

8
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:24,420
ok so now you're looking at the gradient

9
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:26,640
of my world where the brightness of each

10
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,890
pixel corresponds to the strength of the

11
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:31,230
gradient at that point we're going to

12
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:33,600
find edges by tracing out the pixels

13
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,369
that follow the strongest gradients

14
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:37,619
alright but gradient world's a little

15
00:00:37,619 --> 00:00:40,950
scary so let's go back to color by

16
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:42,570
identifying edges we can more easily

17
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:45,869
detect objects by their shape so what

18
00:00:45,869 --> 00:00:48,359
exactly is an edge let's first get some

19
00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:49,859
intuition by having a look at the

20
00:00:49,859 --> 00:00:51,869
parameters for the opencv can function

21
00:00:51,869 --> 00:00:54,448
you'll call it like this in this case

22
00:00:54,448 --> 00:00:56,219
i'm applying the candy function to an

23
00:00:56,219 --> 00:00:58,109
image called gray and the output will be

24
00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:00,659
another image called edges low threshold

25
00:01:00,659 --> 00:01:02,698
and high threshold determine how strong

26
00:01:02,698 --> 00:01:05,640
the edges must be to be detected you can

27
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,019
think of the strength of an edge as

28
00:01:07,019 --> 00:01:08,760
being defined by how different the

29
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,680
values are in adjacent pixels in the

30
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,390
image really just the strength of the

31
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:14,549
gradient next I'll show you how that

32
00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:16,109
works so that you have a clear picture

33
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:18,478
what's going on under the hood when you

34
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:20,938
use the canny edge detection method in

35
00:01:20,938 --> 00:01:26,419
opencv
