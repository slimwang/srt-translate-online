00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:01,970
So let's take a step back for
moment, and

2
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:04,870
think about all that we've done
over the course of this lesson.

3
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:08,080
So first, we became familiar
with the existing code base.

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,300
And then we tied in tents
to each of our buttons.

5
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:12,010
So we could move between
activities in our app.

6
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,049
And lastly, we learned about
interfaces and on click listeners.

7
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:21,560
Now remember each of these skills can be
used for apps beyond the new walk app.

8
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,990
And I'd like you to take a moment
to reflect on these concepts and

9
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:25,530
how you might use them
in your future projects.
