00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:04,030
In this lesson, you'll become more familiar with ANOVA by going through a full

2
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:08,109
length example that not only includes calculating the F statistic, but learning

3
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:11,890
about and calculating a measure of effect size for the differences between

4
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:19,430
three or more groups. This is similar to Cohen's d for the t tests. To improve

5
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:23,980
the lives of dairy cows, a researcher examined 3 types of foods, they wanted to

6
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:28,530
assess cows prefernece for one food over the other all were equally nutritous

7
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:35,436
and afforadable. Together the farmer and the researcher gave the cows each type

8
00:00:35,436 --> 00:00:39,576
of food there were nine cows bessie frank and slim got food a Bob, Red, and

9
00:00:39,576 --> 00:00:46,485
Pippin got food B. Sam, Merry, and Chip got food C. They were randomly assigned

10
00:00:46,485 --> 00:00:51,341
to each type of food. Over eight hours this is the amount that these cows

11
00:00:51,341 --> 00:00:57,336
consumed in pounds. The data can be visualized with bar graphs. Before we get

12
00:00:57,336 --> 00:01:01,824
started with our analysis, match the independent variable dependent variable,

13
00:01:01,824 --> 00:01:07,656
null an alternative hypothesis, with the column on the right. Not all of these

14
00:01:07,656 --> 00:01:11,680
will be used. Put the appropriate letter next to each.
