1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,040
The answer to this question
is the second one.

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,650
They did not have a CISO,
or CISO, at the time.

3
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:12,940
They did have a CIO, and she was fired,
who was victim of one of this breach.

4
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:15,640
And we're going to talk about
later on who's responsible,

5
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:18,710
who sort of entirely
focuses on cybersecurity.

6
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:20,790
The CISO's job is to do that.

7
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:22,700
I should say that post-breach,

8
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:27,050
they did actually end up hiring a Chief
Information Security Officer who came

9
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:31,190
from General Electric, where he was
responsible cybersecurity and risk.
