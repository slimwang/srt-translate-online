00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:01,770
Hopefully, you just found
that machine-learning

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:04,710
is already being used in some
area that you're interested in.

3
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:07,560
When I was writing this lesson I
did this exercise with basketball,

4
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:09,100
with astronomy, and with cooking and

5
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:12,810
found that machine-learning is
already being used in all three areas.

6
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:14,980
I also tried to apply it to
my fantasy football team, but

7
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:17,190
that did not go quite as well,
but maybe someday in the future.

8
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:19,500
Maybe by the end of this program
you'll be able to tell me what I

9
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:20,090
should be doing.
