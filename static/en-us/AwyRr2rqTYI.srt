00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,560
Okay so here I am inside DevTools for our page.

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:06,820
And I've got the div selected that has our name and title.

3
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:09,980
It looks like we're in the right place but let's go ahead and

4
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:14,040
check Bootstrap's documentation, to figure out which classes we need.

5
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:17,920
I found this section about alignment classes in the CSS documentation.

6
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:23,490
It looks like we just need to add text-right to get Right aligned text.

7
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:25,070
Let's go ahead and try that out.

8
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:26,380
I'm back in DevTools.

9
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:29,940
And I will, double-click on the class to open it up.

10
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:34,230
I'll type in text-right, and press Enter.

11
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:35,800
And we see that our name and

12
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,190
title immediately pop to the right side of the screen.

13
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:39,590
So it looks like we're on the right track.

14
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:41,170
Let's see if we can get it capitalized.

15
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:42,170
Right underneath alignment,

16
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:46,660
we see transformation classes, including Uppercased text.

17
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:48,970
All we need to do is add the class text-uppercase.

18
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:50,738
Let's see if it works.

19
00:00:50,738 --> 00:00:55,460
So now we have text-right and text-uppercase and I'll press Enter, and voila!

20
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:58,400
We have capitalized text that is aligned on the right.

21
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:01,960
So for right-align text, we just need text-right.

22
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:05,590
And to make text uppercase we simply add text-uppercase.

23
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:10,200
It worked for us when we added these classes to class equals col-md-6, but

24
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,440
in fact you could also add it to the h1 and h3 tags.

25
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:17,150
While adding it to h1 and h3 would work,

26
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:19,830
it's actually a lot cleaner when you add it to the div containing them.
