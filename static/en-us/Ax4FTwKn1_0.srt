1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,880
As before, we use normalized cross correlation.

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:06,370
Since the image is a two-dimensional matrix,

3
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:09,270
we need to be careful when finding the maximum.

4
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:13,990
Simply writing max of c would compute the column wise maximums.

5
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:17,550
Indexing c with a single colon flattens it.

6
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:23,590
Therefore, max of c colon would compute the image wide maximum.

7
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:27,050
We use a slightly different trick to find the location where this

8
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:28,740
maximum occurs.

9
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:31,910
The find function directly returns the row and

10
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:36,830
column, that is the y and x coordinate of the desired location.

11
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:42,010
Remember that these are raw indices into the matrix of correlation coefficients.

12
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:45,060
We need to account for the offset by subtracting the size of

13
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:48,360
the template along the appropriate dimension and adding one.

14
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:49,850
And that's it.

15
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:52,687
Let's see what y and x values we get back.

16
00:00:52,687 --> 00:00:54,710
All right, 75, 150.

17
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:57,990
Isn't that where we cropped out the glyph from?

18
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:01,410
Indeed, those were the top and left coordinates.

19
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:05,340
We can do some additional plotting to make the result more intuitive.

20
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:07,840
Here we first show the original image, and

21
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,300
then we plot a red plus on top of it where the template was found.

22
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:15,150
Since this is not a fully interactive environment,

23
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:17,270
we have limited plotting capability.

24
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:19,450
In the local installation of MATLAB, or

25
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:24,250
Octave, you can a lot more, like draw a rectangle where the template is found.
