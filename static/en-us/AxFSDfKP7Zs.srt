1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:05,080
Before we dive into techniques to add context to our visualization, and see how

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:09,530
to create a narrative around our data, I wanted to take a step back and first go

3
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:15,110
over some approaches traditional journalism takes when treating its stories.

4
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:21,210
Nate Silver, of blog FiveThirtyEight fame, who correctly predicted all 50 states

5
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:26,130
in the 2012 presidential election, describes approaches to journalism,

6
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:31,720
with the following spectrum, in opening post of the new relaunch of his blog.

7
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:37,140
Nate sees journalism as neither wholly quantitive or qualitative.

8
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:39,550
When talking about approaches to journalism,

9
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:42,690
it's not a binary categorization to him.

10
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:45,660
Rather than being either quantitative or

11
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:49,230
qualitative, he sees it as more of a spectrum.

12
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:54,780
Numbers without context is just as meaningless as words

13
00:00:54,780 --> 00:01:00,489
without numbers, and you need both to create effective data stories.

14
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:05,750
And Nate actually goes one step further, and labels each of the quadrants.

15
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:10,470
The upper left is where organizations like 538 stand, that

16
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:16,200
produce very rigorous and empirical articles based on some quantitative data.

17
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,700
When talking about the upper right quadrant,

18
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:21,410
I'm referring to the traditional articles.

19
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:25,150
That the Washington Post or the New York Times might put out, that have

20
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:30,560
extensive research backing the qualitative story they're trying to tell and

21
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:35,680
narrative, but may not necessarily contain charts, interactive graphics, or

22
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,590
some data collection or experiment they're testing.

23
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:43,891
But, as I mentioned earlier, the quantitative and qualitative divide

24
00:01:43,891 --> 00:01:48,560
isn't necessarily as black and white as I might have drawn it in this graphic.

25
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,794
And organizations like the Washington Post and the New York Times do

26
00:01:52,794 --> 00:01:57,556
have very data driven articles and interactive graphics just like 538.

27
00:01:57,556 --> 00:02:01,890
I publish more qualitative articles in line with traditional journalism.

28
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:05,610
The bottom of this chart, the bottom left and

29
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:08,520
the bottom right quadrants, Nate doesn't think too highly of.

30
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:15,675
The reason being that the bottom half of this graphic represents anecdotal and

31
00:02:15,675 --> 00:02:17,090
ad-hoc stories.

32
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:21,010
The bottom left here, might represent sports writers or

33
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:26,020
other journalists, who take numbers and statistics out of context and

34
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:31,080
don't have the rigorous research to back them and verify their facts.

35
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:36,810
And finally the bottom-right quadrant is reserved for op-ed columnists and

36
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:41,860
pundits who disseminate solely their opinions, without any research,

37
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:45,110
data, or hard facts to back up their claims.

38
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:48,650
In this class, we will focus on the upper-left quadrant and

39
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:53,280
techniques that organizations like 538 take when writing their articles and

40
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,080
crafting their narratives.

41
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:58,110
In this lesson, we will try to create a compelling data

42
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:01,120
narrative around the history of the World Cup.

43
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:06,610
Using quantitative facts and data to support our claims to convey potentially

44
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:12,322
some qualitative or subjective view of the World Cup, but before we go farther,

45
00:03:12,322 --> 00:03:18,060
I want to expand on this idea of the upper left quadrant of quantitative and

46
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:22,210
rigorous analysis in the context not only of journalism, but

47
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:24,050
how it tied into data science as a whole.
