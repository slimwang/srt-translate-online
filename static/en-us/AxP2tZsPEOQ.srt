Once you've produced some summary statistics,

2
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:05,140
you'll write a brief blog post explaining the results of your analyses from

3
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:08,690
assignment three, incorporating the visualization you made for assignment four.

4
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:11,400
And, also your newly produced map for these findings.

5
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:15,900
When this is complete, you should have an interesting and informative blog post

6
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:19,320
about the New York City subway that you can share with your friends and family.

7
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,210
Writing this blog post will give you some good practice communicating your

8
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:26,110
findings to other people, whether they be other data scientists or

9
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:28,060
less technical business partners.

10
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:30,790
This is one of the most important skills a data scientist can

11
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:34,650
have when working in the real world, since not everybody's a data expert.

12
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:37,480
This blog post should also be an excellent first entry in to

13
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:40,060
your portfolio of work as a data scientist,

14
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:43,540
which you can share with other people when they ask what projects you've done.

15
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:46,040
I've posted an example blog post on the class forum,

16
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,290
in case you need some inspiration.
