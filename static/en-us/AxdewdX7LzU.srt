00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,790
Unit tests are designed
to verify that a small,

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:06,230
individual part of the code,
works as expected.

3
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:09,960
In this exercise, we've created some
unit tests for you so that you could run

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:13,280
them and verify that you've
implemented the contract correctly.

5
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:18,119
To run all units test, in the exercise
folder underneath the waitlist test

6
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:21,830
directory, right click on
the ContractClassUnitTest and

7
00:00:21,829 --> 00:00:24,579
then select Run 'ContractClassUnitTest'.

8
00:00:24,579 --> 00:00:27,699
You can see that once you've run it
before we've implemented the contract,

9
00:00:27,699 --> 00:00:30,519
is that it tells you that
All 3 tests have failed.

10
00:00:30,519 --> 00:00:32,618
And if you look down
underneath in the logs,

11
00:00:32,618 --> 00:00:36,133
you can see what one the problems are is
that there should be 1 inner clause

12
00:00:36,133 --> 00:00:38,871
inside the contract which
we haven't implemented yet.

13
00:00:38,871 --> 00:00:42,033
Now once you have
implemented your contract,

14
00:00:42,033 --> 00:00:45,121
you can rerun those tests
again the same way.

15
00:00:45,121 --> 00:00:47,618
And then you'll notice that
the bar turns green and

16
00:00:47,618 --> 00:00:50,289
it tells us that All
the 3 tests have passed.

17
00:00:50,289 --> 00:00:54,250
However if one of them still failed, you
could take a look at the logs underneath

18
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:56,409
which might help you identify
what the problem is.
