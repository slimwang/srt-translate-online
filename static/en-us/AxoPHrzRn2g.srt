00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,984
For the p value for age and time you arrive at a party, you should have gotten

2
00:00:04,984 --> 00:00:10,680
0.2066. This is a pretty high p value. Much greater than the alpha level.

3
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:15,010
Therefore we will write, we would fail to reject the null. We have no evidence

4
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:19,630
in support of the fact that our population correlation might be different from

5
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:26,940
0. For this p value, we get something small. 0.0028. And this is less than our

6
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:31,950
alpha level. So, we were right, based on our confidence interval, we decided to

7
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:34,480
reject the null. Good job.
