00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:03,440
The web service layer refers
to the protocols that can sit

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:05,530
on top of the application layer and

3
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:08,360
can determine the format in which
APIs are sent and received.

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:12,400
One of the most popular protocols
at this level is the simple

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,300
object access protocol, or SOAP.

6
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:18,910
SOAP uses the extensible markup language
to transmit sets of information

7
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:20,650
in the form of objects.

8
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:24,710
SOAP most commonly sits atop
the HTTP application protocol, but

9
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:28,500
can also function with SMTP, or
the simple male transfer protocol.

10
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,270
REST, a representational state transfer,
is the up and

11
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:34,430
coming alternative to SOAP.

12
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:38,780
REST is more of a set of styles and
guidelines than a protocol,

13
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:42,630
since it leverages the features of
HTTP in order to transmit information.

14
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:46,640
HTTP verbs like GET, POST, PUT, and

15
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,270
DELETE, handle the management
of a server's resources.
