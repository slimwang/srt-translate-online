00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:04,150
Intrusion detection is also a part of
the network defense-in-depth mechanism.

2
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:08,270
In this lesson, we're going to discuss
the system architecture, algorithms,

3
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:09,600
deployment strategies,

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:13,100
as well as performance metrics
of intrusion detection systems.

5
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:16,500
We're also going to discuss attacks
on intrusion detection systems.
