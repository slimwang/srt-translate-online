00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:08,640
We can move both of them, we can move just the prisoner, or

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:12,780
we can move just the guard. From this one we can either move one prisoner or

4
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:16,790
two prisoners, and from this one all we can really do is move the prisoner back

00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:20,970
over to the left. Remember that David is not generating these successive states.

00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:24,460
David is saying that the DOM generator will generate the successive states.
