00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The fourth final exam question is another creative application as in concepts you've learned.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
We're going to deal with a three-body problem.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Let's say that we've three stars--one with a small mass, one with the twice the smallest star's mass,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and one very large star with three times this mass.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Given the certain initial 3D configuration of these stars, we want you to figure out

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
how to position and graph each change of time.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
One piece of information that's going to be very important is this equation as the gravitational force

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
between two bodies, which you should remember from all the new units.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Tremendous that this force is actually vector quantity.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm going to be super explicit in putting a vector sign on top of that.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Remember, all three of these bodies exert a force one way or another.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
In the code you can see that we've written out the mass at each star for you

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
as well as the gravitational constant big G.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
We've dealt with everything concerning time for you and all left for you to do

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
is to implement this symplectic Euler method for the motion of the stars we did write above.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
When that is symplectic Euler method if the kind of half implicit, half explicit method

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
that'll help you find the position and velocity of each star.

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Just show your result and surprise you. This is a chaotic system.

19
00:01:07,000 --> 99:59:59,999
See it showed a pretty interesting looking graph.
