00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,110
Well, the way we constructed this graph or the way that I first construct it--well of course as follows

2
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:13,990
that we made the greedy algorithm take all vertices into the vertex cover except for those 24 here.

3
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:18,890
So every vertex except for those that are actually in a minimum vertex cover.

4
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:20,200
So how many are there.

5
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:25,710
Well, up here we have 11, then we have an additional 14 here, then we have 12 here,

6
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:31,130
8 here, and 12 here, and that is a total of 57 vertices

7
00:00:31,130 --> 99:59:59,999
as opposed to a minimum vertex cover, which is 24.
