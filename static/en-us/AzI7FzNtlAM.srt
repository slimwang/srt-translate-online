1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:04,920
A variety of machine learning algorithms
can be used for intrusion detection.

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:07,530
These include Bayesian networks.

3
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:12,960
Bayesian networks encode the conditional
probabilities among observed events.

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,000
For example,

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,880
how likely an email is sent by a user
if the current time is 2:00 AM.

6
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:24,510
If a low probability activity
takes place it is an anomaly.

7
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:27,200
Markov models, a Markov model

8
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:32,119
is a set of states that are connected
by transitional probabilities.

9
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:37,720
For example, Markov models can be used
to model legitimate website names

10
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:41,840
because, the traditional probabilities
from one letter to the next

11
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,770
should be similar to that of
real dictionary words because,

12
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:49,160
users need to type the website names.

13
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:54,010
On the other hand, a randomly spelled
website name is anomalous and

14
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:56,780
may be used by botnets for C and C, or

15
00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:02,170
command control, because bots don't
have to type the website names.

16
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:03,700
Neural networks.

17
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:09,500
A neural network simulates how human
brain perform reasoning and learning.

18
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:12,930
They are one of the most powerful
machine learning approaches.

19
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:15,400
Clustering and outlier detection.

20
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:20,400
Clustering groups the observed data into
clusters based on some similarity or

21
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,050
distance measure.

22
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:27,370
And then identify subsequently observed
data as either belonging to a cluster or

23
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:28,690
as an outlier.

24
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:31,820
For example,
traffic from the internal network

25
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:35,960
to the company's internal web
server have common characteristics

26
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:40,260
that can be grouped into clusters
based on the webpages visited.

27
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:44,800
On the other hand, an attack may
access data on the web server

28
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:48,070
that's rarely visited,
which makes it an outlier.
