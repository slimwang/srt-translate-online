00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:02,770
In this lesson we introduce
the Event-driven model for

2
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:05,370
achieving concurrency in applications.

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:09,051
We performed comparisons between
multi-process, multi-threaded,

4
00:00:09,051 --> 00:00:12,860
and an Event-driven approach for
implementing a web server application.

5
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:14,290
And in addition,

6
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:18,210
we discussed in more general terms how
to properly structure experiments.
