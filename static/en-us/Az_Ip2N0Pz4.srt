1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:04,019
Okay, so I want to do, VIP tickets sold first.

2
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:04,210
>> Okay.

3
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:10,820
>> Okay, so. Let's see what's going on

4
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:13,480
here. We've got our master object festival, and it's

5
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:18,830
summarizing something. okay. Not much there, summarizing attendees. Oh,

6
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:20,250
because it's the only thing that it's related to.

7
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:20,830
>> Exactly.

8
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:26,530
>> Okay. And roll-up type. Count. I'm guessing that would tell me that

9
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:27,590
there were two.

10
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:29,760
>> That would count the number of records.

11
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:30,960
>> Okay, which is not what we want to do.

12
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:31,412
>> Right.

13
00:00:31,412 --> 00:00:33,330
>> We want to add up the number of tickets sold.

14
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:34,390
>> Yes.

15
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:35,990
>> Okay. This is actually making

16
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:40,290
sense. Field to Aggregate. Tickets Purchased? Yes.

17
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:40,550
>> Yes.

18
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:42,870
>> But only if they're VIP tickets.

19
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:44,620
>> So what's great is at the very bottom

20
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:46,770
you can see there you can create a filter criteria.

21
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:51,630
>> Okay. all records should, no, only records meeting certain criteria.

22
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:56,090
Oh, this is easy. Field is Ticket Type.

23
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:56,960
>> Exactly.

24
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,060
>> What's operator? Oh, okay, equals.

25
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:05,150
And equals VIP, yeah?

26
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:05,620
>> Yep.

27
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:06,570
>> Sweet.

28
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:10,430
>> And you can do a lot of different kind of calculations, as you can

29
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:13,570
see. So, the minimum value, the maximum value,

30
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:15,050
some sort of aggregate, and you can get

31
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:16,480
it to be pretty complicated with your

32
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,240
filters. Well that's great. So now you have

33
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,610
a count of your VIP tickets, but you

34
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:22,560
probably want one for general admission to right?

35
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,010
>> Wait, first I want to see, I want to see if this actually worked.

36
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:28,440
I'm want to go to Cloudstock an see if I can, actually see this thing.

37
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:37,810
Hey, it's pretty cool. Okay. Alright now, I will

38
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:39,630
do the same thing for the general admission tickets.

39
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:40,160
>> Right
