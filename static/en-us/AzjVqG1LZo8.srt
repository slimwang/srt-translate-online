1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,624
So here are the values that I got.

2
00:00:02,624 --> 00:00:07,163
There's not much variation here, but
there's a number of good choices.

3
00:00:07,163 --> 00:00:10,330
You can see three branches
that have a value of 2.

4
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:13,730
Our computer player will take
the one on the left automatically.

5
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:15,769
So it will probably take
this move to start with.
