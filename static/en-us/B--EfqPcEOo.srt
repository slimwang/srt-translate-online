1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,178
So, now it's your turn to
explore the Analytics Dashboard.

2
00:00:03,178 --> 00:00:05,939
Feel free to explore
the Admin Dashboard.

3
00:00:05,939 --> 00:00:08,622
Look at the different options,
see what the things do.

4
00:00:08,622 --> 00:00:13,151
You'll find that there's really a lot
of options here, Channel Settings for

5
00:00:13,151 --> 00:00:16,700
example, e-commerce settings,
Adsense linking.

6
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:20,050
Things like this you may not be ready
to use, but don't worry about that.

7
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:23,460
There's a lot of resources for
learning how to use analytics.

8
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:27,880
And this course is going to focus on how
to add analytics to your mobile app.

9
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:32,325
Okay, so take a look around the Admin
Dashboard, switch to the reporting

10
00:00:32,325 --> 00:00:37,025
dashboard, investigate some of
the options, go to the Home tab.

11
00:00:38,215 --> 00:00:40,075
What do you see there?

12
00:00:40,075 --> 00:00:44,075
Feel free to set your preferences,
uncheck everything, check them all,

13
00:00:44,075 --> 00:00:45,135
as you like.

14
00:00:45,135 --> 00:00:47,435
What about the Customization tab?

15
00:00:47,435 --> 00:00:51,205
Again, I don't want you to necessarily
understand everything you're seeing.

16
00:00:51,205 --> 00:00:54,980
I want you to learn how to navigate
through the different tabs.

17
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:57,960
And how to get back to
the Admin Dashboard.

18
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,500
When you've done some investigating,
take this quiz.

19
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,190
Which dashboard do you use to do what?
