00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:03,620
We need to add some code to the table
view, so that photo messages appear.

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:08,038
Here's what the FCViewController
cellForRowAt indexPath function looks

3
00:00:08,038 --> 00:00:08,790
like right now.

4
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:13,230
Again, it only looks for name and
text, but not for our URL.

5
00:00:14,269 --> 00:00:16,928
So let's remove some of our
existing code and start fresh.

6
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:20,859
Our first step is to add
code that handles messages

7
00:00:20,859 --> 00:00:22,530
when they include an image URL key.

8
00:00:23,769 --> 00:00:26,519
If the message snapshot
contains an image URL,

9
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:30,269
then we assign its value to
a variable called imageUrl.

10
00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:34,874
With the URL we can use the Firebase
storage to create a reference to that

11
00:00:34,874 --> 00:00:36,190
particular image.

12
00:00:36,189 --> 00:00:38,414
And then with this
function call to data,

13
00:00:38,414 --> 00:00:41,300
we can download the image
with its maximum size.

14
00:00:41,299 --> 00:00:45,084
And by the way, I apologize if I've
been swapping between image and photo.

15
00:00:45,085 --> 00:00:46,310
I'm just using them interchangeably.

16
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:51,880
Now this function takes a closure
with the data and error.

17
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,810
We'll go ahead and
get the error check out of the way and

18
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:55,190
then we're ready to display our image.

19
00:00:56,659 --> 00:00:58,449
We can create an image from the data.

20
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:03,600
Then we can set the cell's imageView to
display the image that we've created.

21
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:07,769
Now if no image URL is found,
that's not a problem.

22
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:13,000
In that case we can safely assume
that it's a text message and

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,790
we can use an else block to configure
the cell like we've done before.

24
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,620
All right,
now I'm going to run the app and

25
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:20,930
see if the photo message
I sent earlier shows up.

26
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:23,189
And there's our photo.
