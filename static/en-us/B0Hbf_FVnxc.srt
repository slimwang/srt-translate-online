1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,370
Did you play the game Mousetrap?

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:05,160
Or see a Rube Goldberg
machine at the science fair?

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:07,540
If our app were a Rube Goldberg machine,

4
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:11,330
then an instance of a class would
be one of its moving parts.

5
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:16,615
A class is a unit that we use to package
together related data and functionality.

6
00:00:16,615 --> 00:00:18,235
A class is made up of properties and

7
00:00:18,235 --> 00:00:21,665
methods, as you can see here
in this simple Movie class.

8
00:00:21,665 --> 00:00:24,585
The properties are title,
director and release year.

9
00:00:24,585 --> 00:00:27,195
And it only has one method,
an init method.

10
00:00:27,195 --> 00:00:30,000
We'll talk about the specifics
of initialization shortly.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,900
For now, just know that every class
needs an initialization method.

12
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:37,300
Notice that the properties are generally
defined at the top of the class,

13
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:38,910
followed by the methods.

14
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:42,680
Here's another class you've seen before,
the Moviearchive class.

15
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:45,610
This one has a property that's
an array of movie objects.

16
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:50,390
And in addition to its init method, it
has a familiar method, filter by year.

17
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:53,170
You can see that, apart from
the placement of the code between these

18
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:57,420
curly braces, defining properties in a
class is no different from defining any

19
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:59,360
other variable or constant.

20
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:02,270
And defining methods in a class is
no different from defining global

21
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:02,900
functions.
