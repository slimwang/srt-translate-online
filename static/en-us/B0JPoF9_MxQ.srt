1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:04,362
The first reason is false. Since the single set of triangles is shared by all

2
00:00:04,362 --> 00:00:09,042
four tires, each tire must look exactly the same, at least as far as geometry is

3
00:00:09,042 --> 00:00:13,060
concerned. A flat tire doesn't look the same as the others. The last reason can

4
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:17,342
also be rejected, as each tire is drawn with the same geometry. The second

5
00:00:17,342 --> 00:00:21,928
reason is not true, as each tire needs to have its own transforms. The third

6
00:00:21,928 --> 00:00:26,496
reason is definitely true. Instead of storing four separate triangle sets for

7
00:00:26,496 --> 00:00:30,885
each tire, we can store just one. The savings can be huge when there are many

8
00:00:30,885 --> 00:00:35,733
identical parts. This reuse can also increase performance on the GPU, depending

9
00:00:35,733 --> 00:00:37,430
on how the data is passed in.
