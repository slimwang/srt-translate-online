For this quiz, I want you to explore how the meaning of an operation like plus

2
00:00:04,457 --> 00:00:08,674
depends on the type of its inputs. For each part below, give the type of the

3
00:00:08,674 --> 00:00:12,822
result of a plus b, where the type of a is the type shown here, and the type of

4
00:00:12,822 --> 00:00:17,398
b is the type shown here. So for the first question, if you did plus where the

5
00:00:17,398 --> 00:00:22,190
two operands were both of type int, write the type of the result. So the fist

6
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:27,476
one, it's and int plus an int. Second one it's a int plus a float. Third one

7
00:00:27,476 --> 00:00:33,646
it's str plus a str. Fouth one it's a str plus an int. Fifth one is list plus a

8
00:00:33,646 --> 00:00:36,786
list and the last one is dict plus a dict.
