Now you have the tools to build fluid designs from previous lessons. And you can

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:07,130
adapt those designs to radically different scenarios using

3
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:09,740
media queries. The only thing that's still missing

4
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:11,830
is how to make images look beautiful,

5
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:14,790
across all these different devices and screens. So

6
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:15,900
that's what we're going to take on in the

7
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:18,390
next lesson, when we dive into adaptive images.
