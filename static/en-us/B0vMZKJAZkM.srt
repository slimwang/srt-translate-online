1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,410
So here you can see my
AndroidManifest.xml class.

2
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:08,830
And here, I've used the service tag to
add .GeofenceTransitionsIntentService.

3
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:12,220
This allows me to use this service
within my Android application.

4
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:14,545
And then secondly,
uses-permission has been configured for

5
00:00:14,545 --> 00:00:16,290
ACCESS_FIND_LOCATION.

6
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:19,280
And in general, you're going to need to
use find location when using geo fence's

7
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:21,260
particularly smaller ones.

8
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:24,670
You now have everything you need to
run this application and to build it.

9
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:26,200
So run it, give it a try, and

10
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:30,040
demonstrate your geo fence in action,
the way that I did with mine earlier on.

11
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:32,130
And have fun building
geo fence applications.
