1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:04,570
So the, the pros and cons of,
background subtraction.

2
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:05,950
It's very easy to implement.

3
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:07,370
It's easy to do in real time,

4
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:10,240
fast, and the background models
don't have to be constant.

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,130
They can change, so
we could sort of track that change.

6
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:16,720
The disadvantage,
of course, is, you know,

7
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,770
frame differencing is a real problem,
depending on how things move.

8
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:22,580
The median background can be
a high memory requirement,

9
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:24,560
we talked about keeping all that.

10
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,490
And of course, you have to
build a set these thresholds.

11
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:30,390
When does this basic approach fail?

12
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:33,933
Well it fails a lot of times when
we can't really touch that, but

13
00:00:33,933 --> 00:00:38,890
one, one idea that has come up that has
really gotten a lot of play is that,

14
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:41,640
suppose your background
actually has a couple of

15
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,220
different things that might be in it,
right?

16
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:48,948
So, the example that, that I'll show
you in a minute you're looking at,

17
00:00:48,948 --> 00:00:53,297
water and sometimes it's plain water,
and sometimes it's a specularity.

18
00:00:53,297 --> 00:00:56,810
Or you might be looking at some areas
where there's some foliage, and

19
00:00:56,810 --> 00:01:00,735
you might get, you know, one color from
the leaf, and one color from the thing

20
00:01:00,735 --> 00:01:04,510
that's not so, so these pix, pixels
are essentially in the background.

21
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:08,874
They're twinkling between a couple
of different values, all right?

22
00:01:08,874 --> 00:01:13,594
And that analysis was the basis of
a paper that's now very well known by

23
00:01:13,594 --> 00:01:19,048
Chris Stauer and Eric Grimson on
doing adaptive background modeling.

24
00:01:19,048 --> 00:01:21,670
And here, they're showing you
a couple different examples.

25
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:24,500
So we'll just do them,
one is the water here.

26
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:28,500
And the idea is that the water,
most of the time, it's kind of this dark

27
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,340
color and that's shown as this
distribution as sort of a low value.

28
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:34,689
This is you can think
of this as an RG space.

29
00:01:34,689 --> 00:01:38,740
But when they get bright specularities,
you get this high value.

30
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:43,540
Likewise, this area where the door is,
well when the door is opened,

31
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:46,030
it's bright because it's light,
it's lit by the,

32
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:48,350
the, the light in the hall,
in the office.

33
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:51,800
But when the door is open,
it's much darker and it's over there.

34
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:55,920
So the idea is that there's
multiple values in the background.

35
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,425
So what they did was they said okay,

36
00:01:58,425 --> 00:02:03,520
we're going to model the background
as a mixture of Gaussians.

37
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,520
That is, we're going to say that
the background could be made up

38
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:11,120
of a couple of different
distributions of intensities, and

39
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,908
we're going to learn
those distributions.

40
00:02:12,908 --> 00:02:14,750
So if a pixel comes in,

41
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:18,369
if it comes from one of those Gaussians,
I'll say it's background.

42
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:23,150
And, if it isn't, if it's new, then
I'm going to say I think that's a new

43
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:26,730
object, I might hold on to it to
see if it becomes background, but

44
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:28,610
that's how you do the detection.

45
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:29,840
One of the cool things about that,

46
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,480
I'll tell you that early on when papers
like this were being done like I said,

47
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:36,192
people thought background
subtraction was sort of trivial.

48
00:02:36,192 --> 00:02:40,225
I think this paper is one of the paper
that won the Longuet-Higgins prize for

49
00:02:40,225 --> 00:02:42,934
being most cited ten years
after it was published,

50
00:02:42,934 --> 00:02:46,224
because it just became a really
important piece of work.
