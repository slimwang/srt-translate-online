1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
And the answer is that there's just 1.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The +9/+9 is Pareto optimal.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Both players would rather be there than anyplace else.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
And so it seems that if both players are rational

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
they'll both know that there are 2 equilibrium points,

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
but only 1 of them is Pareto optimal.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
And even though there isn't a dominant strategy,

8
00:00:18,000 --> 99:59:59,999
they can both arrive at that happy conclusion.
