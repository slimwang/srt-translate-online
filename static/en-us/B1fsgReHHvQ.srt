Here's another problem involving interest. This time you invest money at 7% and

2
00:00:05,055 --> 00:00:10,089
8%. You invested a total of $25,000 and your yearly interest was 1,900. How much

3
00:00:10,089 --> 00:00:14,882
money did you invest at each rate? To get started solving this problem let's

4
00:00:14,882 --> 00:00:19,320
first come up with some equations. We'll let x be the amount of money we

5
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:24,002
invested at 7% and y be the amount of money we invested at 8%. Using these

6
00:00:24,002 --> 00:00:29,227
variables write two equations for representing this problem. Use the ideas of

7
00:00:29,227 --> 00:00:33,911
amount, and amount, plus the total amount. And interest plus interest should be

8
00:00:33,911 --> 00:00:37,731
total interest. And make sure to use those variables. Good luck.
