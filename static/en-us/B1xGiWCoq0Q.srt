00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:03,580
Objective-C's approach to mutability
differs from Swift in a couple

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:05,120
fundamental ways.

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:09,000
One relating to how mutability is
achieved for a given type, and

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,980
one relating to the probability of an
unintended mutation propagating through

5
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:13,550
a program.
