00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,610
To implement this method, we'll use the same kind of

2
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:06,660
while loop we learned in lesson four. To keep collecting doubles,

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:09,640
as long as the user enters doubles. Inside the loop, we'll

4
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:12,440
read that double, using the scanner that was passed in. And

5
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:14,450
then we'll save it. We want to save it in the

6
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:18,150
next open spot in scores, which should be at index current

7
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:21,540
size. So we'll put nextscore in there. Now there's a new

8
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:25,270
element in scores so the size has changed. We'll need to

9
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:28,110
increment current size to reflect that. Lets see it

10
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:30,930
in action. If I run the demo, and enter some

11
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:33,440
scores. It saved the scores in the order that I

12
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,890
entered them. Looks like we're ready to add another feature.
