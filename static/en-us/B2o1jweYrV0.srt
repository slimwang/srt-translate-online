00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,497
So whether we're trying to write that one number is less than another number or

2
00:00:04,497 --> 00:00:08,568
that one number is greater than another number, the bigger side of this

3
00:00:08,568 --> 00:00:13,030
inequality sign is next to the larger number. Thinking about how we use this

4
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:17,702
symbol, which of these statements is mathematically correct? There may be more

5
00:00:17,702 --> 00:00:19,047
than one right answer.
