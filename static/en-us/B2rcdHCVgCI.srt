00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:04,310
I want to provide you some hints as to
how to go about restructuring this code.

2
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:07,670
You have already seen all the code
necessary to complete this challenge.

3
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:10,020
All of the CRUD operations from
lesson one will come in handy here.

4
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:13,411
You will have to import the modules
you used to do your CRUD commands in

5
00:00:13,411 --> 00:00:14,061
lesson one.

6
00:00:14,061 --> 00:00:14,913
Alll of the code for

7
00:00:14,913 --> 00:00:18,560
these objectives can be written
within your web server.pi file.

8
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,930
You'll need to reconstruct your do_GET
and do_POST methods, such that they

9
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:25,980
perform the necessary CRUD operations
to create the desired functionality.

10
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:28,770
Print statements are simple ways to
see if our code is flowing the way

11
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:29,710
we expect.

12
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:33,030
Feel free to use print statements to
see what blocks your code is in, and

13
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:34,170
the value of variables,

14
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:37,570
like I did with the output variable
that showed our HTML code.

15
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:41,010
Within your browser, you can view source
code, as well as inspect DOM elements,

16
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:44,670
to see if you are outputting the HTML
you expect to see from your server code.
