I give you three more examples from that day.

2
00:00:02,508 --> 00:00:05,080
Because at some point, we got from 247.6 to

3
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:10,346
247.55, some other time 242.5 to 240.0 and then

4
00:00:10,346 --> 00:00:14,437
we got from 205.71 to 201: all within a

5
00:00:14,438 --> 00:00:16,155
fraction of a second. Iâ€™m just going to ask

6
00:00:16,155 --> 00:00:18,483
you the same question as before, do you

7
00:00:18,483 --> 00:00:20,943
consider these abnormal, relative

8
00:00:20,943 --> 00:00:24,000
to this confidence interval over here?
