00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,800
When I get a compiler runtime error, the first thing I do is likely look at the

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:09,320
screen and say, darn, it why isn't this right? But I move forward and the

3
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:13,680
second thing I do is tell myself, hey, you can fix this. You get this code, you

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:17,330
wrote this, you know where you can find the problem. So, I usually try to

5
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:21,330
comment out certain areas of code or build use cases for it to try to narrow it

6
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:26,420
down. And then, solve the issue within that one part of the code. The third

7
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:30,670
thing I do is I usually get really frustrated by that point, two or three hours

8
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:35,410
later, and I say, I can't do this anymore. Where do I go? So, I try to look at

9
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:40,340
some documentation or I try to look at some tips. And I specifically go and ask

10
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:44,370
some friends for help. The fourth thing that I do is usually I probably solve

11
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:48,260
it by then. So, I give myself a pat on the back and say hey, you can do it.

12
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:51,680
This is awesome. And I learn something, and I write it down. I take a mental

13
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,419
note of it so that next time I don't make that same mistake.
