00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,730
Now that our app is showing real data, we should take

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:05,240
a screenshot of our app, so we can remember what it was

3
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:08,490
like when we made it this far. I personally like doing this

4
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:11,430
throughout the process of building an app, because then I can look

5
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:15,190
back, and see how it evolved. I'm going to show you one

6
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:18,170
way that you can take a screenshot of your device. Open up

7
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:22,080
Android Device Monitor and then click on the device here. Then, click

8
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,720
on this camera icon, to do a screen capture. When it pops

9
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:27,330
up, you can hit Save, and then you're done.

10
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:32,140
On certain physical devices, there are actually hardware keys that

11
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:35,440
allow you to grab a screenshot. For example, on the

12
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,910
Nexus 5, you can long press on the volume down

13
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:41,620
and the power key, at the same time. That takes

14
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:44,530
a screenshot. It gets saved to the Photos app and

15
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:46,940
then you can share it out to anyone you want.

16
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:49,410
You can show them what an awesome app you're building.
