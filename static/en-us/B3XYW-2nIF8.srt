00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,985
Well, we already know that our behavior is a result of what goes on in our

2
00:00:03,985 --> 00:00:10,060
environment and in our brains. And our brains are essentially created by our

3
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:14,270
DNA. So, we know that our genes have some kind of connection with behavior, so

4
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:19,450
we know that the last one's not right. We also can guess that behaviors are

5
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:24,140
very complex. So, one gene controlling one behavior is probably not what's

6
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:30,310
going on. And even just a few genes regulating all behaviors is probably not

7
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:36,300
likely either. As you might have guessed, many genes are behind any given

8
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:41,528
particular behavior. And as we go through this course, you'll see exactly how

9
00:00:41,528 --> 00:00:44,769
complex some of these behaviors can be.
