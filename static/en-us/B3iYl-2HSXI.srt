1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,855
Okay and finally, one last way in which we're

2
00:00:02,855 --> 00:00:05,760
going to look at queries involving arrays. So far we've looked

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:09,670
at querying array-valued fields. We've also looked at supplying

4
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:12,490
a number of values, using the" in" operator, any of

5
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:15,660
which can be found in a field, and retrieved

6
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:19,500
documents for which the value of this field matches any

7
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,770
of the values supplied here. We're going to look at

8
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:25,610
the inverse of" in," and that is the all operator.

9
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:28,600
So if you remember, with in, the more values

10
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:31,983
we add, the larger our query target gets. Always the

11
00:00:31,983 --> 00:00:36,360
inverse. In this case, we're specifying an increasingly narrow target.

12
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,820
That is to say, the model uris field, for a

13
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:41,170
document must contain all of these values, in order to

14
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:43,930
be retrieved by this query. Let's take a look at

15
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:47,810
an actual result set. Okay, and we can see that

16
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:51,010
here, all of our values are found in this document.

17
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:55,880
As with this one, and this one, so on. So that's the all operator.
