1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,220
So similar to what we saw in the data binding,

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:08,650
we can have D3 objects which exist in our JavaScript scope, but it is not until

3
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:13,610
we actually choose to select some elements on the page, either HTML or SVG.

4
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:17,890
And append something to them which has some visual representation that

5
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:22,230
the actual axis objects themselves get rendered as SVG.

6
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:27,010
In this case we first select the SVG which contains our chart,

7
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:32,400
we append a group in this case SVG g-element.

8
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:38,970
And again you can think of this analogous to a div tag in HTML, simply a way to

9
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:44,890
group other SVG elements which doesn't have intrinsic visual display itself.

10
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:47,580
So think of a group in SVG.

11
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:51,530
As some invisible fence around a bunch of other SVG objects.

12
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:53,170
We add a class to it.

13
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:54,610
Actually two classes.

14
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:58,430
Both class x and class axis.

15
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:02,020
And then, change the transform attribute on the group

16
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,525
to move everything contained within the group,

17
00:01:04,525 --> 00:01:09,510
zero pixels in the x direction, and height pixels in the y direction.

18
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:15,100
Since SVG has an inverse coordinate space by translating rg we

19
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:16,420
move it zero in the x and

20
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:22,790
height in the y which corresponds to the bottom of our chart in this case.

21
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:24,930
And for the y-axis we do the same.

22
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:28,700
This time, instead of giving it the classes, both x and

23
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:32,280
axis, we give it the class y and axis.

24
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,430
Notice that the axis class is common between the two.

25
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:41,680
This allows us to apply CSS selectors to both the x and y axis.

26
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:47,010
But since we also attached a separate x class and a separate y class

27
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:51,960
we can then further specialize the x and the y styling independently.
