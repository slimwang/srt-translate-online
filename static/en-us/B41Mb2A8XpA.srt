1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:01,940
Can you compute these quantities for me?

2
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:05,700
>> Sure so
I gotta find the max a of f of a, so

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:10,140
I just have to find the maximum
value for f and that is 9.

4
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:10,890
Happens to be a2.

5
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:12,930
>> That's right happens to be a2.

6
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:19,960
>> And he maximum value for
g is 8 which is at about a3 and a5.

7
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:22,714
Good, all right so
then what goes in this box?

8
00:00:22,714 --> 00:00:24,826
>> 9 minus 8 which is 1.

9
00:00:24,826 --> 00:00:28,162
>> The absolute value of 9
minus 8 which is also 1.

10
00:00:28,162 --> 00:00:29,770
>> Yes, that's amazing.

11
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:30,910
>> And the other box?

12
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:32,080
>> So that requires a little bit more,

13
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:37,200
I have to figure out what the maximum
absolute difference is for each a.

14
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,780
So I'm just going to do that.

15
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:39,560
I'm going to start at a1.

16
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:41,396
So 7 minus 5 is 2.

17
00:00:41,396 --> 00:00:46,085
9 minus 3 is 6, 1 minus 8 is 7, for

18
00:00:46,085 --> 00:00:50,221
the purposes of this discussion.

19
00:00:50,221 --> 00:00:51,710
>> It's absolute value, it's fine.

20
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:56,260
>> It's absolute value.

21
00:00:56,260 --> 00:01:02,505
>> 0 minus1 is 1, 6 minus 8 is 2,
3 minus 5 is 2, and -2 minus 5 is 7.

22
00:01:02,505 --> 00:01:03,350
>> Good.

23
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:06,950
>> And
let's see the maximum value there is 7.

24
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:09,590
>> All right.
And just to make sure is 1 less than or

25
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:10,600
equal to 7?

26
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,530
>> Most days.

27
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:12,140
>> There we go.

28
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:15,139
All right so good, so we verified
that this theorem at least holds for

29
00:01:15,139 --> 00:01:17,520
this one example that I
kind of made up at random.

30
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,524
>> Well and then we just simply use,
just simply say it's true for

31
00:01:20,524 --> 00:01:21,210
one example.

32
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:24,190
It's true for two examples,
and then we're done, right?

33
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:26,595
>> This is, what, induction?

34
00:01:26,595 --> 00:01:27,440
>> Yeah.

35
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,450
>> Yeah, I don't think we can do that.

36
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:30,695
I think we actually have
to do it by deduction.

37
00:01:30,695 --> 00:01:31,220
>> Ugh, okay.
