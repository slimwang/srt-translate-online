1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:05,280
Before PHRs and sites like Patients
Like Me, hospitals and physicians

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:09,430
were able to establish portals,
essentially web pages where their

3
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:13,340
patients could do some of the things we
discussed under personal health records.

4
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:16,129
The first of these is now
part of Relay Health,

5
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:20,740
itself a part of McKesson Technology
Solutions For Healthcare.

6
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:24,980
Here patients can get test results,
they can request or

7
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:30,990
sometimes even make appointments,
and they can pay their provider,

8
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:36,050
something you don't see on PHR sites,
which emphasizes the key difference.

9
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:38,400
Portals are generally
provided to the patient,

10
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:42,580
while PHRs are generally
patient initiated and operated.

11
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:46,400
Importantly as you can see here,
patients can now Download their

12
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:51,240
Health Data, in this case using
Blue Button Plus, a technology we've not

13
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:55,250
previously mentioned,
that is intended for just this purpose.

14
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:58,000
And one that is getting a lot
of attention because of the VDT

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,745
requirements of Meaningful Use 2.
