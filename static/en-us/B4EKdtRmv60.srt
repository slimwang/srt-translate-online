00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:02,940
The future of data visualization looks very bright.

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:05,540
And I hope that you've learned a lot in this class.

3
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:08,900
Ryan, if there's something that a student taking this class walks away from

4
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:11,010
learning in this course, what would you hope that would be?

5
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:14,200
>> The one thing that I want everyone to walk away with is that anyone can do

6
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,200
data visualization.

7
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,480
You don't necessarily need to be the best coder or the best designer.

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,560
But with a few simple tools and concepts,

9
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,130
you too can create a data visualization that is both beautiful and compelling.

10
00:00:25,342 --> 00:00:27,300
>> I want to thank you for taking this course, and

11
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:31,270
I hope you had as much fun going through the material as we had producing it.

12
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:34,730
And while we covered a lot of ground, both on the theory and practice of

13
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:40,030
data visualization, we learned how to code using D3 to create visualizations for

14
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:42,470
the web, there's still much more to learn.

15
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:46,170
I encourage all of you to join us at Ziptheme Academy or

16
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:49,300
use the wealth of online resources to continue learning and

17
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:51,990
creating visualizations of your own to share with the world.
