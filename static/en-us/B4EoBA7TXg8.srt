00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,035
We should use line d. Remember, we can start graphing linear inequalities like a

2
00:00:05,035 --> 00:00:09,841
line. We start with the y intercept, which is that positive 3. Then we travel

3
00:00:09,841 --> 00:00:14,612
down 2 and right 3 units. We can continue doing that to get other points in the

4
00:00:14,612 --> 00:00:15,012
line.
