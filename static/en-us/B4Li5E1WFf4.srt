1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:04,580
It turns out there's only one value that makes this equation true. And it's

2
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:09,450
positive 12. Great algebra skills for getting this one correct. Now if you

3
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:13,210
didn't get this solution, that's okay. Math can be pretty tough. So, let's

4
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:16,945
figure out how to do this together. First, we want to subtract 9 from both

5
00:00:16,945 --> 00:00:22,034
sides, to isolate this radical. Next we'll square both sides to undo this

6
00:00:22,034 --> 00:00:27,250
radical, or square root. So, I have x squared minus 18 x plus 81 on the left,

7
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:33,870
and x minus 3 on the right. We subtract x from both sides and add 3 to both

8
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:39,700
sides to get 0 on the right and this expression on the left. Now we want to

9
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:46,178
find factors of 84 that add to negative 19. This factor pair would be negative

10
00:00:46,178 --> 00:00:50,282
12 and negative 7. It's pretty tough to find, so this might have been where you

11
00:00:50,282 --> 00:00:54,624
got stuck. The easiest way to find the factor pairs of 84 is to start with 1

12
00:00:54,624 --> 00:00:58,987
and 84. Then you can just go up to the next number to see if it divides in

13
00:00:58,987 --> 00:01:05,140
evenly into 84. I know 84 is even so 2 does go into it. We can try each of the

14
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:08,090
numbers going up and then we can see that 7 and 12 would be the factor pair

15
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:13,224
that we need. They add to positive 19 so they must both be negative if they are

16
00:01:13,224 --> 00:01:19,495
going to add to negative 19 and multiply to positive 84... This is how we know

17
00:01:19,495 --> 00:01:25,069
this must be our factor pair. Next, we can set each factor equal to 0 and solve

18
00:01:25,069 --> 00:01:31,622
for x. So, x could equal 12 or x could equal positive 7. Now, keep in mind that

19
00:01:31,622 --> 00:01:35,197
we need to check these solutions. We took the square of both sides, so we

20
00:01:35,197 --> 00:01:39,295
might've picked up a root that won't work in the original radical equation.

21
00:01:39,295 --> 00:01:47,360
When we check x equals 12 we get 12 equal to 12 so yes, this answer does check.

22
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,865
But on the right side with x equals 7 we don't get an answer that checks. We'll

23
00:01:51,865 --> 00:01:56,584
have 7 equal to 11 which we know isn't true. So, we remove 7 from our solution

24
00:01:56,584 --> 00:02:00,253
set leaving us with just positive 12.
