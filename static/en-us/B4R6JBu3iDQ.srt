00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:01,560
Just as a refresher,

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:04,400
let's recall the basic elements of computational photography.

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,220
But first, let's imagine what is our scenario.

4
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:10,490
We want to take a picture of a 3D scene, as demonstrated here, and

5
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:13,530
what we want to convert into is a picture.

6
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:17,000
So in essence, what we have done is we have taken the rays of light that

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,470
are illuminating the scene, and converted it into a two-dimensional picture.

8
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:25,840
Now recall that the main aspects of the computational photography started with

9
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:31,240
illuminating the scene, the optics that were used to then take the light

10
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:35,880
information and get it onto a sensor which was then converted into an image.

11
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,150
And then we can do various types of image processing on it.

12
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:40,210
That would be displayed into a picture like this.

13
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:45,060
As you may, may remember, our goal was to computationalize each and

14
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:47,430
every aspect of this pipeline.

15
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:50,190
Today of course, in this lesson, what I'm interested in having you

16
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:52,400
start thinking about how the digital information,

17
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:56,680
the sensor, can be actually used to generate a representation that we

18
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:59,810
can actually do various types of image processing on.

19
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:01,650
So then we can display an image.

20
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:04,580
So the three main aspects that we're interested in here is how

21
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:08,270
the digital information from the sensor is put on to generate an image that we

22
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:11,860
can do various types of processing on it to generate a picture.

23
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:15,530
We will discuss more aspects of how a sensor does generate this kind of

24
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:17,600
a signal in a later lecture.

25
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,790
Today the goal is for us to start thinking about how we can actually start

26
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:25,540
doing image processing and computer vision types of techniques on images.

27
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:28,690
So, the goal that we have in this lesson is to be able to

28
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:31,760
make an image a computable entity.

29
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:36,040
That is, we can run various, various types of computational processes on it, and

30
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:39,010
actually allow us to start thinking of what is a digital image, and

31
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:42,990
what's a representation of a digital image, to convert and create images and

32
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:44,760
pictures that we can use for processing.
