00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,620
This was the correct answer. Fantastic job if you found it. Now if you got stuck

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:08,370
along the way, it might of been at this denominator that gave you trouble. Let's

3
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:12,525
see how we can find our lowest common denominator first. This denominator

4
00:00:12,525 --> 00:00:17,097
factors to x plus 2 times x minus 1. And then this denominator is actually the

5
00:00:17,097 --> 00:00:22,888
difference of two perfect squares. So we can factor it as X plus 1 times X minus

6
00:00:22,888 --> 00:00:26,610
1. We see the two denominators have a common factor of X minus 1, so we list

7
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:30,750
that in the middle for our factor tree method. The other factor's on the outside

8
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:35,110
and then we multiply all of them together to get our lowest common denominator.

9
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:41,117
X plus 2 times X minus 1. Times x plus 1. Next we want to turn each of these

10
00:00:41,117 --> 00:00:45,340
fractions into an equivalent fraction with the lowest common denominator. This

11
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:49,904
first denominator is missing the factor x plus 1. So we multiply the numerator

12
00:00:49,904 --> 00:00:54,457
and denominator by it. The second fraction is missing the factor x plus 2. For

13
00:00:54,457 --> 00:00:59,829
this numerator we're multiplying 2 binomials together and we get x squared minus

14
00:00:59,829 --> 00:01:05,412
x minus 2. For the second fraction we're[INAUDIBLE] this 3, the quantity x plus

15
00:01:05,412 --> 00:01:11,064
2. So we have 3 times x which is 3 x and 3 times 2 which is 6. Now that we've

16
00:01:11,064 --> 00:01:15,560
added our numerators together we have a new numerator. And we should always ask

17
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:19,458
ourselves can we factor this? If we can factor this then we'll be able to

18
00:01:19,458 --> 00:01:24,074
simplify another factor in the numerator and denominator. But in this case, this

19
00:01:24,074 --> 00:01:29,676
numerator can't be factored. There are no factor pairs of 4 that sum to positive

20
00:01:29,676 --> 00:01:33,593
2. This is why we're finished and we can have this as our answer.
