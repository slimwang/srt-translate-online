[D. Evans] The purpose of Backus-Naur Form is to be able to precisely describe

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
exactly the language in a way that's very simple and very concise.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:16,000
So each rule has the form like this where on the left side there's a non-terminal.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Non-terminal means something that we're not finished with.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
All the words written in blue in the grammar are non-terminals.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Sometimes they're written with brackets around them.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I've just used blue to distinguish the non-terminals like this.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Then there's an arrow, and then on the right side there's a replacement.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The replacement can be anything.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
It can be a sequence of non-terminals like here.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Sentence can be replaced with subject followed by verb followed by object.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
It can be 1 non-terminal like here.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
It can also be a terminal, and the terminals I've written in black.

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
What's special about the terminals is they never appear on the left side of a rule.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Once we get to a terminal, we're done, we're finished.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
There's nothing else we can replace it with.

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
So all the rules have this form.

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
We can form a sentence by starting from some non-terminal,

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
usually whichever one is written at the top left--

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
in this case the one I called sentence.

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
And then by following the rules we keep replacing non-terminals with their replacements

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
until we're left with only terminals.

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Here's an example starting from sentence using the grammar above.

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
We can start with sentence.

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
We only have 1 rule to choose from where sentence is on the left side,

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
so we're going to replace sentence with subject, verb, object.

27
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Now we have a lot of choices.

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
We can pick any of the non-terminals we have left.

29
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Find a rule where that non-terminal is on the left side.

30
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
We can pick any of the rules where it's on the left side and do the replacement.

31
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
So I'm going to start with the left one. We'll pick subject.

32
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
We only have 1 replacement rule for subject.

33
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
We can replace subject with noun.

34
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000
The others stay like they are, so we still have verb and we still have object.

35
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Now we can keep going.

36
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
We can pick the first one again.

37
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
It's still a non-terminal, so we can still do replacements.

38
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
With noun we've got 3 choices.

39
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
We can pick any one of those choices.

40
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I'm going to pick the first one. We'll replace noun with the terminal I.

41
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Now we've got a terminal. We're done with that replacement.

42
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Verb and object stay the same.

43
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'm running out of space, so I'm not going to write them again

44
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
because now we can use rules to replace verb.

45
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
As a separate step we're going to find a rule that matches verb.

46
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
We have 2 choices. I'll pick the second one and replace verb with like.

47
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
We still have object.

48
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Object is a non-terminal, so we have to keep replacing it until we're done.

49
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
We have 1 rule for object. We can replace object with noun.

50
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Now we have 3 rules for noun. I'm going to pick the second rule and replace noun with Python.

51
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
What I've done here is what's called a derivation.

52
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
A derivation just means starting from some non-terminal,

53
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
follow the rules to derive a sequence of terminals.

54
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
We're done when we have only terminals left

55
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
and we can derive a sentence in the grammar.

56
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
In this case we produced the sentence I like python,

57
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
but there are lots of other sentences we could have produced

58
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
starting from the same non-terminal if we pick different rules to follow.
