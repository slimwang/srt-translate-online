1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,828
Again since we have the logarithm of one amount on one side, and the logarithm

2
00:00:03,828 --> 00:00:08,887
with base 3 of another amount on the other side. We can set these amounts equal

3
00:00:08,887 --> 00:00:13,835
to one another. Now this property only holds true if the bases are the same,

4
00:00:13,835 --> 00:00:20,010
and we have one log on the left, and one log on the right. This means we have

5
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:25,723
three x minus 2 equal to x minus 4. Solving for x, I'll subtract x from both

6
00:00:25,723 --> 00:00:30,908
sides to get 2 x minus 2 equals negative 4. We'll add 2 to both sides in order

7
00:00:30,908 --> 00:00:36,314
to isolate the 2x. And finally, we'll divide both sides by positive 2 to get x

8
00:00:36,314 --> 00:00:41,805
is equal to negative 1. But here's where we want to be careful. If we plug in a

9
00:00:41,805 --> 00:00:48,258
negative 1 in for x, we'll have log base 3 of negative 5. The same would be

10
00:00:48,258 --> 00:00:52,721
true on the right-hand side. If I plug in a negative 1 here, I'll have log base

11
00:00:52,721 --> 00:00:58,372
3 of negative 5. But here's the question. Can we really take the log base 3 of

12
00:00:58,372 --> 00:01:02,730
negative 5? What would that equal? Well, we'd be saying 3 raised to some

13
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:08,102
unknown power, equals negative 5. There's no power that we could raise the base

14
00:01:08,102 --> 00:01:13,834
3 to that would make it equal to negative 5. So this we can't do. Remember that

15
00:01:13,834 --> 00:01:19,662
we can't take the log of negative numbers, this number must be greater than

16
00:01:19,662 --> 00:01:29,062
zero. This means x equals negative 1 isn't a solution so we have no solution.
