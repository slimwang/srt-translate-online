1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,980
Vista, by virtue of its simplicity, by making

2
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:06,010
one of the problems go away, namely, the power

3
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:10,020
failure, the implementation is very simple. 700 lines of

4
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:12,490
code in Vista as opposed to more than 10,000

5
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:16,300
k lines of code in the original LRVM implementation.

6
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:19,750
Why? Because there are no redo logs. All the

7
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:22,970
changes that we're making to virtual memory for persistent

8
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:25,200
data structure directly get in to the data segments.

9
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,220
So no redo logs. Correspondingly, there is no truncation

10
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:31,620
code, and check pointing and recovery code is significantly

11
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:35,600
simplified, and there is no group commit optimizations. The

12
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,070
upshot of all of these simplifications that comes from

13
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:41,540
one simple trick and that is to make a

14
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:45,200
portion of the DRam persistent. And implement the file

15
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,270
cache with that persistent portion of DRAM can get

16
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:50,730
rid of redo logs and get rid of truncation

17
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:53,840
code and Vista has the simplicity of

18
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,820
LRVM but it is also performance efficient. I

19
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:00,760
encourage you to browse through the performance

20
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:04,430
results that are reported in the paper on

21
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:05,900
Rio Vista which I have assigned for

22
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:09,880
your reading. To see how Vista performs compared

23
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:12,600
to LRVM. In particular, Vista performs three

24
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,430
orders of magnitude better than the original LRVM

25
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:21,730
because of the simplicity and the fact that there is no disk IO. That

26
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:27,200
is the biggest improvement in making Vista perform really well compared to LRVM.
