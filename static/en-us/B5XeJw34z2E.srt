00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,625
Beyond the functionality that a system provides exists certain

2
00:00:03,625 --> 00:00:05,520
non-functional qualities.

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,790
These qualities are often crosscutting.

4
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:10,750
What this means is that their implementation is often spread across

5
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:12,240
the entire system.

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,810
For example, consider re-usability.

7
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:18,050
It is not enough that one of a systems components is reusable,

8
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:19,720
it means that most of the components and

9
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:24,910
possible the application as a whole must be easily applicable in other contexts.

10
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:28,460
Because of the crosscutting nature of non-functional qualities,

11
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:32,000
providing them often has a strong effect on the system's overall structure.
