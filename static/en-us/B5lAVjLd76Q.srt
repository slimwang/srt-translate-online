1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:02,110
So your goal for this quiz, is to finish

2
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:06,800
modifying the crawl_web procedure, so that instead of returning just

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:09,510
the index, it returns both an index and a graph.

4
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:12,040
And the graph gives the link structure. The graph should

5
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:15,118
be a dictionary, where the entries in the graph are

6
00:00:15,118 --> 00:00:19,540
a URL, which is the target page, and a list.

7
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:21,790
Which is the pages that link to that target. So

8
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:25,640
to test your graph making code, we've provided a sample

9
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:28,200
site at this URL. So if that's the link

10
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,110
that you pass in as the seed for the crawl_web.

11
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:32,659
It's going to crawl in the site we set up.

12
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:35,010
And there's an index page that looks like this, it's

13
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:39,720
got five links on it. And, those links go to different web pages. So the first

14
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:44,595
one goes to my favorite hummus recipe. So, there's a link from

15
00:00:44,595 --> 00:00:50,710
index.html. And it goes to the page hummus.html. And if we

16
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:53,120
follow that link, we get to a page that

17
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,330
has no links on it. This second link. Goes

18
00:00:56,330 --> 00:01:00,136
to page arsenic.html. And that page includes a link

19
00:01:00,136 --> 00:01:02,470
the Nickel Chef page. And the Nickel Chef page

20
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:10,210
includes a link to kathleen.html. And that page has

21
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:12,170
no links on it. And the third link on

22
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:15,860
the index page, also goes to the kathleen.html page.

23
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:18,910
And there's two more links on the start page.

24
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:21,000
The first one goes to the Nickel Chef page,

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,430
which we've already seen. And the last link, goes

26
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:27,260
to the Zinc Chef. And from the Zinc Chef

27
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:30,620
page, we have two more links, we have one to

28
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:34,950
the Nickel page. And we have one to the Arsenic

29
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:38,940
Chef's famous hummus recipe page. So this is a pretty

30
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:42,040
complicated link structure, although it's very simple compared to the

31
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,870
things that we actually find on the web. But your goal

32
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:47,330
is to be able to produce this graph, by modifying

33
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:50,430
the code that we have for crawl_web. And then once

34
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:52,380
we have the page ranks, we'll be able to use

35
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:55,320
PageRank to find the best page. To find a hummus recipe.

36
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:58,758
So for this site, the graph that your

37
00:01:58,758 --> 00:02:02,520
crawl_web should produce, should have entries that show these

38
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,170
connections, so there should be an entry where the

39
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:11,180
URL is the urank/index.html, I'm leaving out the beginning

40
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:16,870
of the URL. And the entries should be a list of all the pages that, that links

41
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,965
to there. So they're going to be five pages. All

42
00:02:18,965 --> 00:02:21,234
five of these should be in the list here.

43
00:02:21,234 --> 00:02:24,939
There should be the Hummus page, there should

44
00:02:24,939 --> 00:02:29,150
be the Arsenic page, and the other three pages.

45
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:31,810
The order that. Links appear in this list doesn't

46
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:33,535
matter, it's correct as long as you have all

47
00:02:33,535 --> 00:02:35,560
five of the links that you can reach from

48
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:40,210
the index.html page. The kathleen.html page, doesn't have any

49
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:43,930
outgoing links, so the entry for kathleen.html should be

50
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:46,430
an empty list. So see if you can figure

51
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:50,090
out how to change the code for crawl_web, to produce as its second

52
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:54,870
output, a graph that shows the structure of the web pages that we crawled.
