>> If we do the vertical line test on the circle, this vertical line only

intersects with the circle once, but I can see at other places the vertical

00:00:10,008 --> 00:00:15,613
lines hit twice. That means this input at x equals 1 has two different outputs.

We could be up here or we could be down here. So no, this isn't a function.
