00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:06,983
As x increases, y or height also increases. This is a positive relationship. A

2
00:00:06,983 --> 00:00:11,933
negative relationship is when increases in x are associated with decreases in

3
00:00:11,933 --> 00:00:17,970
y. So it would look like this. Note that, these do not mean it's good or bad,

4
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:24,012
these are just terms to describe which direction the trend is going in. And you

5
00:00:24,012 --> 00:00:28,897
may remember this from learning about graphing lines. Lines with a positive

6
00:00:28,897 --> 00:00:33,253
slope go upwards whereas lines with a negative slope go downwards, from left to

7
00:00:33,253 --> 00:00:34,900
right.
