00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:03,900
Here's a graphic that describes one approach to web services.

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:08,480
This one provided by J2EE, which is Oracle's technology for

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:12,490
dealing with new situations. Three remaining components on the left is your

4
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:16,410
web browser, which is going to be using HTMLs or applets, or

5
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:21,750
possibly even application. On the right, is some kind of database services, and

6
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:27,010
in between is where the beef is, as far as Oracle is concerned. And that's what

7
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:32,560
holds the business logic. This is the computational segment, that knows

8
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:37,060
about the particular application computations. And the way that J2EE has it,

9
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:41,510
there's two parts. One is a web server, and the other is the EJB containers.

10
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:47,070
EJB is enterprise java beans which is libraries are API within Java.

11
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:50,980
Standard interactions then apply, and presumably you can build your

12
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:55,000
applications using this technology, in a way that can deal with some of

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,960
the non-functional constraints that these applications have to be constructed.
