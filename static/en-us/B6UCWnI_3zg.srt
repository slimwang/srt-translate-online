Suppose then that we have two functions. How about these two, f of x equals x

2
00:00:04,986 --> 00:00:11,018
over 4 and g of x equals 4 over x. Are they inverses of one another? Please

00:00:11,018 --> 00:00:14,995
pick yes or no. Think about how you can use what we just learned to figure this

4
00:00:14,995 --> 00:00:15,939
out.
