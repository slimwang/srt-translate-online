1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,820
There is one last promise method
that you should learn to use,

2
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:05,949
and that is .all.

3
00:00:05,949 --> 00:00:09,900
.All takes an array of promises,
it executes them, and

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:13,745
then it returns an array of values in
the same order as the original promises.

5
00:00:13,745 --> 00:00:19,860
.All fails fast, in that it will
reject as soon as the first

6
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:24,730
promise rejects, without waiting for
the rest of the promises to settle.

7
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:27,620
This means that even if one
of the promises rejects,

8
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:30,020
the whole .all rejects.

9
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:32,450
But once ever promise has resolved,

10
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:36,000
then the next in the chain
gets the array of values.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,960
For this quiz, I want you to refactor
this code from the previous quiz,

12
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,740
using .all.

13
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:46,010
When you do it correctly, of course you
should see the thumbnails show up and

14
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:49,340
you should also see
parallel network requests.

15
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:52,080
Check the instructor notes for
more information, and good luck.
