00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Let me now the same question again for a different alignment.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Suppose we were to marry the red pixel over here to the blue one over here,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
the red one to the red one over here, and so on.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
What would now by the cost of the alignment?

5
00:00:16,000 --> 99:59:59,999
We don't have these diagonals, but match pixel by pixel over here.
