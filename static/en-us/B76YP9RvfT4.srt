1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:05,220
Crazy Bob will you please summarize all the bugs have you found?

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:05,810
>> All right. So, I'll read.

3
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:07,055
I'll read basically the type,

4
00:00:07,055 --> 00:00:11,130
the severity, the location and then the description.

5
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:12,690
So, this was wrong.

6
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:17,220
Minor, line one, don't import asterisk.

7
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:23,017
Wrong, minor, line two, useless import or useless import of .java.lang.

8
00:00:23,017 --> 00:00:25,952
Stylistic minor, line 12.

9
00:00:25,952 --> 00:00:29,549
Program to interfaces not implementations.

10
00:00:29,549 --> 00:00:31,300
Missing minor.

11
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:35,840
Lines 13 and 14, no initialization of variables.

12
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,410
Stylistic minor 13 and 14 integer versus character.

13
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:42,560
Style minor lines four, seven and eight.

14
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:45,120
We discussed all about our standard coding style and

15
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,580
comments should be slash, slash asterisk.

16
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:48,500
>> No, shouldn't.

17
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:51,606
>> I'm sorry. >> I kind of agree with said that we should go with,

18
00:00:51,606 --> 00:00:54,710
maybe, a minor plus plus or some kind of other severity.

19
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:58,560
If, if styling is, is important as we kind of talked about maybe that should be

20
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,220
somewhere between major and minor.

21
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:00,950
>> Okay.

22
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:03,750
Okay. >> Really need to crack down on that.

23
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:06,270
Make sure that one just doesn't get washed away.

24
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:07,440
>> Yeah.

25
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,360
>> And also before you go to the next one Crazy Bob,

26
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,160
please read the meaning of the redispositions again.

27
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,420
So the first one is what?

28
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:15,380
The first one is the line number.

29
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:16,870
The second sources.

30
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:18,980
>> Yeah. >> So our line numbers are four, seven and eight.

31
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:20,570
That's where the comments were.

32
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:21,270
>> No, I wasn't being clear.

33
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:21,900
>> On the form?

34
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:22,815
>> They're on the forum.

35
00:01:22,815 --> 00:01:24,046
>> Oh first, oh this one.

36
00:01:24,046 --> 00:01:25,517
This is just the number.

37
00:01:25,517 --> 00:01:26,904
>> Okay. >> Like consecutive number.

38
00:01:26,904 --> 00:01:27,433
>> All right.

39
00:01:27,433 --> 00:01:28,637
>> Of the defect that we found.

40
00:01:28,637 --> 00:01:32,745
Then the type, so there's missing, wrong, extra usability, performance, style,

41
00:01:32,745 --> 00:01:33,801
clarity or question.

42
00:01:33,801 --> 00:01:37,814
And then there's the severity, either major minor, and

43
00:01:37,814 --> 00:01:41,842
then we can add plus plusses, or minus minuses if you'd like.

44
00:01:41,842 --> 00:01:45,166
And then it'll locate the actual line number of the code.

45
00:01:45,166 --> 00:01:51,550
So then we have style minor line 16.

46
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:53,000
Follow should be in capital letters.

47
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,126
And character was misspelled and buy was misspelled.

48
00:01:56,126 --> 00:02:01,343
And then stylistic minor line 19 inconsistent space in white space around, and

49
00:02:01,343 --> 00:02:05,416
then we talked again about needing a some kind of coding standard for

50
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:07,218
white space.

51
00:02:07,218 --> 00:02:12,345
then, wrong major plus.

52
00:02:12,345 --> 00:02:16,410
On line 20 the equal equal should be not equal per our loop condition.

53
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:19,259
Then wrong again, major lines 19 and

54
00:02:19,259 --> 00:02:24,189
28, we're printing every character on a new line as an integer.

55
00:02:24,189 --> 00:02:27,485
Then stylistic major line 20.

56
00:02:27,485 --> 00:02:30,791
We had a question about whether this loop ever even terminates, and

57
00:02:30,791 --> 00:02:33,654
we should be checking for some kind of enda file.

58
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:36,545
Stylistic minor line 31.

59
00:02:36,545 --> 00:02:39,022
The assert comment is confusing.

60
00:02:39,022 --> 00:02:42,232
Stylistic minor lines 32 through 35.

61
00:02:42,232 --> 00:02:45,774
We should catonate all that system out into one line.

62
00:02:45,774 --> 00:02:50,758
[COUGH] Then wrong implementation major line 34.

63
00:02:50,758 --> 00:02:53,570
We're printing the wrong variable.

64
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:57,370
Style again, minor everywhere is our brace placement standard.

65
00:02:57,370 --> 00:02:59,115
We need to come up with something, some kind of standard.

66
00:02:59,115 --> 00:03:00,404
>> Mine are plus plus maybe I don't know.

67
00:03:00,404 --> 00:03:01,403
>> Then another plus plus.

68
00:03:01,403 --> 00:03:05,843
>> And then style minor everywhere, there's no java.doc author tags or

69
00:03:05,843 --> 00:03:08,678
any other information on the code.

70
00:03:08,678 --> 00:03:10,173
Stylistic major line 36,

71
00:03:10,173 --> 00:03:13,862
we should catch specific exceptions rather than generic exception.

72
00:03:13,862 --> 00:03:15,714
Stylistic major, line 37,

73
00:03:15,714 --> 00:03:19,571
we should log exceptions instead of just exiting immediately.

74
00:03:19,571 --> 00:03:26,770
Stylistic, again major, line 39, we need an exit status on our success.

75
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:28,114
Stylistic minor, lines 19 and

76
00:03:28,114 --> 00:03:30,859
28, we should not be printing debug information to the console.

77
00:03:30,859 --> 00:03:34,718
And then I added another important one that I think is important,

78
00:03:34,718 --> 00:03:38,447
major everywhere our implementation should've been in Ada.

79
00:03:38,447 --> 00:03:40,050
>> Oh, that's a minority report.

80
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:42,623
>> [LAUGH] Very good.

81
00:03:42,623 --> 00:03:45,245
>> So, I think the code passes, right?

82
00:03:45,245 --> 00:03:46,976
>> Thank you team.

83
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:52,525
I can certainly breathe easier now that we have squashed these bugs.

84
00:03:52,525 --> 00:03:56,781
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid I'm going to have to neuralize you to

85
00:03:56,781 --> 00:03:59,445
protect the identities of our team members.

86
00:03:59,445 --> 00:04:03,897

87
00:04:03,897 --> 00:04:06,006
