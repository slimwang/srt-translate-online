00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,380
Here's the same information that we saw in the sequence diagram.

2
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:07,430
There are three particular objects. One is a client, one is a transaction and

3
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:11,830
one is a proxy. There are lines between these particular objects.

4
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:16,079
Notice that the lines are annotated with numbered message indicators.

5
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:19,940
The numbers indicate the orders in which those messages take place.

6
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:24,540
And it's using a kind of, Dewey Decimal notation. So, first step is number 1,

7
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:29,054
then number 2. And then 2.1, 2.2 and then step 3.
