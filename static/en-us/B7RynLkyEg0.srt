00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:03,350
For me, this lesson is about
one of the most fun and

2
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:05,140
interesting topics in
parallel computing.

3
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:07,170
Namely, the problem of
graph partitioning.

4
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:11,180
A common thread in a distributed
memory algorithm is,

5
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:12,290
how do you distribute the data?

6
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,420
For instance, there's a lesson in this
course on distributed breadth-first

7
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:18,280
search or BFS.

8
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:20,940
Distributive BFS needs
a way to choose an initial

9
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:23,170
partitioning of the input graph.

10
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:26,110
Now that lesson left us
choice of the black box.

11
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:28,417
This lesson fills in the box.

12
00:00:28,417 --> 00:00:32,317
Before we start, I want to hint at one
of the techniques which I happen to

13
00:00:32,317 --> 00:00:33,816
think is especially neat.

14
00:00:33,816 --> 00:00:36,330
It's called spectral partitioning.

15
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:40,620
Spectral partitioning exploits
the connection between graphs and

16
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:44,570
linear algebra, but
it also has an unusual interpretation,

17
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:46,630
which it turns out is
really kind of fun.

18
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:50,420
It's a physics-based interpretation
based on systems of springs.
