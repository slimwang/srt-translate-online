1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,250
So the answer here is, there are already 120 possibilities to visit 5 houses.

2
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:11,250
The way you calculate this is there are 5 possibilities for the first house,

3
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:13,420
times 4 possibilities for the second house,

4
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:17,230
times 3 for the third one, times 2, times 1.

5
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:20,420
So it's the same as a factorial of 5,

6
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:23,720
if you are familiar with that terminology, which is 120.

7
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:27,960
For the second one, the number in different ways of which you can visit 10 houses,

8
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:34,440
it's a factorial of 10, which is precisely 3,628,800.

9
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,780
As you can see this number here grows enormously.

10
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,870
Just to give you one more example.

11
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:53,340
If we were to visit 15 houses, then the number of possibilities would be 1,307,674,368,000,

12
00:00:53,340 --> 99:59:59,999
which, as I'm sure you'll agree, is quite a lot. Even for a computer to handle.
