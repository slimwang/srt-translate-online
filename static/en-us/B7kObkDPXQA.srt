00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So here is one of my favorites.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I'm holding in my hand a flashlight,

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
and as I move the flashlight around,

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
you can see that the appearance of the object changes a lot,

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
based on where I hold my flashlight.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So my question now is what type of invariance does this realize?
