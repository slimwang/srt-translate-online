1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:03,950
Just behind a VR headset's lens,
you'll find one or

2
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:06,720
more high resolution OLED displays.

3
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:11,970
Sometimes those displays are embedded
inside the headset, like the Vive.

4
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:16,520
Other times,
you'll use your phone's display.

5
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:19,430
Like the Google Cardboard or
Samsung Gear VR.

6
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:26,220
First off, it’s very important for
these displays to have high resolution.

7
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:32,740
The magnifying properties of the lenses
make the display’s pixels much bigger

8
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:34,460
then when they’re viewed
with the naked eye.

9
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:40,976
According to Michael Abrash,
Oculus' chief scientist, we need around

10
00:00:40,976 --> 00:00:46,400
16,000 by 16,000 pixels per eye
to have a completely sharp image.

11
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:53,540
For comparison, the Vive currently
has 1,080 by 1,200 pixels per eye.

12
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:56,240
And obviously, we have a long way to go

13
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:59,079
before VR displays are crisp
enough to look like photos.

14
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:06,798
For this reason, we want the highest
resolution possible for a VR display.

15
00:01:06,798 --> 00:01:10,723
A second important component of
a modern VR display is something

16
00:01:10,723 --> 00:01:12,330
called low persistence.

17
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:18,720
Low persistence means that instead of
showing you a full image, the display is

18
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,950
only showing you a portion of
the image in an moment in time.

19
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:28,190
It causes the display to
function like a rolling shutter.

20
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:31,530
Only showing your eye a moving
slice of the VR world.

21
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:37,120
Check out this video of
the Occulus DK2's low persistence mode,

22
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,410
filmed up close at 400
frames per second.

23
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:42,360
It almost looks like a strobe light,
doesn't it?

24
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:47,240
So why only show the slices of an image,
instead of the full frame?

25
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:51,790
Well, it's because low
persistence reduces and,

26
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:54,080
in many cases, eliminates motion blur.

27
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:57,780
This keeps the image clear
when you look around,

28
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,870
and it keeps it from smearing together.

29
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:04,290
The individual pixels in
a typical OLED display

30
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,640
don't change color fast enough
to eliminate motion blur.

31
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:10,530
Low persistence fixes that problem

32
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:13,390
by effectively hiding the pixels
while they change color.

33
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:17,890
This gives you sharp, consistent, and

34
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:20,900
a believable image when
you turn your head.

35
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:26,360
So behind almost every VR headsets
lenses, you'll find high resolution,

36
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:31,080
a led displays that
support low persistence.

37
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,279
Pretty cool, right?

38
00:02:33,279 --> 00:02:35,208
So we've talked about lenses and
displays,

39
00:02:35,208 --> 00:02:36,990
now let's look at tracking technology.
