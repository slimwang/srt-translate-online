00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,980
The correct answer is happiness. That is our dependent variable. Because

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:09,036
happiness is what we're measuring by using smiles which is how we are

3
00:00:09,036 --> 00:00:15,620
operationalizing our construct happiness. Happiness is our construct. A

4
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:20,880
construct is a psychological concept that we can't necessarily see or touch and

5
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,230
it has to be measured indirectly. And that's why we come up with an operational

6
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:30,410
definition. We have to find a way to measure happiness. So we operationalize

7
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:35,230
happiness with the number of smiles. That just means when someone smiles we

8
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:36,540
interpret it as happiness.
