00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:01,770
My name's Jared.

3
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:02,960
>> My name's Gabrielle.

4
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:04,770

5
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:07,670
In the coming weeks and months, you are
going to be learning the foundational

6
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:10,660
skills used every day by iOS developers.

the Swift programming language.

8
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:17,790
Which is Apple's custom language

9
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:19,170
watchOS development.

10
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:21,430
>> Before going any further,
you'll need to download and

11
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:25,600
install the core tool for
any iOS developer, Xcode.

12
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,230
Xcode is Apple's Integrated
Development Environment,

13
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:31,540

where you build your apps.

14
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:33,260
Downloading Xcode is simple.

15
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:35,810

free on the App Store app on your Mac.

16
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:38,950

you can find instructions below.

17
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:42,120
Depending on your Internet speed
however, this download can take a while.

18
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,330
But don't worry, go ahead and
grab something to drink.

19
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:45,980
