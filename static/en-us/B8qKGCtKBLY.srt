1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,100
I'll start my diagram with the last commit that the coin branch has in

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:04,920
common with the master branch.

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:07,780
As you can see that's the revert controls commit here.

4
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:11,250
I use an ellipses to indicate there's more history off over here.

5
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:14,110
After this commit our history branches off into the master branch and

6
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:15,190
the coin branch.

7
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:18,000
So I'll split off here, keeping the master branch straight.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,490
Each of these two branches has several more commits.

9
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:22,030
I'll label the last commit made on

10
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:24,450
each branch with the appropriate branch label.

11
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:27,770
Now remember, we also made a new branch off of master called easy mode, and

12
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:29,280
made one commit on it.

13
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,830
So we'll add that to the diagram as well.
