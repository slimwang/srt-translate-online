1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:02,480
Now let's talk about correspondence.

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,290
Again, similar idea to what we
talked about when we talked about

3
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:06,570
depth imaging.

4
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:10,020
Basically here I'm showing four
different images of the Trevi Fountain

5
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:12,770
taken completely under different
lighting conditions and

6
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:13,595
different scales.

7
00:00:13,595 --> 00:00:16,570
If I run feature detection on it,
basically it would find

8
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:21,240
four features perhaps that are actually
on the head of the statue here.

9
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:24,496
Course what I'm interested in
making sure is that these features

10
00:00:24,496 --> 00:00:25,211
are the same.

11
00:00:25,211 --> 00:00:28,580
And of course, that basically is what
my correspondence is going to be.

12
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:31,520
After matching, within,
you know, thresholds and stuff,

13
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:33,760
it basically says this feature and
this feature are the same.

14
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,680
Similarly, it will do the same for
the next feature, and

15
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,160
of course, from there to the last one.

16
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,881
So in essence, now this says
is all features are the same.

17
00:00:43,881 --> 00:00:48,018
And this will allow us to link
up pairwise matches to form

18
00:00:48,018 --> 00:00:52,100
a connected graph of matches
across several images.

19
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:53,360
This image is connected to this.

20
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,530
This image is connected to this.

21
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:56,190
This image is connected to this.

22
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:59,390
And again, in the UI that was shown in
the video, you saw how that was used to

23
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:02,830
be able to kind of scale in and look at
different images at different locations.

24
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:04,300
I'll show you examples of that also.
