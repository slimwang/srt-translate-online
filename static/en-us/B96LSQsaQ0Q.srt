Welcome to Unit 3 of CS 215. I'm so glad to have you back!

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Let's start off with a little magic trick.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
All right for this trick, I'm going to ask you to write your initials.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
First initial of your first name and your first initial of your last name on top of each other--like so.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
My name is Michael Littman, so I'm going to write my initials like this.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Then, I want you to mark all the end points and crossing points that are created.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:39,000
All right. What I want you to do is count up all the dots and all the regions and all the segments,

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
and segments in this case are the things connected by dots.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:54,000
So we've got one, two, three, four, five, six and then finally take the number of dots

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:02,000
plus the number of regions minus the number of segments and write your answer in this box.
