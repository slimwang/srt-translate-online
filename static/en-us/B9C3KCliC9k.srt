1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,061
A final consequence of Handel's law that we will

2
00:00:03,061 --> 00:00:06,675
discuss, is the law of diminishing returns. Let's say

3
00:00:06,675 --> 00:00:09,750
that we had an original processor, which we will

4
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:12,900
call GEN1 in which our execution time can roughly

5
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,375
be divided into a purple phase and a blue

6
00:00:15,375 --> 00:00:18,450
phase each of them takes about half the execution

7
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:22,388
time. Let's say that in the generation 2 processor

8
00:00:22,388 --> 00:00:25,504
we decided to speed up the blue phase by factor

9
00:00:25,504 --> 00:00:31,810
of two. What we got now is that the purple part is not affected and the

10
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:38,120
blue part is now half as long. The orbital speed up of the GEN2 processor over

11
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:45,410
GEN1 is equal to one over half is not enhanced. Half is speed up by a

12
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:52,160
factor of two and we get the the speed-up of 133, which is a sizeable speed-up.

13
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,086
Now let's say that we have a generation three

14
00:00:55,086 --> 00:00:58,551
processor, where we again get the blue part and speed

15
00:00:58,551 --> 00:01:00,861
it up by a factor of two, relative to

16
00:01:00,861 --> 00:01:04,751
the GEN2 processors. Now we have that the purple part

17
00:01:04,751 --> 00:01:10,075
is still the same, and the blue part is half of what it was. The speed up of the

18
00:01:10,075 --> 00:01:13,551
GEN3 processor over a GEN2 processor is 1 over and

19
00:01:13,551 --> 00:01:17,224
now we have to be careful. The unaffected part is

20
00:01:17,224 --> 00:01:20,547
now 2 3rds of the execution time. The

21
00:01:20,547 --> 00:01:23,470
affected part is only one third and that part

22
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:28,845
is still affected by a factor of 2, so the overall speed up is 1.2 over GEN2.

23
00:01:28,845 --> 00:01:31,373
If we keep improving the blue part over

24
00:01:31,373 --> 00:01:34,928
the generations, eventually we will get to almost no

25
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:39,480
speed up. Why? Because we are improving what

26
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:42,370
amounts to less and less of the execution time.

27
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:45,494
Furthermore, usually it is the case that improving

28
00:01:45,494 --> 00:01:48,618
something initially is not very hard, but after you

29
00:01:48,618 --> 00:01:52,310
exhaust the easy methods for improvement, it becomes very,

30
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:54,582
very difficult to get new speed ups on a

31
00:01:54,582 --> 00:01:58,776
thing that has been already enhanced hugely. So eventually,

32
00:01:58,776 --> 00:02:01,812
the solutions that will improve the purple part will

33
00:02:01,812 --> 00:02:04,986
be cheaper than the solutions that further improve the

34
00:02:04,986 --> 00:02:07,470
blue part just because all of the easy stuff

35
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:10,889
on improving the blue part we have already done.

36
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:12,659
So not only do we get lower speed ups

37
00:02:12,659 --> 00:02:15,648
by improving the blue part, it's actually becoming more

38
00:02:15,648 --> 00:02:18,764
difficult to do so. This is sort of a

39
00:02:18,764 --> 00:02:22,742
lesson to computer architects to not go overboard improving

40
00:02:22,742 --> 00:02:26,252
the same thing, because the things they have already

41
00:02:26,252 --> 00:02:29,372
improved are now a smaller percentage of the new

42
00:02:29,372 --> 00:02:32,492
execution time, and we need to reassess what is

43
00:02:32,492 --> 00:02:37,280
now the dominant part in the execution time. In other words, once you

44
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:42,140
have applied one improvement, you need to reconsider what is now the new

45
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:44,740
dominant part in the execution time.

46
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:47,621
And definitely, when applying Handel's law, we

47
00:02:47,621 --> 00:02:52,320
need to consider what is now the fraction enhanced, and the fraction unenhanced.
