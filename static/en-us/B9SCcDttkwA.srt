Ha ha, so just when you thought it
was safe, it's time for another quiz.

2
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:05,670
So suppose you have two bags.

3
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:07,060
Here's my question.

4
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:11,740
What's the running time to combine these
two bags if each bag is of size n?

5
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:16,070
Your choices are constant time,
linear time, log time and

6
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:18,430
log n time, or n squared time.

7
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:20,330
Ooh, scary.
