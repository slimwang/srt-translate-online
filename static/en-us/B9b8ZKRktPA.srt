We've seen how to factor a polynomial with factoring by grouping. But,

2
00:00:04,046 --> 00:00:07,881
sometimes, it's easier to just recognize special patterns to make factoring

3
00:00:07,881 --> 00:00:12,211
easier. We're going to look at those special patterns in this lesson. The

4
00:00:12,211 --> 00:00:17,062
special patterns involve the square of binomials and the difference of two

5
00:00:17,062 --> 00:00:20,690
squares. When we multiplied polynomials, we saw how to expend each of these

6
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:24,783
three cases. But this time, we're going to be given these forms and we're going

7
00:00:24,783 --> 00:00:28,977
to move in the other direction. We want to find the factored form. We're going

8
00:00:28,977 --> 00:00:33,360
to focus on these two patterns first. We're going to factor the perfect square

9
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,003
trinomials as a perfect square or a squared binomial.
