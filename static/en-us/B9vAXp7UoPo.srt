00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:04,840
It turns out that the distance is 13 units. Great solving if you found it. We

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:09,565
can use the Pythagorean theorem to set up an equation. We'll have this leg

3
00:00:09,565 --> 00:00:16,079
squared plus this leg squared equals our hypotenuse squared. Solving for d,

4
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:19,100
we'll get d is equal to 13 units.
