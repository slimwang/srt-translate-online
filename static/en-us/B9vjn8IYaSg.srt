1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:01,980
Okay let's begin to look at each of

2
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:04,745
our data quality metrics in a little more detail.

3
00:00:04,745 --> 00:00:08,140
We'll start by looking at the validity metric. Here

4
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:12,560
we are primarily concerned with individual field values. For

5
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:15,900
example, we might have fields that are mandatory

6
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:18,510
there must be a value there. We might have

7
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:21,270
fields that must have a unique value in each

8
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:25,606
data item. We might have fields with foreign-key constraints.

9
00:00:25,606 --> 00:00:27,860
An example might be product records. Each of

10
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:31,210
which must have a reference to a manufacturer. And,

11
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:34,680
that manufacturer must exist in our database. We might

12
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:38,260
have cross-field constraints. What I mean by this is,

13
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:41,810
essentially conditions on multiple fields. So, for example,

14
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:44,570
the start date must come before the end date.

15
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:46,780
Now for most fields, we're also going to be

16
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:50,680
expecting a specific data type. Or, a particular structure

17
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:53,930
of some kind, if we're talking about JSON data, where fields

18
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:57,630
can have values that are themselves dictionaries or arrays. We might

19
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:00,920
also have fields that we expect to have a particular patterns,

20
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:05,220
a pattern we can test using regular expressions. Some fields will

21
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:07,420
have values that we expect to be in a certain range.

22
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:10,110
This might be a numeric range that we can do bounds

23
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:13,290
checking for, or we might be talking about set membership of

24
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:15,790
some kind, so all tee shirts have to have a size

25
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:18,530
field that's small, medium, large, or extra large.

26
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:23,020
Auditing validity is about determining what the constraints

27
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:25,600
are on individual fields and checking to make

28
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,160
sure the field values adhere to those constraints.
