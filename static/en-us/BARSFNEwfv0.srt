1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:05,130
Now, if we're looking
back at our mock here,

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:08,432
we're going to start saying, well there
are some things that aren't the same.

3
00:00:08,432 --> 00:00:13,430
Bootstrap isn't making, using this nice
font here, there's not light gray.

4
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:15,480
What we've done so
far is we've gone thru and

5
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:19,590
we've done what Bootstrap
can do natively.

6
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:22,490
Now what we're going to do is we're
going to apply our own styles on top of

7
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:25,850
that and
make the page look a little nicer.

8
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:29,390
Okay, so one of the first things
that we'll notice is that the font

9
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:34,640
that we have in the mock here is not
the same as the font that we're getting

10
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:35,940
sort of by default.

11
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:38,760
One of the great things that
Google provides is Google Fonts.

12
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:43,450
So I've found a font that is similar
to the one that we have in the mock.

13
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:45,610
It's not perfect, but it'll do.

14
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:48,260
And what we're going to do
is we're going to select,

15
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:52,070
we have a very thin version of
it up here in the name, and

16
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:58,810
a sort of thicker, higher weight
version of it in the rest of the page.

17
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:01,090
So what we need is two font weights.

18
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:04,910
Font weights are how thick or
thin a font is.

19
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:07,570
And for this project,
I'm going to be using the Thin and

20
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:11,220
the Light for
those two situations I just pointed out.

21
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:13,690
Google Fonts may look slightly
different when you use it.

22
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:15,040
They change it from time to time.

23
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,770
But the general concept is you're
going to select your font.

24
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:19,940
In this case, I've picked Lato.

25
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:28,860
And we're going to then select
what weight we want to use.

26
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:31,670
The characters, in this case we're just
gong to use the Latin character set.

27
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:36,060
Use the Latin Extended if you need
accents and things like that,

28
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:39,080
that aren't in the normal Latin set.

29
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:44,370
And, we come down here and Google
has provided us with a handy little

30
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:51,900
piece of HTML that will link this font
with these weights into our page.

31
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:55,020
So we go back and we're going to
put that up in the head and

32
00:01:55,020 --> 00:02:00,750
that will make sure that we have
that font loaded and ready to go.

33
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:04,475
But just loading it into the page
isn't going to do anything.

34
00:02:04,475 --> 00:02:08,520
We actually have to make
a style that can use it and

35
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,500
it tells our page to use it.

36
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:13,460
So what we're going to do next is
we're basically just going to make

37
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:18,230
a styles.css and this will contain
all of our personal styles.

38
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:20,270
So we've used Bootstrap styles already.

39
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:22,880
And we'll make our own styles.css.

40
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,980
So, in the same way that
we loaded Bootstrap in,

41
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:27,200
we're going to load in our own styles.

42
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,140
And we're going to put them below
Bootstrap, remember that CSS

43
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:35,080
is applied in the order that it
shows up, all things being equal.

44
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:39,600
So, if we want to have our
styles not be overwritten by

45
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:43,610
similar styles in Bootstrap, we're going
to put our styles last in this list.

46
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:51,040
So in our styles.css,
we're going to add a body selector.

47
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,690
So this will target the whole HTML body.

48
00:02:54,690 --> 00:03:00,290
And what we're going to do then is,
if we go back to Google Fonts.

49
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:04,064
They'll actually have provided
how to integrate it into our CSS.

50
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:07,396
So it'll give us this font family and

51
00:03:07,396 --> 00:03:11,161
we're going to put that
right into our CSS.

52
00:03:11,161 --> 00:03:15,039
And that's going to say to the browser,
use this font if possible,

53
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:19,496
if not fall back to just a whatever
sans-serif font you have lying around.

54
00:03:22,433 --> 00:03:28,807
So, now if we go back to our page and
refresh, there we go.

55
00:03:28,807 --> 00:03:30,900
So now we're using that new font.

56
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,300
We're starting to look
a little bit better,

57
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:35,710
a little bit closer to our mock,
and we can go on from there.

58
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:42,120
One of the things looking at the mock is
that we have some other colors in here.

59
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:45,260
It looks like instead of being
sort of the dark gray or

60
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:47,880
black that is the default in Bootstrap,

61
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:53,690
our designer has given us a color for
all of the text on this page.

62
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:54,440
So we're going to go back.

63
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,870
We're going to add that
to the body as well.

64
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:57,170
Now, this is just the default color.

65
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:59,592
We can override it at any time,
but this is In general,

66
00:03:59,592 --> 00:04:01,814
the text on our site we're
going to give this color.

67
00:04:19,786 --> 00:04:24,007
And the other thing is that because I'm
loading in these two different weights,

68
00:04:24,007 --> 00:04:25,247
the thin and the thick,

69
00:04:25,247 --> 00:04:28,410
I'm going to make sure that my
style actually calls that out and

70
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:33,600
says as the default we're going to use
this slightly thick one, the 300 weight.

71
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,052
And so we'll put that right
back in this body tag, too.

72
00:04:46,604 --> 00:04:50,780
So looking at our code here.

73
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:57,270
The colors have now changed to
the one we just set and we know for

74
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:58,940
sure we're using the right weight.

75
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:05,220
Looking at our mock, we have a few

76
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:10,190
other text sort of effects
that I'm seeing here.

77
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:13,530
One of them is this featured
work is in a muted color.

78
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:19,170
And one of them is that the Jane Doette
here at the very top, this title is

79
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:24,629
thinner than the other sort of
headings that we have on the page.

80
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:28,330
So let's write some rules
that will help us with that.

81
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:35,880
Bootstrap, as I mentioned before,
has a whole bunch of text helpers,

82
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:38,750
like text-uppercase, text-write,
those sorts of things.

83
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:41,060
So we're going to make our own and
we'll just add to that collection.

84
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,634
We'll make a text-muted.

85
00:05:52,449 --> 00:05:56,895
And that'll change the color
of any text we put that onto,

86
00:05:56,895 --> 00:06:00,590
be a little bit more muted,
a little gray.

87
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:01,697
We'll also make the text thin.

88
00:06:10,093 --> 00:06:14,370
That'll use that thinner version of
the font that we've also loaded in.

89
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:17,590
Just making these classes isn't going to
change the way that the HTML looks,

90
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:21,040
that it displays on our page.

91
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,800
So now we have to go
back to the HTML and

92
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,390
add these classes in where we want them.

93
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:26,598
So I'm thinking we'll put the.

94
00:06:30,998 --> 00:06:35,551
Text in on the name and let's find
that featured work, here we go.

95
00:06:42,306 --> 00:06:44,311
All right.
So we reload our page here and

96
00:06:44,311 --> 00:06:48,212
now you can see Jane Doette at his,
the thin text we were looking for and

97
00:06:48,212 --> 00:06:50,990
featured work has turned grey.

98
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:54,650
So its come along here but
we still got a few more things to kind

99
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:57,800
of polish up and
we will start to work on.

100
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:01,201
One of them is that the logo here
seems to be off a little bit and

101
00:07:01,201 --> 00:07:03,558
we'd like to give it
some room on the top.

102
00:07:10,526 --> 00:07:15,230
And another is that, the name, this
JANE DOETTE, this title, this sort of

103
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:19,500
super title up here, is much bigger
than anything else on the page.

104
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,391
So we're going to try and
bump that up in size.

105
00:07:27,407 --> 00:07:31,285
So again, in our HTML,
let's put in some classes so

106
00:07:31,285 --> 00:07:36,943
that we can actually hook onto that with
our CSS and target the right things.

107
00:07:42,762 --> 00:07:45,093
So one of the things we
wanted to target was that.

108
00:07:45,093 --> 00:07:52,200
Jane Doette, that top heading there.

109
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:56,120
So we'll make this,
we'll give this like a title super so

110
00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:00,350
this is the biggest title there is,

111
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:04,615
and it's at the top of the page and
the biggest thing we have.

112
00:08:04,615 --> 00:08:08,315
And then we also wanted
to target that logo.

113
00:08:08,315 --> 00:08:14,895
So let's call that, so
that things are similar, title logo.

114
00:08:14,895 --> 00:08:17,645
So that's the logo that's
in that title space, and

115
00:08:17,645 --> 00:08:19,445
this is the super text that's in that.

116
00:08:19,445 --> 00:08:25,050
Okay, so now we have that in HTML,
let's go stick some CSS to it.

117
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:29,940
The general note, I generally
organize my CSS files when I'm

118
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:34,700
on smaller projects like this
in we'll do like the body first,

119
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:37,280
the very basic, the resets,
those sorts of things.

120
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,230
General classes,
classes that get used a lot and

121
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:45,500
then more specific classes
further down the file.

122
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:49,260
And for small things like this,
it works great.

123
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:51,488
And it'll let you know in your head,
sort of,

124
00:08:51,488 --> 00:08:54,759
where to look in the file when
you're looking to change something.

125
00:09:08,206 --> 00:09:11,682
So for that super title,
let's give it a,

126
00:09:11,682 --> 00:09:15,360
crank it up to 60 pixels
to start with here.

127
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,270
And then we'll target the title logo.

128
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:28,187
Give it a bit of a margin and
push it down to there.

129
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:34,330
So now, when we refresh our page,
that Jane Doette is nice and

130
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:36,820
big, the logo is nice and in line,

131
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:41,740
we're starting to look a lot closer to
what we're going for in our mock here.

132
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:45,103
So as I'm looking at our mock,

133
00:09:45,103 --> 00:09:49,230
I've actually noticed something that I
missed the first time and this happens.

134
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:53,630
You basically go through your design and
you're checking it side for

135
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:56,290
side with your mock or your image.

136
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:59,250
And you'll notice something
that you missed the first time.

137
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,580
It's an iterative process
as you do it more,

138
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:04,860
you'll miss fewer things
the first pass through.

139
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:07,790
But what I've noticed is
that I don't think that

140
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:10,650
my text at the bottom
of these is centered.

141
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:12,820
So I'll actually jump back in.

142
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:16,010
You can see down here in
the featured work section,

143
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:17,570
these are all left-aligned.

144
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:18,480
And actually,

145
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:23,180
as it turns out, everything in this
entire section here is text centered.

146
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:26,050
So what we can do is add that.

147
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:32,182
Remember, Bootstrap had that text-center
class, we can actually add that

148
00:10:32,182 --> 00:10:35,758
to the parent of all of these,
and it'll apply to everything.

149
00:10:44,304 --> 00:10:45,126
There we go.

150
00:10:45,126 --> 00:10:48,840
So now everything is that
sort of centered text.

151
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:53,540
And we're starting to get closer and
closer to how our mock looks.

152
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:55,560
Now, I'm going to call it here for now,

153
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:58,610
because this has gone pretty long,
but you can keep going.

154
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:01,860
You can say, hey, this HR,
this horizontal rule here,

155
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:03,240
is not thick enough.

156
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:08,350
Hey there's not, it's not quite as
bold as I want it on these titles,

157
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:10,170
you can keep going and
keep going closer and

158
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:12,550
closer to the mock
that you're trying for.

159
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:17,170
At a certain point,
you'll just have to call it a day.

160
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:21,720
And that's okay, getting a Web page to
look exactly like the mock that was done

161
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:26,520
in PhotoShop or wherever it came
from is tremendously hard and

162
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:30,690
very time consuming for
the last couple percent.

163
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:33,370
so, getting to a good place and
saying hey, this looks good.

164
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:37,400
I feel good about this Web page,
I think people can use it.

165
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,660
If you're working with a designer,

166
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:43,690
getting their thoughts on that as well
is definitely a worthwhile activity.

167
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:48,080
And wrapping it up and saying,
okay, I think we're good here.

168
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:52,964
So, I'm going to leave this as it is for
right now, and I think we'll.

169
00:11:56,552 --> 00:12:00,253
So, I'm going to do that right here and
say, hey, we're good enough for

170
00:12:00,253 --> 00:12:01,870
right now.

171
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:06,610
If we wanted to do more work on it, we
absolutely could, but we've got a good

172
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:10,930
looking website here with a lot of
little puppies, and I'm a happy camper.

173
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:15,980
One of the things we get from using
Bootstrap is something like this,

174
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:18,020
where if we look at our website and

175
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:23,350
I've scaled my browser down to be
similar to a to a mobile device.

176
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:25,060
We actually get a nice layout.

177
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:29,150
All of our little featured work has
gone into a line here, it's readable.

178
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:34,000
And we can actually see
it on a mobile device.

179
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,169
Now we didn't do any work to make this
happen, which is really impressive and

180
00:12:38,169 --> 00:12:41,890
we definitely can do a few more things
here to make this look better for

181
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:44,969
our mobile friends, but
it's a great starting place and

182
00:12:44,969 --> 00:12:47,175
we didn't have to worry about it at all.
