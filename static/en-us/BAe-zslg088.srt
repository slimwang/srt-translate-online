00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,850
The overarching theme in this module
is how to find what you're looking for

2
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:04,799
in images.

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:07,299
In previous lessons,
we've accomplished this task for

4
00:00:07,299 --> 00:00:09,740
the most part using colors and
gradients.

5
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:12,550
Now that you're familiar with
some popular classifiers,

6
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:15,110
we're going to go deeper into
our exploration of colors and

7
00:00:15,109 --> 00:00:19,619
gradients to see how you can locate and
classify objects in images.

8
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:21,769
>> Image classification is tricky.

9
00:00:21,769 --> 00:00:25,550
And it becomes even trickier when you
don't know exactly where in an image

10
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:27,580
your objects of interest will appear or

11
00:00:27,579 --> 00:00:31,469
what size they'll be or
even how many of them you might find.

12
00:00:31,469 --> 00:00:34,619
Coming up, you'll focus on
the task of detecting vehicles and

13
00:00:34,619 --> 00:00:38,449
images taken from a camera
mounted on the front of a car.

14
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:41,970
But the same principles apply to
pedestrian detection, or traffic sign

15
00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:46,640
detection, or identifying any object
you might be looking for in an image.

16
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,939
>> In this lesson, you'll practice
searching for objects in images.

17
00:00:49,939 --> 00:00:54,199
And you'll explore what features are the
most useful input for your classifier.

18
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,270
With those tools, you'll then work on
tracking vehicles in a video stream.
