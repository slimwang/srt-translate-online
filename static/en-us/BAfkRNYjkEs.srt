1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,903
Now, what if we have something like this function? f of x equals 6x squared

2
00:00:03,903 --> 00:00:09,110
minus 7x minus 5. Once again, our leading coefficient, the coefficient of the

3
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:14,223
highest degree term, is not equal to 1. It's 6. Unfortunately, this time, our

4
00:00:14,223 --> 00:00:19,146
situation's not as easily solvable as last time. We can't just factor out a 6

5
00:00:19,146 --> 00:00:23,283
from each of our terms, since it's not a common factor. Well, what do we do

6
00:00:23,283 --> 00:00:27,658
now? I'll tell you already what the factors are. There 2x plus 1 and 3x minus

7
00:00:27,658 --> 00:00:31,359
5. But how do we find those? That's what we're going to look at next.
