00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,640
The answer is that all three variables are available inside the body of

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:05,110
the newSaga function.

3
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:09,060
The newSaga function is the tightest scoped function available and so

4
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:11,240
it has access to all the outer functions.
