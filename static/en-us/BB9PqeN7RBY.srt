1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:01,450
Story time.

2
00:00:01,450 --> 00:00:04,620
This reminds me of when I first started building things with wood.

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:06,180
So, I went down to Home Depot.

4
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:07,090
I bought some wood.

5
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:11,040
I bought a hammer and a box of nails, and suddenly I could build things.

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,060
I went crazy with it.

7
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:13,940
I built all kinds of small things,

8
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:17,750
occasionally hitting my finger, but generally, I was successful.

9
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:19,140
Eventually though, hammers and

10
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:23,070
nails didn't quite cut it, so I saved up some money and I upgraded.

11
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:24,876
I bought a screw gun and some screws.

12
00:00:24,876 --> 00:00:26,548
I bought a chop saw.

13
00:00:26,548 --> 00:00:29,194
I even bought some of these.

14
00:00:29,194 --> 00:00:31,902
And I built all kinds of cool things with these tools, and

15
00:00:31,902 --> 00:00:35,600
the things I built were much better because my tools were better.

16
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,530
Then I wanted to build an actual structure, like something I could stand on.

17
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:40,450
And guess what?

18
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:42,330
I didn't trust my own designs.

19
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:46,290
I knew that if I took my methods from all those small projects and scaled them

20
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:49,820
up, I'd build something that wouldn't hold my weight, which would be bad.

21
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,970
Now, I didn't need to go out and buy new tools.

22
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:56,170
I had everything I needed, everything physical at least.

23
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:58,790
What I did need was some organizational guidance and

24
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:00,230
some new building techniques.

25
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:02,780
So, I spent some time experimenting.

26
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:05,900
I discovered that if I separated out my sections of my project into

27
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:09,320
different pieces that attach to each other, it'd be easier to build,

28
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:13,060
potentially more stable, and much easier to change later.

29
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:16,690
Then eventually, I Googled around and I got even better techniques that way,

30
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:19,700
things that would have taken me a long time to figure out on my own.

31
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:22,210
And this is exactly where you are right now.

32
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:23,810
You have great tools.

33
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:25,680
You know JavaScript.

34
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,550
You know the features of the language.

35
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:31,490
But you do need to learn better organizational techniques so your applications

36
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:36,250
are stable and bug-free, cleanly written, they scale well and are extensible.
