1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,080
So here again, my input.

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:03,290
And that's my output.

3
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:08,890
Notice now that the eyes are merged, right?

4
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:12,450
And the hair is also kind of much more kind of a mixture here.

5
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:14,910
We still see a little bit of the Tigger ears.

6
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:19,630
But more of the hair of the Einstein image is now actually been put

7
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:21,930
on the Tigger head.

8
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:25,980
And you can see the frequency mixing is happening again much nicely.

9
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:29,300
This basically shows where some of the laplacian errors were.

10
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:30,700
I mean again, it accounted for

11
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:33,690
a lot of the high frequency information where the eyebrows are.

12
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:36,750
It did have a little bit of problems with the ears.

13
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:38,090
That's what showed up here.

14
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:41,750
And also near the edge of the mouth here which is showing up here.

15
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:45,680
But overall hopefully you'll see this is a much nicer blend than we

16
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,510
have actually see of these kinds of images so far.

17
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:53,140
And the secret was we actually counted for all of the frequency variations, and

18
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:56,767
put them again in the boat, the Laplacian, the Gaussian.

19
00:00:56,767 --> 00:00:59,662
Up the scales, we were able to use this information.
