00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,005
Let's switch gears and talk a little bit about sleep and dreaming, and how that

2
00:00:03,005 --> 00:00:08,935
relates to our consciousness. So why do we sleep? Is our brain responsive while

3
00:00:08,935 --> 00:00:12,489
we sleep? Can we hear while we sleep? Can we be consciously aware of our

4
00:00:12,489 --> 00:00:16,440
dreams? All of these are types of questions that psychologists have researched

5
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:20,358
for a really long time. And we're going to go over a few of the answers in this

6
00:00:20,358 --> 00:00:25,060
section of the lesson. We're going to look at the biological purpose of sleep.

7
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:28,640
What happens during sleep, and what happens if we don't get enough sleep? I

8
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,840
promise you, it's not good, because sleep is imperative for us to function as

9
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:36,370
healthy human beings. We really need sleep for both our physical and mental

10
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:40,199
health. So let's start by looking at our sleep patterns.
