1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Well, with a little bit of math, we realize that this is 80%.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:13,000
The way to calculate this is 724,000 is the votes that party A received,

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
but the total number of votes was 724,000 plus 181,000,

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
which is 724,000 over 905,000.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
That's exactly 0.8, which is the same as 80%.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
It follows that party B got 20%.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
You get to that number when you replace 724,000 with 181,000--the number of party B.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
It turns out 181,000 divided by 905,000 is exactly 0.2.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 99:59:59,999
This is exactly 5 times as large as this number over here.
