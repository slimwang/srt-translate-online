00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
[Thrun] This leads me to the general study of conditional independence in Bayes networks,

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
often called D-separation or reachability.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:17,000
D-separation is best studied by so-called active triplets and inactive triplets

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
where active triplets render variables dependent

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
and inactive triplets render them independent.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Any chain of 3 variables like this makes the initial and final variable dependent

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
if all variables are unknown.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
However, if the center variable is known--

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
that is, it's behind the conditioning bar--

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
then this variable and this variable become independent.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
So if we have a structure like this and it's quote-unquote cut off

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,000
by a known variable in the middle, that separates or deseparates

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
the left variable from the right variable, and they become independent.

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Similarly, any structure like this renders the left variable and the right variable dependent

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
unless the center variable is known,

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
in which case the left and right variable become independent.

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Another active triplet now requires knowledge of a variable.

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
This is the explain away case.

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
If this variable is known for a Bayes network that converges into a single variable,

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
then this variable and this variable over here become dependent.

21
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Contrast this with a case where all variables are unknown.

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:40,000
A situation like this means that this variable on the left or on the right are actually independent.

23
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:48,000
In a single final example, we also get dependence if we have the following situation:

24
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
a direct successor of a conversion variable is known.

25
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
So it is sufficient if a successor of this variable is known.

26
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
The variable itself does not have to be known,

27
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
and the reason is if you know this guy over here,

28
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
we get knowledge about this guy over here.

29
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
And by virtue of that, the case over here essentially applies.

30
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
If you look at those rules,

31
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
those rules allow you to determine for any Bayes network

32
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
whether variables are dependent or not dependent given the evidence you have.

33
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
If you color the nodes dark for which you do have evidence,

34
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
then you can use these rules to understand whether any 2 variables

35
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
are conditionally independent or not.

36
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,000
So let me ask you for this relatively complicated Bayes network the following questions.

37
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Is F independent of A?

38
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Is F independent of A given D?

39
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Is F independent of A given G?

40
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
And is F independent of A given H?

41
00:02:51,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Please mark your answers as you see fit.
