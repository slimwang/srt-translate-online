IQ tests have been controversial over the years. One of the major concerns is,

2
00:00:04,046 --> 00:00:09,680
are IQ rests reliable and valid measures of intelligence? Now the simple answer

3
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:15,162
to is an IQ test a reliable measure, is yes. IQ test will produce consistent,

4
00:00:15,162 --> 00:00:19,988
meaning reliable, scores over time. In fact, the reliability of IQ tests are

5
00:00:19,988 --> 00:00:24,217
among the highest in social sciences. Now, how they find this, is they look at

6
00:00:24,217 --> 00:00:27,379
people's score at one point in their life, and then they compare it to their

7
00:00:27,379 --> 00:00:32,159
score at another point in their life. And even though time has passed, they

8
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:35,110
find that the scores they have on IQ tests at different times are highly

9
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:40,702
correlated. This shows that it's reliable. However, just because it's reliable

10
00:00:40,702 --> 00:00:44,080
doesn't mean there might not be problems with validity. So let's go back to

11
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:47,022
Susan to talk about the validity of an IQ test.
