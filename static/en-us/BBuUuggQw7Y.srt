00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
There's a very clever solution to this that was developed

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
by David Chaum and colleagues in 1988.

00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The key idea is that if the cash is only spent once, then it's anonymous,

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
but if it's spent twice, then the identity of the double spender is revealed.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I want to see if you can guess how to do it. It uses cryptographic tools that we've seen before.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 99:59:59,999
The key idea is to provide this property.
