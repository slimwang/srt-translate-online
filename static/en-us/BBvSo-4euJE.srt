1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:00,672
All right.

2
00:00:00,672 --> 00:00:03,551
Now, I'm going to make some simple
changes with a and b, right?

3
00:00:03,551 --> 00:00:07,764
So, a is here and
a is just this quantity there and

4
00:00:07,764 --> 00:00:11,145
b is here and
b is just this quantity there.

5
00:00:11,145 --> 00:00:16,045
In which case, this whole expression,
I replace the a and b, keep going.

6
00:00:16,045 --> 00:00:18,822
Again, a and b,
carry it forward here, here,

7
00:00:18,822 --> 00:00:21,884
here what you'll notice
I've done is I took a here.

8
00:00:21,884 --> 00:00:25,868
I added in the b there,
which ends up subtracting that there.

9
00:00:25,868 --> 00:00:30,992
Keep going and
what you'll see is this expression

10
00:00:30,992 --> 00:00:35,872
that says,
mu t plus our new belief after we've

11
00:00:35,872 --> 00:00:40,144
taken our measurement
is just mu t minus.

12
00:00:40,144 --> 00:00:41,246
What's mu t minus?

13
00:00:41,246 --> 00:00:45,553
Mu t minus was the prediction and
then we have to change that prediction

14
00:00:45,553 --> 00:00:49,642
a little bit and that prediction
is changed based upon two things.

15
00:00:49,642 --> 00:00:53,889
The first thing is based
upon this difference here.

16
00:00:53,889 --> 00:00:56,188
What's that difference?

17
00:00:56,188 --> 00:00:57,710
That difference is the residual, right?

18
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:00,960
Y divided by m,
that's the measurement guess.

19
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,086
Right?

20
00:01:02,086 --> 00:01:03,769
That's the measurement's guess of x.

21
00:01:03,769 --> 00:01:06,267
Mu t minus was your prediction.

22
00:01:06,267 --> 00:01:10,692
The difference between
them is the residual and

23
00:01:10,692 --> 00:01:17,005
I multiply that by some factor k and
that k is called the Kalman Gain.

24
00:01:17,005 --> 00:01:22,198
If my Kalman Gain was zero, then I
ignore my measurements all together and

25
00:01:22,198 --> 00:01:24,307
I just go with my prediction.

26
00:01:24,307 --> 00:01:25,190
Okay?

27
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:30,182
If my Kalman Gain was one,
let's see I put mu t minus t.

28
00:01:30,182 --> 00:01:33,408
I ignore my predictions all together and
I just get my measurement.

29
00:01:33,408 --> 00:01:36,208
And it's that Kalman Gain
that you're estimating

30
00:01:36,208 --> 00:01:39,657
that goes between essentially zero
to one in the scaler case and

31
00:01:39,657 --> 00:01:42,998
does something funkier in
the multidimensional case.

32
00:01:42,998 --> 00:01:44,427
All right.

33
00:01:44,427 --> 00:01:47,644
Let me show you that in a simple e,
example.

34
00:01:47,644 --> 00:01:51,147
And this is going to be a constant
velocity model and what we mean by that

35
00:01:51,147 --> 00:01:54,725
is we assume the velocity is constant,
except a little bit of noise.

36
00:01:54,725 --> 00:01:57,754
So the state is two-dimensional,
it's the position and the velocity.

37
00:01:57,754 --> 00:02:00,262
Right?

38
00:02:00,262 --> 00:02:02,752
So, it's, I'm,
I'm moving in one dimension, but

39
00:02:02,752 --> 00:02:06,123
my state is two-dimensional, because
it's the position and the velocity.

40
00:02:06,123 --> 00:02:08,258
And now we're going to take
a look at this graph, all right?

41
00:02:08,258 --> 00:02:11,129
So, in this graph, all right?

42
00:02:11,129 --> 00:02:13,651
So we have time and position as
the things we're measuring and

43
00:02:13,651 --> 00:02:14,924
the thing we're estimating.

44
00:02:14,924 --> 00:02:18,025
The red line here is the state.

45
00:02:18,025 --> 00:02:22,179
This, we happen to know was
the actual underlying state, okay?

46
00:02:22,179 --> 00:02:24,062
How did we know this?

47
00:02:24,062 --> 00:02:28,030
We booked a trip to Delphi, you know
where Delphi is, it's in Greece.

48
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:29,954
They have a thing there
called the oracle and

49
00:02:29,954 --> 00:02:32,970
they also sell really good Baklava,
but that's beside the point and

50
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:35,368
you go to the oracle and
the oracle tells you the truth.

51
00:02:35,368 --> 00:02:36,925
Okay?

52
00:02:36,925 --> 00:02:37,842
It tells you if the Mets
will win the world series.

53
00:02:37,842 --> 00:02:41,983
They always say no and they also tell
you the state, but the idea is that for,

54
00:02:41,983 --> 00:02:44,922
for the points here,
I am just showing you the graph.

55
00:02:44,922 --> 00:02:45,562
That is the actual state.
But

56
00:02:45,562 --> 00:02:47,303
we also took some measurements, okay?

57
00:02:47,303 --> 00:02:51,819
And the green dash lines, these
are the measurements we happen to get.

58
00:02:51,819 --> 00:02:54,362
Now you'll notice,
pretty crummy measurements, right?

59
00:02:54,362 --> 00:02:56,743
Life is the way life is.

60
00:02:56,743 --> 00:02:58,749
This is the noise that we
actually happen to get.

61
00:02:58,749 --> 00:03:02,928
The purple line here is
the corrected mean, okay?

62
00:03:02,928 --> 00:03:08,873
And what you're seeing here is that
the mean is sort of being pulled,

63
00:03:08,873 --> 00:03:11,242
the estimate, all right?

64
00:03:11,242 --> 00:03:15,576
Is being pulled around by the
measurements, but you see that it tracks

65
00:03:15,576 --> 00:03:19,402
the real state much better than
the measurements do, right?

66
00:03:19,402 --> 00:03:23,022
because it's blending a prediction,
where it's estimating the velocity with

67
00:03:23,022 --> 00:03:25,773
the ability to incorporate
the measurements.

68
00:03:25,773 --> 00:03:29,175
If you want to take a look at the,
the error bars here a little bit,

69
00:03:29,175 --> 00:03:30,687
one of the things that cool.

70
00:03:30,687 --> 00:03:31,906
In fact, I'll look at just the last one.

71
00:03:31,906 --> 00:03:33,009
Right?

72
00:03:33,009 --> 00:03:38,001
This is the error bar of our prediction,
okay?

73
00:03:38,001 --> 00:03:41,519
So remember, you see, it says, the
predicted mean, which is right there.

74
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:44,584
And after we did the common filtering
this was our new guess, all right?

75
00:03:44,584 --> 00:03:50,180
And our error bars got smaller, okay?

76
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:55,604
So, again, this is what's happening
is we take a step, we get bigger.

77
00:03:55,604 --> 00:03:57,850
We take a measurement,
we move and we get smaller.
