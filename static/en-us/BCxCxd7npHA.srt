1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,020
Building capacity is constant.

2
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:03,179
It's not going to change.

3
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:05,380
Unless we bulldoze the building or
something.

4
00:00:05,379 --> 00:00:07,730
So we declare building capacity
with the keyword, let.

5
00:00:08,869 --> 00:00:12,109
Attendance on the other hand,
will increase and decrease over time.

6
00:00:12,109 --> 00:00:14,219
So we declare attendance
with the key word var.
