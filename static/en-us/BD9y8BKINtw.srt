1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:03,150
When the service worker
is first registered,

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:05,180
it triggers an install event.

3
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:09,280
This is the perfect time to pre-cache
all of the resources needed for

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,730
the App Shell.

5
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:15,130
Lets have an event listener that
will fire on the install event so

6
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:17,910
that we can cached the resources
required by the end of the App Shell.

7
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:21,310
The HTML, CSS and any JavaScript.

8
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:27,610
First, we need to open the cache with
caches.open and provide a cache name.

9
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:32,710
Providing a cache name allows us
to version files or separate data

10
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:37,790
from the App Shell so that we can easily
update but not affect other content.

11
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:45,780
Once the cache is open we can call
cache.addAll which takes a list of URL's

12
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:50,200
and then fetches them from the server
and adds the response to the cache.

13
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:53,710
Unfortunately, cache.addAll is atomic.

14
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:56,760
If any of the files fail,
the entire cache step will fail.

15
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:02,180
And I guess it would be a good idea to
provide a list of the resources that we

16
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:04,260
want to cache as part of the App Shell
