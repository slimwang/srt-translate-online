1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The next step in this funnel is remember we just talked about getting customers

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
and let's talk about keeping customers.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
This is what I called the you-should-be-so-lucky-to-have-this-problem part of the funnel,

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and that's how you grow the customers you have.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
When you're thinking about growing customers, nothing magic.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
You've now sold these customers way back here under purchased,

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and you've kept them around with relative programs and product updates,

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
but really what you'd like to do, understanding now that it's a lot cheaper

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
to sell existing customers more stuff than it is to get new customers,

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
is let's go try to sell them some stuff, and how can we do that.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Well, the first thing you might want to think about is,

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
can I un-bundle some of the stuff in my startup that I tried to package all at once.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
What are the mistakes that early stage ventures make that this new company is thinking

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,000
that you have to stick every possible feature in the product and sell it for the one price.

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
It might be possible once you understand more and more about your customers

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
to know that, you know what, most people just kind of want the base product

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
or you might have a freemium strategy which just says I'll give them the base product for free

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
but really understanding that what they're going to want some percentage is these other things.

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Un-bundling is just a fancy word for saying--can I somehow decompose the product

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
into separate pieces, giving some for free or if you're lucky, charging for everyone of them.

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I used to do this all the time to actually increase the average selling price by un-bundling the product.

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
And next thing to think about is can I up-sell the product.

23
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
A retailer in the United States called Sears had a line of tools

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
that they sold to people who made things and their product line always

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
had three types of products--good, better, and best.

26
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
And what they would try to get you to do is get you into the store

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
looking at the price of the good product but then when you got there, you said--

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
well, I deserve better and then someday I could aspire to the best.

29
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
And so that was kind of up-selling in the same product line

30
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
and in fact in the United States from the 1920s to the 1960s,

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
the master of up-selling was General Motors.

32
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
When they had separate brands, each had a fixed price point.

33
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
You started buying a car with a Chevrolet then you moved up to a Buick, then a Pontiac,

34
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
then an Oldsmobile, then eventually you could aspire to a Cadillac.

35
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
And these were all kind of up-selling based on aspirations

36
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
and the quality and features of the product increase as well.

37
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
You might want to think about creating an up-sell strategy.

38
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Cross-sell, well that's also kind of simple.

39
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Gee, if you're buying one product, are there any accessories

40
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
or companion products that you ought to just figure out to make sure

41
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
that you customers are aware of or on the pricing page or on a price list say--

42
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Gee, when you buy this product, we'll give you a 20% discount off of this other one,

43
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
which most consumers would realize, ooh I'd like to have that too, and so thinking about

44
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
what adjacent products, what products next to the one you're already selling

45
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
customers can buy is a cross-selling strategy.

46
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Finally, the last piece is referrals and that's another grow strategy.

47
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
And referrals basically generates this outer viral loop.

48
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Remember what we were trying to do in the initial purchase

49
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
or get your new customers to start telling their friends about your products,

50
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
you want to do the same thing after you've had those customers for a while.

51
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Maybe now you want to give them discounts on future purchases.

52
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:26,000
You want to say thank you for doing this, by the way, a $100 off or $5 off to the next purchase.

53
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
When you bring in the next new customers, banks now think that's a popular strategy,

54
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
and this referral program just helps your customers,

55
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
hopefully, who are satisfied sell more of your product for you.

56
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
And so that's get, keep, and now grow customers.

57
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:48,000
By the way, this grow funnel just like in get customers, there's nothing magic about cross-sell,

58
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
up-sell, and un-bundling, there might be other strategies

59
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
that your company and your startup might want to stick in to this funnel as well.

60
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
We put this up as kind of a canonical model because most companies

61
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
tend to use these types of techniques but it really depends

62
00:04:00,000 --> 99:59:59,999
on what you're industry and product line is.
