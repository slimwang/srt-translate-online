1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:02,410
Okay, I'm going to choose
a really big font, and

2
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:04,900
then I'll try a really small font.

3
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:07,640
So I picked display three here,
which is 56sp.

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,390
And remember to, add an attribute
before the tag is closed.

5
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:17,610
So I'll hit enter here and
then add textSize attribute.

6
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:20,360
Cool.

7
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:23,370
And then the text is giant over here.

8
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:29,420
Now I can try a smaller size,
of maybe some body text

9
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:34,310
which would be 14 SP,
so I'll erase this and

10
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:39,960
then say 14, and
then it's tiny again, cool.

11
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,040
Okay, so we finished the first task.

12
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:45,472
The optional challenge was to try
learning about the text appearance

13
00:00:45,472 --> 00:00:49,850
attribute on your own from the Google
Plus protip that I included a link to.

14
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:51,480
Let's open that up now.

15
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:55,580
So, this is an Android dev protip
that was written by yours truly, for

16
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:58,100
the Android developers Google Plus page.

17
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00,640
If you haven't already,
you can follow the Google Plus page for

18
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,989
Android developers, to get the latest
news on Android development.

19
00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:08,900
Or if you'd prefer Twitter,
you can follow our account there.

20
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:12,040
So basically in this short pro tip,
I talk about

21
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:15,840
again how too many font sizes can be
visually distracting for your user.

22
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:20,930
So you can use the recommended font
sizes in the Material Design spec, or

23
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:25,970
you can also choose from a standard set
of type sizes, provided by Android,

24
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:28,370
which is small, medium and large.

25
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:32,650
So instead of text size, you said
the Android TextAppearance attribute

26
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:38,020
to be androidTextAppearanceLarge,
or you can set small or medium.

27
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:42,380
These TextAppearance values
map to these SP font sizes.

28
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:45,390
So with these ever changing Android

29
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:49,090
then your code will
automatically get the new value.

30
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:53,190
Using text appearance is grea,t because
you don't have to worry about specific

31
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:54,940
SP values, and

32
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:58,190
you can still be consistent
with other apps on the device.

33
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:01,530
For example, for
a title you can use large, for

34
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:06,160
a list item you can use medium, or
for a caption you can use small.

35
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:10,090
So these are good buckets to work with.

36
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:13,170
You can try the mat in our code
by copying this line here.

37
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:17,600
You can use cmd+Ccor you can use
ctrl+c if you're on a Windows machine.

38
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:21,000
Go over to our code here.

39
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:24,450
I'm going to delete this text size line,

40
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:27,780
because we're going to
add text appearance.

41
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,890
Hit command V or control V.

42
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:33,900
So now android text appearance
is text appearance large.

43
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:38,510
And you can see that the preview has
updated to have the larger font size.

44
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:39,860
That's pretty neat, right?

45
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:44,150
And you can also change
this to be medium or small.

46
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:47,100
So in general,
this is really useful to know,

47
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,930
if you don't want to
declare specific SP values.

48
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:55,090
So if you have no idea which
SP values you want to use,

49
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:56,870
you can just pick from small,
medium, large.
