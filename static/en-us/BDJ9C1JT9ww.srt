00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
[Evans] The answer is not much harder at all.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
All the attacker has to do-- The attacker has compromised the password file.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
That contains the line giving the salt for Alice and her encrypted password.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
To break the password, the attacker needs to try possible passwords

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
concatenated with that salt and find one that matches the hash value.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 99:59:59,999
This seems like the salting doesn't help us at all, but let's change the question a little bit.
