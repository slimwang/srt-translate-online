00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:05,020
I'm Pete Lepage, a developer
advocate on the web team at Google.

2
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:06,160
In this course,

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,490
I'm going to teach you the fundamentals
of progressive web apps.

4
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:12,060
And you're going to put
your new skills to work

5
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:14,980
building your own progressive web app.

6
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:19,880
Progressive web apps are experiences
that combine the best of the web and

7
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:21,510
the best of apps.

8
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:26,650
They give users the kind of reliable,
fast, and engaging experience

9
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:31,620
that they've come to expect from native
apps, but delivered through the web.

10
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:35,300
They're reliable and
load quickly, even on slow or

11
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:39,220
intermittent networks, or
when there's no network at all.

12
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:43,030
They're fast, and scroll,
and animate smoothly.

13
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:47,000
They're engaging, sending relevant
push notifications to users.

14
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:51,450
And they're integrated,
showing up on the home screen and

15
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:54,539
loading as a top level, full screen app.

16
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:59,830
In this course, you'll learn how
to architect a single page app

17
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:04,230
using the app shell model which
separates content form the data, and

18
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:09,120
how to ensure that the app gets data
onscreen as quickly as possible.

19
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,710
Then we'll dive in to service workers.

20
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:14,400
You'll learn about different
caching strategies and

21
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,720
how to use the most appropriate ones for
different needs.

22
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:22,200
By the end of the lesson,
your progressive web app

23
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:26,260
will use a service worker to
cache the app shell and the data.

24
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:28,850
So it'll work whether your online or
offline.

25
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:31,920
Finally, you'll learn the ins and

26
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,789
out of how to make your app
installable via the web app manifest.

27
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:41,920
All of these features are built
entirely using progressive enhancement.

28
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,970
They will light up and be available to
users who have a browser that support

29
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:50,410
them, while other users will
still get a standard experience.

30
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:51,650
So, let's get started!
