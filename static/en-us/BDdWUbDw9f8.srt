1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,430
Finally, I want to emphasize again that a key requirement

2
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:06,880
in mobile web development is optimizing for battery usage. Battery

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:09,690
life in your user's mobile device is an incredibly precious

4
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:12,180
resource. So I want to call this out as an explicit

5
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:15,970
goal, even though it's hard to directly measure. The best

6
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:19,450
way to optimize battery life is, well, to only do work

7
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:22,420
when you need to. This may seem pretty obvious, but

8
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:25,470
all the things we've talked about in this lesson are applicable

9
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:29,990
to this. In fact, network usage, computation, and

10
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:33,970
rendering are all heavy indicators of battery usage.

11
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:36,100
But the other APIs we'll talk about later

12
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:39,610
can also affect this. For example, using the GPS

13
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:42,910
changes battery usage, as does the camera. One

14
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:45,430
final comment, there are several tools out there

15
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:47,310
that will analyze your page for you and

16
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:50,840
make some suggestions on how to improve your performance.

17
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:54,080
My personal favorite, of course, is PageSpeed Insights

18
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,750
which is a Google tool that you can

19
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:57,850
point at any website and it will give

20
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:00,510
you feedback on your performance. With that, and

21
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:02,930
the tools you've acquired in this lesson, you're

22
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:05,780
on your way to designing performant web apps.

23
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:07,170
In the problem set, we're going to be

24
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:09,914
going over testing the conference app, with PageSpeed.
