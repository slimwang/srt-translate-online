1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,860
How can we see some
evidence of stack behavior.

2
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:06,100
It'd be nice if we could see console
output every time one of our

3
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:08,510
view controllers was
popped off the stack.

4
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:11,440
Every time the OSD
allocates a swift class

5
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,860
including our view controller
it calls a deinitializer.

6
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:18,850
What if we put a print statement
into the deinitializer like this.

7
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:21,660
Think about what would appear
down here in the console

8
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:25,320
if a print statement was added to the
deinit method in the ViewController for

9
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,090
make your own adventure.

10
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:30,970
Or see for yourself by adding this
method to the ViewController class.

11
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:32,820
Then answer the quiz question.

12
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,990
ViewControllers are deinitialized.

13
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:39,680
When they are no longer on the screen,
they slide off the screen to the right,

14
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,480
or they're covered up by a new
Controller sliding in from the right.
