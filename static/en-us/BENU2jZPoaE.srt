1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,150
As you can see, exactly counting the number of time steps

2
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:07,790
even though we have a very simple model of just three rules

3
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:13,390
and a code that doesn't even have a variable input is already quite tedious.

4
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:17,300
We are going to introduce a number of additional simplifications

5
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:20,450
that will give us a little more levy here so that we do not have to go

6
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:24,770
through this exact counting process but still learns something about the algorithm.

7
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:29,430
In general, the capabilities of the RAM closely matched what you would expect from

8
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:33,100
your own computer but of course it is a simplification

9
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,790
but nevertheless it is a rather solid model.

10
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:41,020
It's difficult to design an algorithm that when you analyze it

11
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:44,860
it will give you a very different idea about its performance that it would get on the RAM.

12
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:47,870
Nevertheless, I think it's important to think about the differences

13
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:55,080
between a RAM model and a normal computer, and we will do this as a quiz.

14
00:00:55,080 --> 00:01:01,940
Here are four main simplifications that I think the RAM is making.

15
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:04,739
Here are four properties of the RAM.

16
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:08,340
The first one is simple operations take only one time step.

17
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:12,290
The second one is we assume that we have as much memory as we need.

18
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:17,410
The third one is that memory access is considered to be free in terms of time.

19
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:23,170
And the fourth one is that a unit of memory cannot hold an arbitrarily large number.

20
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:27,160
And of course this is going to be subjective, but I would like you to tell me

21
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:34,350
which of these four properties you think is realistic in the sense that it comes pretty close

22
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:37,130
to a real computer and which of these you would consider unrealistic

23
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:41,430
meaning of you were to run your algorithm on a real machine

24
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:46,010
then there would be considerable differences and again the answers to these are subjective.

25
00:01:46,010 --> 99:59:59,999
If you get stuck or if you disagree with me just take next and see where our opinions differ.
