1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:04,000
The MemeMe app lets you create
a meme with an image and some text.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,180
Everyone loves a good meme.

3
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:07,610
And it's easy to get
a laugh from friends.

4
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:10,160
This is the meme editor view controller.

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,400
It lets you select a picture and
edit text at the top and

6
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,200
the bottom of the picture.

7
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,220
The picture can be selected from
the device's photo album or

8
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:20,010
by using the camera.

9
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:24,020
When I press on the camera button in the
bottom toolbar, the camera launches and

10
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:26,280
I can take a new picture
to use in a meme.

11
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:27,820
When I press on the album button,

12
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:31,580
I'm brought to the photo library where
I can choose from recent photos.

13
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:33,830
I like this one of the baby hedgehog.

14
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:36,680
Whether we're using the camera or
the album, you'll use

15
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:40,540
Apple's UIImagePickerController
to select your image.

16
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:43,830
After I've chosen an image,
I return to the Meme Editor.

17
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:46,580
Notice that because of the shape
of the hedgehog picture,

18
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:49,450
I'm making my meme in landscape mode.

19
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:52,300
Here text is entered into a text field.

20
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:55,900
When the editing is complete we show
the text in an outlined white font.

21
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:58,590
It's slightly different from
impact to the true meme font, but

22
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:02,200
it's pretty close, and
available among Iowa stock funds.

23
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:06,390
When I click inside the bottom text
field, notice how the view slides up so

24
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:09,680
that the keyboard doesn't
obscure the bottom text field.

25
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,240
Now our meme is ready to go,
so let's share it.

26
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,480
You can find the share button
in the upper left corner.

27
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:18,400
And here's our old friend,
the activity view controller.

28
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,346
Let's send this to Kunal.

29
00:01:22,446 --> 00:01:23,710
And that's all there is to it.
