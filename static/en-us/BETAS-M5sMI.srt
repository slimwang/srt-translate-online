1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The tricky part is if I have an expression like m*x + b

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I want to make sure that I parse that as if m and x are together and not x and b are together.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Another way to say that is I want to see any expression as if it were the sequence

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
of something plus something else plus something else.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
These pluses can also be minus signs,

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:30,000
but anything with the time sign, I want to have that all be within the dot-dot-dot

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
rather than encompassing a plus sign in it.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
What I want to do is write a grammar that defines the language of these expressions.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Grammar is a description. It's finite in length, and it should be easy to write.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
A language is the set of all possible strings that that grammar describes.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I want to be able to say that in a concise language.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Maybe something like saying I'm going to define expressions,

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
and I want to define the expression as something that looks like this.

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I need a name for the dot-dot-dots.

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Let's call that a term.

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
An expression can be a term, a minus or a plus.

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Let's use regular expression notation to describe a plus or minus.

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Then more terms, but I can just say recursively that that's an expression.

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
That will give me any number of terms with plus and minuses in between them.

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
That's one possibility, but that's recursive, and I need a base case

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,000
so I can say it can also be the case that an expression can consist of a single term--

22
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:38,000
a + b is an expression, a + b + c is an expression, and also just a.

23
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
That's the rule for expression.

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Then I would write the rule for term.

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
It would be similar.

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
It would take into account the multiply and divide,

27
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
and I would write the rest of the grammar in this format.

28
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Notice here I've just sort of made up--I've used wishful thinking

29
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,000
to say I wish I had a notation like this to describe what the grammar is.
