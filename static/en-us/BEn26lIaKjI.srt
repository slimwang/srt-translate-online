00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,875
So you may have noticed that I haven't actually taught you much of anything new

2
00:00:03,875 --> 00:00:08,268
yet. All this is really just a new notation for manipulating different kinds of

3
00:00:08,268 --> 00:00:12,363
expressions. However, this new notation gives us an important way to think

4
00:00:12,363 --> 00:00:17,510
about functions. Just like variables can be added, subtracted, multiplied and

5
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:22,682
divided, so can functions. In fact, there's an even shorter, easier way of

6
00:00:22,682 --> 00:00:26,220
representing things like f of x plus g of x, or any of the other things I have

7
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:32,729
written down here. Let me show you. And, this is all it is. If we want to add

8
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:36,121
two functions, f and g, and of course they're dealing with the same variable,

9
00:00:36,121 --> 00:00:40,931
which in this case is x. Then we just write in parentheses, f plus g, showing

10
00:00:40,931 --> 00:00:45,928
that they're one combined function when we add them together like this. So we

11
00:00:45,928 --> 00:00:52,438
have f plus g of x. Similarly, for subtraction, we can have f minus g of x. For

12
00:00:52,438 --> 00:00:56,190
multiplication we just multiply f and g together inside the first parentheses,

13
00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:01,230
and for division, we do the same thing with dividing. If we have the functions

14
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:05,190
f of x equals x, and g of x equals x squared minus x, then please tell me what

15
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:10,469
we get for each of these combined functions down here.
