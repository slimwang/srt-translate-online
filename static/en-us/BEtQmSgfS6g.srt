1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:03,800
So here's my method,
get GeoFence pending intent.

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:08,750
To this I create a new intent and
I pass it that this is the context.

3
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:12,710
And if you remember earlier we created
a GeoFence transitions intent service.

4
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:15,010
So we just specify the class of that.

5
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:18,388
So our new intent is going to
be a GeoFence transitions intent

6
00:00:18,388 --> 00:00:19,620
service type.

7
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:22,530
And then we return pending intent or
get service.

8
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:27,090
This, zero, intent,
which is the intent we've just created.

9
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:30,454
And then this
PendingIntent.FLAG_UPDATE_CURRENT.

10
00:00:30,454 --> 00:00:32,530
We use FLAG_UPDATE_CURRENT so

11
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:37,660
that we get the same PendingIntent
back when we call addGeofences.

12
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:39,990
We want to keep the PendingIntent
consistent across them all.
