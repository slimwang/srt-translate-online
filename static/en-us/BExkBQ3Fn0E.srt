1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,655
Let's change this same problem a little bit. Instead of just being greater than,

2
00:00:05,772 --> 00:00:11,040
I'm going to have greater than or equal to. What additional value can x now be?

3
00:00:11,157 --> 00:00:15,465
Is it 0, 1, 2, 3, or do no additional values work?
