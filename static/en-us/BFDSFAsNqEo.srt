00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,149
We want to start by looking for our Greatest Common Factor and what do you know

2
00:00:04,149 --> 00:00:08,451
all the coefficients are even, so 2 can come out. Now that we factored out a 2,

3
00:00:08,451 --> 00:00:13,338
we want to continue factoring this inside portion if possible. We want to find

4
00:00:13,338 --> 00:00:18,722
factors of positive 14 and some to negative 15. This 14 comes from multiplying

5
00:00:18,722 --> 00:00:23,862
the coefficient of the x squared term 2 by the constant term 7. The negative 15

6
00:00:23,862 --> 00:00:28,998
is simply the coefficient of our x term. We have a positive 14 and a negative

7
00:00:28,998 --> 00:00:33,690
15. This must mean every factor in a factor pair must be negative. We want to

8
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:38,730
use negative 1 and negative 14 since they multiply to give us positive 14 and

9
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:43,246
they add to negative 15. We continue factoring this portion by rewriting the

10
00:00:43,246 --> 00:00:47,426
middle term with these two factors as coefficients for x. Then we factor by

11
00:00:47,426 --> 00:00:51,498
grouping. We take out an x from the first two terms and a negative 7 from the

12
00:00:51,498 --> 00:00:56,078
second two terms. When I remove a negative 7 from positive 7, I'm left with

13
00:00:56,078 --> 00:01:01,450
negative 1 here. I also know I did this step correctly, since negative 7 times

14
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:06,657
2x is negative 14x. And negative 7 times negative 1 is positive 7. We have a

15
00:01:06,657 --> 00:01:11,563
common factor of 2x minus 1. So this is our completed factor form. Fantastic

16
00:01:11,563 --> 00:01:13,513
work, if you got that correct.
