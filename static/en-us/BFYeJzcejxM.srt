1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So here's the code that we need to finish.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
We need a test condition for the while, and in this case

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
we really want to keep on going forever until we're done.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
So, we're going to use while True and then use break to stop the loop.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
The test condition is true, and the way we know when we're done is when

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
the value returned as the URL was none.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
That means we got to the else, so to finish,

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
we need to finish the else block by using break.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Now let's test our code.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
We'll call print_all_links with our test string

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
that has test 1, test 2,

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
and test 3 as the 3 links.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
And when we run this, what we see is it prints out the 3 links,

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
test 1, test 2, and test 3.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
We'll try a more interesting test.

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
For a more interesting example, let's go back to the web page

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
we looked at earlier.

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
This was the page with the flying Python comic.

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
And it has many links in it,

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
and we saw when we did view source we can see

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
what those links look like,

22
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
so the first link that we see on the page.

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
So if we use Command-F [or Ctrl-F], we can search for the first link on the page.

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
We see that we have these links.

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The first one is the link to Archive,

26
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
and that corresponds to what we see here at the top of the page.

27
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Here's the link to Archive, the link to Blag,

28
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
the link to the Store and About and Forums.

29
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
And so there's a lot of links on this page.

30
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
If we go back to our print_all_links code, we can try to print them all.

31
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
First, let's look at what we actually see when we do get_page

32
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,000
passing in the URL of xkcd.com/353,

33
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
which is the page we were looking at.

34
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
And when we run this, we see a lot of text printed out,

35
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
and that's exactly what we saw from view source,

36
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
but now that's what we're getting as the result from get_page.

37
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
That's the text of the web page.

38
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Not very easy to look at.

39
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Instead of using get_page, we'll print all the links on the page

40
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
instead of just printing the whole page out.

41
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Now we're using our print_all_links procedure

42
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
to print all the links in the xkcd page.

43
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
And when we run this, we indeed see all the links on the page.

44
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
At least we see most of them.

45
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
There are a few that we missed, and we'll talk about that in a later unit,

46
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
but we're seeing many of the links on the page, including the first ones that we saw

47
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
with the Archive and the Blag and the Store link,

48
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
and we're seeing lots of other links.

49
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
And you can see that we go all the way to the

50
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Buttercup Festival link and the license link.

51
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Those are the 2 at the bottom of the page.

52
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
This is the link to license,

53
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
which was the last one that we printed out.

54
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
So, congratulations are in order.

55
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
You've made it to the end of Unit 2, and I hope

56
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
you understand the main concepts that we've seen so far.

57
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
In Unit 1 we saw variables.

58
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
We learned about programs.

59
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
We saw how to do arithmetic.

60
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
In Unit 2 we learned about making procedures,

61
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
and we learned how to use if to make decisions,

62
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
and we saw that those by themselves were enough to do

63
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
every possible computer program as Alan Turing showed in the 1930s.

64
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
We also learned about while loops,

65
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
a way to make it more convenient to do things over again.

66
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
And now we've actually got a really good start on our search engine.

67
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
We can print all the links on the page.

68
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
We still don't have our web crawler.

69
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
We need to actually collect those links and do something with them.

70
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
That's what we're going to do in Unit 3, and then in Unit 4, 5, and 6,

71
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
we'll see how to use the corpus that we've built

72
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
to do useful web searches, but we've come a long way,

73
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
and I hope we'll see you back soon for Unit 3.
