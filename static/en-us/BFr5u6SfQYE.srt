1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,440
The right answer is log n to the base two

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:05,140
ceiling of log n to the base two and of

3
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:09,080
course, from the example that we just saw, with n

4
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:12,210
equal to five. We saw that at the end of

5
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:16,110
three rounds, everybody has gotten a message from every other

6
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:19,382
node in the entire system. And therefore it is common

7
00:00:19,382 --> 00:00:21,970
knowledge at that point that that has been reached. So

8
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:25,320
the right answer is ceiling of log n To the

9
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,750
base two, and if you chose log N to the

10
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:31,740
base two, you're not far off from the right answer but,

11
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,560
you know, the reason why it is ceiling is because of

12
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,990
the fact that N need not be a power of two.
