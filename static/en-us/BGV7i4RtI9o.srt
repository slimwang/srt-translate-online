How about this one? Is this an algorithm? If so what does it do? You'll need a

2
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:09,920
little bit more detail. This is a two by eight block and this is a two by two

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:14,860
block. And I can stick blocks together like this. Is this an algorithm? Yes or

4
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:21,487
no? If not, why not? If so, what does it make? An L, an H, a doorway or

00:00:21,487 --> 00:00:24,052
something else?
