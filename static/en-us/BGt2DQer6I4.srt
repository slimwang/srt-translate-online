In this lesson, you've seen
the basics of two SQL statements.

2

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:09,070

4
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:12,300
You've also applied joins in
aggregations to answer a variety of

5
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:13,470
questions.

6
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:16,010
In the next lesson,
we'll talk about creating tables and

7

You'll also learn how to extend your
analysis by connecting your database

10
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,210
powers to your Python
programming skills.

11
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:26,730
See you there.
