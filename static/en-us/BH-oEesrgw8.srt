The post crest ql database server,

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:05,050
has already been installed
on your virtual machine.

3
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:10,490
The psql program, lets you log into the
database and do queries interactively.

4
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:12,240
Here, let's look at the database for
the forum.

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,720
If you're on psql forum,
look at a database prompt like this.

6
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:20,470
Now you can run select
statements like this one, and

7
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:22,760
that's something we saw back
in lesson one actually.

8
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:24,580
But, how about this.

9
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:27,790
Okay huh, looks like an empty table,
zero rows.

10
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:32,020
Yeah, your VM came with an empty table,
for you to connect the forum app too.

11
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:33,800
That's just because we're
not covering creating new

12
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:34,960
tables until the next lesson.

13
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:38,430
Now if we look at what
types these columns are,

14
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:42,630
it looks like, content is text.

15
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:50,050
Time is some sort of time stamp, and
ID is an integer, plus something weird.

16
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:52,060
We'll see more about that later on.

17
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:52,820
For right now,

18
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:56,760
the ones of these that we really need
to focus on, are content and time.

19
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,100
We'll use the text column,

20
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:01,970
content to store the contents
of user's forum posts.

21
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,710
And we'll use the time column to
store the time they posted, so

22
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:08,890
we can put them in order
with the most recent first.

23
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:12,350
You can press q to go
back to the psql prompt.

24
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:14,010
Now let's dig into the forum code and
do it.
