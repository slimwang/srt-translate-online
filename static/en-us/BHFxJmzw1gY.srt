1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:05,868
Let's do this thing. So, we'll go to cell A2, Command, Shift, Right arrow key,

2
00:00:05,868 --> 00:00:13,350
Command, Shift Down arrow key, highlighting all the data. Data, Sort range,

3
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:18,697
Sort by column B. And even though it says A to Z, that also applies for

4
00:00:18,697 --> 00:00:26,820
numbers, from least to greatest. Ascending rather than descending, and then

5
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:35,678
Sort. And now, we have all our data sorted. Note that it starts in cell B2 and

6
00:00:35,678 --> 00:00:42,783
goes to B28. Meaning, there are 27 values that we're interested in. And that

7
00:00:42,783 --> 00:00:49,500
means our median is going to be this one, 479. With 479, we have 13 values

8
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:58,922
greater, and that's because we're going from cell 16, B16 until B28. So, we can

9
00:00:58,922 --> 00:01:06,530
find that number of cells by just doing 28 minus 16 plus 1, that gives us 13.

10
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:16,500
And there are 13 values below 479. And likewise, we can do 14 minus 2 plus 1,

11
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:25,432
which gives us 13. So, here's our median in the 14th place. It says 15 here,

12
00:01:25,432 --> 00:01:32,563
but that's because the data starts at cell 2. So, this is the 14th value.
