00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:03,240
Let's do a quick exercise to
practice these transformations.

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:09,300
Use the transformations discussed to
transform the linear program on the left

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,690
to the form on the right.

4
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:13,170
And note here that x1 and

5
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:18,200
x2 should be the same, but x3 might be
a different variable in these two cases.
