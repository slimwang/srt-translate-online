00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,660
I've got another spot
the difference challenge for

2
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:06,980
you with some pictures that I took
on my most recent trip to Paris.

3
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:09,770
Both of these images pretty
much look the same, but

4
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:11,660
can you spot the difference?

5
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:13,490
Once again, DevTools are definitely
going to help you out.

6
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:17,850
You can find a link to that
site in the instructor notes.

7
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:19,750
What's the difference between them?

8
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:22,430
Is it their compression level,
their display size,

9
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:24,180
their natural size, or their type?

10
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:26,080
Check all that apply.
