Hi, I'm Luke.

00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:02,610
>> And I'm Anthony.

00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:03,980
>> And we're coaches here at Udacity.

4
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:06,950
When you're first learning to code,
both concepts and

5
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:09,470
tools are being presented
to you at the same time.

6
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:11,340
It can be hard to
understand the concepts.

7
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:15,430
If you aren't sure how to use the tools
you need to apply the concepts yourself.

00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:18,250

That will help you really make the most
of your Udacity learning experience.

11
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:26,680
And they'll be useful throughout your
entire life as a computer programmer.

12
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:27,870
>> That's right.

13
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:30,870
Next, we'll talk with Mike,
a programmer with years of experience.

14
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:33,890
To find out why it's so important to
set up your workspace for development.
