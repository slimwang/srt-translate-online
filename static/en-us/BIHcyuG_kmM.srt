00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,605
It's time for a quiz to see how well you understand inheritance and adding

2
00:00:03,605 --> 00:00:07,682
methods to classes. Your goal for this quiz is to find a Discerning bear class

3
00:00:07,682 --> 00:00:11,906
that chases and knocks down trees like a Grizzly Bear, but does not like to eat

4
00:00:11,906 --> 00:00:16,288
humans named Dave. It should behave like this. So we'll create two humans, one

5
00:00:16,288 --> 00:00:20,290
named Dave and one named Bob, and have them both climb trees. And then we'll

6
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:24,406
create a Discerning Bear. The Bear can chase Bob, knocks down the tree, yummy,

7
00:00:24,406 --> 00:00:31,522
Bob tastes good. But when the Discerning Bear chases Dave, Kimber[NOISE]. I'm

8
00:00:31,522 --> 00:00:35,830
not eating Dave. So that's the behavior your Discerning Bear should have and

9
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:40,513
your goal is to define your Discerning Bear, using as little code as possible.
