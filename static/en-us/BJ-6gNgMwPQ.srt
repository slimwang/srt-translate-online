1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,517
We should multiply both sides by 10. I know I should multiply by 10 because I

2
00:00:04,529 --> 00:00:08,952
have 5 and 8 10ths and 2 and 1 10th. Tenth is the smallest place value I have.

3
00:00:09,055 --> 00:00:13,626
And I know multiplying by 10 moves the decimal one place to the right. So that

4
00:00:13,638 --> 00:00:15,178
will clear those decimals.
