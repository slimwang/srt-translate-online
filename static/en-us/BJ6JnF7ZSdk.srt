00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,410
Let me show you what
this depth ambiguity

2
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:06,300
how it manifests itself in real images.

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:09,560
For example, here, you've seen
lots of these types of images.

4
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:13,490
Somebody basically being at a different
distance that is, in the scale,

5
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:17,970
which in this image means how far
that person is from an object, and

6
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:21,300
depending on where they are, you can
actually see them to be the same size.

7
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,430
Of course, you know that Leaning of
Tower of Pisa and this person are,

8
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:26,440
of course, not the same size.

9
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:29,160
You've seen other fun
images like this or

10
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:33,210
other images that basically show
how big your pumpkin could be and

11
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:36,450
this is actually what we also saw
when we talked about cameras, right?

12
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:42,270
Two different lenses actually basically
showed different depth information.

13
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,220
Here this person is looking bigger than
this one and again, they are exactly

14
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:50,790
the same distance here but they look
the same size, depending on where I am.

15
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:53,200
The scaling factor that
comes in from the lenses.

16
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:57,670
So this is the depth ambiguity that is
hard to decipher if somebody just gave

17
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:01,590
me a single image and that's the point
that we want to actually try to

18
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:05,200
take to the next level on asking
the question, how we can get depth?
