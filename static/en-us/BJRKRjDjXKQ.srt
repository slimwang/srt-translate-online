1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,093
So now that we know how to simplify terms,
we can get back to Grant and his gleaming

2
00:00:04,105 --> 00:00:07,816
glasses. Earlier, we came up with
expressions for the amount of money that

3
00:00:07,828 --> 00:00:11,593
Grant's going to make from his friends
buying his wipers, and also from them

4
00:00:11,605 --> 00:00:15,503
buying his nozzles, and we had an equation
for the total amount of money earned.

5
00:00:15,712 --> 00:00:19,052
Saying that the total amount of money
he's going to earn from his friends is

6
00:00:19,052 --> 00:00:23,073
equal to the amount that they spent on his
wipers plus the amount that they spent on

7
00:00:23,073 --> 00:00:28,775
his nozzles. Now I'm going to add one more
equation into the mix for you or rather

8
00:00:28,787 --> 00:00:32,867
create one more variable. Total money
earned right here takes a long time to

9
00:00:32,879 --> 00:00:40,281
write, so instead I'm going to call this a
different variable. Let's say a. So, with

10
00:00:40,281 --> 00:00:45,676
my other equations up here, I can also
write total money earned euals a.

11
00:00:45,676 --> 00:00:50,304
So let's combine all this information that we
came up with in our earlier quizzes and

12
00:00:50,304 --> 00:00:54,587
the new information that I just gave you
that a stands for the total amount of

13
00:00:54,587 --> 00:00:58,385
money earned. Which of these expressions
down here, do you think should replace

14
00:00:58,397 --> 00:01:03,702
this question mark, in this equation for
a? You can check as many answers as you

15
00:01:03,702 --> 00:01:07,351
think are right. I know this is a lot to
look at on the screen at one time, but

16
00:01:07,351 --> 00:01:11,052
once we come up with this final equation,
we'll only have single letters and

17
00:01:11,052 --> 00:01:14,317
numbers, and no more words, in our
equation, and that will make things much

18
00:01:14,317 --> 00:01:16,269
easier for the future.
