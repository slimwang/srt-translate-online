1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:02,029
When you've got it all working, then go

2
00:00:02,029 --> 00:00:05,420
ahead and extend the code. Add a function greet

3
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:10,570
by period that takes the name and a period or a period's a time of day like

4
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:16,680
morning, afternoon, evening. And return a HelloClass object

5
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:20,030
whose greeting field includes a greeting using the name

6
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:22,670
and the period. For example, if the name is

7
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:24,290
the name is Kippy and the period is morning,

8
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:27,890
the message in the Hello Class would be: Good

9
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:30,380
morning Kippy! And if the name was Ken and

10
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:33,720
the period was evening, the message would be: Good

11
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:38,020
evening, Ken! Add this Endpoints API function to your app,

12
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:40,750
try it out in the API's explorer, and update

13
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:43,520
index with html to allow people to call this

14
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,110
function from the UI. So just to remind it

15
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:52,917
to go to the API Explorer. Go to /_ah/api/explorer and

16
00:00:52,917 --> 00:00:58,440
when you've got your app working and it's got this new

17
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:02,530
function. This function must have this exact name because we're going

18
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:04,290
to test it and if you use a different name our

19
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:07,360
test won't work. Go ahead and enter your app id here
