00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,912
Now that we have a general form for the shifted version of the parabola y equals

2
00:00:03,912 --> 00:00:07,880
x squared. Let's work with this a little bit. A lot of parabolas we see don't

3
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:11,997
have equations that are already in this form. So to see what other equations we

4
00:00:11,997 --> 00:00:16,155
could eventually get back to this general form, I'd like you to multiply out the

5
00:00:16,155 --> 00:00:19,898
right side of the equation. Then make sure that you combine like terms.
