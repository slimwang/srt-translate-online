1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So now let's have you try it out on your own.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Using the interpreter, write a Python function called small_words

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
that accepts a list of strings as input and yields

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
only those that are at most 3 letters long.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Since you'll be using yield, this is a generator function.
