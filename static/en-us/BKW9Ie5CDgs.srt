00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,750
At Udacity we just released a new feature.

2
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:03,500
Text.

3
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:06,440
Tada! You'll be able to start seeing reading more so

4
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,320
it'll show up inside your courses.

5
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,710
But don't worry, we aren't going to make you read a novel or

6
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:13,720
a textbook but sometimes it's useful to leave text for you.

7
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:16,440
Like you might see GitHub instructions or

8
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,538
a project rubric inside a reading morsel.

9
00:00:18,538 --> 00:00:20,920
But the Udacity classroom isn't too large.

10
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:23,150
We only have this much space to work with.

11
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:25,910
So, instead of forcing everything to move down,

12
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:28,720
we use an overflow to make sure that text can scroll.

13
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:31,010
You've probably seen something like this on other web sites.

14
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:32,980
Let's see what this looks like in CSS.

15
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:36,210
I will right click here, go to inspect elements,.

16
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:40,716
Inside Div Tools, we can see that the text on the screen has this CSS class for

17
00:00:40,716 --> 00:00:43,670
overflow:auto within the reading-area class.

18
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:45,430
If we uncheck it, let's see what happens.

19
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:47,680
I'll click it and make Div Tools disappear.

20
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,720
We can see that the text is flowing outside of the classroom and

21
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:52,120
into the elements below it.

22
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,200
And this is obviously a problem.

23
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,100
Let me go ahead and

24
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:58,190
turn Overflow Auto back on, and everything is safely back in here.

25
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:00,860
It's worth keeping overflow in mind in the event that you've got a lot of

26
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:02,700
text you want to contain in a small area
