1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:05,260
So here I am back at my code and I have pasted both the account_sid and the

2
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:09,730
Authorization Token, into my program. Now the next thing I want to change, is

3
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:14,000
the body of the text message. I will change it to something I actually want to

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,070
send which is, My name is Ron Burgandy?

5
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:25,530
With a question mark. Now for this 'to' number the commons in the code

6
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:28,350
suggests that I have to replace it with my

7
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:32,159
phone number. So, I'm going to select and change

8
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:35,590
this to my phone number with my country code.

9
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:37,500
This by the way is also the number I

10
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:41,930
registered with twilio previously. Then they say the from

11
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:44,460
number, I have to replace it with my Twilio

12
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:47,950
number. Now, I remember that Twilio actually gave me

13
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:50,790
a phone number, but I didn't quite save it.

14
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:53,310
So, if I go back to my accounts page, and click

15
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:59,210
on Numbers. I can get my phone number from Twilio. All right,

16
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:02,720
back to the code and now I can change that number along

17
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:07,140
with the country code. Next I will save and run my program

18
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:11,480
and this is the phone that I'm going to receive

19
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,940
the text message. So I'm just going to give my program

20
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:16,660
a few seconds op, there it is, there's my text

21
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:19,870
message. Let me read it. You probably can't read it but

22
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:24,540
it says my name is Ron Burgendy. Alright this just

23
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:27,930
blows my mind that a few lines of code like this

24
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:31,260
can help us send a text message. Okay, so now

25
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:34,710
that this code has worked, let's figure out what's actually going

26
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:35,420
on with this code.
