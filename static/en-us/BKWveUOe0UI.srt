1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,780
Companies can be large or small.

2
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:04,330
They can be in different fields,

3
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:09,900
manufacturing, agriculture,
transportation, education, finance.

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,960
No two companies are the same, but

5
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:14,950
there are a couple of things that
can be said about any company.

6
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:19,040
First, every company has customers
with a problem to be solved.

7
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:23,140
Even animal shelters and
government agencies have customers.

8
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:27,350
Maybe you work on a team that works
only with internal customers,

9
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:29,220
other company teams.

10
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:33,260
Second, companies solve problems by
providing some kind of product or

11
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:34,470
service.

12
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:38,820
A cosmetics company makes hair products
to solve the problem of bed hair.

13
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:42,199
A beverage company makes an energy
drink to combat tiredness.

14
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,860
An education company creates online
courses to close the skills gap.

15
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:52,970
A tech company creates a game engine for
mobile games to eliminate boredom.

16
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:57,280
Companies identify problems,
come up with solutions,

17
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,610
implement their ideas and
then deliver products to customers.

18
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:05,960
So you can think of it as a cycle that
starts and ends with the customer.

19
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:10,220
The challenge is to build a high
quality, cost effective and reliable

20
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:15,140
solution that you can put in the hands
of your customer as soon as possible.

21
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:18,830
It's important to be in alignment
on your overall company goal.

22
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:23,150
When development teams are rewarded for
launching new features quickly but

23
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:24,690
operations is rewarded for

24
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:30,050
keeping things stable, you have
the potential for conflict across teams.

25
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:33,480
When you realize that the real goal
is to deliver good service to your

26
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:38,400
customers, teams are more likely to
work together to find a solution.

27
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,590
To do this,
you have to understand your customers.

28
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:44,850
Are you working for external or
internal customers?

29
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:47,500
If you're a part of
a large organization,

30
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:50,240
who are the internal
people who use your work?

31
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,020
What is the main problem that your
company or division is trying to solve?
