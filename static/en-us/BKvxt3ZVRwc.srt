1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:03,969
Alright, so, I'm going to go to set times, to try and test this out.

2
00:00:03,969 --> 00:00:06,230
>> Before we go to test it out, don't forget to click

3
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:09,740
Activate. I always forget to do that, especially on work flows and approvals.

4
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:14,298
>> After activating, you cannot add or remove that's fine. Okay, we

5
00:00:14,298 --> 00:00:18,510
are activated. Set times. So should I create a new set time?

6
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:20,190
>> So you could create a new set time, or,

7
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:22,000
we could just use one of the ones we already created.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,340
>> Okay. Send it for approval?

9
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:25,260
>> Sounds good.

10
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:28,690
Alright, so there we see it. So in the

11
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:31,460
Approval History, we saw when you submitted it for approval,

12
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:31,920
>> Okay.

13
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,650
>> Who its assigned to. And then they can come here and

14
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:39,170
approve, reject or possibly reassign it to someone else to approve it.

15
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:41,080
>> And this is just visible to me because

16
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:44,470
I happen to be, the approval, the approver as well?

17
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:47,740
>> So depending on your security settings.

18
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:48,134
>> huh.

19
00:00:48,134 --> 00:00:51,530
>> You might not be able to see it, but honestly, if you can see this record,

20
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:54,000
anyone should be able to see where this is at in the Approval Flow.

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,870
>> Okay. Gotcha. Okay so now, I should have

22
00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:58,850
gotten a notification, and now I can approve it, right?

23
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:02,290
>> Right. So first, look at the status.

24
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:02,790
>> In Review.

25
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:03,700
>> It moved into Review.

26
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:04,769
>> Okay. That's pretty cool.

27
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:05,180
>> So sweet.

28
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:06,820
>> So now, should I go to Home?

29
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:08,470
>> Well, you can improve it right from here.

30
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:10,310
>> Oh, right. Here?

31
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:10,830
>> Yeah.

32
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:11,170
>> Cool.

33
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:16,810
>> So you can leave some comments with it. Do you approve the set time?

34
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:17,510
>> I approve.

35
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:20,710
>> So you can see the Record's still locked. Now

36
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:23,660
that it's confirmed, you can unlock it whenever you want.

37
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:26,250
>> Very cool. Alright. I don't want to unlock it.

38
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:26,800
>> All right.

39
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:27,560
>> I want it to be a secret.

40
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:27,940
>> Lock it up.

41
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:28,290
>> Okay.
