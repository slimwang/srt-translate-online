1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,744
So Stanley Milgram did debrief his participants. That is, he told them exactly

2
00:00:03,744 --> 00:00:06,327
what the study was about and he made it very clear to them that they never hurt

3
00:00:06,327 --> 00:00:12,338
anybody. But that's not to say that the study was without controversy. In fact,

4
00:00:12,338 --> 00:00:15,794
remember that the participants really experienced serious and real mental

5
00:00:15,794 --> 00:00:20,890
anguish and distress. When they thought they were hurting people. Now in fact,

6
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:24,418
only 5% of the people though, said that they regretted participating in the

7
00:00:24,418 --> 00:00:30,396
study. But the controversy, was started. After Milgram /g, there was a real

8
00:00:30,396 --> 00:00:34,885
serious debate, in and outside of psychology, about what was ethically okay, in

9
00:00:34,885 --> 00:00:41,057
human research. So let's look more carefully at the ethics of Stanley Milgram's

10
00:00:41,057 --> 00:00:45,594
study. So what is it that he first did, well, he first recruited participants

11
00:00:45,594 --> 00:00:50,670
by telling them that this was a study on learning and punishment. And we now

12
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:54,957
know that was a lie, it was deceptive. But is that okay, is it okay in this

13
00:00:54,957 --> 00:00:59,720
case? To use that kind of deception in research. What do you think?
