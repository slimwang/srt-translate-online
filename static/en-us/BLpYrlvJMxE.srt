00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,570
So here is our stage manager approval process. And

2
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:07,800
if I scroll down, so I've got these initial

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:12,100
submission actions, approval steps, final approval actions, final rejection

4
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:14,930
actions, all these different things. What's, what's going on here?

5
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:18,360
>> So actions and approvals are the same thing as they are in work flows,

6
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,000
you know, creating an email, or sending

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,040
an email, creating a task, updating a field.

8
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:22,590
>> Okay.

9
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:25,770
>> But the great thing about approval processes, you can add

10
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:28,050
in actions throughout all the steps of the process.

11
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:28,310
>> Okay.

12
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:30,630
>> So initial submission actions are the actions that

13
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:33,440
are fired immediately after someone submits a record for approval.

14
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:33,580
>> Okay.

15
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:38,270
>> The approval steps are the pieces of the flow that,

16
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:40,620
you know, happen as it's going down the line of approvers.

17
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:40,650
>> Mm.

18
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:43,610
>> Cause you could have one approver, just one manager. Or, you could send it

19
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:46,250
down a list of managers if you wanted a bunch of people to approve it.

20
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:46,960
>> Sure.

21
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,620
>> Then there's the final approval actions, which

22
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:51,980
is after either the last person approves it.

23
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:52,450
>> Mm-hm.

24
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:55,440
>> Rejects it, or maybe somewhere along the way, someone

25
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,390
was like, recall this approval, like, I want to take it back.

26
00:00:58,390 --> 00:00:58,610
>> Okay.

27
00:00:58,610 --> 00:00:59,800
>> And so you can set up.

28
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:00,440
>> all your actions.

29
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:01,810
>> Actions for all the parts of the flow.

30
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:03,630
>> Very cool. Okay, that makes sense.
