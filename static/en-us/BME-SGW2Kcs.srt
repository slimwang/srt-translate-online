1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:05,020
So first, we check to see if our list of skills has a length that's greater

2
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:06,020
than 0.

3
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:11,660
If it does, we start by appending our HTMLskillsStart.

4
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:15,050
We can see here that we have a formatted skill,

5
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:20,480
which is created by taking HTMLskills and calling the .replace method,

6
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:26,530
and replacing the data place holder with the first in the list of skills.

7
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:28,510
Lastly, we append that skill to the page.

8
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:31,880
And for the remaining three items,

9
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:35,660
we repeat that same code, only changing the index.
