00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,270
What answers did you come up with,
David?

2
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:05,200
>> So I counted out seven
possible next states.

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:10,170
We can put B on A, B on D,
B on the table, A on B,

4
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:13,540
A on D or D on B or D on A.

5
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:16,720
So that's seven total operations.

6
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,810
Of those, only one of them accomplishes
a goal we hadn't already accomplished,

7
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:23,360
and that's putting A up on B.

8
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:24,090
>> That's good, David.
