00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:01,694
So, quick quiz,

2
00:00:01,694 --> 00:00:05,605
what does it mean when the magnitude of the image gradient is zero?

3
00:00:05,605 --> 00:00:09,043
The image is constant over the entire neighborhood.

4
00:00:09,043 --> 00:00:13,380
B, the underlying function is at a maximum.

5
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:16,860
C, the underlying function is at a minimum.

6
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:19,040
And D, either A, B, or C.
