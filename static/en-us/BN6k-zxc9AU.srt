00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The answer is, no, it's not possible to include the signature in the hash itself.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
The reason for this is if that was included, we don't know what it is until we've computed this.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
After we compute this, well, if we computed it again with the new result,

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
That would change it every time.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Unless we had a very weak hash function and a very weak encryption function,

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
there is no way to sensibly include the signature in these contents,

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
but the good news is we don't need to.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
The reason we don't need to is this is what we're using to verify the rest of the certificate.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The important part is that it's encrypted using the private key of the issuer.
