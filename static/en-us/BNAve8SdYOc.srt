1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Now for the answer: Well, GUI capture replay tools

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
can capture sensitive information, just as sensitive information

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
may be contained in files.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
If you enter a password, for instance, on a webpage,

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and this is recorded, this can even become a security issue.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Next recorded scripts may not be replayable in different environments.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Yes, we have seen that.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Finally, recorded scripts may be prone to change as the software

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
of the GUI changes, obviously.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
We also have seen that.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
All three apply.
