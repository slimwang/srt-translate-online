1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:03,730
Now that our project is imported,
let's get it fired up.

2
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:06,920
We'll do most of our prototyping
using the desktop back end

3
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:09,870
since it launches the fastest and
doesn't require an external device.

4
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:16,140
So, what we need to do is tell Gradle
that we want to run the desktop version

5
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:18,235
and we can do that with this
console command right here.

6
00:00:18,235 --> 00:00:22,930
If we run ./gradlew desktop:run,
and wait for

7
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:25,020
Gradle to do its thing, there we go.

8
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:26,900
Beautiful Udacity orange.

9
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:29,610
And if we click and drag around, whoa!

10
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:31,650
Super sweet particle effects!

11
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:33,890
All right, so
it's not really a game yet.

12
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:35,240
We'll get there.

13
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:39,410
While you certainly can run all your
games from the command line like this,

14
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:42,140
it's really convenient to be able
to hit the green Run button and

15
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:43,440
have your project run.

16
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,510
You can also use the Ctrl+R keyboard
shortcut, however, to do that,

17
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:49,660
we need to set up a run configuration.

18
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:51,460
Don't worry, it's not too complicated.

19
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:55,480
We simply click on this drop down and
select Edit Configurations.

20
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:57,290
Then we can hit the plus button.

21
00:00:57,290 --> 00:01:00,590
Since we want to run a Gradle task,
we'll click Gradle.

22
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:06,150
We'll give it the name Desktop, and
then the task we want to run is

23
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:09,890
in the desktop project and
the task is called run.

24
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:11,360
If we click OK,

25
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,770
now we see that the current selected
run configuration is Desktop.

26
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:17,510
And if we hit the green arrow,
there we go.

27
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:19,000
Our game runs just as before.

28
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:23,200
So now it's direction
to run the desktop app.

29
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:28,026
To set up the run configuration,
you can go to Run > Edit Configurations,

30
00:01:28,026 --> 00:01:32,545
click +, select Gradle,
name your new run configuration Desktop,

31
00:01:32,545 --> 00:01:36,290
give it the task, desktop:run, click OK.

32
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:39,850
Then you can hit the green arrow in
the toolbar and poke at your screen for

33
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:41,940
a while,
which I guess will make you profit.
