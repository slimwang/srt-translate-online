1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:02,880
So, before we jump into these questions, let's talk

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:05,689
a bit about how to approach these assignments. Most

3
00:00:05,689 --> 00:00:08,910
of these questions won't have a correct answer. Rather

4
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:11,520
than asking you to choose the correct definition of user

5
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:14,210
experience we're actually going to ask you to do some

6
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:17,950
design. We're also going to ask a lot of questions where

7
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:21,430
the only output from you to us is your

8
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:25,440
response to the question, did you do this? Now obviously,

9
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,540
the purpose of a question like this is not to

10
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:31,450
prevent plagiarism. The assumption here is you are in this course,

11
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:34,680
you want to learn how to improve your design skills. And,

12
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:37,680
anyways, if you are actually enrolled in the class, your final

13
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,950
grade of pass or no pass will be based only on

14
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:44,060
your final project. So, the purpose of a question like this

15
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:47,470
is really to help you keep track of the questions you've

16
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:50,930
answered and which ones you haven't. You get that nice little

17
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:54,140
orange bubble filled in somewhere up here in the

18
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:58,540
navigation when you've completed a question. And, another part of

19
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:00,650
the reason why we ask these questions is for

20
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:03,210
us, and for the continued improvement of this class. We

21
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:05,069
want to know if the people taking this class

22
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:08,580
are doing the assignments. We're also going to ask you

23
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:12,000
to submit to the forum quite a bit. And let

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
me actually talk about that a bit more. So working

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,880
on this course with Nasman and Isabel has

26
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:21,390
been awesome. Pretty early into the design of

27
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:24,740
this class, we realized that the design process

28
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:27,960
that. We at Udacity have sort of converged on

29
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:32,070
over the last few years, is essentially identical

30
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:34,640
to the design process that Nasman and Isabelle

31
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,420
advocate for, in the world of software. One

32
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:41,280
example of this, in less than four, you are

33
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,890
going to learn how to take the things that

34
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:46,930
Android can do really well and leverage those opportunities to

35
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:50,850
make amazing experiences for your users. But, more generally what

36
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:54,160
I think's going on here is, you should know as

37
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:57,080
a designer, what you are uniquely positioned to do

38
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:59,650
well. No matter what you're designing. And then you should

39
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:03,570
do that thing well. In these massive classes that we've

40
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:06,290
been making for a while now, we've realized that one

41
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:08,050
thing we are uniquely positioned to do

42
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:12,640
well is leverage this amazing, massive body of

43
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:17,520
enthusiastic, diverse, intelligent students who are all thinking

44
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,590
and doing projects about the same sort of

45
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:23,200
stuff. And that's, that's a really huge

46
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,240
learning opportunity. So when we ask you to

47
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,120
write something down or share something in the

48
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:31,440
forum. That's, that's why. We want you to

49
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,500
not only learn from the writing experience itself, but to

50
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:38,470
share that with other students and read what other students

51
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:41,440
have to say. This, this sort of social learning is

52
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:46,230
a really potentially important part of the online learning experience
