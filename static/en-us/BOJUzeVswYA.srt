1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Now, the next choice we have in agent design

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
revolves around how adventurous he wants to be.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
One possibility is what's called the passive reinforcement learning agent--

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
and that can be any of these agent designs,

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
but what passive means is that the agent

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
has a fixed policy and executes that policy.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
But it learns about the reward function, R,

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
and maybe the transition function, P,

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
if it didn't already know that.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
It learns that while executing the fixed policy.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
So let me give you an example.

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Imagine that you're on a ship in uncharted waters

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
and the captain has a policy for piloting the ship.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
You can't change the captain's policy.

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
He or she is going to execute that, no matter what.

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
But it's your job to learn all you can about the uncharted waters.

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
In other words, learn the reward function,

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
given the actions and the state transitions

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
that the ship is going through.

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
You learn, and remember what you've learned,

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
but that doesn't change the captain's policy--

22
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
and that's passive learning.

23
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Now, the alternative is called

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
active reinforcement learning--

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
and that's where we change the policy as we go.

26
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
So let's say, eventually, you've done such a great job

27
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
of learning about the uncharted water

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
that the captain says to you,

29
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
"Okay--I'm going to hand over control

30
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
and as you learn, I'm going to allow you

31
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
to change the policy for this ship.

32
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
You can make decisions of where we're going to go next."

33
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
And that's good, because you can start to

34
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
cash in early on your learning

35
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
and it's also good because it gives you

36
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
a possibility to explore.

37
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Rather than just say: What's the best action I can do right now?--

38
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
you can say: What's the action that might allow me to learn something--

39
00:01:42,000 --> 99:59:59,999
to allow me to do better in the future?
