00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,180
Now that you have a better handle
on what polymorphism is and

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:06,700
how it helps us as programmers, don't
be surprised when you start noticing

3
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:11,450
examples of polymorphism everywhere,
in your code and in daily life.

4
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:15,100
And, of course, your newfound mastery
of override will serve you well,

5
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:17,530
especially to reduce
redundancy in your code.

6
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:18,635
See you in the next session.
