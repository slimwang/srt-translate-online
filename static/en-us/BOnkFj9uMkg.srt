1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The correct answer is an error was displayed.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Let me try that in my browser.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
So--we have our text, we click submit,

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
and we get this error 405--method not allowed.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Now--remember--this is a status code--

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
we talked about status codes in the previous unit

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
and in this particular case, 405 means method not allowed.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
And if you recall, status codes that start with the number 4

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
are considered errors on our side, or on the browser's side.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
So in this case, our application is saying,

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
the method POST is not allowed for this resource.

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Resource is referring to slash test form.

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Let's take a look at our code.

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
What we changed in our code is we changed

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
our method from the default get to post,

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
but our test handler down here,

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
which handles requests for slash test form

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
is only configured to use get.

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
So, let's change this function to the word post.

20
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
What the Google framework allows us to do is

21
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
have a different function for each type of method request.

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
So until now we've been using get,

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
but now that we're doing a post request,

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
because our form method is post,

25
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
we need to have that function implemented.

26
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Okay--so we change this to post,

27
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
and we go to our browser and we try it again.

28
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Okay--here we are in our browser,

29
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
we type some words.

30
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
And we hit submit--

31
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
ah--it's behaving just like it was before,

32
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
except this time our q parameter isn't in the URL.
