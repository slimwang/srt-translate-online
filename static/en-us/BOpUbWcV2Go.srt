1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,240
The calling mask property tells
the camera which layers of the scene

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:06,260
it should render in the image.

3
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:10,470
A layer is simply a group that we
can place any game object into.

4
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:13,400
To explore this,
let's create a simple cube.

5
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:17,900
Go to GameObject &gt; 3D &gt; Cube.

6
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:20,410
Now take a look at
the top of the inspector.

7
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:22,010
See the Layer drop-down?

8
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:27,800
By default, any game object we create
will be placed in the default layer.

9
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,610
Let's go ahead and
open up the drop-down.

10
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:34,950
As you can see, Unity gives us five
different layers to play around with.

11
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:37,930
In generic cases,
we can use these layer names.

12
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:41,990
But, we can also create our own
layers by clicking add layer.

13
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:45,410
That will open up the tags and
layers panel.

14
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:49,180
Unity reserves the first eight
layers for it's own names and

15
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:50,164
potential future names.

16
00:00:51,605 --> 00:00:55,565
Let's go ahead and create a new
layer for our cube called NinjaCube.

17
00:00:56,895 --> 00:01:00,945
Once you've typed the name of the layer,
find the cube in the hierarchy, and

18
00:01:00,945 --> 00:01:03,490
navigate to the layer drop-down.

19
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:05,180
Select Ninja Cube.

20
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:09,310
Let's bring up the camera and
the inspector again.

21
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:12,490
Now that we know what a layer is we
can better understand what the calling

22
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:13,770
mask does.

23
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:16,870
As mentioned before the calling
mask lets us choose which

24
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:18,980
lairs surrender in our image.

25
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:22,390
By default a camera will
lender every layer.

26
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:25,900
if we click the drop down we
can see all layers listed and

27
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:28,920
can check which ones we
want the camera to lender.

28
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,620
Let's unselect NinjaCube.

29
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:34,880
You can see that our cube is still
in the seen view but if we go

30
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:40,020
over to the game view, you'll realize
that it's going to just like a ninja.

31
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:44,770
We can of course bring it back
by enabling the NinjaCube layer.

32
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:47,120
And boom, it's back.

33
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:51,060
The calling mask is one way to
efficiently render parts of our scene

34
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:52,940
and hide others until the time is right.
