00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,800
>> We know the slope can be calculated by the difference in the y values,

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:10,015
divided by the difference of the x values. The rise divided by the run. I'm

3
00:00:10,015 --> 00:00:15,783
going to label this point x2, y2 and this point x1, y1. So, y2 is 0 and y1 is 2.

4
00:00:15,783 --> 00:00:20,732
Then x2 is 3 and x1 is 0. Notice again that I'm always using parenthesis when I

5
00:00:20,732 --> 00:00:24,627
substitute in numbers. This is so I don't make a mistake with negative signs.

6
00:00:24,627 --> 00:00:28,661
When I carry out the subtraction, I get negative two thirds. Negative two thirds

7
00:00:28,661 --> 00:00:32,219
was the slope. But wouldn't it be easier if we could just read it from the

8
00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:35,925
equation? It's not as easy to read off the slope from an equation written in

9
00:00:35,925 --> 00:00:39,942
standard form, as it was with an equation written in slope-intercept form. But

10
00:00:39,942 --> 00:00:41,408
you can still find the slope.
