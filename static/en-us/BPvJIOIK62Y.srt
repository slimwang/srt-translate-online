00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Here is a car,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
and again we worry about the kinematic state.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
That is, where in the world is this robot irrespective of its current velocity?

4
00:00:11,000 --> 99:59:59,999
What do you now the right answer is for dimensionality?
