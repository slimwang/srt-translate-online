1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,350
Let's discuss the solution
to our TLB performance quiz.

2
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:06,960
We have a one megabyte array that
we are reading one byte at a time.

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,670
One megabyte is 2 to the 20th bytes.

4
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:14,890
Our page is 4 kilobytes,
which is 2 to the 12th.

5
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:18,690
So there are 256 pages in this array.

6
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:21,970
Now what happens is,
once you have the first access,

7
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:24,130
you will have a level one TLB miss.

8
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:28,310
A level two will be missed and
the translation will be generated and

9
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:30,100
placed in both TLB's.

10
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:33,210
Next, when we access the second byte,

11
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:37,860
we have a TLB hit because that byte is
in the same page as the previous one.

12
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:42,330
So after the first miss
we will have hits for

13
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:44,950
the remainder of the four kilobyte page.

14
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:51,725
In the first sweep we will
have 256 L1 TLB misses,

15
00:00:51,725 --> 00:00:57,330
cause that's how many pages we accessed,
and we will have 4095.

16
00:00:57,330 --> 00:01:04,569
This is one less than four kilobytes,
times 256.

17
00:01:04,569 --> 00:01:06,710
They'll be hits at L1.

18
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:13,210
After this first sweep, the Level 1 TLB
contains the entries for the second half

19
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:17,810
of the array, because the array needs
256 pages, we only have 128- entry.

20
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:23,340
The level two TLB, however,
contains the mappings for

21
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:28,190
the entire array because it's still
has enough elements to hold them.

22
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:33,130
So what's going to happen after the
first sweep, is the level one TLB will

23
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:39,460
continue doing this 256 hits and
this many misses each time we sweep,

24
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:42,190
but the level two TLB will
start hitting all the time.

25
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:51,258
So what we have is ten times
two-fifty-six misses here and

26
00:01:51,258 --> 00:01:57,860
ten times 4095 times 256 hits here.

27
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:01,530
Now the question is for
L2 what do we have?

28
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:06,500
We know that we will have 256 misses,
that is because during

29
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:11,180
the first sweep we have no mappings for
any of the 256 pages.

30
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:15,130
After the first sweep We will have
the mapping for all the pages so

31
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:18,170
we will only have hits, but
the question is how many of them?

32
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:22,350
Well know that we only
access the level two TLB

33
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:25,130
if we have a miss in the level one TLB.

34
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:29,510
So the number of hits here will
be this minus this, so for

35
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:35,450
nine sweeps we will be having
these Misses go here and big hits.

36
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:37,400
So this is the answer to this quiz.
