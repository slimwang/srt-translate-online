1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,560
Let me give an example of the limited
dynamic range of current cameras.

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:08,260
Here's is an image I took again,
in my home.

3
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:12,030
Here, basically, a short exposure,
remembering again the concepts of

4
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:15,920
exposure that we looked at from
exposure triangle and stuff when

5
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:20,100
we talk about cameras, and here if you
look at it, you should be able to see,

6
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:23,540
it's a dark scene but outside you
can see a little bit of snow.

7
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:28,080
I took this picture on you know, one
of the rare snowy days in Atlanta but

8
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,930
it's a short exposure, you can't
see any of the details inside but

9
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:34,800
look outside, you can see
a lot of snow and brightness.

10
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,150
Same image or same scene,
different exposure values.

11
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:42,600
Long exposure, of course,
all of the insides are nice and

12
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,818
visible now but
you might think that there's a lot of

13
00:00:46,818 --> 00:00:52,530
overexposure going on at this point and
the details outside are not good.

14
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:55,735
So this is an underexposed image,
this is an overexposed image.

15
00:00:55,735 --> 00:00:59,620
Underexposed because lots of
pixels did not get any detail,

16
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:01,430
lots of black pixels here.

17
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:04,319
Overexposed, a lot of white,
bright pixels.

18
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,590
So you, if you were to build
histograms of these images,

19
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:10,450
you would start seeing a lot more on
the white pixels and for this one,

20
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:12,590
you'd see a lot more black pixels.

21
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:15,260
Again note,
both of them are exactly the same scene.

22
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:16,870
They are not even
a different time of the day.

23
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:20,110
They were taken seconds
after each other and

24
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:23,790
that's the kind of stuff that basically
old cameras give you right now, and

25
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:26,510
that is a limited dynamic range and
now, of course,

26
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:29,620
we're interested in its capturing
the range from here to there.

27
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:31,100
To capture this dynamic range,

28
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:36,330
we basically need 5-10 million values
to store all the brightness around us.

29
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:38,960
Remember the luminosity
stuff that I showed you.

30
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,230
The scale information was significant.

31
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:44,596
Here we want to basically able to
capture all of this in one image.

32
00:01:44,596 --> 00:01:49,090
Problem is, and recall when we started
talking about images, most images

33
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:54,390
capture each of the three different
channels in basic 8 bit images,

34
00:01:54,390 --> 00:02:00,560
values of 0 to 255, sometime basically
just put in values of 0 to 1.0 but

35
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,530
again, there are only
256 values as opposed

36
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:08,020
to a much brighter range that would
cover the range from here to there.

37
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:12,860
Nowhere close to, of course, being able
to capture 5 to 10 million values.

38
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:15,250
Just to showcase this,
let's look at this example again.

39
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,950
Here, if you notice,
I'm showing you the high dynamic range.

40
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:23,389
In the real world, this was a dynamic
range from 10 raised to minus 6 to 10

41
00:02:23,389 --> 00:02:27,028
raised to 6, and
that's what we're trying to look at.

42
00:02:27,028 --> 00:02:31,570
Of course, on a photograph, what we
would most likely do is just showcase

43
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:34,470
this one and
that's what basically is shown here.

44
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:38,390
I'm basically showing all the values
that are much more on the brighter side

45
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:40,130
and focusing it here.

46
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:44,490
The other end of the spectrum is
the long exposure and of course,

47
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:48,090
this is the long exposure, and mention
again a lot more bright values and

48
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:52,830
here what we'll be doing in this dynamic
range is most probably just capture

49
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:56,969
the region here and
pack it into my 0 to 255 values.

50
00:02:56,969 --> 00:02:59,940
Again, a lot of detail would be lost.

51
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:03,280
Here, I'm basically showing you more
of the information on this side of

52
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:03,790
the spectrum.
