1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,021
We just said that the critical numbers of this rational inequality are 4 and 9.

2
00:00:05,021 --> 00:00:09,801
So these two values are going to split the number line into several parts, and

3
00:00:09,801 --> 00:00:14,883
those intervals, and these values are things that we can test to figure out what

4
00:00:14,883 --> 00:00:19,432
values of x satisfy this inequality. So I'd like you to start out by doing

5
00:00:19,432 --> 00:00:24,447
something very similar to what we did for quadratic inequalities. And filling in

6
00:00:24,447 --> 00:00:29,133
this column over here with intervals and values for x, starting the left side of

7
00:00:29,133 --> 00:00:33,407
the number line and working right. As we did before with tables, I don't want

8
00:00:33,407 --> 00:00:37,593
you, in this case, to include critical points in these intervals right here. I

9
00:00:37,593 --> 00:00:41,862
want these to be noninclusive intervals. Oh, and one other note, I'd like you to

10
00:00:41,862 --> 00:00:44,682
write these intervals using inequality notation.
