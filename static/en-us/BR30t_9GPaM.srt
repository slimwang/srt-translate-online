1
00:00:01,117 --> 00:00:04,689
We have chosen a model so
the only thing we have to do is predict

2
00:00:04,689 --> 00:00:07,520
who is going to redeem
a future marketing campaign.

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:11,500
When we put a model into production,
it's referred to as scoring a model.

4
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:14,790
This simply means taking
each individual record and

5
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:20,140
applying the model to them, which gives
their probability to redeem this offer.

6
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:22,610
Now I'm going to have you
take a stab at this first,

7
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:25,990
with our completed model, and
one individual to predict.

8
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:29,100
Then we're going to take the full
data set and score it over in Altrex.
