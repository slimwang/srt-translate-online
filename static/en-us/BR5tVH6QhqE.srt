Our final answer is 24 divided by x. You've really got the hang of simplifying

2
00:00:05,505 --> 00:00:09,415
for finding this one out. To simplify this expression, we want to factor the

3
00:00:09,415 --> 00:00:14,024
numerator and denominator. 24 is the greatest common factor for these two terms,

4
00:00:14,024 --> 00:00:18,504
and x is the greatest common factor for these two terms. When we factor, we can

5
00:00:18,504 --> 00:00:24,029
see that we have a 2x plus 1 in our numerator and denominator. So these cancel

6
00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:31,846
to make 1. So, this crazy original expression turns into 24 divided by x. Pretty

7
00:00:31,846 --> 00:00:32,644
nice.
