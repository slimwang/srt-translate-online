00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,800
So now you've learned
the basics of database design,

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:07,230
building normalized tables to represent
various relationships amongst data.

3
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:09,360
And you spent some time
at the PostgreSQL and

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,650
Python DB API documentation.

5
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:15,110
So you're prepared to refer to
them in your future database work.

6
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:18,070
In the next lesson, you'll bring
together all those skills to

7
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:21,800
build a database backed tool
to solve a particular problem.

8
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,020
Running a game tournament
that's both fair and

9
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:25,610
challenging for all its players.
