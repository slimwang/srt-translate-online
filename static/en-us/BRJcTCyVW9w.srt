Welcome to the mini-unit. It's really about how to learn new things

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:08,058
When you're trying to develop as a programmer as well as trying to understand how to solve

3
00:00:08,058 --> 00:00:12,668
new problems. In CS101, I tried to keep things as simple as possible,

4
00:00:12,668 --> 00:00:16,438
using only a very small subset of Python. The reason for this

5
00:00:16,438 --> 00:00:20,339
was to focus on learning new concepts in Computer Science

6
00:00:20,339 --> 00:00:23,853
rather than learning lots and lots of different Python constructs.

7
00:00:23,853 --> 00:00:28,405
And I think that is the right way to begin as a computer scientist. You should learn

8
00:00:28,405 --> 00:00:31,984
to construct programs using only a few simple things that you understand well,

9
00:00:31,984 --> 00:00:35,856
focusing on the problems to solve, the algorithms to solve them

10
00:00:35,856 --> 00:00:39,919
and understanding how things work, rather than learning lots

11
00:00:39,919 --> 00:00:43,273
of new language constructs. But if you want to become a better programmer,

12
00:00:43,273 --> 00:00:47,070
well then, you need to start learning more of the language. And most of our courses

13
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:50,925
don't focus on that. They focus on concepts important for problem-solving,

14
00:00:50,925 --> 00:00:54,993
understanding what's going on in a computation and analyzing

15
00:00:54,993 --> 00:00:58,894
and reasoning about them. But to become a better programmer, you also need to learn more

16
00:00:58,894 --> 00:01:02,605
of the language. And the main goal of this unit is to help

17
00:01:02,605 --> 00:01:06,401
you learn how to actually learn things on your own. Becoming a better

18
00:01:06,401 --> 00:01:10,438
programmer really depends on two things - it depends on experience:

19
00:01:10,438 --> 00:01:13,922
and you get experience by solving more and more problems; and it depends on

20
00:01:13,922 --> 00:01:18,004
knowledge. And you gain knowledge also by solving problems, but

21
00:01:18,004 --> 00:01:22,392
it's a different kind of thing. Knowledge means learning more language constructs,

22
00:01:22,392 --> 00:01:26,323
learning more algorithms, knowing more different ways of solving problems.

23
00:01:26,323 --> 00:01:30,709
That's different from the experience you get by solving a lot of problems yourself.

24
00:01:30,709 --> 00:01:33,709
And both of those are important for becoming a better programmer.
