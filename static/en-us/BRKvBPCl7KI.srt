00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:04,820
Before moving on, let's quickly recap
a few of the big ideas of this lesson.

2
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:08,812
These ideas all stemmed from the fact
that graph partitioning is indeed

3
00:00:08,812 --> 00:00:09,609
complete.

4
00:00:09,609 --> 00:00:13,780
That means you'll naturally want some
algorithms with good heuristics.

5
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:17,460
Some of the heuristics that we talked
about included multi level partitioning,

6
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:20,810
based on divide and conquer,
exploiting special structure,

7
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:25,350
like plainarity, and the no gain
is pain improvement techniques,

8
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:27,190
like what you saw in the KL algorithm.

9
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:31,920
The last method we talked about
was spectral partitioning.

10
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,669
That exploits the spooky relationship
between graphs, and matrices.

11
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:41,570
Now, you might be confused about at
least one more thing in this lesson.

12
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:46,830
Both KL, and spectral partitioning
are really expensive compared to

13
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:51,840
the original motivation for partitioning
which was a relatively cheap BFS.

14
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,789
So, why would you ever partition for
BFS?

15
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:57,240
To answer that question,

16
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:01,200
you will need to think about how all
of the ideas in the lesson connect.
