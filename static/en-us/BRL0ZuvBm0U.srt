00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:04,774
While this engagement ratio certainly tells us something about your engagement,

2
00:00:04,774 --> 00:00:09,196
there are a few flaws as with any operational definition and method of measuring

3
00:00:09,196 --> 00:00:13,470
a construct, in this case the construct of engagement. For example, what if you

4
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:17,452
logged on and were watching lessons, but then your friend called. And so, you

5
00:00:17,452 --> 00:00:21,635
spent an hour talking to her while the videos continued to play. Or sure, you

6
00:00:21,635 --> 00:00:26,717
can come up with a few flaws in using this as the sole measure in engagement.

7
00:00:26,718 --> 00:00:31,566
So, here's another option. You could self report how engaged you are on a scale

8
00:00:31,566 --> 00:00:36,315
from one to ten. Since engagement doesn't necessarily equal learning, I'll also

9
00:00:36,315 --> 00:00:40,419
ask you how much you feel like you're learning on a scale from one to ten. So,

10
00:00:40,419 --> 00:00:44,907
go ahead and tell me how you'd rank your engagement and learning by clicking the

11
00:00:44,907 --> 00:00:49,124
link below. When you're done, just click Yes. The purpose of this quiz is just

12
00:00:49,124 --> 00:00:53,204
to make sure the video is paused. Giving you enough time to click the link and

13
00:00:53,204 --> 00:00:54,993
rate your engagement and learning.
