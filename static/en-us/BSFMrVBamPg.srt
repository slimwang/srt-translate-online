1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,804
Now let's take this opportunity 
to go ahead and create

2
00:00:02,804 --> 00:00:04,267
our own custom view.

3
00:00:04,267 --> 00:00:06,531
We don't need one in particular 
for Sunshine,

4
00:00:06,531 --> 00:00:08,438
so you can go ahead and choose anything.

5
00:00:08,438 --> 00:00:12,002
Personally, I'm a fan of Compass Control, 
so that's what I've been building.

6
00:00:12,002 --> 00:00:14,112
You'll need to include three Constructors

7
00:00:14,112 --> 00:00:16,817
to support your view being created in code

8
00:00:16,817 --> 00:00:18,767
through a resource or through inflation,

9
00:00:18,767 --> 00:00:22,271
then simply override the onMeasure method
and set your dimensions.

10
00:00:22,271 --> 00:00:24,857
Click here when you're done, 
and, you're ready to get started

11
00:00:24,857 --> 00:00:26,680
drawing the contents of your view.
