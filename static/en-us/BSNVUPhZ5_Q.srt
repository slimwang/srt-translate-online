1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:04,160
We did it, physics and
audio in one lesson.

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:07,190
&gt;&gt; Right, and although it was a lot
of stuff to cover all at once,

3
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:11,640
as usual, to have this first exposure
is really what you need to get started.

4
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:15,587
And from here, you know which
directions you can take it.

5
00:00:15,587 --> 00:00:18,889
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so now's a great opportunity to
practice and play with the scripting in

6
00:00:18,889 --> 00:00:21,890
all of these components we've
already played around with.

7
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:23,056
&gt;&gt; Right, and don't worry,

8
00:00:23,056 --> 00:00:25,700
you're not going to have to do
this exploration all on your own.

9
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:29,320
We have some really great examples that
we prepared, and we'll be going through

10
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:33,160
those with you so that you can be
accelerated into your exploration.

11
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:35,240
&gt;&gt; So
let's dive in to the Udacity scripts.
