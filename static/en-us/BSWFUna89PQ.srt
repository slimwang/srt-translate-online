1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:04,849
Okay, it's time to start another
coding exercise, finally.

2
00:00:04,849 --> 00:00:09,339
Open t2.4-Exercise-ConnectToTheInternet.

3
00:00:09,339 --> 00:00:11,750
After all that Internet lecture and
quiz stuff,

4
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:14,734
you might guess that we'll start by
adding that INTERNET permission.

5
00:00:14,734 --> 00:00:18,160
We go to android manifest.xml and
add the internet permission now.

6
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,013
[BLANK_AUDIO]

7
00:00:22,013 --> 00:00:25,771
Then we just have to change
the makeGitHubSearchQuery method to call

8
00:00:25,771 --> 00:00:30,934
network utils that get response from URL
rather than simply displaying the URL.

9
00:00:30,934 --> 00:00:34,365
Store the response in a string
called GitHubSearchResults.

10
00:00:34,365 --> 00:00:37,495
Watch out though, because you're also
have to cache that io exception.

11
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:41,759
Since we want to see the result
we'll call set text on our search

12
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:42,579
results text view.

13
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,729
So, now it's your turn!

14
00:00:46,729 --> 00:00:48,369
Follow the to-dos.

15
00:00:48,369 --> 00:00:50,573
Add the Internet permission
to the Android manifest.

16
00:00:50,573 --> 00:00:54,769
Call getResponseFromUrl in your
makeGithibSearchQuery method.

17
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:59,980
Set the results in the search results
text view and watch things crash.

18
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:05,820
So, look in the Android monitor logcat,
what error do you see from your

19
00:01:05,819 --> 00:01:07,869
application when it tries
to connect to the internet?
