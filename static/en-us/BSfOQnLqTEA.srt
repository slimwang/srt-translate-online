1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:03,950
What is that we should be doing
to address cyber security?

2
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:09,150
How is the task of securing our system,
it is going to be addressed by us?

3
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:11,920
What are the things that
are available to us?

4
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,835
So one way you can reduce
vulnerability is by

5
00:00:14,835 --> 00:00:19,985
basically following some design
principles that are good for security.

6
00:00:19,985 --> 00:00:23,285
And when they're more secure,
there are fewer vulnerabilities, and

7
00:00:23,285 --> 00:00:25,435
less likely to be compromised.

8
00:00:25,435 --> 00:00:27,452
The complexity is always the enemy.

9
00:00:27,452 --> 00:00:31,502
The well established studies
that show whether it's bugs or

10
00:00:31,502 --> 00:00:34,432
performance related things,
or whatever it is.

11
00:00:34,432 --> 00:00:39,732
Those increase with the complexity or
size of lines of code for example.

12
00:00:39,732 --> 00:00:45,432
So one way to reduce vulnerabilities is,
what we call this economy of mechanism.

13
00:00:45,432 --> 00:00:50,760
Should be a small set of mechanisms that
your system fundamentally relies on.

14
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,220
So avoid complexity.

15
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:54,980
Keep it simple keep it small.

16
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:58,120
Chances are that you are going to
have fewer vulnerabilities then.

17
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:01,500
Now the design principle
is fail safe defaults.

18
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:05,340
Fail safe defaults always
say when somebody may or

19
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:08,850
may not need access to some
sensitive data you deny it.

20
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:11,550
If they really need it at
that point you can allow it.

21
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:13,230
So default should be denied and

22
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:16,860
fail safety fault is that
the thing is protected.

23
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:18,180
Access is controlled.

24
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:21,520
Complete mediation says your
system should never allow

25
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,240
someone to bypass that monitor.

26
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:27,600
The monitor has to mediate before
someone is able to gain access.

27
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,580
To the resource.

28
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:33,230
The idea is that someone who's
there to enforce that accesses

29
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:38,210
are those allowed by policy you have
in place then you can bypass it and

30
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:40,110
that's the complete
mediation requirement.

31
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:44,100
A lot of people don't believe that
you can get security by obscurity.

32
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:47,000
So if someone says well we
are secure because no one knows

33
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,160
how we do something.

34
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,860
Well don't count on that.

35
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:53,520
Perhaps somebody smart can reverse
engineer and learn most of it.

36
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,730
So Open Design is good because
we're not counting on somebody

37
00:01:57,730 --> 00:02:00,680
in not finding out how we do things.

38
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,800
An extremely important design principle
is what's called least privilege.

39
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:07,890
So in systems at any time, essentially
when you're running an application or

40
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:12,810
a program, you have the privilege to
be able to access a set of resources.

41
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:15,330
Least privilege says you should
only have privileges for

42
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:18,410
resources that you absolutely need,
and nothing more.

43
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:20,570
It's a damage containment idea.

44
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:24,500
If something were to go wrong, what you
can harm is the set of resources for

45
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,020
which you hold privileges.

46
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:29,850
We said people are the weak
link when it comes to security.

47
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:33,170
And that is because we perhaps
expect people to do something and

48
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:34,820
that doesn't come naturally to them.

49
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:37,970
Psychological acceptability says don't

50
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:43,330
ask people to do that doesn't
put excessive burden on them.

51
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,100
So there are a number of
these design principles.

52
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:49,770
Actually they come from a classical
paper called design principles for

53
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:50,990
secure systems.

54
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:53,320
You'll have a link to that paper.

55
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:57,020
At least read the design principle
section out of that paper.

56
00:02:57,020 --> 00:03:02,000
And for each of these principles we
should understand how does it enhance or

57
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,530
improve cyber security.
