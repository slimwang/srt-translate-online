00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,280
Now that we have our approach in mind,

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:05,270
as we start to work on the problem,
we need to prepare our data.

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:11,580
This generally involves gathering,
cleansing, formatting, blending, and

4
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:12,400
sampling the data.

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,410
In this lesson, we're going to start
with a data set that doesn't need any

6
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:18,229
work and is ready for analysis.

7
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:23,010
We'll spend an entire course
learning about data preparation,

8
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:24,375
so we'll skip it here.

9
00:00:24,375 --> 00:00:27,467
Now that we have our data ready,
the next step in the problem solving

10
00:00:27,467 --> 00:00:30,640
framework is to perform the analysis and
develop a model.

11
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,250
We mentioned that we're going to
use a Linear Regression model for

12
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:34,260
this problem.

13
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:35,490
But first,

14
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:38,400
let's learn a little about Linear
Regression before we create the model.
