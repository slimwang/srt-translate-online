1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
And a point for a student who did better in high school

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
than in college would be below the line.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
So you can see here,

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
someone in the extreme case,

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
someone with a college GPA of 0,

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
could have any high school GPA

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
and would still be below the line,

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
But as the college GPA gets higher,

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
their high school GPA must be at least equal

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
to the college one to fall into that region.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 99:59:59,999
And so that is the answer, below the line.
