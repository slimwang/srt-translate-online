A famous histogram can be obtained by looking at the age distribution.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
For the USA, the distribution looks about as follows.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Again, going to the statistics is an endless number of actual ages and so on.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Let's make a histogram that is somewhat simplified

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
that only looks at people from age 0 to 40.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Here is the data set from 21, 17, 9, 27, and so on.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I'm asking you for all these four graphs in a histogram how high are the bars

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
for each of those four ranges as shown over here.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Again, the horizontal axis depicts age, and the vertical axis the count.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 99:59:59,999
