1
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:03,620
Remember that components must
have a hyphen in them, so

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:06,939
let's name the component order-tracker.

3
00:00:06,939 --> 00:00:09,240
While we're here,
let's create the service, too, and

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:12,080
let's call it order-manager.

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,010
The order manager service needs
to keep track of the active day.

6
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:18,780
We'll have the active
day default to Monday.

7
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:22,210
The service will also need to manage
the orders that have been placed.

8
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:26,220
I've created a menu selection object
that will hold the orders for each day.

9
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:28,930
So this is the data that
the service will need to manage.

10
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:31,540
Now we need to give it some
way to update this data.

11
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:34,300
The service needs to be able to
change which is the selected day.

12
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:38,490
It also needs to add an item
to the selected days meal.

13
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:41,740
And then it needs to be able to
remove an item from the menu.

14
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:45,050
Remember that we're extending
the service class with an object.

15
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:49,260
So inside a function we can directly
access one of the data properties.

16
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:53,090
Instead we have to use Ember's
this.get to access a property.

17
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:55,050
Or this.set to change it.

18
00:00:56,450 --> 00:01:00,120
Here we have the order tracker
component and its template file.

19
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:03,050
We want the template to be
able to use this data, so

20
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:06,750
we need to make a connection between
the component and the service.

21
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:10,870
We use Ember to get the service and
stored in the order manager object.

22
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:14,800
It's all very readable, we inject
this service into this component and

23
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,870
refer to it by this name.

24
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:19,830
Now in the order tracker template we
want our users to know which day they're

25
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:21,390
picking food for.

26
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:23,950
So we reference
the orderManager object and

27
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:26,160
then the selectedDay
property off of the service.

28
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:30,240
Now let's add this component
to the application template.

29
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,940
And while we're here,

30
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:33,850
let's change the heading to make
it something more exciting.

31
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:38,360
I had to restart the server on the
terminal for the changes to take effect.

32
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,180
So if you don't see
the data from your service,

33
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:41,450
make sure to restart the server.

34
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:44,500
And here's the order tracker
template that's pulling

35
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,250
the data from the service.

36
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:49,360
We also want to display the menu item
that's been ordered for each day, so

37
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,510
let's add that to the template.

38
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:55,050
We need to display entries for
every meal, so I've added breakfast,

39
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:55,760
lunch, and dinner.

40
00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:01,828
We want this information for each day so
we need to loop over the list of days.

41
00:02:01,828 --> 00:02:07,070
Let's use Ember's each in helper to loop
over the days storing the key as day and

42
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:08,680
the days order as menu order.

43
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:12,310
Let's use these variables
to print out the day and

44
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:13,740
the chosen menu item for a meal.

45
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,240
So here we're printing out the day.

46
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,130
And here are the menu items for
breakfast lunch and dinner.

47
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,140
And there we go.

48
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:24,730
We're showing a meal time for each day.

49
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:27,660
Now to add a button to each menu item,
so we can select it for

50
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:28,740
a specific day and meal.
