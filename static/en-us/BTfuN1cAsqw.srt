1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,750
You actually get a little more than
vector that just tell you when

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:04,750
things are alike.

3
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:05,470
And it's really fun.

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:07,890
You have vectors.

5
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:11,050
Imagine that you could
do math with words now.

6
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:12,740
Let's try an experiment.

7
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:19,740
What do you think the results of puppy-
dog + cat should be intuitively?

8
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:25,229
How about taller- tall + short?
