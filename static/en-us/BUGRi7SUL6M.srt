1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,110
Okay, so, it seems very much.

2
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:04,170
This is going to be
broken up into pieces.

3
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:09,180
So, our first distributed
responsibility here is that

4
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:15,210
the height is now changed, and
it gets reported to the viewport.

5
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:17,060
>> Okay.
>> The viewport will look at its

6
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:22,360
current height and make a determination
of whether it's grown, shrank.

7
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:28,740
Essentially, then having to
distribute to the scroll bar,

8
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:32,990
the handle that needs to move, and
also if its proportion needs to change.

9
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:33,740
>> Okay.

10
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:38,626
>> That in turn,
will be distributed down

11
00:00:38,626 --> 00:00:43,670
to the file manager from the scroll bar.

12
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:48,557
It could be that the first distributor
responsibility goes to the scroll bar,

13
00:00:48,557 --> 00:00:51,370
waits on something to come back.

14
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:53,760
So, actually I think that's the case.

15
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,860
>> Okay, so Jared has raised
an interesting point here.

16
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:59,020
We know we're eventually going to
have to go to the file manager

17
00:00:59,020 --> 00:00:59,940
to get some more lines.

18
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:02,020
Is it the scroll bar that
informs the file manager?

19
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,060
Is it the viewport that
informs the file manage?

20
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:06,880
Because both of them are dependent,
right?

21
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:07,600
>> Right.

22
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,640
I think it's the viewport.

23
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,900
Because our last example kind
of did a similar thing when

24
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:13,160
we just moved the handle.

25
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,932
It eventually came back to the viewport.

26
00:01:14,932 --> 00:01:19,270
The viewport reported down to the file
manager, I need these new lines.

27
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:20,310
It seems like it's going to.

28
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:22,090
Let's recap here.

29
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:23,470
We're going to resize the window.

30
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:26,100
The height is going to
come to the viewport.

31
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,170
It going to then report, or

32
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:33,220
send a message to the handle about where
it needs to be and its proportion.

33
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:35,215
That will come back to the viewport, and

34
00:01:35,215 --> 00:01:39,450
the viewport will request from the file
manager any nuance that it needs.

35
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:46,430
>> Okay, and one of the takeaways from
this is that distributed is just that.

36
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:50,350
There's different choices
as to who's going to tell

37
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:53,450
whom else about what's going on, okay?

38
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:58,980
So although each particular event is,

39
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:01,580
each particular segment of
code is probably fairly small,

40
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:04,360
consisting of some method calls,
that are distributed all over the place,

41
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,690
which might make them
hard to understand.
