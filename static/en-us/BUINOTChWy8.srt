1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,826
The answer is that the running
time is order M times K.

2
00:00:03,826 --> 00:00:05,590
There are no tricks about that.

3
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:07,770
These are simple iterated for loops.

4
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:12,060
Now at first this bound might seem
to suggest that subset sum is in P.

5
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:17,330
But no, this number K takes
only log K bits to represent.

6
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:21,120
So this number K is exponential
in the input length.

7
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:23,150
And therefore this is
an exponential algorithm.

8
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:26,770
Because it's exponential nature
comes from something that is

9
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:28,290
a simple parameter to the problem,

10
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:33,160
like K, algorithms of this sort
are sometimes called pseudo polynomial.

11
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:34,220
As we'll see however,

12
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:39,254
subset sum is still in P complete
because we can reduce three.
