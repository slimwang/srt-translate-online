1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:04,268
So hash function used for
computing hash values.

2
00:00:04,268 --> 00:00:07,617
If it's a good one, and
serves the purpose,

3
00:00:07,617 --> 00:00:11,952
then what properties or
characteristics it should have?

4
00:00:11,952 --> 00:00:14,258
Or what requirements it should meet?

5
00:00:14,258 --> 00:00:17,585
Should it be efficient
storage of the hash values?

6
00:00:17,585 --> 00:00:20,227
Unique hash values for
different passwords?

7
00:00:20,227 --> 00:00:23,645
Or should going back in
the reverse directions be hard?

8
00:00:23,645 --> 00:00:24,922
So these are the options.

9
00:00:24,922 --> 00:00:27,160
Chose one or
more that you think make sense.
