00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,030
I want you to think about
the tools that you have now.

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:06,780
You have a cannon learner, and
you have a linear aggression learner.

3
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:09,860
And also,
we've taught you a bit about how to use

4
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:14,620
the linear aggression like tools
to build parameterized models.

5
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:19,410
With these tools, how could you
go about building an ensemble?

6
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:24,040
Consider each of these approaches,
A B C D and E, and

7
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:28,590
put a checkmark next to the one that
you think is the best solution.

8
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:31,940
So some of these are okay, but
I want you to pick the best answer.
