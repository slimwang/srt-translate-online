00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,510
So far, we have been developing a StateChart to describe the behavior of,

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:05,110
of a clock radio.

3
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:08,950
Thus far, we have used seven concurrently executing machines to

4
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:11,200
model the radio's percepts.

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,670
We have left some placeholders for

6
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:14,490
other machines we will need to complete the diagram.

7
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:18,110
We have also left out the transitions for the time being.

8
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:21,320
Let's begin to look at the events that can provide the impetus for

9
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:22,670
these transitions.

10
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:28,490
Recall that an event is a spontaneous or instantaneous occurrence.

11
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:31,590
That is, we're not concerned with its duration.

12
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:34,810
It can communicate information such as if we

13
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:39,660
turned the dial what position are we turning the dial to.

14
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:44,200
But that the state machines can be sensitive to those events taking place and

15
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,030
cause a change of state when they detect them.
