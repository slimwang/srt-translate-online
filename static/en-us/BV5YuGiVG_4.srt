1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The answer is that it'd better be d.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The reason for that is that's what the private key is.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
The private key includes the secret d.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
The public key includes e.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
If we want the private key to be secret and hard for an adversary to guess,

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
it's got to include something that is unpredictable.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
That will be the value of d.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
N, again, is part of the public key, so that doesn't provide any security for the private key.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Notice from this that since e is public, it's okay if e is computed in a predictable way.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 99:59:59,999
In fact, e is often chosen to be a small value.
