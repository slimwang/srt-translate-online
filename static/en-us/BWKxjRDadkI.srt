1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,450
So now we're ready to finish the Web Crawler. And remember

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:05,600
what we want the Web Crawler to do. So, we have

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,420
a seed page, and we're assuming we know some seed page

4
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:11,460
to start with. And the seed page has some links on it.

5
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:14,920
We want to be able to find those links, and we

6
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,330
know how to do that now. We're going to get them to

7
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:20,670
list, and then we're going to follow those links. So we'll follow

8
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:25,390
the links. To new pages, and those new pages might also have

9
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:29,180
links, and we want to follow those links. So

10
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:31,560
in order to do this, we need to think about

11
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,240
two things. We need to keep track of all

12
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:36,950
the pages that we're waiting to crawl, and we'll introduce

13
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:40,090
a variable, tocrawl, to do that. And what tocrawl

14
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:43,840
will be is a list of pages left to crawl.

15
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,580
So, initially it'll just be the seed page. Once

16
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:50,410
we collect the links on the seed page well it

17
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:54,130
will include those links as well. Once we finish crawling a

18
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:56,990
page, we don't want to keep it in tocrawl anymore. And

19
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:59,270
as we find new pages to crawl, they'll be added to

20
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:03,280
the tocrawl list. The other variable we want is to keep track

21
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,660
of all the pages that we've crawled. At the end of

22
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:09,400
our crawl, this is the result. We want to know all the pages

23
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,980
that we found. That will be stored in the variable we'll

24
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:15,480
call crawled. So let's walk through an example of how this should

25
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,280
work on the sample site.

26
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:26,280
So I'll make the seed page, www.udacity.com/cs101x/index.html, that's

27
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,900
this page here. That means when we start

28
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:31,440
to crawl, we want tocrawl to be this

29
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,990
index page. And I'm going to stop writing out the

30
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:37,060
full URLs, just writing out the final part.

31
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:39,050
because all the pages we crawl will be

32
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:42,150
on our test site. So tocrawl will be

33
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:47,030
the list containing just one element. The index.html page.

34
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:49,730
We haven't crawled anything yet, we're just getting started, so

35
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:53,430
crawled will start out as the empty list. The next

36
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:55,040
thing we're going to do is crawl this page, so

37
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,490
we'll get all the links on this page. That means

38
00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:01,510
we've crawled the index page, so that will now be

39
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:04,710
added to crawled. But when we looked at the links

40
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:07,030
on the index page, we found three new links on

41
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:12,030
that page. We found a link here, which goes to crawling.html.

42
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:15,840
We found the link here, which goes to walking.html.

43
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,470
And we found the link here that goes to flying.html.

44
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:23,810
So the new value of tocrawl, after crawling this page,

45
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:27,070
will have those three links in it. The next thing

46
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:29,150
we want to do is take one of those links

47
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:32,520
and crawl it. The order actually matters a lot in

48
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,200
terms of getting a good crawl. Let's assume for now

49
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,970
that we'll do just do the last one first. So,

50
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:39,880
we'll do the link fly. That links to

51
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:42,930
the flying page. Here is the page there. So,

52
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:46,060
we are going to crawl the page flying.html. This

53
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:48,880
page doesn't have any links. If you're not sure

54
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,980
why squeamish ossifrage is the magic words, I

55
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:55,790
would encourage you to DuckDuckGo or Google that. And

56
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:57,890
now we've finished crawling flying, so that's going to

57
00:02:57,890 --> 00:03:02,115
be added to the crawled list, which already had

58
00:03:02,115 --> 00:03:05,260
index.html, we don't lose that. We're going to add the

59
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:07,410
new one, which is flying, to that list. And

60
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,980
we finished crawling it so we don't want to crawl

61
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:14,410
it again. Let's remove it from the tocrawl list. Now,

62
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:17,800
after we're crawled flying, we have two more links

63
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,950
left in our tocrawl list. We have two links

64
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:23,400
that we've crawled. So let's try another link. Let's

65
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:27,280
suppose we follow the crawling.html link. And we follow crawling.

66
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:31,150
We get to this page. So, to follow crawling, we're

67
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:33,620
going to follow the same algorithm we did with flying. Alright, so

68
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:37,940
that removes this link from the tocrawl list, adds it

69
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:42,100
to the crawl list. So, we're done crawling, crawling. And now

70
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,870
we want to add to our tocrawl lists all the

71
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:46,170
links that we find on this page. Well, we found the

72
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:50,400
link, kicking, which goes to the page, kicking.html So we're going to

73
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,260
add that to our list of pages to crawl, and now

74
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:57,640
we keep going. And we're going to keep going.

75
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:00,600
We'll follow kicking. We find that kicking does not

76
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,980
have any links. So that would add kicking

77
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:05,678
to the crawled list and remove it from the

78
00:04:05,678 --> 00:04:08,090
to crawl lists. And we're going to keep going

79
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:10,380
until we have no more pages to crawl. So

80
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:12,750
let me describe that process a little more formally

81
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,190
and then I'll ask you a question about it.
