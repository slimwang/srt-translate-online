00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:05,712
Here, x would equal positive 3. Great thinking if you found this. Now, the

2
00:00:05,712 --> 00:00:09,128
easiest thing to do is to think about writing this with a base of 3, and this

3
00:00:09,128 --> 00:00:15,859
with a base of 5. 27 is the same thing as 3 cubed. And 125 is the same as 5

4
00:00:15,859 --> 00:00:21,710
cubed. Now that we have 3 cubed divided by 5 cubed, I can pull out a cube from

5
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:28,534
the numerator and denominator and just raise 3 5ths to the 3rd power. Remember

6
00:00:28,534 --> 00:00:31,820
that when you raise a fraction to an exponent, you can apply the exponent to

7
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:37,720
each part of the fraction. So this is an equivalent statement, for this. Now

8
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:45,040
notice, we have the same base as 3 5ths, so we set the exponents equal. x

9
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:46,043
equals 3.
