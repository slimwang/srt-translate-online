1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:04,100
We can figure this out by looking at the roots, or the zeros of this function.

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:08,955
We found before that they were 2, 9 plus i and 9 minus i. Now, these breakeven

3
00:00:08,955 --> 00:00:14,700
points are going to be actual points on the graph. And remember, since our

4
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:17,669
graph is only plotting real values of x and real values of y, 9 plus i and 9

5
00:00:17,669 --> 00:00:23,769
minus i, are not actual x values on the graph. That means the only real x

6
00:00:23,769 --> 00:00:29,487
intercept is at x equals 2. So there's only one break even point, and as I just

7
00:00:29,487 --> 00:00:35,590
said the value of x at that point is 2. Now remember, x in this equation, stood

8
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:40,344
for thousands of dollars spent on advertising. So Grant doesn't just need to

9
00:00:40,344 --> 00:00:45,595
spend $2 to break even, he needs to spend $2,000. He'd probably rather spend

10
00:00:45,595 --> 00:00:49,720
two but unfortunately, advertising is pretty expensive.
