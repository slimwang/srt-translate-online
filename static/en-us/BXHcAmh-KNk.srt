00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,420
Let's explore the Bootstrap documentation for the grid system.

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:05,580
These first three lines are really important.

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:09,400
The first one says that all rows must be placed within a container or

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:10,450
a fluid container.

5
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:13,970
This allows them to have the right alignment and padding on the page.

6
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:17,690
We'll also be using rows to create horizontal groups of columns,

7
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:20,100
which means columns that are lined up one next to each other.

8
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:24,950
And this last point says that your content has to be inside of a column and

9
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:27,290
a column has to be inside of a row.

10
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:28,430
Back to our mockup.

11
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:32,490
We've gone ahead and put some boxes around the different elements on the page.

12
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:35,550
We have a container encompassing the entire page.

13
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:40,580
We've got a row right here in the middle that includes Appify and Sunflower.

14
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:43,960
And then Appify itself is just a single column inside this row.

15
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,520
You can see other examples.

16
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,630
For instance, at the top, we have a header.

17
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:48,760
That's going to be a row.

18
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:52,410
And inside of our row, we have two columns, one on the left and

19
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:52,940
one on the right.
