00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:05,310
Okay, so we know that IPv4 addresses
are represented as 32-bit integers.

2
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:10,412
So with 32-bits, the biggest
number that can be represented is

3
00:00:10,412 --> 00:00:16,360
two to the 32nd minus one, which is
slightly smaller than 4.3 billion.

4
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:18,240
And there are 7 billion
people on the planet.

5
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:23,530
So, the correct answer is that there
are more than a billion IPv4 addresses,

6
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:26,560
but fewer than the number
of people on the planet.

7
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,060
That means that everybody wants one.

8
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:32,430
There aren't going to
be enough to go around.

9
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:32,930
Oops.
