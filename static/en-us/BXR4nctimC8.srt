00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:02,840
As a quick quiz, suppose we have a direct trie, and

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:06,380
the first level is 16 bits, the next level is eight

3
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:09,980
bits, and the third level is the final eight bits. In

4
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:13,490
the worst case, how many accesses would be required per lookup?
