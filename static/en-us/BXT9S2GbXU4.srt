00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,350
My understanding of the main difference
between a unicorn investor and

2
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:06,000
sort of a long tail investor is
a unicorn investor is looking for

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,200
other investors to pile on.

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,950
That's where they make their money.

5
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:12,810
So, a first investor in a unicorn
company will say, hey, you know what,

6
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:15,670
I think this could be sold
as a billion dollar company.

7
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:20,540
I'm going to put in enough money to
make the valuation a billion dollars.

8
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:21,931
That sets off a press cycle.

9
00:00:21,931 --> 00:00:24,398
That press cycle is a feeding frenzy for

10
00:00:24,398 --> 00:00:27,029
other investors who
want to also pile on.

11
00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:31,045
And as those other investors pile on,
the first investor is actually reaping

12
00:00:31,045 --> 00:00:34,410
the benefits of these
other additional pile ons.

13
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:38,020
But that whole business model of
investors feeding on investors

14
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:40,880
is dependent on no drop in valuation,

15
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:45,130
which requires continued growth with
the company that's been invested in,

16
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:48,190
either in the technology space,
the people space, the market space,

17
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:52,490
some metric that they consider
important has to keep getting bigger or

18
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:57,030
more valuable, even though it's only
perceived value, the whole business can

19
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:01,230
fall apart if the true value of
the company is never realized.

20
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:04,110
This is where tech bubbles
come from actually.

21
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:07,580
Now in the long tail investor side of
things, those investors are actually

22
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:10,710
interested in legitimately
helping Bootstrap companies and

23
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:12,310
make them successful and

24
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:16,360
sustainable because they see the
sustained long term value of investing

25
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:21,130
in a spread of different businesses
that will be around in 20 or 50 years.

26
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:23,200
It's that continued growth but

27
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,760
slowly without that get rich
quick kind of mentality.

28
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:32,170
Those are the investors actually I
prefer because it actually benefits

29
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:36,860
society and is a good place for
you to put your business trust.
