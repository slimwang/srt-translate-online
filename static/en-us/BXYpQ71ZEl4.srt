00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,910
The computer renders a 3D scene by determining how much light comes from each

2
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:08,548
direction. There are a few elements that go into this calculation. First, we

3
00:00:08,548 --> 00:00:12,536
have to define a world. For example, take this scene. Here, there are many

4
00:00:12,536 --> 00:00:17,154
different objects defined in different ways. Each object is described by some 3D

5
00:00:17,154 --> 00:00:21,324
geometry. It also has some material description that says how light interacts

6
00:00:21,324 --> 00:00:25,655
with it. Objects can also be animated over time. The red cube is obviously

7
00:00:25,655 --> 00:00:29,815
spinning and if you take a closer look at the metallics sitting man on the left

8
00:00:29,815 --> 00:00:33,428
you'll notice he moves. There are also lights in this world which in this case

9
00:00:33,428 --> 00:00:36,702
are not animated. As the view changes, some materials look different as the

10
00:00:36,702 --> 00:00:39,925
light reflects off of them at a different angle while others don't change.

11
00:00:39,926 --> 00:00:44,488
Finally, a camera is also defined for the scene and interactively changes under

12
00:00:44,488 --> 00:00:48,757
the user's control. To sum up, a scene consists of objects, which are typically

13
00:00:48,757 --> 00:00:53,493
described by geometry and material. Along with lights and a camera.
