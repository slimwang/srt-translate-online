1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
In lecture, Dave introduce the Rabin-Miller test for primality.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
For this assignment, I want you to implement this test.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
The Rabin-Miller function your going to write will take in a number

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
that may be composite or prime and target, which defines the desired probability level.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
The default value 128 corresponds to a probability of 1/2^128.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Two useful routines are the module exponentiation function

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
that we've been using throughout this unit and randrange,

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
which is a function of the Python library, that returns a random integer

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
a random integer between start and end.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I haven't provided any tests, but you should be able to find some prime and composite numbers

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
to test with on your own.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
There is some randomness, so there is a small chance the test will return True for a composite number,

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
but if your target is set high enough--and 128 should be pretty high.

14
00:00:47,000 --> 99:59:59,999
It's very unlikely that this will happen.
