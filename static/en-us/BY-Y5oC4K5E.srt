1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The correct answer is Marcie.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
To answer this question, we first want to look at the number of degrees of each node.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
A degree is the number of edges coming in and out.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Tyrone is a node with degree 2.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Marcie a node with degree 3.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Sayo is a node with degree 2.

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Christian is a node with degree 2.

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Javier, our starting node, is a node with degree 3.

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Hubert is a node with degree 2.

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
As we showed in lecture, in order for there to be an Eulerian path

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
every node in the network needs to have even degree,

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
except for the starting and ending nodes, which are odd.

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
In this example, Javier was our starting node and it had degree 3.

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
All the other nodes are even, except for Marcie, which has degree 3,

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
which is odd. Marcie will be our end node.
