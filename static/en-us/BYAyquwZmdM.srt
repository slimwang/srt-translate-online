1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:03,860
I don't remember what this
elephant is here for,

2
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:06,590
but she remembers why we're here.

3
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:09,410
In this lesson, we're going to jump
right into something practical.

4
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:12,550
You've seen a few database
queries in SQL last lesson, but

5
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:15,430
now it's time to start
talking to a live database.

6
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:18,250
Here's how this is going to work,
I'll show you how you can write

7
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:21,640
SQL queries right in your
browser using our zoo database.

8
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:24,920
Then we'll explore some of the different
things that you can do with SQL.

9
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:28,450
Also, if you're allergic to all
these animals, don't worry,

10
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:30,400
the next lesson will be zoo-free.

11
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,560
Databases aren't just for
zoo animals, after all.
