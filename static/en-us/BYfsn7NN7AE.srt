1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:03,262
The first one be five times the square root of x, and the second one be

2
00:00:03,262 --> 00:00:08,520
thirteen times the forth root of five. Nice thinking if you got those two

3
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:11,905
correct. The key to understanding these problems is that we can only add the

4
00:00:11,905 --> 00:00:16,768
radicals if the radicands are the same and if the indexes are the same. Here we

5
00:00:16,768 --> 00:00:21,708
have square roots and both of the roots have a radicand of x. So we have three

6
00:00:21,708 --> 00:00:26,208
square roots of x, and two square roots of x. So all together, we'll have five

7
00:00:26,208 --> 00:00:30,254
square roots of x. We're simply combining like terms just as we would with

8
00:00:30,254 --> 00:00:34,502
polynomials or with fractions. Here we combined the x squareds, and here we

9
00:00:34,502 --> 00:00:38,993
added together sevenths. So in the second example, we're really adding six

10
00:00:38,993 --> 00:00:44,510
fourth roots of 5, and seven four roots of five. So all together, we'll have 13

11
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:50,470
fourth roots of 5. The type of radical doesn't change in each case. We still

12
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:52,903
have the square root of x in the first one and the 4 through the 5 in the

13
00:00:52,903 --> 00:00:54,553
second one.
