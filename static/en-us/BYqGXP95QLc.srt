1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,690
Let's dive in and
start with something fun.

2
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:06,740
Let's teach you the rules of isolation,
the example game we will be using.

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:11,429
Shelly and I will play a game of
isolation on a five by five board.

4
00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:13,209
I'll be O and move first.

5
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:16,379
O gets to place its piece
anywhere on the game board.

6
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:17,150
I'll choose here.

7
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:22,770
Shelly will be X and she can place
her piece anywhere remaining.

8
00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:24,640
Shelly, where do you want to go?

9
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:25,230
>> I'll go here.

10
00:00:26,989 --> 00:00:29,909
>> From now on,
our players move like queens in chess.

11
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:34,630
For example, for my next move,
I can go any square that's horizontal or

12
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:39,770
vertical or diagonal from me except I
can't move through Shelly's piece here.

13
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:42,070
I only have this diagonal move.

14
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:46,310
>> Okay, I get how players move, but
do they attack each other like in chess?

15
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:47,950
What's the objective of the game?

16
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:50,510
>> The objective is to be
the last player to move.

17
00:00:50,509 --> 00:00:53,859
The players cannot go outside
the boundaries of the game board, nor

18
00:00:53,859 --> 00:00:56,539
through a position that is currently,
or was previously occupied.

19
00:00:56,539 --> 00:00:58,839
The first player to get isolated, and

20
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:02,730
by that I mean unable to
move on their turn, loses.

21
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:07,329
For my next move I
think I will move here.

22
00:01:07,329 --> 00:01:08,209
>> Wait a second.

23
00:01:08,209 --> 00:01:11,309
Why aren't the squares between the start
and the end position filled in?

24
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:12,980
>> You mean these squares here?

25
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:14,850
You're thinking about the game snake.

26
00:01:14,849 --> 00:01:18,119
In isolation it's just where you
land that becomes unobtainable for

27
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,280
future moves.

28
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,400
>> Okay, in that case I'll move here.

29
00:01:22,469 --> 00:01:25,579
>> Great, now we have a game going.

30
00:01:25,579 --> 00:01:27,090
So let's see here.

31
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:31,750
I want to go here and
limit your moves for the future.

32
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:34,734
>> Okay.
Okay, so I'll go here.

33
00:01:34,734 --> 00:01:35,754
>> Cool.

34
00:01:35,754 --> 00:01:40,974
I think that what I'll do is try
to force an end to the game.

35
00:01:40,974 --> 00:01:45,344
I'm going to do this and
start dividing up the board.

36
00:01:45,344 --> 00:01:49,155
>> Okay, so there's more spots filled
up on the right side of the board, so

37
00:01:49,155 --> 00:01:52,480
I think I'll go towards the left so
I have more space to move in.

38
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,350
Okay, that was a wise move.

39
00:01:54,349 --> 00:01:58,309
Let me actually go here and
see if I can trap you in.

40
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:59,980
>> Okay.
So I'm going to keep going left and

41
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:03,939
see if I can escape,
maybe get back onto the right side.

42
00:02:03,939 --> 00:02:06,590
>> Okay,
I want to prevent you from getting out.

43
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:10,340
So I think I can do that, I think
I can actually win at this point.

44
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:14,039
So I'm going to go here and
stop your diagonal move out.

45
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:15,527
>> Hm, looks like I'm stuck.

46
00:02:15,527 --> 00:02:19,629
[LAUGH] I guess I have
to try to get out.

47
00:02:19,629 --> 00:02:25,039
>> Yep, we're getting to end game
pretty quickly here because of that

48
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:27,409
immediate move where I
could partition the board.

49
00:02:27,409 --> 00:02:33,729
So I'll go up here, and now you're stuck
and now since you have no move, I win.

50
00:02:33,729 --> 00:02:34,780
Yay!

51
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:35,460
Okay.

52
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:40,070
So what we've shown here is the rules
of isolation and the game board.

53
00:02:40,069 --> 00:02:45,259
We've also shown some tricks that show
about the difficulty of the game and

54
00:02:45,259 --> 00:02:48,870
how you can early on create a partition
that divides the boards up into

55
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:52,140
one side the other and how you
often fight for the correct side.

56
00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:54,929
Strategy for
isolation is really quite complex.

57
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:57,460
You'll find out pretty quickly when
you actually try do your homework.
