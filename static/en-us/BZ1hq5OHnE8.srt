00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,830
We will now look at three App Engine success

2
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:06,210
stories that are representative, because they use the strengths

3
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:09,250
of App Engine. The first one is a real-time

4
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:13,310
earthquake monitoring system in japan. So in this picture, lots

5
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:15,680
of data is collected by NIED, which is an

6
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:18,810
institute in Japan. They look at the data and then

7
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:23,040
send image files to App Engine, every second. Clients

8
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:26,320
can then view these images files to see the activity.

9
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,830
Well, as you can imagine, when there is no earthquake

10
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:32,030
activity, there are not many clients that are interested in

11
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:35,210
watching this system. But on the other hand, when there

12
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:38,610
is earthquake activity, the system needs to serve a lot of

13
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:41,690
data to many clients. And this is, of course, a

14
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:44,440
great application for App Engine. Which can scale the number

15
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:47,820
of instances up and down, depending on the activity and

16
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:51,530
the number of clients accessing the system. Another great success story

17
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:54,140
of App Engine is Song Pop, an app you

18
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:56,330
may have used, which is a game where you guess

19
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:59,300
the song or an artist. Well, Song Pop grew

20
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:03,690
from zero to 10,000 queries per second in six months.

21
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:07,040
And as of early 2013, it had more than

22
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,970
60 million users. Song Pop uses app engine, again, because

23
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:13,930
of its ability to rapidly scale up and down based

24
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:16,880
on the user load. And one that you've certainly heard

25
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,910
about is Rovio, the creator of Angry Birds. When Rovio developed a web

26
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:22,800
based version of Angry Birds, they used

27
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,460
App Engine because of its automatic scaling.

28
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:29,470
But also for many of the other functions it provides. And these things

29
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:33,270
are exactly what you will learn when you take this course. So stay tuned.
