1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:01,075
All right.
Well that was painful.

2
00:00:01,075 --> 00:00:06,100
[LAUGH] That's the mathematics
behind sort of the general

3
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:10,150
way of thinking about prediction and
correction cycle of tracking.

4
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:14,240
Fortunately it gets a lot easier
when we look at specific cases.

5
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,760
Spec, specific models of how to do that.

6
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:20,533
What we're going to do in the next
one is look at a very very simple

7
00:00:20,533 --> 00:00:24,207
analytic form of doing this
called the Kalmen filter.

8
00:00:24,207 --> 00:00:27,891
We won't, we'll show you the equations,
we'll you the update, we'll show you

9
00:00:27,891 --> 00:00:31,165
the intuition behind it, without
necessarily deriving the equations.

10
00:00:31,165 --> 00:00:35,822
Then what we're going to do is show you
sort of a more modern approach using

11
00:00:35,822 --> 00:00:39,706
it's referred to as particle
filtering in computer vision, but

12
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:43,828
basically it's this idea of using
samples to represent densities.

13
00:00:43,828 --> 00:00:47,190
And when we do computing,
envision, robotics, et cetera.

14
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:50,920
The idea of using samples to represent
densities gives us a lot of power

15
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:55,760
because we're not limited to particular,
analytic, distributions.

16
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,040
So that will make those integrals,
either easier or

17
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,130
even better just simply go away.

18
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:02,560
So, let's do that next.
