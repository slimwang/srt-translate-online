00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,640
Like a good performance-aware developer,

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:07,220
I am starting in the timeline panel
with the Paint Profiler checked.

3
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:10,669
I will hit record and
then scroll down and up the page a bit.

4
00:00:10,669 --> 00:00:12,268
Now, that I've got my timeline,

5
00:00:12,268 --> 00:00:15,150
I will click on one of the frames
to get some more information.

6
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:16,300
Aha!

7
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:19,435
This little picture here is pretty
telling about what's going on.

8
00:00:19,435 --> 00:00:21,790
Notice that I've got
this Paints checked,

9
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:24,906
which means I'm seeing what
is being painted on the page.

10
00:00:24,906 --> 00:00:28,000
Here at this random frame in
the middle of the scroll,

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,010
the background is being painted.

12
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:32,670
And it looks like it's the only
thing that's being painted.

13
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:37,510
It looks like all the blobs that I saw
before are not, in fact, being painted.

14
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:39,440
The blobs are clearly
on their own layers,

15
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:43,140
because they're not being painted on
this page, only the background is.

16
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:46,230
I've gone back to the Elements pane to
see if I can find it, and lo and behold,

17
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:49,470
the style has WebKit
transform translate.

18
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:52,250
Now, this is a 2D
translate which doesn't

19
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:54,690
automatically create a new layer.

20
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:59,510
So, I've added will change transform
to the element of ID background.

21
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:01,540
Now, let me see what this looks like.

22
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:04,500
Now, back on the page, you can see that
the only thing lighting up in green

23
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,800
when you scroll is the scroll bar.

24
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,950
And there's really nothing
you can do about that.

25
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:11,160
The rest of the page though,
however, looks awesome.

26
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,590
The performance is better and

27
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:15,480
there's definitely not
paint happening everywhere.

28
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:19,360
So, this means the correct answer is
the element with the ID of background.
