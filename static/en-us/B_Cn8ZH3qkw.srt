00:00:03,623 --> 00:00:07,777
expressions together and remember to check to see if you can simplify your

00:00:07,777 --> 00:00:11,933
numerator and your denominator in the end. Make sure your numerator is

4
00:00:11,933 --> 00:00:16,551
multiplied out in the end, and make sure the denominator is in factored form.

00:00:16,552 --> 00:00:18,157
Have fun and good luck.
