00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The answer is it's relying on the third property

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,000
that decrypting with the private key is the inverse of encrypting with the public key.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
The second property turns out to be one that's also very useful

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
It's not necessary for this use of asymmetric cryptosystems,

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
but it is necessary for other uses.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Many asymmetric cryptosystems, including RSA

7
00:00:23,000 --> 99:59:59,999
also provide this property.
