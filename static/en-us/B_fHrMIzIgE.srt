00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:05,030
Let me walk you through this calculation because if you're like me log base two

2
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:07,360
numbers aren't something that you can do in your head and

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:09,622
it can be kind of hard to find a calculator that can handle them.

4
00:00:09,622 --> 00:00:12,640
I'm gonna let Python do the heavy lifting for me.

5
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:16,510
So I go into Python and I import the math module.

6
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:22,058
So I want negative PI times log base two of PI.

7
00:00:22,058 --> 00:00:31,658
So I do negative pslow is 0.5 times log 0.5.

8
00:00:31,658 --> 00:00:35,414
If I put the second argument here, the two that tells you the base of

9
00:00:35,414 --> 00:00:38,741
the log to use, so since I need log base two, I put a two there.

10
00:00:38,741 --> 00:00:42,690
If I wanted log base 10, I would put a 10 there, and so on.

11
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:44,800
And then I need to add in a second term, so

12
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:49,270
this takes care of pslow, I also have a contribution from pfast.

13
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:52,120
Remember, I need to sum over all the classes that are available.

14
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:57,080
So, pslow and pfast happen to be the same.

15
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:00,160
So this is pretty easy, just type it again.

16
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,317
And the entropy, as it turns out, is 1.0.

17
00:01:02,317 --> 00:01:05,810
So this is the maximally impure state, right.

18
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:08,780
We have two class labels that are available to us.

19
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:10,510
And I get an entropy of 1.0.

20
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:14,270
So remember, the largest that we could get, the largest value for

21
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:16,350
the entropy that we could get was 1.0.

22
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:21,070
This means that, this is the maximally impure sample that we could have.

23
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:25,110
If we have two class labels, the most impure situation we could

24
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:30,090
have is where the examples are evenly split between the two class labels, so

25
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:33,990
the entropy of the starting node is 1.0
