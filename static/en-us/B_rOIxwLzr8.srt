1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:06,360
So let's expand the node at Pitesti,
we have to go down this direction,

2
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:11,530
up, then we reach a path we've seen
before then we go in this direction and

3
00:00:11,529 --> 00:00:16,524
now we reach Bucharest which is
a goal and the H value is going to be

4
00:00:16,524 --> 00:00:21,059
0 because we're at the goal and
the G value works out to 418.

5
00:00:21,059 --> 00:00:28,409
Now again, we don't stop here just
because we put a path onto the frontier.

6
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:32,070
Rather we put it there,
we don't apply the goal test next.

7
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:33,799
Now we go back to the frontier and

8
00:00:33,799 --> 00:00:38,119
it turns out that this 418 is
the lowest cost path on the frontier.

9
00:00:38,119 --> 00:00:42,519
So now we pull it off, do the goal test,
and now we found our path

10
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:48,070
to the goal and it is in fact
the shortest possible path.

11
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:50,829
In this case A* was able to
find the lowest cost path.

12
00:00:50,829 --> 00:00:53,969
Now the question,
which you'll have to think about because

13
00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:58,089
we haven't explained it yet,
is whether A* will always do this.

14
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:04,188
Answer yes If you think A* will always
find the shortest cost path, or

15
00:01:04,188 --> 00:01:05,480
answer no if you think it depends
on the particular problem given,

16
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:08,450
or answer no if you think it
depends on the particular

17
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,210
heuristic estimate function h.
