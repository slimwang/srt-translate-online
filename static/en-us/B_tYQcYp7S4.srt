00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:07,297
The equation for our circle is x squared plus y squared equals 2500. Now that's

2
00:00:07,297 --> 00:00:12,560
amazing if you got this equation right. This one wasn't easy. Now, we know this

3
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:18,002
horizontal distance is x units. That's the distance between these two points,

4
00:00:18,002 --> 00:00:23,398
at least just the horizontal distance. And we know that this vertical distance

5
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:29,438
is a distance of y units. We started at 0 and we went down y. So, notice that

6
00:00:29,438 --> 00:00:35,410
we've created a right triangle. So we can relate these distances with this side

7
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:41,641
length. The string is 50 centimeters in length, so we know that x squared plus

8
00:00:41,641 --> 00:00:48,646
y squared equals 50 squared, or 2500. So, no matter where the position of the

9
00:00:48,646 --> 00:00:54,143
string is, this distance relationship will always be true. X squared plus y

10
00:00:54,143 --> 00:00:59,738
squared will always equal 2,500. And it turns out that this distance from the

11
00:00:59,738 --> 00:01:05,692
center to any point on the circle is called the radius. In this case 50

12
00:01:05,692 --> 00:01:06,840
centimeters.
