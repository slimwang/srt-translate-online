00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,134
When you look at the code of the tester, there's something that's a little bit

2
00:00:03,134 --> 00:00:09,490
subtle. The largest method takes an array of measurable. Over here it returns a

3
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:15,294
measurable, and I'm printing it here by adding it to the print statement. That

4
00:00:15,294 --> 00:00:20,430
only works because the Car class has a two-string method. That can convert a

5
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:24,386
Car to a string. And it's a bit of a trick, the same thing won't work, for,

6
00:00:24,386 --> 00:00:30,628
computing the largest Country in a set of countries. Let's try that. Here, I'm

7
00:00:30,628 --> 00:00:35,946
computing, the largest Country of a set of countries. And now, let's run the

8
00:00:35,946 --> 00:00:42,556
program. and it prints the largest Country as some gibberish that's just what a

9
00:00:42,556 --> 00:00:47,125
string does by default on an object. And really what we want is we want the

10
00:00:47,125 --> 00:00:51,473
result of this call as a Country. We know it has to be a Country its one of the

11
00:00:51,473 --> 00:00:55,064
countries that came in so we want this to be a Country and not a measurable and

12
00:00:55,064 --> 00:01:01,492
here we want to be able to call The getName method on it. Now when you compile

13
00:01:01,492 --> 00:01:06,118
this, of course it doesn't work. We are told the types are incompatible. As a

14
00:01:06,118 --> 00:01:10,060
simple fix, go ahead and make that fit, and get this program to run.
