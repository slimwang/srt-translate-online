00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:04,172
Let's go through a few examples. A teacher with a jazz appreciation class says

2
00:00:04,172 --> 00:00:08,665
that his students really like the jazz music that he's playing. And he

3
00:00:08,665 --> 00:00:13,310
concludes that the class is causing the students to enjoy jazz music. Another

4
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:18,652
situation, researches note that drug use is correlated with delinquency. They

5
00:00:18,652 --> 00:00:22,558
conclude drug use causes delinquency and if we reduce drug use, we can also

6
00:00:22,558 --> 00:00:28,120
decrease delinquency. What's wrong with the logic in each of these situations.

7
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:32,628
In the case of the jazz music, perhaps students really liked jazz before and

8
00:00:32,628 --> 00:00:37,994
that's why they took the Jazz Appreciation class. Rather than the jazz

9
00:00:37,994 --> 00:00:42,468
appreciation class causing them to like jazz. For the second situation, it's

10
00:00:42,468 --> 00:00:48,480
possible that people were delinquent and that's why they started using drugs.

11
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:54,158
In both of these situations, there's ambiguous temporal precedence. We don't

12
00:00:54,158 --> 00:00:58,382
know which variable occurred first, if it was the class or the appreciation for

13
00:00:58,382 --> 00:01:04,016
jazz or if there was drug use and then delinquency. Those are just two examples

14
00:01:04,016 --> 00:01:08,710
where we can't infer causality. Here's another one and one that's near and dear

15
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:13,528
to my heart as an educator. We found a correlation between SAT scores and

16
00:01:13,528 --> 00:01:18,689
students grades in college. Can we include them that increasing students SAT

17
00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:24,615
scores will also increase their grades in college? Or what about this one, some

18
00:01:24,615 --> 00:01:28,190
people who commit violent acts played violent video games before committing

19
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:33,943
these acts. Therefore these video games caused violence. What are the flaws in

20
00:01:33,943 --> 00:01:38,684
the logic here, for these two situations? This situation is called a third

21
00:01:38,684 --> 00:01:43,702
variable problem. It's not necessarily true that high SAT scores resulted in

22
00:01:43,702 --> 00:01:50,146
high grades in college. It could be that motivation, effort, intelligence

23
00:01:50,146 --> 00:01:56,160
etcetera was a third variable that influenced both SAT scores And college

24
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:03,320
grades. And this situation's called a post hoc fallacy. Just because a person

25
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:07,220
played violent video games before committing a violent act this doesn't mean

26
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:12,446
that the violent video games caused the violent acts. It could be that people

27
00:02:12,446 --> 00:02:17,600
who want to commit violent crimes also want to play violent video games. There

28
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:21,234
is actually a lot of research on this that I'm unaware of. But certainly a

29
00:02:21,234 --> 00:02:25,740
simple correlation wouldn't be enough to determine this. Here is the punch

30
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:33,383
line. Get it. Just remember, correlation is super-useful but it does not imply

31
00:02:33,383 --> 00:02:35,651
causation.
