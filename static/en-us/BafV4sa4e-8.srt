00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,803
This problem seems really simple. But this
division sign is what's really interesting

2
00:00:04,814 --> 00:00:09,351
about the problem. Dividing by a number is
actually the same as multiplying by the

3
00:00:09,363 --> 00:00:13,289
reciporical. The reciporical of the number
is 1 divided by that number. So, for

4
00:00:13,301 --> 00:00:17,826
example, the reciporical of 3 would be 1
3rd. The reciporical of a fraction, a over

5
00:00:17,838 --> 00:00:23,286
b. Is b over a. This was actually true for
the number 3. We can rewrite 3 as 3

6
00:00:23,298 --> 00:00:29,173
divided by 1, since that's still 3. And
notice the reciprocal of 3 divided by 1 is

7
00:00:29,185 --> 00:00:34,764
1 divided by 3 or 1 3rd So the reciprocal
of negative 5 4ths would be negative 4

8
00:00:34,505 --> 00:00:40,199
5ths And the reciprocal of 1 7th would be
7 over 1 or just positive 7. Now what we

9
00:00:40,211 --> 00:00:45,488
know that a reciprocal is let's go back to
this division. We said dividing by a

10
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:50,397
number is the same as multiplying by its
reciprocal. So I can change 4 divided 2

11
00:00:50,409 --> 00:00:54,570
into 4 times 1 half. So if I do 1 half
times 4, I know I should get 2. Whether we

12
00:00:54,582 --> 00:00:59,707
know it or not we actually multiply by
fractions right here 4 is the same as 4

13
00:00:59,719 --> 00:01:03,045
divided by 1 and I got a result of two.
We're going to look more closely at this

14
00:01:03,057 --> 00:01:04,595
throughout the rest of the lesson.
