00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:04,705
The answer is, Simulation is coupled with Manager and Manager is coupled with

2
00:00:04,705 --> 00:00:10,813
Portfolio. You can see this because Simulation points at Manager in the diagram

3
00:00:10,813 --> 00:00:17,128
and Manager points at Portfolio. But Portfolio doesn't point at Simulation, or

4
00:00:17,128 --> 00:00:23,980
back at the Manager. Similarly Assignment doesn't have an arrow to Portfolio.

5
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:28,461
So Assignment isn't coupled with Portfolio. And remember in the code, this

6
00:00:28,461 --> 00:00:35,460
dotted arrow means that Simulation uses Manager. So somewhere in Simulation, a

7
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:38,550
Manager object or a Manager method is used.
