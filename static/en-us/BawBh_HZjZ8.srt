1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:04,300
So, first step in trying to do any kind of panorama building is to

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:05,040
take pictures.

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,881
In the previous example I showed you,

4
00:00:06,881 --> 00:00:09,150
that basically, the pictures were taken from left to right.

5
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:10,680
Of course, they could be right to left also.

6
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:12,100
So what it basically means,

7
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:14,190
is that I take these pictures by rotating the camera.

8
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:21,370
Of course, it's usually much better to actually rotate this

9
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:23,810
camera about the center axis.

10
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:25,570
This is just for demonstration purposes.

11
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:26,170
Let's look at it again.

12
00:00:30,628 --> 00:00:31,231
One more time.

13
00:00:36,107 --> 00:00:38,485
So basically an images are captured this way, and

14
00:00:38,485 --> 00:00:41,720
of course want to be able to, do things like, identify the matches.

15
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:44,400
So if you noticed this image is offset quite a bit.

16
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,250
We want to align them all together.

17
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:47,230
All of the things here.

18
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:49,770
And then of course what we want to do is.

19
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:51,990
Merge and blend these images together.

20
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:53,990
We want to do of courses, align these images.

21
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:56,670
We noticed the structure here is offset.

22
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:58,878
Also these structures seem to have offsets.

23
00:00:58,878 --> 00:01:02,780
You want to align these images together, and then blend and merge them.

24
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:04,269
Many different ways could be done.

25
00:01:04,269 --> 00:01:07,080
This was of course me showcasing this by a handheld camera.

26
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,160
Which is how I actually took this image.

27
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:12,670
But these days you can use robotic cameras like this GigaPan camera,

28
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:14,390
which is on a robotic mount.

29
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:18,160
And it basically takes a picture, and moves in a controlled manner.

30
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,950
Takes a picture and moves in a controlled manner.

31
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:23,000
So this in essence shows how you can control the camera movement.

32
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,660
As part of the photography pipeline.

33
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:27,270
Or the computation photograph pipeline.
