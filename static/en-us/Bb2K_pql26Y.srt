1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:07,290
So 413 is some kind of numeric value,
in Python or C we'd say it's int.

2
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:09,910
In SQL, we'd use the whole word integer.

3
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:13,460
Georgia here is a string,
or a piece of text,

4
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:17,180
we don't know which Georgia it means,
but it's definitely a string.

5
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:22,320
15 comma negative 5 down here,
that could be a pair of two numbers, or

6
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,790
we could call it a geometric point,
or 2D coordinates.

7
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:31,170
Ursus arctos over here is a text string,
that's the genus and

8
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:33,090
species of brown bears, by the way.

9
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:39,650
And 127.0.0.1 is an ip address,
in some systems that

10
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:43,970
might the same type as a number, but
it can be treated very differently too.

11
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:48,150
So Georgia and
ursus arctos are both strings.

12
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:49,750
They don't have the same
sort of meaning, but

13
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:51,040
they definitely have the same type.
