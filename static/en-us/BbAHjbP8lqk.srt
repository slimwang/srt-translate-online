00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,375
What I notice when I first look at this problem, is that both sides of the

2
00:00:03,387 --> 00:00:07,000
equation are divisible by 4. Now obviously, we divide the right side by 4, it's

3
00:00:07,012 --> 00:00:10,550
going to make things easier, since it's just getting rid of this coefficient.

4
00:00:10,637 --> 00:00:12,900
But this is also convenient to do on the left side.
