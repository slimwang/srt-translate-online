1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,340
Based on the correlation coefficient in this plot, we

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:06,140
just observed that the relationship between age and friend

3
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:09,830
count is not linear. It isn't monotonic, either increasing

4
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:13,430
or decreasing. Furthermore, based on the plot, we know

5
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:15,610
that we maybe don't want to include the older ages

6
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:18,670
in our correlation number. Since older ages are likely

7
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:22,820
to be incorrect. Let's re-calculate the same correlation coefficient

8
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:26,220
that we had earlier with users who are ostensibly

9
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:29,290
age 70 or less. What Cmd would you use to subset our data

10
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:32,820
frame so that way we can get a correlation coefficient for just this data?
