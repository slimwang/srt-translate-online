00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:05,568
To write this in exponential form we'll have a base of 2, raised to the x power

2
00:00:05,568 --> 00:00:12,006
equal to 64. In order to solve for x, we need to rewrite 64 with a base of 2.

3
00:00:12,006 --> 00:00:19,308
64 equals 2 to the 6th, so we have 2 to the x equals 2 to the 6th. Since the

4
00:00:19,308 --> 00:00:24,163
bases are equal, we know the exponents must be equal as well. So x equals

5
00:00:24,163 --> 00:00:26,663
positive 6.
