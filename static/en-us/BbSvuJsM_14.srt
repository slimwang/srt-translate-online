1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:04,100
Now that we have an idea
of what a database is,

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:07,960
in particular, a relational database
that we been looking at, well,

3
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:12,420
now we want to go back to what
is relevant to securing it.

4
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:14,480
What are the things that
we have talked about?

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:18,250
Remember, we are going to have users
who want to access the database,

6
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:22,040
we would have to do authentication so
we know who the request is coming from.

7
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:25,310
And once you do authentication,
then comes access control.

8
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:29,970
So, let's talk about how access
control is done in databases.

9
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:35,565
So actually, the two basic commands and
different variations of SQL.

10
00:00:35,565 --> 00:00:39,795
Details may differ but we are basically
talking about the key concepts.

11
00:00:39,795 --> 00:00:41,595
So you can grant or revoke.

12
00:00:41,595 --> 00:00:45,600
So this is sort of an example
of how access could be granted.

13
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,420
So, this says grant
either set of privileges.

14
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:52,060
So, for example, selecting some tables.

15
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:55,210
So, privilege may be to do a select,
for example.

16
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:58,560
So you can grant
a privilege on a table or

17
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:01,520
you can grant a role to a certain user.

18
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,140
That could be in the context
of a given table.

19
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:07,080
That's the resource we're talking about.

20
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,440
This is what you can
do with the resource.

21
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:13,250
This access has been
granted to a certain user,

22
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:14,810
it could be granted to a role.

23
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:16,960
We talked about role
based access control, so

24
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,340
if you have that it could
be granted the role.

25
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:21,350
Public is granted to everyone.

26
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:25,310
So this is the world,
every user that we have in the system.

27
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:30,820
So some of these things are optional,
for example what's in this parenthesis

28
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:35,760
here, so if you don't specify a table,
that's basically saying on all tables.

29
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:39,470
Okay, so you can either
specify a particular table or

30
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:42,410
if you don't then this
is optional part here.

31
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:45,350
If it's omitted,
then that would mean all the tables.

32
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:50,290
Similarly there's an optional thing here
that says identified by password, so

33
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:54,970
that means if you ever revoke
this access that's being

34
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:56,650
granted as a result of this.

35
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:58,650
You will need the password to do that.

36
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:03,050
So somebody else can't revoke it
if they don't have the password.

37
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:07,210
And another thing that you can do
here which is also optional is,

38
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:10,030
that whoever you
granting this access to.

39
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:14,840
The user or to the role,
they can actually further propagate, so

40
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:18,080
that's the GRANT option,
saying, well, I give you access,

41
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,850
you can give this access to somebody
else, if this is specified.

42
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:24,630
If you have the access
with the GRANT option.

43
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:26,979
So an example of this would be for

44
00:02:26,979 --> 00:02:32,460
example a statement that says you grant
the select privilege on any table,

45
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:36,375
so we are omitting this
choosing a particular table,

46
00:02:36,375 --> 00:02:40,828
because this is optional, to,
the user part here is Alice.

47
00:02:40,828 --> 00:02:44,656
Remember we didn't include
the grant option here,

48
00:02:44,656 --> 00:02:48,571
that means Alice will not be
able to further propagate

49
00:02:48,571 --> 00:02:53,105
this select access that she has
on any table to somebody else.

50
00:02:53,105 --> 00:02:55,947
We're going to talk about securing data,
of course,

51
00:02:55,947 --> 00:02:58,810
you have to worry about access control.

52
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:00,055
So access control,

53
00:03:00,055 --> 00:03:05,230
to make good things happen, of course
authorized users need to have access.

54
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:08,430
So this is how you can
grant access to them.

55
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:11,340
We talked about both
a mandatory access control and

56
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:12,800
discretionary access control.

57
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,890
If your company controls centrally who
should have access to what kind of

58
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:20,190
things they should be able to do with
various databases and tables and

59
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:24,030
the databases they have, then of course
it'll be centrally managed access.

60
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:26,840
So that would be
mandatory access control.

61
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,590
Discretionary means if
you created a table,

62
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:33,050
then of course you are the owner and
you can decide who else can access it.

63
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:35,420
But this is how access is granted.

64
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:37,920
So we saw the example of a privilege,
but

65
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:42,630
privileges can also be operations
such as you can insert, update,

66
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:46,080
delete tables and insert new tables and
things like that.

67
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,960
All the different things we
said we can do under the basis.

68
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:53,670
These are operations you can perform and
basically access control says

69
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:57,500
a certain user role is allowed to
perform that operation or not.

70
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:03,270
So the other side is, the side of grant
is of course you may want to revoke.

71
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:06,360
So revoking is again privilege
we were talking about.

72
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:11,220
The example we had was select, but
it could be one of the other ones or

73
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:15,770
you being able to take on a certain
role optionally on a table.

74
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:20,260
And you take it from a user or
a role or from everybody.

75
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:24,600
Granting is giving someone access,
revoking is taking that access back, and

76
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:29,850
an example would be, revoke
the select privilege on any table,

77
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:33,400
so we omit this from user Alice.

78
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:37,110
Granting access rights to perform
various operations you can do on

79
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:43,110
a table, and revoking those, this is how
we manage access control in databases.
