The answer to this one,

2
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:04,570
I've gone, we're just going through the last few quizzes, should be obvious.

3
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:07,780
That basically whenever the kernel is symmetric,

4
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:10,360
which is the case with the box filter or Gaussian filter and

5
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:13,510
all those other types of filters we've looked at so far.

6
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:18,240
The as, the result of convolution and correlation should be the same.
