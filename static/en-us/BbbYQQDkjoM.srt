00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,560
How about this parabola? What do you think would be the vertex for it? And try

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:08,528
and create its graph. Remember, identifying the vertex is only one part of this

3
00:00:08,528 --> 00:00:12,213
problem. The graph is just as important, and it's up to you to make sure you

4
00:00:12,213 --> 00:00:15,722
get it correct. Take your time on this one, and be sure to check over your

5
00:00:15,722 --> 00:00:20,008
work. This one's a little bit harder. When you think you're ready to compare

6
00:00:20,008 --> 00:00:23,810
your graph, type in your vertex here and check out the solution video.
