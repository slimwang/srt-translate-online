00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,724
>> To say this mathematically, I would have to have an ordered pair, or an x and

2
00:00:04,724 --> 00:00:09,693
a y. The x tells me the horizontal distance, in this case 2. And the y tells me

3
00:00:09,693 --> 00:00:14,714
the vertical distance, in this case 4. We call this an ordered pair or we could

4
00:00:14,714 --> 00:00:19,953
think about calling these the coordinates of the point. So, where would you find

5
00:00:19,953 --> 00:00:22,520
the point for 3? Choose the best answer.
