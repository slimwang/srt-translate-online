00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,520
The answer to that is we can find a group of four genes that are connected to each other

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:11,830
by selecting this one here, this one here, this one here, and this one here

3
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:18,980
and as you will see, this gene here is connected to those three.

4
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:24,110
This gene here is connected to that one, that one, and that one.

5
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:28,970
This one up here is also connected to this one, this one, and this one

6
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:33,070
and similarly here the fourth one is also connected to the other three.

7
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:36,720
That is actually the largest possible group of genes that you can find

8
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:39,760
that are all connected to each other in this network.

9
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:45,040
Now it should be noted that this problem is a bit of a simplification of what you might

10
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:48,360
encounter in a real biotechnology setting.

11
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:54,190
For example, normally in biotechnology you would be happy if you found a group of genes where

12
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:58,850
most are connected to most others but here we'll be looking

13
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:02,710
only for groups that are fully connected to each other so like this one here.

14
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:06,540
The reason why we're doing that is that from an algorithmic perceptive,

15
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:09,950
it doesn't really make much difference and it's just simply to work with the problem

16
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:14,520
where we know we have to find groups of genes that are fully connected to each other

17
00:01:14,520 --> 99:59:59,999
rather than if we allow certain connections to be missing.
