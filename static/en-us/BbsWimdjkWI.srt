1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:05,490
Let me talk to you a little bit about
what's the underlying concept of

2
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:07,350
what makes video what it is.

3
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:11,620
And the whole concept comes through
some literature that actually comes from

4
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:14,530
psychology or understanding
of the human vision system.

5
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:17,220
Some of it is controversial and
not completely bought into.

6
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:21,040
But the idea really is what is
referred to as Persistence of Vision.

7
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:25,230
Our human vision system, when you
actually show it frames of something,

8
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:30,160
and if you could take those frames and,
basically, look through them very fast,

9
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,180
that is being able to change from one
frame to the other at certain frequency.

10
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:36,560
Our vision system
merges the information,

11
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:39,018
such that we actually
don't see any flicker.

12
00:00:39,018 --> 00:00:41,920
And that's a large part of what
the whole concept of Persistence of

13
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,040
Vision is.

14
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,930
That our vision system, when shown
something at a certain refresh rate,

15
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:51,455
merges the information such that we
actually see motion that's flicker-free.

16
00:00:51,455 --> 00:00:55,450
So, for example, here, this is very
classic example of a horse, and

17
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:59,820
this were bunch of pictures taken,
one by one, and

18
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:03,670
then basically put on top of each other
and that basically gives you the fact

19
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:07,764
that this horse is running
with the jockey on top.

20
00:01:07,764 --> 00:01:11,243
Again these were individual images,
taken one at a time,

21
00:01:11,243 --> 00:01:14,375
placed in front of the horse
as the horse was moving.

22
00:01:14,375 --> 00:01:16,667
Again, they were lined up
at different locations.

23
00:01:16,667 --> 00:01:21,296
And, now if you notice, by just aligning
them and being able to display them,

24
00:01:21,296 --> 00:01:25,170
you basically see motion, and
a very continuous smooth motion.

25
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:29,070
Of course, in this case,
you might see a little bit of jerkiness.

26
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:34,260
So, in essence, the idea is, if you
give me a bunch of image frames, and

27
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:38,750
if they're captured in such that when we
can play them back at a rate somewhere

28
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:44,000
around 124th of a second, we will see
flicker-free appearance of motion.

29
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,420
And this is again a very
classic example from 1887,

30
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:51,625
by the way, of how this kind of
stuff was used to generate motion.

31
00:01:51,625 --> 00:01:55,920
This another example of these birds
here is again showing motion of course.

32
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,320
They've been actually multi-exposed
into creating one frame

33
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,070
of all of that motion.

34
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:03,820
So this concept of Persistence
of Vision is, basically,

35
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:08,139
the foundational observation
of why we perceive video.

36
00:02:08,139 --> 00:02:11,740
Again, video is a medium,
stacked frames of

37
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:16,700
continuous motion refreshed at
more that 124th of a second,

38
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:20,760
gives us an appearance of motion and
we don't see any flicker.

39
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:24,220
So this actually is also
the rationale behind building and

40
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:25,560
inventing video cameras.

41
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:30,140
We've talked a lot about cameras coming
up in the early 1800s, and some of

42
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:33,860
the earliest technologies of showcasing
frames of videos, including things like

43
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:38,430
zoetropes and stuff were in essence
about taking images and showing them to

44
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:42,440
you in a rate faster than our human
vision system can actually deal with.

45
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:45,900
And again that's one-24th of a second or
more, And when that happens,

46
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,160
we see complete flicker-free motion.

47
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,250
Again, examples of this are there.

48
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:53,030
And this is actually pretty much
the foundation of why people wanted to

49
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:56,840
invent cameras, video cameras,
that can capture these frames.

50
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:00,470
Some of the earliest work in this space
of pretty much building these ways of

51
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:05,010
kind of taking sequences, images and
then using that to understand motion,

52
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:09,240
and that's what he was interested in,
was done by Muybridge.

53
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,630
And in this case, in fact,

54
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:12,920
this video that you see of
the horse was done by him.

55
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:16,210
Basically, what he did was he used
stop-motion photographs to study

56
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:17,680
animal motion.

57
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,660
So, yes, this is,

58
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:22,750
in essence, stop-motion photographs,
photographs taken by a bunch of cameras

59
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:26,780
that basically fired as the horse
was moving in front of them.

60
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:30,370
And then, of course, using them to
generate this whole motion, and

61
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:32,580
a stabilized version of this.

62
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:36,600
Another person, who actually at the same
time frame as Muybridge, did work in

63
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:40,275
this, too, as well, is Marey, and he
developed a, basically a technique for

64
00:03:40,275 --> 00:03:44,610
chronophotographie to capture motion,
and this example image is from him.

65
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:45,830
Both of them were pioneers and

66
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:51,380
actually had allot to do with the basic
concept of what video motion capture

67
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:54,330
that allowed us, in fact both of
them were interested in actually

68
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:58,880
understanding behaviors of animals and
people as they moved.

69
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:02,650
They started using cameras and
video cameras to support this.
