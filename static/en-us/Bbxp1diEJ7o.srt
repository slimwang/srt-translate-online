00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,430
Just like before, we substitute in our x-coordinate in the spot of x and our

2
00:00:04,442 --> 00:00:09,040
y-coordinate in the spot of y, then we just simplify. For the left hand side, we

3
00:00:09,052 --> 00:00:13,545
end up with 34. For the right hand side, we start out with 34, and there aren't

4
00:00:13,557 --> 00:00:17,990
any variables involved in this expression. Since we don't have any place to

5
00:00:18,002 --> 00:00:23,633
substitute anything in We can just say 34 is equal to 34. And again, looking at

6
00:00:23,645 --> 00:00:29,527
these two sides and how they compare, 34 is still equal to 34. So, yes, these

7
00:00:29,539 --> 00:00:35,284
two sides are equal. That means that we can say, that even though we may not

8
00:00:35,296 --> 00:00:40,564
have any idea what this curve looks like, we know that this point lies on this

9
00:00:40,576 --> 00:00:00,000
line. You might see some equations like this later on in the course. Get

10
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
excited.
