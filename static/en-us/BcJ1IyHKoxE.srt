00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,310
Now let's discuss the solution to our two bit

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:04,800
predictor quiz. We have a two bit predictor like

3
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:08,201
this. The question is, is there a sequence of

4
00:00:08,201 --> 00:00:11,685
branch outcomes, such that this predictor, starting in the

5
00:00:11,685 --> 00:00:15,390
strong note taken state always mispredicts. And the answer

6
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:19,620
is of course yes. Every single predictor has the

7
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:22,960
worst case scenario of always mispredicting. What you have

8
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,490
to do to find out what that worst-case scenario

9
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:30,660
is, is simply design a sequence such that whatever

10
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,360
the state of the predictor is, the sequence goes

11
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,480
the opposite way. So, we start in the strong

12
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,530
not taken state, thus the first decision will be taken,

13
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:42,370
and that will take us to a weak not

14
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:45,716
taken state. The predictor will still predict not taken,

15
00:00:45,716 --> 00:00:48,410
so we make the branch be taken next time.

16
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:51,440
Now the predictor goes to the weak taken state and

17
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,110
now we know how to cause the alternation between the

18
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:57,760
states. So in the weak taken state, we go not taken.

19
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:01,890
It moves to weak not taken, now we say taken and

20
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:05,300
so on. So you can just keep doing this. So pretty

21
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:07,290
much, even if we do start in a strong taken

22
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:09,460
state, there is a way to move us to a weak

23
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:12,870
state, at which point we can do this alternation. Note that

24
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:16,480
for this particular sequence, there is a way to change this

25
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,845
predictor so that this behavior doesn't result in

26
00:01:19,845 --> 00:01:24,240
100% misprediction. But in general, every predictor no

27
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,551
matter how it's organized, will always have some

28
00:01:27,551 --> 00:01:31,190
sequence as it's worst possible outcome. It's just

29
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:33,520
a matter of how likely is that sequence.

30
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,628
A good predictor will not have this worst

31
00:01:35,628 --> 00:01:37,550
case behavior for some thing that is a

32
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:42,060
very likely sequence to happen. So again, every predictor

33
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:45,450
has a worst-case scenario where it's doing 100% mispredictions.
