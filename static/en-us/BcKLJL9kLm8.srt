1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,060
We can think of concepts lying on a spectrum.

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:06,440
On one extreme end are extremely formal concepts for

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:09,270
which we can define logical conditions that are necessary and

4
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:13,480
sufficient for that concept. We'll examine that in more detail in just a minute.

5
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:17,680
On the other end of the spectrum are less formal concepts for which it's hard to

6
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,440
define necessary and sufficient conditions. Now here are three points on

7
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:26,550
the spectrum. Axiomatic concepts, prototype concepts, exemplar concepts.

8
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:29,535
There can be other types of concepts as well. We're just going to

9
00:00:29,535 --> 00:00:32,689
consider these three concepts because they are the three most common ones.

10
00:00:32,689 --> 00:00:36,030
And we'll look at each one of them in turn. In general, humans find it

11
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:40,610
easier to communicate about axiomatic concepts because they are well defined.

12
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:44,460
There is a set of necessary and sufficient conditions that we all agree with.

13
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:48,870
Examples are mathematical concepts. Humans find it harder to communicate about

14
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:53,700
prototype concepts, but most of the time we do quite well. It's even harder to

15
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:57,930
talk about exemplar concepts like, let's say, beauty or freedom. Similarly,

16
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:02,290
it's easier to teach computers axiomatic concepts or program axiomatic concepts

17
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:06,940
into computers. It's much harder to program or teach prototype concepts.

18
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:10,590
And much, much harder to teach a program exemplar type concepts.
