1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:01,160
Okay, great.

2
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:04,420
So now you have Jenkins taking your
service all the way from your code base

3
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:06,310
to the borderlands of production.

4
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:10,220
But once you're there, how do you know
if your service is working right?

5
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:12,840
One of the principles of
DevOps is measurement.

6
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,880
That includes measuring how
effective our process is, but

7
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:19,460
it also includes measuring how
well our services are running.

8
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:21,650
What is it we want our service to do?

9
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:24,740
If it's a web server, well,
we want it to answer user queries,

10
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:29,680
we want it to be fast, we want it to
return actual results and not errors.

11
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:32,808
Measuring those things is what
service monitoring's for.

12
00:00:32,808 --> 00:00:35,840
From an operations standpoint,
your service monitoring is a lot like

13
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,600
the instrumentation in
an airplane cockpit.

14
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:41,120
You know how an airplane
pilot can keep the plane on

15
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,380
course even when there's no visibility?

16
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:46,230
They need instruments even to tell
if the plane is in level flight or

17
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:48,530
if it's diving into a crash.

18
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:51,430
Or another way of thinking about
it is that service monitoring

19
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:53,370
is like a scientific instrument.

20
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:55,260
You can see things with a microscope or

21
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:58,340
a Geiger counter that you
can't see with your naked eye.

22
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:01,980
If there's dangerous bacteria in your
water supply, looking at a drop of water

23
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:04,980
with the microscope let's you know
what it is that's making people sick.

24
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,610
If you have dozens of servers and

25
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:09,630
you want to know whether they're
doing the right thing, or

26
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:14,580
if they're serving errors to maybe even
just 1% of users, you're not going to

27
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:17,750
find that out by just refreshing
the home page or something.

28
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:19,260
You need a monitoring
system to tell you.
