00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,810
Let's look at the solution for our laundry

2
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:05,920
pipelining quiz. We have a washer, dryer and

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:08,135
folder. Each takes one hour. We have ten

4
00:00:08,135 --> 00:00:12,190
loads of laundry. With no pipelining, one load takes

5
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:14,983
three hours to finish. Only then we begin

6
00:00:14,983 --> 00:00:18,089
the next load. So it's going to take 30 hours

7
00:00:18,089 --> 00:00:20,357
to do them, because we do them one

8
00:00:20,357 --> 00:00:25,030
at a time. Each takes three hours. With pipelining,

9
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:31,170
the first load will take one, two, three hours. So, so far we are no better off.

10
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:38,110
However, once the first load is in the folder, the second load is already in the

11
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:41,720
dryer. When the first load leaves the pipeline

12
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:44,690
after three hours, it takes only one hour to

13
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:47,540
do the folding for the next load. So

14
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:50,270
we have, after the initial three hours, one load

15
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:54,578
leaving every hour. So what we have, really,

16
00:00:54,578 --> 00:00:57,680
is three hours for the first load, plus

17
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:01,456
one hour for the remaining loads. Overall, it

18
00:01:01,456 --> 00:01:05,570
takes only 12 hours to process the ten loads.

19
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:07,950
As you can see, by planning, you can

20
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:11,200
significantly improve the execution time, when we have many

21
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,260
things to do. And, when you have instructions,

22
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:15,990
you usually have a lot of them to do.
