1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:03,210
All right, so let's find the path to
get to the properties in the first

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:04,820
earthquake in the list.

3
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:07,140
Now, we always start the root,
so we look for

4
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:10,990
the JSON array with the key features,
which is right here.

5
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:15,100
Again, we know this is an array based on
the left and right square brackets, and

6
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:16,260
we can expand out from there.

7
00:00:17,298 --> 00:00:21,170
Then we want to find the object that
it's mapped to by the key properties.

8
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:22,130
So if you collapse this,

9
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:26,130
we also see that this is an object,
and expand further to go deeper.

10
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:29,130
Now, here's the meaning
of the extraction.

11
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:31,961
This object contains all
the attributes we care about.

12
00:00:31,961 --> 00:00:38,349
We've got the magnitude as a decimal,
we've got the place as a string,

13
00:00:38,349 --> 00:00:43,078
and we've got the time as
a very large integer value.

14
00:00:43,078 --> 00:00:45,480
And then,
we have the URL also as a string value.

15
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:48,870
So by following the logic
we just mentioned,

16
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:52,870
here are the traversal paths for
the magnitude, the location, the time,

17
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:55,580
and the website URL of
the first earthquake.
