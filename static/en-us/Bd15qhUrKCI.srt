1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:03,150
Now were going to talk about something that's very important for

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:05,400
decision trees, and that is entropy.

3
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:11,120
Entropy is basically the thing that controls how a decision tree

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:14,030
decides where to split the data.

5
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:16,270
So, entropy is this very powerful thing.

6
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:18,050
What's the definition?

7
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:21,320
It's a measure of impurity in a bunch of examples.

8
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:22,590
Let me show you what I mean.

9
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:26,240
Sebastian self-driving car data, we have the grade and

10
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,000
the bumpiness of the train, like we did before.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,610
But, let's suppose that there's a new variable, a new feature now

12
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:35,413
that we're going to take into account, and that is a speed limit.

13
00:00:35,413 --> 00:00:39,424
Remember, the question was whether the car can drive fast or slow.

14
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:43,190
So, if there's a speed limit, it shouldn't be driving very fast.

15
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:46,440
So remember, before we had data that looked like this,

16
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,640
where he had the bumpiness and the grade.

17
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,760
Now, let's suppose we had the speed limit and the grade.

18
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,460
And, let's suppose the speed limit worked like this.

19
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:58,050
If the speed limit was in force, you're in this half of the data.

20
00:00:58,050 --> 00:00:59,800
And the, if the speed limit is not in force,

21
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:02,930
you can go at whatever the speed you like, you're in this half of the data,

22
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:05,510
the lower half of the scatter plot here.

23
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:09,885
So then, when the speed limit is in effect, doesn't matter what grade it is,

24
00:01:09,885 --> 00:01:13,230
everything's going to be slow.

25
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:15,800
Whereas, when the speed limit is not in effect,

26
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,820
you still have to go slow when it's too steep, but

27
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:22,570
now you can still go fast if it's flat enough, if the train is good.
