00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:01,880
To implement the intent service,

2
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:04,740
there are a number of steps that
you're going to need to follow.

3
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:09,286
The first thing to do is to create
a GeoFenceTransitionsIntentService

4
00:00:09,286 --> 00:00:13,590
class and have this extend
the IntentService base class.

5
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:19,100
You'll then need to add a constructor
and add an onCreate override to this.

6
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:22,990
Generally these will be empty, but
in the constructor you could call super

7
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:27,500
tag, and in the onCreate you could just
pass onCreate up to super as well.

8
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:33,010
Finally, you'll need to create
an override for onHandleIntent.

9
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:37,230
Now this takes an intent as
a parameter and returns void.

10
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:40,340
Once you've created all this stub code,
check this box when you're done.
