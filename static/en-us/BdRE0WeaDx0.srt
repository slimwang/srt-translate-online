00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Just for the fun of it, let me ask you a quiz that links back to the very first class.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Robotics is partially observable, yes or no?

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,000
It's continuous in its state and action spaces and its measurement, yes or no?

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
The environment may be stochastic, yes or no,

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
and it may be adversarial, yes or no?

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Specifically, something like the DARPA Grand Challenge might be adversarial or not.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Please choose the answer that best fits.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I understand there might be multiple choices possible here,

9
00:00:30,000 --> 99:59:59,999
but please go back to what fits the best.
