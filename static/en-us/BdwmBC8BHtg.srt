1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:03,800
For the rest of this practice set
you're going to gets build some apps.

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:06,250
You'll work with me through
a basketball scoring app, and

3
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:09,380
then we'll give you a few optional apps
that you could try if you want to hone

4
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:10,240
your skills a bit more.

5
00:00:11,445 --> 00:00:13,390
Okay, the basketball scoring app.

6
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:15,210
This app is called court counter and

7
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:19,360
the purpose of this app is to keep track
of the score of a basketball game.

8
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:23,030
Now they end up is going to look like
this but will build it up in stages.

9
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:26,840
For the less athletically inclined,
and for our international audience,

10
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:29,350
I'll go ahead and explain how
scoring and basketball works.

11
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:33,100
The first way to score a point is
within the three point line which,

12
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,150
is a circle around the basket.

13
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:37,750
It's the most common way to score and
it's worth two points.

14
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:42,350
The second way to make a basket
is behind the three point line

15
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:43,530
which is this line right here.

16
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:47,290
It's quite a bit harder but
it earns you three points.

17
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:50,860
Finally the last way that a team
can score is something called

18
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:52,360
the free throw.

19
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:56,830
When a player is fouled such as kicked
in the shins, they get to try to make

20
00:00:56,830 --> 00:01:01,000
one free basket behind the free throw
line Players will be lined up along

21
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,489
either side, but nobody will stop him or
her from trying to make that basket.

22
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:07,020
A free throw is worth one point.

23
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:11,880
With the court counter app, you can see
that you have a team A and a team B.

24
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:16,270
You also have the option to give
three two or one free throw point.

25
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:19,150
If you click on the buttons to
award team points as they score.

26
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:23,740
And if you want when the game's
over you can hit the reset button.

27
00:01:25,135 --> 00:01:27,070
Okay, so to start off we're
going to make a new app.

28
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:30,090
You've done this a couple times before
so I'm just going to give you the major

29
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,530
checkpoints that you need to
hit to make your new app.

30
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:35,240
Make sure that you call your new
application court counter and

31
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,280
that you give it
the right company domain.

32
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,160
Set the minimum SDK to A.P.I. 15 and
choose the empty activity template.

33
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,180
You can go ahead and
accept any other defaults.

34
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:45,150
Then you should be done and
ready to get going with this app.
