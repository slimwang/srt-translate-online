00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:05,540
>> Alright, so now we have a way to, to look at our modified version using a

2
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:07,580
file on our local machine, but it would

3
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:09,130
be really nice if we could you know, share

4
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:11,290
this with our friends without passing them all

5
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:13,985
of the files that we modified and having them

6
00:00:13,985 --> 00:00:16,325
loaded up on their computer. So what we did

7
00:00:16,325 --> 00:00:19,600
was we made this shareable version hosted on GitHub.

8
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,900
>> Yeah, and GitHub does this automatically, it's

9
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:26,560
pretty cool, it's this feature called gh-pages. And we,

10
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,850
Sara and I just went through the whole process of making that happen and it

11
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:32,070
was actually a little frustrating, not for any

12
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:34,510
good reason, mostly because we were impatient. So

13
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:37,030
there is a link in the instructor comments

14
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:39,400
of this video that will give you great

15
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:42,720
documentation for how to make your own page.

16
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,870
The only advice I think we would give.

17
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:45,590
>> Be patient.

18
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:48,490
>> Yes. There's a part where it says it may take

19
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:51,686
ten minutes. It really means that, so don't, don't think anything's

20
00:00:51,686 --> 00:00:54,299
going wrong if your page isn't loading as fast as you think.

21
00:00:54,299 --> 00:00:55,373
>> Yep.

22
00:00:55,373 --> 00:00:57,770
>> But, once you have your, your page up, you should go to

23
00:00:57,770 --> 00:01:01,275
the forum, share your link and I'm really excited to see what everyone makes.

24
00:01:01,275 --> 00:01:02,370
>> Yeah.
