1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Okay, and the answer is Apache/22.3.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Now, if you put in

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Big IP,

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
we accepted that, but I'm pretty sure you didn't use urlib2.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Because when I was finding the answer to this,

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I also cheated, used curl, and got Big IP,

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
which is actually what www.example.com uses,

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
but urllib2 automatically follows redirects,

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
and the server it redirects to uses Apache.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
So let me show you how I got the example,

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
and then we'll go ahead and talk about what happened with the redirect.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Okay, so the way I found this answer is

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I used urllib2.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I used the url open function to hit www.example.com.

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I stored that in a variable,

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
and then I looked at its headers.

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I see that the server is Apache/22.3.

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
And that's the correct answer.

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
If we look at the url attribute on P,

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
we see it's actually iana.org.

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Now, if you remember from Unit 1, I asked you what is the location header

22
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
when you hit www.example.com.

23
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
And that was because--

24
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
And this was the answer, because example.com redirects to iana.org.

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Now, urllib2 automatically follows redirects,

26
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
which can sometimes be confusing.

27
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
And in this case, it automatically followed the redirect.

28
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
It hit iana.org, whose server is Apache.

29
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
But we're going to do this by hand. I'm going to use curl.

30
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
This is the Unit 1 example.

31
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
We can see that server is actually Big IP.

32
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
So hopefully you used urllib2, but if you cheated like I did

33
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
when I was writing this quiz and you saw Big IP, we'll also accept that.

34
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
And it's important to know, when you're using these libraries,

35
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
that a lot of these libraries--urllib2,

36
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
the default one included in Google App Engine called URL Fetch--

37
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
they follow redirects automatically.

38
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
And if you don't want to follow the redirects,

39
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
say your are writing a grading script for your homeworks,

40
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
you need to look up the docs.

41
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
There's almost always an option to tell the library not to follow automatically follow redirects.

42
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
So that's something to keep in mind when you get behavior you don't expect

43
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
as just happened to me.

44
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,153
Okay, let's move on.
