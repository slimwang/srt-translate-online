00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,951
Alright, now that we've got some better tools, let's take a look at a bigger

2
00:00:04,963 --> 00:00:09,975
piece of code. Now this is the entire base game engine class for the game that

3
00:00:09,987 --> 00:00:14,928
we're going to be building. Now, what I'd like you to do, is debug this much

4
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:16,376
larger piece of code.

5
00:00:16,381 --> 00:00:20,662
And to do this, you're going to need some help, otherwise, it's going to take

6
00:00:20,674 --> 00:00:25,091
far too long. Now, there are only a few syntax errors here. So, it's going to be

7
00:00:25,103 --> 00:00:29,273
a little bit hard to find them unless you use some tools, whether the Chrome

8
00:00:29,285 --> 00:00:30,605
developer tools or some other browser's tools.
