00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:05,656
You might have guessed that it's going to be skinnier, because if n increases

2
00:00:05,656 --> 00:00:11,376
from 2 to 5, the denominator of this standard deviation of the distribution is

3
00:00:11,376 --> 00:00:16,490
going to be bigger. Meaning that this standard deviation or this standard error

4
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:20,935
is going to be smaller, that means that the distribution of sample mean is going

5
00:00:20,935 --> 00:00:24,832
to be skinnier. But it's also great if you use the applet, because that's a

6
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:30,389
really good visualization tool. Let's do that. So we'll roll five dice, and then

7
00:00:30,389 --> 00:00:35,558
take the average of all the numbers that show up at the top. And then we'll do

8
00:00:35,558 --> 00:00:40,094
this at least 100 times. Let's do it a 1000 times. And you see we have a

9
00:00:40,094 --> 00:00:46,280
skinnier normal distribution. Again let's compare this to if we only rolled two

10
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,672
dice. Then we get a much wider distribution.
