1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:01,700
Here is the answer.

2
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:03,300
The work is linear.

3
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:04,830
The loops all go from 1 to n,

4
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:08,010
and the amount of work per
iteration is constant.

5
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:09,930
Now the span is log n.

6
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:11,496
That follows from our usual convention.

7
00:00:11,496 --> 00:00:14,760
A parallel for-loop with a constant
amount of work per iteration

8
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:16,400
has logarithmic span.

9
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,344
I've also asked the grading
auto box to accept O of 1 time.
