I'd like you to identify the types of matrices these are. Your four choices are

2
00:00:03,953 --> 00:00:08,401
translate, rotate, rotate then translate, and scale. When you figure out what a

3
00:00:08,401 --> 00:00:12,604
matrix is, put the appropriate number in the box. Each transform will be used

4
00:00:12,604 --> 00:00:13,070
one time.
