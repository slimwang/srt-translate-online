00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,340
I'm sitting here with Mike Wales.

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:04,360
He is one of our front end developers.

3
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:05,000
How you doing?

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:05,750
>> Good.

5
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:07,610
So what are we talking about?

6
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:10,805
>> We're talking about getting things with no context whatsoever.

7
00:00:10,805 --> 00:00:12,170
>> [LAUGH] >> Like this interview.

8
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:12,820
>> This interview.

9
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:17,080
Okay. >> So, have you ever been in a situation where someone has handed you

10
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:21,090
a whole bunch a code, written in a framework you've never seen before?

11
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:23,235
>> Okay. >> You've never seen this code itself before.

12
00:00:23,235 --> 00:00:23,910
>> Mm-hm.

13
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:25,620
>> And you hardly know what it does.

14
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:27,059
And they give you some task to do.

15
00:00:27,059 --> 00:00:28,720
>> Oh yeah, all the time.

16
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,760
>> All the, really? >> [LAUGH] Yeah, it's pretty common.

17
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:33,120
>> Tell me a little bit about the feeling behind that.

18
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,890
Like what, what does it feel like when someone hands you this big mess?

19
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:36,880
>> Yeah.

20
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,290
It's a daunting task at first because like you said,

21
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:42,360
they've handed you a big mess and you have no idea what's going on.

22
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:46,330
So you just got to, you kind of have to make a plan of attack.

23
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:49,030
And how are you going to figure out what's going on?

24
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:52,600
And how are you going to get the right amount of context to

25
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,470
accomplish the task that's been handed to you?

26
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:58,520
>> Yeah, I mean one of the things is it feels like a big mess,

27
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:02,410
not because it necessarily is but because you don't have that context.

28
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:02,990
>> It's just new to you.

29
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:03,590
Right? >> Exactly.

30
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:04,489
Yeah.

31
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:07,260
So how would you go about getting that context?

32
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:09,740
>> The first thing I would do is try and track down what libraries or

33
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:11,940
frameworks that application might be using.

34
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:15,030
And hopefully it's something popular or something well-documented.

35
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:19,630
And I would just dive into the documentation of that library or that framework.

36
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:22,930
>> Now, are you looking to get a lot of specific information, like

37
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:26,280
really become an expert in this framework or are you looking for a big picture?

38
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:26,850
>> No, not at all.

39
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:28,000
Yeah, just a big picture.

40
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,980
Just kind of where is stuff at in this framework.

41
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:35,170
What are the best practises that this framework establishes just so

42
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:38,020
I can figure out, because I mean I have this task I need to accomplish.

43
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:40,560
I don't have the time to sit here and learn a whole framework.

44
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,395
So just to kind of,

45
00:01:41,395 --> 00:01:46,200
or where do I need to look in the application code to get this problem solved?

46
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,520
>> Yeah, and pretty much all organizational libraries and

47
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,370
frameworks are the same.

48
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:50,550
>> Right. >> I mean, they all have models.

49
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:51,710
They all have collections.

50
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:54,060
I mean, they all call them different things, right?

51
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:54,750
>> Right.

52
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:58,210
>> Like for example, Knockout calls them observable arrays rather than

53
00:01:58,210 --> 00:01:59,580
collections, or something like that.

54
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:03,110
>> Yeah, my goal would just be to find out what does this framework call it and

55
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:04,140
where is it at.

56
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:07,980
>> Got it. So that's to enable you to figure out, in your code that you've been

57
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:11,470
given, where to look to implement the feature that you want to implement.

58
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,510
>> Exactly, otherwise I have to sit there and

59
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:16,860
read the entire application code, and who knows how long that's going to be.

60
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:18,960
>> All right, that makes sense.

61
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,180
So, what about if your framework, or

62
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:25,420
library, doesn't have documentation, or doesn't have good documentation?

63
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:26,738
>> Burn it all down and redo it.

64
00:02:26,738 --> 00:02:28,510
No. [LAUGH] >> [LAUGH] >> Don't do that.

65
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:29,060
Don't do that.

66
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:29,990
>> I'm kidding-

67
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:32,890
>> Then you just have to, you have to spend the time to

68
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:36,460
read through the application code and, and just understand it.

69
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:38,920
And you should estimate the time required for

70
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:42,020
that task to now be like five times as much as your original estimate.

71
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:44,120
>> Mm. So legacy code can be pretty difficult.

72
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,565
>> Absolutely, if it's not documented well.

73
00:02:45,565 --> 00:02:47,290
Yeah. >> Awesome. Well, thanks for sitting with me, Mike.

74
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:47,790
>> Mm-hm.
