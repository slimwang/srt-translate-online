00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,560
For example, let's go take a look at the front page

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:06,180
of our Conference Application. First, let's look at it in Landscape

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:08,870
Mode on a Tablet, now let's look at it on the

4
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:12,490
phone. See how the layout is different? Let's take a look on

5
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:14,860
this on the Desktop and see how it adjusts, when you

6
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:18,500
drag the Window. You can see how the Buttons pop into two

7
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:21,890
rows when the window gets too narrow to fit all four

8
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:25,380
comfortably, let's take a look at the magic that makes this happen,

9
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:28,260
it's actually quite simple. The Menu items are laid out

10
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:31,230
inside a flex box, and the items inside that flex

11
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:34,870
box by default are told to take up 46% of

12
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:38,100
the available space. That means, of course, that only two

13
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,950
items will fit on a line. However, there's an app

14
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:44,720
media rule that overrides this if there's a minimum width

15
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:47,860
of the window of 500 pixels. In that case, the

16
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:51,250
items will each only take up 24% of the space,

17
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:54,244
so all four items will fit on a single line. Using

18
00:00:54,244 --> 00:00:57,580
Flexbox can be a great way to transform your page. You

19
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:01,040
can change flex direction or flex order to make dramatic interface

20
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:04,480
changes like the one I did in the Audio Recorder earlier on.
