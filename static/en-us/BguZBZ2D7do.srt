1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,200
Now that you know a little bit more
about both write rules and validate

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:06,800
rules, you might be wondering what the
exact differences are between the two.

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:09,800
After all they are both executed when
you try to write data to a database.

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,600
Part of the difference is in their use.

5
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:14,960
Validation rules should be used to
ensure the correct structure and format

6
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:19,100
of data, whereas right rules deal with
who has access to write to that data.

7
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:21,940
Functionally, the fact that
write rules cascade down and

8
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:24,422
validate rules do not is very important.

9
00:00:24,422 --> 00:00:27,390
Write rules should be used to map
out portions of the data structure

10
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:29,950
that particular users
have access to write to.

11
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:33,710
Whereas validate rules should be used
to deny a user with write access

12
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:36,340
if they're trying to do
something strange to the data.

13
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:39,300
Write rules therefore become
about giving access to someone.

14
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:43,490
Whereas validate rules can be used to
further restrict improper data editing.

15
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:47,300
For example, you could use a write rule
to say that a user could alter an item's

16
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:50,980
properties if they're the owner of
the list or shared on that list.

17
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:54,200
But say you want to also verify that
there are some true things specific

18
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:58,060
to each property, to make sure that
the property is being used correctly.

19
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:00,730
For example, you could validate
that they change the item

20
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:03,250
only to words that start
with capital letters.

21
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:06,510
Or you could do something like check
that the user is shopping at a list

22
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:08,970
if they want to edit the bought
property of an item.

23
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:12,395
And finally, another functional
difference that I've mentioned but

24
00:01:12,395 --> 00:01:15,932
is very good to be again reminded of
is that validate rules are not executed

25
00:01:15,932 --> 00:01:17,828
when something is deleted or removed.

26
00:01:17,828 --> 00:01:21,643
And basically what this means is that
if you ever need to restrict access

27
00:01:21,643 --> 00:01:25,668
to deleting or removing items, you'd
need to use the write rule for that.

28
00:01:25,668 --> 00:01:27,510
Okay, hope that clears
things up a little bit.
