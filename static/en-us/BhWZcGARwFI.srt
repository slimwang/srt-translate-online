00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:04,540
Remember, Paul just taught you that
forced synchronous layout occurs when

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:08,830
you ask a browser to run layout first
inside the JavaScript section, and

3
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:12,040
then recalculate styles,
and then run layout again.

4
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:15,675
There are a few different properties
that when accessed will cause layout.

5
00:00:15,675 --> 00:00:18,345
And you can find a list of
them in the instructor notes.

6
00:00:18,345 --> 00:00:21,515
With that in mind I've got three
reasonable snippets of code for

7
00:00:21,515 --> 00:00:23,705
you that I want you to analyze.

8
00:00:23,705 --> 00:00:26,265
Each of these three includes
some kind of iteration

9
00:00:26,265 --> 00:00:28,735
which I'm using forEach to do.

10
00:00:28,735 --> 00:00:33,415
Now by the way you can't normally
use forEach with a collection of DOM

11
00:00:33,415 --> 00:00:37,310
nodes which you get from using something
like Document.querySelectorAll.

12
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:42,060
But I really like using forEach because
of its pretty awesome call back syntax.

13
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:46,110
So what wind up doing is converting the
collection of DOM nodes, into an array

14
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:50,540
of DOM nodes which gives you the option
to use forEach and other array methods.

15
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:53,760
See the example in
the instructor notes to see how.

16
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,890
Anyways, two of these three will
cause a forced synchronous layout.

17
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:01,760
But which one cannot cause
a forced synchronous layout?

18
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,290
In the instructor notes below, you can
find a link to a sample site that uses

19
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:07,730
all three as well as
some other helpful hints.

20
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:11,220
So open the examples site, try out these
three and see if you can figure out

21
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:13,710
which one is not causing
the forced synchronous layout.
