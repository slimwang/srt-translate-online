1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:04,740
So first of all, we need our activity
to implement the various callbacks and

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:07,110
listeners that we've
been discussing about.

3
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:10,597
So, you can see here our public
class MainActivity already extends

4
00:00:10,597 --> 00:00:12,030
ActionBarActivity.

5
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:13,850
We want to implement a few things.

6
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:16,620
So we want it to
implement the following.

7
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:20,064
It's going to implement
GoogleApiClient.ConnectionCallbacks,

8
00:00:20,064 --> 00:00:24,900
GoogleApiClient.ConnectionFailedListe-
ner, and the location listener.

9
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,500
Instead of you watching me typing,
I'm just going to paste these in.

10
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:31,550
I've now added these, but
we can see we have a few errors

11
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:34,130
because some of the symbols
haven't been resolved.

12
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:36,840
You just need to import the correct
libraries to resolve them, and

13
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,160
I've added those libraries here.

14
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:43,230
We can now see that we still have an
error, and that's because there are some

15
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:47,250
methods that need to be implemented and
we haven't implemented them yet.

16
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:48,810
But we will be doing
that in just a moment.

17
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:54,210
Before we do that, there's a few
things that I want to add to the code.

18
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:56,670
First up, we just want to add a tag,

19
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:00,710
which is a string,
to the code that allows you to track

20
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:03,910
the name of this application if
we're writing it out to the log.

21
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:07,370
So we do that with a private
final string, it's called tag.

22
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:09,060
And you can put whatever
you like in there.

23
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:14,200
I'm just going to put LawrenceTestApp
and the code would look like this.

24
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:18,800
Next there's a few local variables that
we need to set up within this class.

25
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:23,220
Things, for example, for tracking
the text view that we call TxtOutput,

26
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:26,710
the Google API client itself,
and a location request object.

27
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,000
So I'll add these now.

28
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,960
You can see when I added them in,

29
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:34,280
it detected that it needed
to import this class.

30
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,800
So just go ahead and say okay to that.

31
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,450
And the class will be imported.

32
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:42,790
So you can see here I have a TextView
object that I'm calling txtOutput

33
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:45,560
that will just be used to
address the TextView on the UI.

34
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:49,410
I have a GoogleApiClient that
I call mGoogleApiClient.

35
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:53,590
And I have a LocationRequest
that I call mLocationRequest.

36
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:59,100
Okay, now in our onCreate method,
we need to set up the GoogleApiClient.

37
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:02,800
And we use this with
a GoogleApiClient builder, and

38
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,160
we add the requisite APIs to that.

39
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,700
Let's add this code and
then we can talk through it.

40
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:11,580
So, we go to onCreate and
I'll add the code in here.

41
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:15,100
So what it simply does is it
creates a new builder for

42
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:20,350
an API client, and it adds that we
want to use the location services API

43
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:24,960
by saying just LocationServices.API
to the addAPI method.

44
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:31,380
We want the connection callbacks on the
Google API client to come to this class.

45
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:34,580
And we want
the OnConnectionFailedListener

46
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:37,370
also to come to this class,
and then we build it.

47
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:40,950
So that's now going to give us a Google
API client that allows us to talk to

48
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:42,400
Google services.

49
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,860
Now, if you remember,
we had a UI element called a text view.

50
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:48,540
And this will render
the location information.

51
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:51,991
Of course, we want that text
view to be addressable in code,

52
00:02:51,991 --> 00:02:54,070
using this txtOutput class.

53
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:56,380
So let's set up something
to do that right now.

54
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:58,510
And we do that like this.

55
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:05,720
We just specify that txtOutput is found
my looking for the ID, or .id.txtOutput.

56
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:09,670
If you remember, when we specified the
text view in the XML for the activity,

57
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:12,870
we called it txtOutput,
the same name as this.

58
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:15,540
We just find that view and
then we cast it into a text view, and

59
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,160
now we're good to go.

60
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,330
So just to recap,
what did we actually do here?

61
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:24,850
Well first, we created an instance of
a Google API client using its builder.

62
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:29,090
We set it to use
the LocationServices API here, and

63
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:34,590
then we told it what the callbacks for
OnConnectionFailed were this,

64
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:37,380
so we're going to be handling
them within this class, or

65
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:41,240
within this activity, and
then we hooked up to text view to code.

66
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,910
You've actually done a lot but
there's still more to come.

67
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:45,300
So let's have a quick quiz first.
