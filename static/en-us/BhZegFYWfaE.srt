00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:05,230
In this class we'll use five main learning strategies. First, Learning by

2
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:09,970
Example. Almost every lesson of this class starts with an example of the type of

3
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:14,049
reasoning we want you to learn. The example that runs throughout the lesson,

4
00:00:14,049 --> 00:00:20,180
could demonstrate that reasoning. Second, Learning by Doing. In most lessons,

5
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:24,390
the lesson will end with a multi-part exercise, where you are doing the exact

6
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:28,070
reasoning that you learned in that lesson. There's first you see an example,

7
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:32,860
then you do a similar example yourself. Third, Project-Based Learning.

8
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:37,047
The class is largely structured around a series of challenging projects. And

9
00:00:37,047 --> 00:00:41,906
you will frequently be asked to relate each lesson you learn, to the projects in

10
00:00:41,906 --> 00:00:46,237
the class. Personalized learning. Personalization permeates throughout this

11
00:00:46,237 --> 00:00:50,990
course. You can watch the lessons in any order you choose, and at your own pace.

12
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:55,680
You can choose which concepts to focus on, and everything the assignments.

13
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,030
You'll receive personal feedback on every exercise throughout the course.

14
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:03,882
Fifth, Learning by Reflection. At the conclusion of each lesson,

15
00:01:03,882 --> 00:01:07,060
you'll be asked to reflect on what you learned in that particular lesson.

16
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:10,520
At the conclusion of each project, you'll write a designed report that will

17
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:15,420
reflect on the experiments that you did as part of the project. We'll also use

18
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:18,160
other learning strategies as needed, such as collaborative learning.
