00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,708
It turns out, any parallel lines will have the same slope. I can draw more

2
00:00:03,708 --> 00:00:08,750
lines on this graph, and all these lines have a slope of negative two thirds.

3
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:13,106
This should make sense that they're parallel because, this slope goes down two

4
00:00:13,106 --> 00:00:18,181
and right three, negative two, positive three. The same is true for the blue

5
00:00:18,181 --> 00:00:20,789
line. To move to another point of the line, we travel two units down and three

6
00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:25,504
units right. It's the same slope for both lines, pretty cool.
