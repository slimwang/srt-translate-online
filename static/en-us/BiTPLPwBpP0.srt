1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,220
There are a few really common pitfalls
that developers should avoid.

2
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:07,240
First and foremost,
it's using your analytics improperly.

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:12,080
A good example of this is
relying on vanity metrics.

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,940
Vanity metrics are things
such as daily active users.

5
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:19,870
These might be extremely large,
attractive numbers, 100,000, a million

6
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:24,070
people but they don't actually tell you
how the app or the game is performing.

7
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:29,160
You might have a huge number of people
but nobody's actually monetizing,

8
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,400
or the percentage of the people
that are monetizing,

9
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,410
even though the average revenue
per user is really high,

10
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:39,220
the percentage of total people who
are making a purchase is absurdly low.

11
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:41,410
You're leaving money on the table.

12
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:43,960
Make sure that you're not
relying on those vanity metrics.

13
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,530
Make sure you're tracking
exactly the right things.

14
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:50,850
Only things that actually determine
whether or not you're making money or

15
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:52,200
retaining users.

16
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:56,180
It might be interesting to see how many
people are engaging with the multiplayer

17
00:00:56,180 --> 00:01:00,500
feature within your game but if it's
not actually contributing to your

18
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:04,000
monetization, the percentage of
people that are making a purchase or

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,360
sticking around or
sharing the game with their friends,

20
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:11,430
then it makes the most sense to
leave that out of your analysis.

21
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:13,080
Finally, when looking at your analytics,

22
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,250
make sure you're not getting
consumed with the minutia.

23
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:19,230
In a lot of cases, there will
be a great degree of noise but

24
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:24,060
not a whole lot of signal, particularly
statistically significant signal.

25
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:27,470
Make sure that in the end,
if you see a small day to day, or

26
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:32,330
week to week fluctuations that
you're only acting on it if it's

27
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:35,430
actually something that is significant.

28
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:40,760
One mistake that we see a lot,
is that developers rely on one

29
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:45,030
particular ad network, or a monetization
method for all of their monetization.

30
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:48,270
You don't want to put all
of your eggs in one basket.

31
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:52,000
Even if you have a great relationship
with whoever the person is that sold you

32
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,530
that particular method,
make sure that there are fallbacks,

33
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:57,190
just in case there's a problem.

34
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:59,098
Finally, don't use emotion or

35
00:01:59,098 --> 00:02:03,370
don't rely on an emotion in
order to make your decisions.

36
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:05,650
Do everything based on the numbers.

37
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:09,030
There's great data somewhere out there
that's going to determine exactly what's

38
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,570
right for you,
all you have to do is find it.
