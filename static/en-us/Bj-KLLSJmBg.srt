1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,660
Most marketing plans will start with
a lot of what we learned in lesson one,

2
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:07,030
like who's your audience?

3
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:10,480
Who are the personas, or
what segments are you going to focus on?

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,870
You'll consider your competitive
analysis and your value proposition.

5
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:17,480
So now we've identified
our marketing goals,

6
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:20,150
we can focus on creating
our distribution plan.

7
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:22,870
The distribution plan
will focus on how and

8
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:25,980
where we're going to reach
our potential customers.

9
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:29,660
Now of course, we're not trying to
make a full marketing plan that

10
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:33,690
the chief marketing officer at
a Fortune 500 company might make.

11
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:37,200
But we try to focus on the most
effective parts of the plan, that

12
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,080
will help you figure out your action
plan to take your product to market.

13
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:43,500
But first, we need to do some research.

14
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,220
There are a few tools and

15
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:49,110
different options we'll go over to
help you conduct market research.

16
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:53,510
The goal is to look for insights that'll
allow us to select some starting points,

17
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:55,510
not to come up with
a super elaborate plan.

18
00:00:56,540 --> 00:01:01,430
Remember marketing is all about making
a hypothesis, testing the market, and

19
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:02,740
then adjusting.

20
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:04,964
Be sure to write down your
hypothesis and results, so

21
00:01:04,964 --> 00:01:07,500
you that you learn what worked and
what didn't work.

22
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,250
Now we're going to go ahead and

23
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:12,770
use Ebarknet as our research example
when we talk about different tools.

24
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:15,410

along with your own app, or

25
