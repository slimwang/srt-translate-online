1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,380
So let's look at these features to see what would be

2
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:06,170
the perfect feature list for Debbie. Bill splitting. That would definitely be

3
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:08,820
one of them, because Debbie is very money conscious, so she'd

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:13,350
want to split the bill. delivery, definitely, because Debbie doesn't have a car.

5
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:15,570
So definitely not pickup, because she doesn't have a car, so

6
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:18,980
there's no way she could go pick up a pizza. Coupons definitely,

7
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:22,490
because she is very value conscious. I don't think name of

8
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:25,440
the farmer, or photos of ingredients would be very useful for her,

9
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:29,260
that might be too extra, to much extra for her. And also multiple payment

10
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:30,720
options would be consistent with the bill

11
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,350
splitting, because different people might have different

12
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:35,190
payment options. So I think this would be a really good feature list that

13
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:37,880
would make Debbie feel like we made a pizza app that's just for her.
