00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,980
Okay, now that we have seen how register renaming works, let's try it ourselves.

2
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:08,010
So let's have a register renaming quiz. Okay so

3
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:13,300
we will have a RAT here that will tell us where the values for R1, R2,

4
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:18,680
R3, R4, R5, and R6 are. And over here we will have a sequence of instructions as

5
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:23,790
they're fetched. And then we will need to write in what's renamed. Okay. So

6
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:28,250
here we have the initial state of the RAT which is simply R1 is mapped to P1,

7
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:33,500
R2 to P2, etc. And here are our instructions. In order to help you get started,

8
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:37,740
I'm going to rename the first instruction. So after renaming,

9
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:42,880
it's still a multiplication. R2 and R2 are P2 and

10
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:47,420
P2. R2 is where we should put our value and, remember,

11
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:53,160
we need to rename it in the RAT, so it's going to be in P7.

12
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:57,940
So this is what this rename instruction looks like. Read the registers.

13
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:03,160
Physical registers P2 and P2, and put the result in P7. Now it's your turn.

14
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:08,330
You need to both tell me what's renamed and also update the RAT accordingly.
