1
00:00:00,312 --> 00:00:03,677
So you can add code to your app
to track how users view products,

2
00:00:03,677 --> 00:00:07,820
add products to the cart, checkout,
and finally purchase their products.

3
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:16,344
You use two classes to label this kind
of tracking, Product and ProductAction.

4
00:00:16,344 --> 00:00:19,396
The Product instances define a product,
and

5
00:00:19,396 --> 00:00:24,380
ProductAction instances define what
the user is doing with the product.

6
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:29,410
For example, let's say the user
adds a dinner to their cart.

7
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:33,000
So they've selected their dinner, and
now they're going to put it in the cart.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,630
You'd create product like this,
new Product().

9
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:39,320
Set the name, set the price,

10
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:43,040
set the variant, set the id,
and set the quantity.

11
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:48,050
And of course, you're app would
actually calculate all these values

12
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:50,410
at the point at which the user
added the product to the cart.

13
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:54,202
Then you'd create
the ProductAction like this.

14
00:00:54,202 --> 00:00:58,080
You just create ProductAction and
you specify the action.

15
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:02,850
In this case, ACTION_ADD indicates that
the user added the product to the cart.

16
00:01:04,065 --> 00:01:07,319
And after you create the Product and
the ProductAction,

17
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:10,860
you add them both to an event
to send to analytics, like this.

18
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:16,685
Get the tracker, create the event hit,
set the category, set the label.

19
00:01:16,685 --> 00:01:22,975
And here, we add the product, and
here we set the product action.

20
00:01:22,975 --> 00:01:24,675
So notice that you do these two things.

21
00:01:24,675 --> 00:01:28,225
You associate the product
action with the product

22
00:01:28,225 --> 00:01:31,615
when you create the event hit,
not when you create the product.
