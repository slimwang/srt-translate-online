1
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:04,160
Remember that the DOM is
a big tree as a result.

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:08,650
This means that elements will end up
inside one another, another way of saying

3
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:12,170
this is that elements end up
within the bounds of each other

4
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:13,790
because of this relationship.

5
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:19,900
The size of a child element can and
will be affected by its parent elements.

6
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:22,560
In many cases you will have
a large number of child elements

7
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,950
grouped inside one parent element.

8
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:27,570
These parent elements
are sometimes called containers.

9
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:30,810
And they can be pretty useful for
sizing boxes.

10
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:31,900
Take this example.

11
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:34,860
There is a child element
inside of a container.

12
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:36,100
Okay, cool.

13
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:40,500
And let's say that I change the width
of the container to be 400 pixels.

14
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:43,680
Now look at the width of the child.

15
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,190
It's 400 pixels.

16
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:48,970
In this case the constraint is
the width of the parent container.

17
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:52,442
The parent is four hundred pixels wide
and so the child stretches out to

18
00:00:52,442 --> 00:00:57,330
400 pixels of course if the parent had
padding then the child would be smaller.

19
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,250
In other cases you might want
to child element to be sized

20
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:03,130
relative to a parent.

21
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:05,960
For instance you might
want this child to take up

22
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,940
half the width of the container.

23
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:10,490
For that you have percentages.

24
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:14,630
First let's change the width of
the child from 400 pixels to 100%.

25
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:18,699
Okay, nothing changed, that makes sense.

26
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:25,400
By default block elements are as wide as
possible but now let's change it to 50%.

27
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,170
Check it out,
now it's half the width of the parent.

28
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:30,620
You can see that it's 200 pixels wide.

29
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:33,600
Remember, percentages
are always calculated

30
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,679
in relationship to immediate parents.
