1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,940
And the answer here is yes; player 1 can always win this game here that I gave you.

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:09,610
And 1 strategy for player 1 to do this, for example,

3
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:13,070
is to move this piece over here to here.

4
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:18,100
Now it's player 2's turn, and player 1 is now threatening to win in the next move

5
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:21,040
by moving this piece here to this piece here.

6
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:25,100
Now, player 2 could try and block this vertex here,

7
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:28,680
but player 2 can only do this with this piece here.

8
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,410
If player 2 were to move his or her piece over here,

9
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:37,510
then player 1, in the next move could, however, move this piece here to that vertex.

10
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:42,180
So no matter what player 2 does, player 1 will win in the next move

11
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:44,640
by either moving this piece here to that vertex,

12
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,120
or being able to move this piece here to that vertex.

13
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,250
Player 2 could also use this piece here to block this vertex down here,

14
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:53,410
but that would still keep this 1 here free,

15
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:58,160
and player 2 also cannot reach any of the vertices that would let player 2 win.

16
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:02,730
So for this initial configuration here, player 1 can always force a win.

17
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:08,160
Now, if you figured out that quiz yourself, you should be very, very proud of yourself.

18
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:10,910
Asking this question: "Can player 1 force a win?"

19
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:14,550
for a given instance of Roadblock on a graph with end vertices

20
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:18,160
is provably harder than any problem in NP.

21
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:21,940
Which means that this problem requires exponential time to solve,

22
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:24,510
even if P were equal to NP.

23
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:28,540
So even if you showed this, or had a nondeterministic gram available

24
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:31,860
to solve this problem, you would still require exponential time.

25
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,990
And that is why Roadblock is 1 example for a game,

26
00:01:34,990 --> 99:59:59,999
or asking a question about a game, that is harder to solve than anything in NP.
