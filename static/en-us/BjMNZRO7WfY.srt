1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,394
The 1st thing that I'm going to, in trying to simplify this expression, is to

2
00:00:04,406 --> 00:00:08,523
look at each of the terms and figure out if I can squish it down at all. So

3
00:00:08,535 --> 00:00:12,577
first, we have 15x squared, there's nothing that I can do to make that more

4
00:00:12,589 --> 00:00:16,857
simple on its own, so I'm just going to rewrite it. Then 3x to the 7th, same

5
00:00:16,869 --> 00:00:21,409
thing. Then I come to. Negative 7x times 2x. Now, there are definitely some

6
00:00:21,421 --> 00:00:26,058
factors here that I can combine. If I rearrange the order of these things I can

7
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:30,625
put negative 7 and 2 next to each other and then the x's at the end. Negative 7

8
00:00:30,637 --> 00:00:35,233
times 2 is negative 14, so I'll have a coefficient of negative 14. And then we

9
00:00:35,245 --> 00:00:40,062
have times x times x and we know that x times x is just. x to the 2nd power. So

10
00:00:40,074 --> 00:00:44,868
I can write that as well. Moving on we have negative 4 times 2x. We can again

11
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:49,933
combine the constant factors. So you have minus 8x, negative 5 times 4, 5 times

12
00:00:49,945 --> 00:00:54,597
4 is 20. So we have negative 20 plus x times 3. We could just rearrange the

13
00:00:54,609 --> 00:00:59,148
order of those two and then we have 3 times x. Which is just 3x, so plus 3x.

14
00:00:59,249 --> 00:01:03,744
Great now each of the terms in and of itself is as simplified as it can get. The

15
00:01:03,756 --> 00:01:08,329
next step is to figure out which terms are like terms. I'm also going to already

16
00:01:08,341 --> 00:01:12,455
start writing like terms next to each other in a modified version of the

17
00:01:12,467 --> 00:01:17,595
equation. We have 2x squared terms, only 1x to the 7th term, 2x to the 1st terms

18
00:01:17,607 --> 00:01:22,385
and 1 constant term. Now I just need to combine the terms that I know are like

19
00:01:22,397 --> 00:01:27,215
terms. Remember that we add the coefficients of like terms together and then

20
00:01:27,227 --> 00:01:32,125
multiply by the variable. 15 minus 14 is 1, so we have 1 times x squared or just

21
00:01:32,302 --> 00:01:36,583
x squared, 3x to the 7th is on its own, it's not combined with anything else.

22
00:01:36,683 --> 00:01:40,901
Negative 8 plus 3 is negative 5, times the variable x, and then we have our

23
00:01:40,913 --> 00:01:45,509
constant term. So this right here is our final answer. Our long, not very pretty

24
00:01:45,521 --> 00:01:49,589
expression, has been squished down to be something much more managable.
