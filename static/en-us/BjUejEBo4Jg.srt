00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,381
>> These three equations all graph parabolas. Even though they might not quite

2
00:00:04,381 --> 00:00:08,752
look like it right now. With a little bit of rearranging though, all of these

3
00:00:08,752 --> 00:00:13,233
can be put into that general form for the equation of a parabola. Which you'll

4
00:00:13,233 --> 00:00:17,695
remember, is y equals a x squared plus b x plus c, where a is not equal to zero.

5
00:00:17,696 --> 00:00:22,012
Now this first equation, 3 x squared plus 3 x minus 7 equals zero, does not

6
00:00:22,012 --> 00:00:26,617
contain a y variable. The only variable it has is x. So this is just an equation

7
00:00:26,617 --> 00:00:30,962
that we can solve for x. But it's not something that we can plot. There's no

8
00:00:30,962 --> 00:00:35,373
information here about y that would let us graph on a coordinate plane. Or at

9
00:00:35,373 --> 00:00:39,954
least, not on the kind of coordinate plane that we've been interested in. With

10
00:00:39,954 --> 00:00:44,504
two variables. This equation actually already is in standard form. The y just

11
00:00:44,504 --> 00:00:49,257
happens to be on the right side, and the other expression on the left side. But

12
00:00:49,257 --> 00:00:53,988
you can see that A, equals negative 1. B, the second coefficient is 5, and C is

13
00:00:53,988 --> 00:00:58,676
negative 6. This one is also in standard form. We have A equals 1, B equals 0,

14
00:00:58,676 --> 00:01:03,359
and C equals 1. However, the only requirement we have, about general form Was

15
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,347
that a couldn't be 0. Either of the other two constants can be and will still

16
00:01:07,347 --> 00:01:11,273
get a parabola, I'll show you the graphs for all of these in a second. But first

17
00:01:11,273 --> 00:01:15,173
let's look at this last equation briefly. The only thing that is preventing it

18
00:01:15,173 --> 00:01:18,886
from being in this general form is the negative sign in front of the y. If we

19
00:01:18,886 --> 00:01:22,666
just multiplied both sides of the equation, by negative 1 and rearrange the

20
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:26,326
terms on the right hand side, we end up with an equation of a parabola in the

21
00:01:26,326 --> 00:01:31,425
form of. We can recognize. Y equals X squared minus 2X plus 1. Now let's pick up

22
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:36,230
these graphs. This third parabola down here is produced by tehe equation y

23
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:41,387
equals negative x squared plus 5X minus 6. This purple corresponds to Y equals X

24
00:01:41,387 --> 00:01:45,947
squared plus one. And the orangeish yellow one of y equals x squared minus 2x

25
00:01:45,947 --> 00:01:49,962
plus 1. Now just take a second here and think about what's different about these

26
00:01:49,962 --> 00:01:54,070
graphs and what's different about their equations. Just form some ideas in your

27
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:57,997
head and keep them in mind for later. We'll keep revisiting a lot of different

28
00:01:57,997 --> 00:02:01,737
kinds of parabolas. And of course the differences in their equations that

29
00:02:01,737 --> 00:02:02,460
produce them.
