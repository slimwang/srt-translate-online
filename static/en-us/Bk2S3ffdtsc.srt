1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So, we took our network with RT and L. We summed out over R.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
That gives us a new network with T and L

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
with these conditional probability tables.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
And now we want to do a join over T and L

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:25,000
and give us a new table with the joint probability of P(T, L).

6
00:00:25,000 --> 99:59:59,999
And that table is going to look like this.
