00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
[Thrun] And the answer is 3200cm or 32 meters.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:15,000
And to see, we transform this equation over here so that the range, Z, is on the left side.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
With this new equation we can just plug in the known quantities.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:26,000
F is 40mm, x is 2mm, and upper caps X is 160cm.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 99:59:59,999
We work this out as 160cm by 20, which gives us 3200cm.
