1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
These two elements over here are called the lower quartile and guess what--the upper quartile.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
And in fact this range in between the upper quartile minus the lower one is called the interquartile range.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
So this range is the data we used to calculate things such as the

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
mean and data outside this range are the north.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
This is a simple but often very effective outlier removal technique that gives results extremely

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
that often are attributed to things other than what you're trying to understand.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Obviously this works well because there's exactly 11 items in our data.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
If there were only 10 items, you would've to shift this element around and you'll break a little bit

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
of the symmetry but that's not a big deal because most of the results are very large.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Now assuming it works for 11, give me the next number up that also works.
