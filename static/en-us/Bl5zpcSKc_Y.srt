1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The best answer is that it does not provide any authentication.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
It does establish a shared key,

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
but it's a shared key with some unknown entity.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
It's may be really providing no benefit,

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
but I would say that at least establishing the shared key means

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
now you've got a channel with some entity that's encrypted,

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
and if someone is eavesdropping on that channel--

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
you're only worried about a passive adversary--

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
they might be able to eavesdrop on that channel, but you do have a secure key established.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
You don't know that it's with the right server.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
If you there's an active adversary, this definitely provides no benefit,

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
because the active adversary can do the attack in the middle,

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
impersonate the server, establish the key,

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
and that's the one who has the shared key instead of the server that you intend to talk to.

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
If it's a passive adversary, that assumes the message actually does get to the right place,

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
so it provides some security against the passive adversary,

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
who can't intercept or inject new messages.

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
It allows you to establish that key, but doesn't provide any authentication.

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I think the 3rd answer is the best.

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
One could make arguments for either the 2nd or the 4th.

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Don't be upset if you had good arguments for those,

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
and I should emphasize that this establishes a secured shared key

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
only against a passive adversary even without worrying about the authentication

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
since an active adversary can interfere with the key that is established.

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
For this protocol to provide a meaningful benefit,

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,000
it's necessary that the client actually knows this KUs value or has a way to check it

27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
before accepting that this is the server that she intends to talk with.
