1
00:00:00,202 --> 00:00:02,518
And of course it stops. So, no, is the right

2
00:00:02,518 --> 00:00:04,378
answer. But the bizarre thing is, itâ€™s going

3
00:00:04,378 --> 00:00:06,149
to have an angle, like this one over here,

4
00:00:06,149 --> 00:00:12,984
this might be 101.374819 and so on. And

5
00:00:12,984 --> 00:00:16,526
this number truly has probability zero. So

6
00:00:16,526 --> 00:00:18,632
whatever the outcome is, that specific

7
00:00:18,632 --> 00:00:21,590
outcome will be unlikely, so unlikely as

8
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:23,436
probability zero. And this is one of the

9
00:00:23,436 --> 00:00:25,404
bizarre things about probability when you

10
00:00:25,404 --> 00:00:27,819
go to continue spaces. In continuous

11
00:00:27,819 --> 00:00:31,254
distributions, every outcome has probability

12
00:00:31,254 --> 00:00:34,285
zero. And that might sound entirely counterintuitive

13
00:00:34,285 --> 00:00:38,285
and it is, but it is important to understand.
