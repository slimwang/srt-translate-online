Let's clear these fractions by multiplying through by 40. I'm going to multiply

2
00:00:04,181 --> 00:00:08,235
the left by 40 and the right by 40. I've multiplied this side by 40 and notice I

3
00:00:08,247 --> 00:00:12,183
didn't need to multiply these inside terms because eventually, this will get

4
00:00:12,195 --> 00:00:16,352
distributed to each of them. I've put parentheses around the right side because

5
00:00:16,364 --> 00:00:20,785
I needed to distribute the 40 to both these terms. 40 times a 4th is 40 4th or

6
00:00:20,797 --> 00:00:26,355
10. I know that because 40 divided by 4 makes 10. This also makes sense because

7
00:00:26,367 --> 00:00:31,705
I can figure out 40 over 1, and then divide 40 and 4 both by 4. And I'll get 10

8
00:00:31,717 --> 00:00:37,090
over 1, or 10. Now, I'm going to distribute or multiply this 10 into this inside

9
00:00:37,102 --> 00:00:42,272
parentheses. I have 10 times negative 2 5th y here, and I have 10 times 1, here.

10
00:00:42,947 --> 00:00:48,057
I can reduce a common factor of 5 in the numerator and the denominator, so I get

11
00:00:48,069 --> 00:00:52,912
negative 4 over 1 or negative 4y. And then, I have my 10 on the end. Notice how

12
00:00:52,924 --> 00:00:58,080
both times I reduced before I multiplied. Usually, it's easier to reduce common

13
00:00:58,092 --> 00:01:03,307
factors before you multiply. Try doing that on this side. If you carry out the

14
00:01:03,319 --> 00:01:07,995
distribution on the right side, what terms would you get down here? Be sure you

15
00:01:08,007 --> 00:01:12,172
enter a number and a variable in the first box and a number in the second box.

16
00:01:12,276 --> 00:01:16,659
You'll also want to include both of their signs. If the term is negative, be

17
00:01:16,671 --> 00:01:20,426
sure to type a negative sign in front of your answer. Good luck.
