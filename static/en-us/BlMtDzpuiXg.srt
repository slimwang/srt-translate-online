00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The first part is our little note to ourselves. This is a function value.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Note that there's little repetition between the abstract syntax tree marker

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
for this is a function element and also this is a function value.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
We could have made them different. It's our choice when we're writing the interpreter.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
The next thing to pass in is the parameters, the next thing is the body,

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
and the last thing is the environment in which the function was defined.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 99:59:59,999
And we're done. This is how we do a function definition.
