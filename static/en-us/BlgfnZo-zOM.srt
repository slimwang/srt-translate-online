00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,176
It's easiest to complete the square when solving a quadratic equation, if this

2
00:00:04,176 --> 00:00:09,532
quadratic is not factorable and if a is equal to 1 and b is even. We want b to

3
00:00:09,532 --> 00:00:13,128
be even because eventually we're going to add b over 2 squared to both sides of

4
00:00:13,128 --> 00:00:17,954
the equation. If b is even, then we know that this b over 2 squared ends up

5
00:00:17,954 --> 00:00:23,499
being an integer rather than a fraction. So, once we know a equals 1 and b is

6
00:00:23,499 --> 00:00:28,026
even. We can move this constant term to the other side of the equation. This

7
00:00:28,026 --> 00:00:32,828
will put the equation in this form. Next, we add b over 2 squared to both sides

8
00:00:32,828 --> 00:00:37,400
of our equation. This allows us to rewrite the left side as a perfect square.

9
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:41,308
And then we can continue solving using our square root method. When solving the

10
00:00:41,308 --> 00:00:44,380
problems throughout this lesson. Use these steps as a guide to help you

11
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:48,630
complete the square. Try solving this first practice problem. Move this

12
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:53,466
negative 6 to the other side, and then complete the square and solve for x. Be

13
00:00:53,466 --> 00:00:57,710
sure you enter your answer using the plus or minus symbol. Good luck.
