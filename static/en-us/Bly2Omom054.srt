1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,990
Since each column has to add to 50, these are the frequencies for the students

2
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:10,870
that said no in each group, and these are the marginal totals. Our goal now, is

3
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:16,180
to see if there's independence between these groups: hit, smashed and control.

4
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:21,620
By independent, we mean there's no consistent predictable relationship between

5
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:25,920
them. Our null hypothesis is that students' response for whether or not they

6
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:31,740
saw broken glass, is independent of the wording used in the question. Whether

7
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:37,250
or not hit, smashed, or no question about the speed of the cars was used. Now,

8
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:42,050
what we have to do to show independence is to compare our observed values,

9
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:45,420
which are these, to the expected values.
