Lets try another plotting exercise. This time, I want you to create

2
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:06,450
a histogram of Facebook users based on their age. You should play

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:09,540
around with the bin width the breaks and the labels. The grader

4
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:12,490
will accept any answer here, but I want you to compare your

5
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:15,860
code and your observations of your histogram to those in the solution

6
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:19,940
video. After you create your histogram, think about what you notice and

7
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:22,420
remember that you can create a couple plots so don't just stick

8
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:25,450
to one. Figure out which pot reveals the most information to you.
