00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,040
Today I'm talking with Graham Grieve

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:08,210
the project leader of the global
HL-7 Fire Standardization Effort.

3
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:09,840
He's here all the way from Melbourne,

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,800
Australia for
an HL-7 meeting this week in Atlanta.

5
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:16,271
Graham thank you very much for
taking the time to be with me.

6
00:00:16,271 --> 00:00:19,038
I know this is a busy week for you.

7
00:00:19,038 --> 00:00:22,900
Perhaps we could begin by you
discussing your background.

8
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:24,680
>> So I qualify as a biochemist,

9
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:28,490
worked in a clinical lab,
did a bit of research.

10
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:32,509
And then I ended up as a lab
systems vendor, tech lead and

11
00:00:32,509 --> 00:00:35,140
got more involved in
interoperability and HL-7 and

12
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:39,880
eventually created my own consulting
compan to do HL-7 consulting.

13
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:43,010
>> So beginning in 2011,

14
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:46,950
you invented the whole idea of fire
can you tell us how that happened?

15
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:52,140
>> We were getting to a point
where the HL-7 was a crossroads.

16
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:56,705
We had a lot of existing standards
that no longer reflected what people

17
00:00:56,705 --> 00:01:00,810
wanted to do, and it was a lot of
unhappiness in the user community.

18
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:04,447
And we said well,
what if we did something like this?

19
00:01:04,447 --> 00:01:05,807
And it grew into Fire and

20
00:01:05,807 --> 00:01:10,169
it was a bit of a surprise to me as much
as everyone else that it was so popular.

21
00:01:10,169 --> 00:01:13,173
But it's been certainly
keeping me busy ever since.

22
00:01:13,173 --> 00:01:17,540
>> By all accounts the growth of Fire
adoption is nothing short of phenomenal.

23
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:22,340
Could you give us an idea of how it's
being adopted not just here in the US

24
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:24,305
but around the world?

25
00:01:24,305 --> 00:01:26,930
>> Well, we expected that initially
while it's still a trial,

26
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:31,610
beta standard which it still is, that
we would have a little bit of adoption

27
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:36,540
particularly in companies doing health
data exchange in the social web area.

28
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:39,480
But it's just been crazy.

29
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:43,640
We have government programs,
large government programs and

30
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:46,750
other insane programs, other national
governments around the world.

31
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:52,560
They have big vendors creating
consortiums like Argonaut and HSPC.

32
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:56,020
Lots of little companies and

33
00:01:56,020 --> 00:02:00,316
institutions creating
solutions based on Fire.

34
00:02:00,316 --> 00:02:04,222
We have thousands of
happening at the moment.

35
00:02:04,222 --> 00:02:09,810
>> So I believe the ballot on Fire as
a second version of a draft standard for

36
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:14,110
trial use was just conducted,
or is being conducted.

37
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:21,000
Where are we in the whole evolution
of Fire to a full HL-7 standard.

38
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,690
>> So
we have balanced it to standard in May.

39
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:28,330
And then we just published last
week in September, the second,

40
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:29,330
formal second version.

41
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:36,004
It's an ongoing process but
we started with a very initial draft.

42
00:02:36,004 --> 00:02:40,165
And then this is I think of this is
the first fully usable version and

43
00:02:40,165 --> 00:02:42,406
we're calling it a trial version.

44
00:02:42,406 --> 00:02:47,961
So we can still introduce new content
and refine the core standard but

45
00:02:47,961 --> 00:02:53,823
increasingly, we're going to treat
the core as a normative standard.

46
00:02:53,823 --> 00:02:59,466
And I think the next version will
represent a stable version for

47
00:02:59,466 --> 00:03:04,163
implementors to base the core
of clinical stuff on.

48
00:03:04,163 --> 00:03:08,797
But it's an ongoing process and we'll be
very driven by the feedback we get from

49
00:03:08,797 --> 00:03:13,291
the community about that, which is why
we're not saying right now how it will

50
00:03:13,291 --> 00:03:16,870
unfold, we don't want to
dictate to the community.

51
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:21,226
>> Well, I've heard numbers in terms of
the ultimate number of Fire resources,

52
00:03:21,226 --> 00:03:25,726
anywhere from 100 to 200, I suppose
nobody actually knows at this point.

53
00:03:25,726 --> 00:03:28,260
>> Well,
we have been a success off today.

54
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:31,198
And we sort of said 200
was a nice the number.

55
00:03:31,198 --> 00:03:35,229
We didn't want to have thousands or
hundreds of thousands,

56
00:03:35,229 --> 00:03:38,160
which were possible choices.

57
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,720
We haven't got a fixed number
that we're going to get to.

58
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,690
>> So
that leads directly to a topic you and

59
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:45,452
I have discussed when we
were together in the past.

60
00:03:45,452 --> 00:03:48,759
To me obviously the use
of Web services and

61
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:54,148
JSON objects these technologies
that are so common in other domains

62
00:03:54,148 --> 00:03:59,457
is very interesting I think very
important to the success of Fire.

63
00:03:59,457 --> 00:04:04,374
But perhaps even more interesting is
your mission of not allowing Fire

64
00:04:04,374 --> 00:04:07,789
to become an overly complex
standard like many of

65
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:10,570
the predecessor standards in HL-7.

66
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:11,235
How is that going?

67
00:04:11,235 --> 00:04:14,430
That must be a very tough thing to do.

68
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:17,029
>> It's an interesting thing to try and
do.

69
00:04:17,029 --> 00:04:20,350
We have constant pressures to try and

70
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:24,220
simplify it and constant pressures
to try and complicate it.

71
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:27,040
And we've got to strike
a balance between

72
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,390
handling the things people need
to do and not letting it get so

73
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:33,420
complicated no one can
do what they need to do.

74
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:38,199
Most of the success in that area
comes from the processes that we

75
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:42,077
laid down at the start
around solid engagement with

76
00:04:42,077 --> 00:04:47,052
the implementation community and
and being responsive to them.

77
00:04:47,052 --> 00:04:51,615
And we grade the successive parts of
the standard not by publication but

78
00:04:51,615 --> 00:04:55,876
by adoption and that's a very
important metric that drives a wider

79
00:04:55,876 --> 00:05:00,980
consideration of the perspective than
just how do we produce a standard?

80
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:04,646
>> So the people who only
have to use this standard and

81
00:05:04,646 --> 00:05:09,274
implement it have a big voice in
what the standard looks like and

82
00:05:09,274 --> 00:05:13,924
it isn't just designed by I'll
use the term standards geeks.

83
00:05:13,924 --> 00:05:16,702
I hope that isn't a pejorative term.

84
00:05:16,702 --> 00:05:18,370
>> It's a very common term.

85
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:20,680
That's exactly what we're
trying to achieve so

86
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:25,990
that you can define on
the standard as a committee.

87
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:29,830
But until it's been adopted and
proven in practice,

88
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,970
it's always going to be draft.

89
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:36,917
>> So as you look out toward
the future after the final version of

90
00:05:36,917 --> 00:05:41,864
Fire is published, how do you
see it continuing to evolve and

91
00:05:41,864 --> 00:05:45,380
adapt to an ever changing world?

92
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:50,340
>> Any community goes through a phases
of storming, norming, conforming.

93
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:54,885
And clearly the core of
the specification is moving into

94
00:05:54,885 --> 00:05:59,527
the norming phase and
will become more and more stable and

95
00:05:59,527 --> 00:06:02,442
growth will happen at the margins.

96
00:06:02,442 --> 00:06:07,299
And then some point where you'll
say to the standard has now

97
00:06:07,299 --> 00:06:09,154
got as big as it can be.

98
00:06:09,154 --> 00:06:13,494
It's no longer sufficient to keep
growing and to keep pushing it along and

99
00:06:13,494 --> 00:06:16,231
it's time to start
considering a new choice.

100
00:06:16,231 --> 00:06:21,429
I kind of thought just looking at
the past record of standards that

101
00:06:21,429 --> 00:06:27,867
a development lifespan might be 15 years
or so and we're sort of 5 of 15 now.

102
00:06:27,867 --> 00:06:29,878
And then at that point,

103
00:06:29,878 --> 00:06:34,917
you start to say maybe it's no
longer worth keeping going.

104
00:06:34,917 --> 00:06:35,706
That's ten years out.

105
00:06:35,706 --> 00:06:36,845
We'll see how we go.

106
00:06:36,845 --> 00:06:40,425
But at some point, you go it's
just not worth keeping going.

107
00:06:40,425 --> 00:06:41,585
>> So one final question.

108
00:06:41,585 --> 00:06:46,300
So what would you say to the students
taking this cours about Fire and

109
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:50,601
about how they might both think
about it, use it, and look for

110
00:06:50,601 --> 00:06:53,095
opportunities that Fire creates?

111
00:06:53,095 --> 00:06:57,442
>> Fire's really different to all the
other approaches we've had because it

112
00:06:57,442 --> 00:06:59,995
allows you to modularize
your solutions and

113
00:06:59,995 --> 00:07:04,136
to create capabilities that can be
used in all sorts of different ways.

114
00:07:04,136 --> 00:07:09,019
And so in the long term,
it's going to represent decomposing

115
00:07:09,019 --> 00:07:13,620
large systems into more
interoperable small systems.

116
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:16,879
And there's going to be
a lot of opportunity for

117
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:22,112
changing the health care system,
not IT but in healthcare itself driven

118
00:07:22,112 --> 00:07:27,807
by the capabilities of the decomposition
and the flexibility that it offers.

119
00:07:27,807 --> 00:07:30,706
We didn't write Fire because we
wanted to have a nice standard.

120
00:07:30,706 --> 00:07:34,504
We wrote Fire because we wanted the
implementations to drive a better health

121
00:07:34,504 --> 00:07:35,226
care system.

122
00:07:35,226 --> 00:07:40,185
And that's going to be our main
focus going forwards is we'll round

123
00:07:40,185 --> 00:07:43,499
out the standard and
finalize the standard.

124
00:07:43,499 --> 00:07:48,526
But our main focus is going to be how
do we drive that to get a health care

125
00:07:48,526 --> 00:07:54,508
system that's more nimble, more patient
focused, more responsive to change,

126
00:07:54,508 --> 00:07:58,521
because the existing system's
pretty pretty rigid.

127
00:07:58,521 --> 00:07:59,940
>> Well, I not only want to thank you.

128
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:02,960
I want to tell you how much I
admire you and what you're doing.

129
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,403
I'm a lot older than you are.

130
00:08:05,403 --> 00:08:09,678
I'm not even sure you were born
when I got involved in health IT.

131
00:08:09,678 --> 00:08:13,895
And I never thought I'd actually
live to see what we're seeing,

132
00:08:13,895 --> 00:08:18,726
which I agree with you completely is
an absolutely workable implementable

133
00:08:18,726 --> 00:08:21,027
deployable solution to and

134
00:08:21,027 --> 00:08:25,267
to actually making health data
a tool for improving health care.

135
00:08:25,267 --> 00:08:27,790
So congratulations, thank you so much.

136
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:28,290
>> Thanks.
