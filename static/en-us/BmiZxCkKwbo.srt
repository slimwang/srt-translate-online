00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:04,190
One of the most important and simplest
ways to ensure your system is secure

2
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:07,270
is to keep your software up
to date with new releases.

3
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:10,800
Because Linux systems focus on
reliability and they run a variety of

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,930
complex applications that have numerous
dependencies of their own, most Linux

5
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:19,320
distributions do not auto-update
the software installed on the system.

6
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,780
You'll need to do this yourself and

7
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:25,380
test your apps to make sure any recent
updates don't break your application.

8
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:28,410
The first step to upgrading your
installed software is to update your

9
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:29,570
package source list.

10
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,950
We do this with the command
sudo apt-get update.

11
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:37,250
See the sudo there?

12
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:39,160
We have to run this as the root user.

13
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:45,236
The update command will run through all
of the repositories we saw within our

14
00:00:45,236 --> 00:00:49,940
etc/app/sources.list file, and it will
check to see what all software is

15
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:52,690
available and
what those version numbers are.

16
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:55,720
This command doesn't actually
perform any changes to the software

17
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:56,940
on your system.

18
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:00,720
It just makes sure your system is
aware of the latest information stored

19
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:03,300
within all of these repositories
that you're making use of.
