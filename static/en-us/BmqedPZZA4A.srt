1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
[Narrator] Now why do we have to interleave

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
planning and execution?

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Mostly because of properties of the

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
environment that make it difficult to deal with.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The most important one is

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
if the environment is

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
stochastic.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
That is if we don't know for sure what

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
an action is going to do.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
If we know what everything is going to do,

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
we can plan it our right from the start, but if we don't, we have to

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
be able to deal with contingencies of

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
say I tried to move forward,

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
and the wheels slipped, and I went someplace else,

15
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
or the brakes might skid, or

16
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
if we're walking our feet don't go 100% straight,

17
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
or consider the problem of traffic lights.

18
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
If the traffic light is red,

19
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
then the result of the action of go

20
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
forward through the intersection

21
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
is bound to be different than if the traffic light is green.

22
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Another difficulty we have to deal with

23
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
is multi-agent environments.

24
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
If there are other cars and people that can get in our way,

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
we have to plan about what they're going to do,

26
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
and we have to react when they do something unexpected,

27
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
and we can only know that

28
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
at execution time, not at planning time.

29
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
The other big problem is with

30
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
partial observability.

31
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Suppose we've come up with a plan

32
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
to go from A to S to F to B.

33
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
That plan looks like it will work,

34
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
but we know that at S,

35
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
the road to F is sometimes closed,

36
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
and there will be a sign there

37
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
telling us whether it's closed or not,

38
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
but when we start off, we can't read that sign.

39
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
So that's partial observability.

40
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Another way to look at it is when we start off

41
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
we don't know what state we're in.

42
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
We know we're in A, but we don't know

43
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
if we're in A in the state where

44
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
the road is closed or if we're in A

45
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
in the state where the road is open,

46
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
and it's not until we get to S

47
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
that we discover what state we're actually in,

48
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
and then we know if we can continue along

49
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
that route or if we have to take a detour south.

50
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Now in addition to these properties of

51
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
the environment, we can also have

52
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
difficulty because of

53
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
lack of knowledge on our own part.

54
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,000
So if some model of the world is unknown,

55
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
that is, for example,

56
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
we have map or GPS software

57
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
that's inaccurate or incomplete,

58
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
then we won't be able to

59
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
executive a straight-line plan,

60
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
and, similarly, often we want to deal with

61
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
a case where the plans have to be

62
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
hierarchical.

63
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
And, certainly, a plan like this

64
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
is at a very high level.

65
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
We can't really execute the action

66
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
of going from A to S

67
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
when we're in a car.

68
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
All the actions that we can actually execute

69
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
are things like turn the steering wheel a little bit

70
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
to the right, press on the pedal a little bit more.

71
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
So those are the low-level steps of the plan,

72
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
but those aren't sketched out in detail when we start,

73
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
when we only have the high-level parts of the plan,

74
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
and then it's during execution that we schedule

75
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
the rest of the low-level parts of the plan.

76
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Now most of these difficulties can be

77
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
addressed by changing our point of view.

78
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Instead of planning in the space of world states,

79
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
we plan in the space of belief states.

80
00:03:16,000 --> 99:59:59,999
To understand that let's look at a state.
