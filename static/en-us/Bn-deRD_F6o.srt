1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:05,570
Now remember earlier when we
were talking about stock value,

2
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:07,620
or I should say company value.

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:12,170
And we looked at a way to compute
company value based on dividends.

4
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:15,970
So companies pay regularly,
many companies,

5
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:19,490
not all, dividends to their owners.

6
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:21,210
And this can be worth a lot of money.

7
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:25,893
So a stock that's priced
at say around $100,

8
00:00:25,893 --> 00:00:32,706
can very often pay up to $1 or
$2 per year in dividends, or 1 or 2%.

9
00:00:32,706 --> 00:00:35,460
Some stocks pay even more than that.

10
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:38,100
Now dividends can have
a significant affect

11
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:43,250
on what happens to the actual price
of the stock, and here's why.

12
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:46,350
Suppose this stock is
trading at about $100.

13
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:49,569
And they announce,
on this date in the future,

14
00:00:49,569 --> 00:00:52,920
we're going to pay a $1 dividend.

15
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,880
So for every share of stock
that you own, you'll get $1.

16
00:00:55,880 --> 00:01:00,730
What do you think is going to happen to
the price of this stock between now and

17
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:02,950
the date of that dividend?

18
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:05,850
Let me give you a little bit
more information that might make

19
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:06,530
things simpler.

20
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:10,885
Let's suppose that the consensus
on the value of the company,

21
00:01:10,885 --> 00:01:14,820
by whatever means you've
determined that consensus,

22
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:18,210
is that the company is
worth $100 per share.

23
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:23,180
So on this date, in order to we get
that $1 dividend, we're going to have

24
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:28,147
one share of the company that people
think is worth $100 per share and

25
00:01:28,147 --> 00:01:29,490
we will have $1.

26
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:37,450
So on this date, we'll have one share of
a company supposedly worth $100 and $1.

27
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:40,180
So think about it.

28
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:44,670
What prices will we see
this stock converge to

29
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:48,930
on the day before the dividend is paid
and the day the dividend is paid?
