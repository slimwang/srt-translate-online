00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,080
>> Here's your first quiz question. In a world

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,110
where A can go left or right and B can

3
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:06,860
go left or right. What are the values that you

4
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:10,500
would put in the cells of this matrix? Again, this

5
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,740
is zero sum. So, these values are from A's

6
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:15,690
point of view and implicitly, there's we know what the

7
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:17,670
values are for B. So, we're just looking for the

8
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:20,240
values from A. Okay? Do you understand the quiz, Michael?

9
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:20,940
>> Yep.

10
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:22,670
>> Okay, so go.
