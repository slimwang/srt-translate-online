1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:01,569
So the first thing that you should do, in

2
00:00:01,569 --> 00:00:04,860
order to minimize network latency, is to minimize the

3
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:08,480
number of HTTP requests. And a major, major way

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,960
to do this, is to avoid page redirects. each

5
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:15,750
redirect can cause a DNS look-up, TCP connect, and

6
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:18,580
the sending of the actual HTTP request itself all

7
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:22,490
over again. HTTPS has even more round trips per

8
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:25,500
connection. So you're looking at high hundreds of milliseconds

9
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:29,050
per redirects, as a penalty, at least. If you

10
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:31,610
have a legitimate need for redirects, for example if

11
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:34,290
you've moved a resource, that's great, but use a

12
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:37,350
301 redirect if you can. Lots of browsers will

13
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:40,650
actually update links then. You also want to illuminate

14
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:44,250
render blocking resources, like waiting on multiple style sheets

15
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:46,830
or fonts of the like. Anything that forces the

16
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:50,650
browser to wait for another HTTP transaction to complete,

17
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:52,660
before it can render the app, is going to

18
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:56,060
be much more noticeable on mobile. So, combine and

19
00:00:56,060 --> 00:01:00,160
minify those style sheets kits. This also includes avoiding

20
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,300
blocking rendering by waiting for the download of JavaScript

21
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,710
files. If you can use async or defer on

22
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:08,810
script to let the content render as soon as

23
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:12,660
possible. In short, you want to prioritize the network

24
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:15,740
transactions or whatever you need to render the initial

25
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:20,710
page full of content. Make sure you're loading images on that first page first,

26
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:24,890
before ones that may be down in the bottom of the page. Get that first

27
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:29,170
page on the screen as quickly as possible. You should obsess over the network

28
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:31,150
page and the developer tools. To make

29
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:33,160
sure you're loading items in the correct order.
