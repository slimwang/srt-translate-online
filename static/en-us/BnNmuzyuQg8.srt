1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:02,980
The Android griddle plug in creates
a set of configurations for

2
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:04,120
each build variant.

3
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:08,540
This allows us to manage dependencies
independently for each of our variants.

4
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:12,140
So we'll have the usual compile and
run time configurations.

5
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:14,570
But we'll also have free compile and
free runtime.

6
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:15,510
And so on.

7
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:19,090
The free runtime configuration extends
the free compile configuration.

8
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:22,860
Just as compile extends runtime
when using the Java plugin.

9
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:26,270
Additionally, free compile configuration
extends the regular compile

10
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:27,470
configuration.

11
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:31,060
Which means our free variance will
include all of our default dependencies.

12
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:34,390
In addition to those added
to the free configurations.

13
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:37,630
It's probably likely that we would
want to enable ads in the free version

14
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:40,120
of our app, but not in the paid.

15
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:44,440
Utilizing Google's Ad Services requires
to depend on the Ad Services Library.

16
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:47,910
However we don't want to unnecessarily
bloat the paid version of our app

17
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:50,200
by including a library
that won't be needed.

18
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:53,450
To solve this problem we can simply
declare this dependency only for

19
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:54,550
the free version of our app.

20
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:56,540
As you can see here,

21
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:59,770
we've added a dependency to
the Google Play ad services.

22
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:02,620
But we've assigned it to
the free compile configuration.

23
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:05,640
That's really there is to declaring
variant specific dependencies.

24
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,830
But we've included a demo
in the course repository.

25
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:08,440
You should check it out.
