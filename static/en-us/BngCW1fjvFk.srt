1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:05,820
So we're trying to find where 8.94 falls on this distribution. So it looks likes

2
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:11,014
it's about here, so this z score is going to be really high. For this one the z

3
00:00:11,014 --> 00:00:15,954
score falls about here, which looks like it's still kind of in the center of the

4
00:00:15,954 --> 00:00:21,715
sampling distribution, so now if we calculate the actual z score... We'll do

5
00:00:21,715 --> 00:00:28,358
8.94 minus the population mean, which is also the mean of sample means. And then

6
00:00:28,358 --> 00:00:32,628
divide by this standard deviation of the sampling distribution. Now to keep

7
00:00:32,628 --> 00:00:37,748
things more precise, instead of using the rounded standard error, I'm going to

8
00:00:37,748 --> 00:00:42,240
put this in my calculator. It's okay if you used the rounded error. You should

9
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:48,305
have still gotten it right. So if we do it like this, we get about 10.06. Which

10
00:00:48,305 --> 00:00:53,922
is pretty big. And here if we calculate z-score. We'll say 8.35 minus the mean

11
00:00:53,922 --> 00:00:58,920
of the sampling distribution. Divided by the standard deviation of the sampling

12
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:06,260
distribution. So we get about 0.92. We're going to call this zees of en, zees of

13
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:08,473
l. So now what's next?
