00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,520
The correct answer is the food parameter in the

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:06,060
URL updates. Let's go ahead and see that in action.

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:08,570
Okay, you can see that we've already got food=steak in

4
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:10,010
the URL from the first time that we submitted the

5
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:12,460
form, and now when I click add for eggs

6
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:16,890
here, the parameter updates in the URL. Now, we've done

7
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:19,650
this before, but it's nice to have. A good refresher

8
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:21,770
because it's going to get a lit bit more complicated soon.
