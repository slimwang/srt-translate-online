00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,494
Psychologists make a distinction between three different types of affective

2
00:00:03,494 --> 00:00:07,922
experiences. We should first state that the word affect, is in an umbrella term

3
00:00:07,922 --> 00:00:11,208
used to cover all emotional experiences, including emotions, moods, and

4
00:00:11,208 --> 00:00:16,785
affective states. Let's start with emotions. Emotions are brief, sudden changes

5
00:00:16,785 --> 00:00:20,738
in our conscious experience and body that are responses to personally

6
00:00:20,738 --> 00:00:27,097
meaningful situations. We feel emotion about very specific situations. Such as

7
00:00:27,097 --> 00:00:31,507
when we fail an exam, get an A on an exam, break up with our significant other,

8
00:00:31,507 --> 00:00:37,025
or have something stolen from us. Emotions are very short lived, typically

9
00:00:37,025 --> 00:00:42,427
lasting no more than 30 seconds to 1 minute. At most. They focus our attention

10
00:00:42,427 --> 00:00:46,030
and guide our memory, perception, and decision making. Think about how you

11
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:49,280
learn if you're really angry or depressed, or the kind of buying decisions you

12
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:54,196
make when you're really happy, compared to when you're really sad. The actual

13
00:00:54,196 --> 00:00:58,356
experience of anger, disgust, happiness, or fear, for example, usually last

14
00:00:58,356 --> 00:01:03,223
only a short period of time. They can lead to other emotions, though. For

15
00:01:03,223 --> 00:01:07,240
example, sometimes we get angry at ourselves for feel jealous or embarrassed.
