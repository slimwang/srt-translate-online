1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,250
For this quiz, you're going to be putting your name and

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:07,520
your role to the top of your resume using the same technique James just used.

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:10,850
You'll start by replacing %data% and

4
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:16,710
HTML header name and HTML header role with your name and your role.

5
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:19,790
In this case, the role is the type of job your looking for.

6
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:21,590
So for me, I would have Web Developer.

7
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:27,810
You can find the strings HTMLheaderName and HTMLheaderRole within helper JS.

8
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:33,847
Once you're done, you will either append or prepend the formatted name and

9
00:00:33,847 --> 00:00:36,650
formatted role to the page header.

10
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:39,915
Now, append adds something to the end of HTML.

11
00:00:39,915 --> 00:00:42,690
While prepend adds something to the beginning of HTML.

12
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:46,000
For this quiz, you might need to experiment with append and

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,630
prepend to get a feel for both of them.

14
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:53,220
Once you see your name in roll appear on the page correctly, check this box.

15
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:55,920
And when you do it right, your resume should look something like this.
