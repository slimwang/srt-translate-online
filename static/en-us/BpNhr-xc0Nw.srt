00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So before we do the work in our Editor, I need

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
to teach you another little bit of HTML.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
So we've seen the value parameter on some form elements,

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
and let's talk about how we use it in the text element case.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
This is our normal text element that we've been using.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Now, of course, this will all be familiar to you:

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000


8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
And this part is new--this is a value attribute,

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
and this causes the text box, when we render it,

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
to have this "cool" as the default value.

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
So you can see, this might be useful for rendering our form

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
with the values that the user just typed in--

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
so they don't have to keep reentering things all the time.

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
And you can also use this to fill out form fields

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
with default values, if you know what the user is probably going to enter.

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Okay--so I hope you can see the direction we're heading.

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
We're going to populate our form s with what the user typed in.

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
So which of these little bits of HTML

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
is the correct for preserving the user's month?
