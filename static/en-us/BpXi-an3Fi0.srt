00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:05,490
So just to keep recap, we basically came up with the whole definition of how

2
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:09,160
the exposure triangle works, reminding that basically we are interested in

3
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:14,080
this simple math, where we want to be able to get the irradiance times the time,

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,370
and use that to generate the exposure.

5
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:21,110
Irradiance is controlled by the aperture opening, and by lowering the f

6
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:26,210
stop doubles the exposure as the aperture is open more.

7
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:30,740
And by lowering two f stop doubles depth of field.

8
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:34,130
So this is basically kind of the impact we're looking at throughout.

9
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:38,450
That by playing around with how the f stops change we can actually impact

10
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:42,880
the size of the aperture opening that impacts what the image would look like.

11
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:46,000
And sometimes by playing around with this, we can actually see impacts on

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,170
things like depth of field and similarly for shutters and stuff like that.

13
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:51,690
I've showed you many examples in this lecture for

14
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:55,560
you to kind of now take it in and play around with your own cameras.

15
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:59,160
Of course, not all cameras allow you to have this kind of control.

16
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:04,239
These days even mobile cell phone cameras do have some code available for you

17
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,600
to play around and change the aperture and shutter speeds and stuff like that.

18
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,570
And we'll try to make them available, but feel free to discuss them

19
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:13,440
amongst yourselves and find other examples of this kind of stuff.

20
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:13,990
Of course, most of

21
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:18,060
the examples I showed you were generated using high-end SLR cameras.

22
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:21,080
In the previous slide I talked about the change of aperture and

23
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,780
now of course exposure time controlled by shutter speed.

24
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:27,330
When you double this the time, the shutters open,

25
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:29,930
well your exposure is doubled also.

26
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:34,890
When you double T well it might actually also double motion blur.

27
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:38,660
And of course, when you're take ISO, you're doubling ISO basically needs

28
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:41,560
half the light to be able to generate a similar type of an image.
