1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,200
So in order to create the new
entry in our database,

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:05,590
we have to specify the name
variable as Rebecca Allen.

3
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:09,299
We also need to create the ForeignKey
relationship between Rebecca's address

4
00:00:09,299 --> 00:00:12,470
and the new employee variable that
we created in the previous line.
