00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,659
The two answers we get are negative 3.08 and 1.08. Here's how I found them. I

2
00:00:04,659 --> 00:00:09,381
found the first one by using a subtraction sign in here. So this is negative 1

3
00:00:09,381 --> 00:00:14,141
minus the square root of 13 over 3. And I found the second answer 1.08 by using

4
00:00:14,141 --> 00:00:18,816
the plus sign in here, negative 1 plus the root of 13 over 3. This means that

5
00:00:18,816 --> 00:00:23,606
our X intercepts are at -3.08, 0 and 1.08, 0. I would like to make one little

6
00:00:23,606 --> 00:00:28,780
change on here though. Since these are rounded answers, let's put approximately

7
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:33,774
equal to signs between these. These are approximate numbers, and if we wanted

8
00:00:33,774 --> 00:00:38,942
to, we could continue calculating out these infinitely long decimals by looking

9
00:00:38,942 --> 00:00:41,316
for their out and calculating these.
