1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Now again, of course, this is a bit debatable,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
but I think you will all agree that this one

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
here is actually super easy to solve shortest path on,

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
because let's say you start here, this is your mail station where you start.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
You go all the way here and then you have no other choice but to go here,

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
because you have to visit all those vertices, and then you go back.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
so there's not really difficult choices that you have to make

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
when you solve shortest path for this one here.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Now this one here is a little bit harder.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Let's say it doesn't really matter where you start out

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
because for a tour you can start out at any point

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
because you have to come back to it anyway.

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
And let's say you start out here and then you go up here

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
and then you already have your first choice to make,

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
so do you go this way or do you go that way?

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Well, probably you want to go that way, but actually

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
there are certain distances where you might want to go this way,

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
so you have to make a choice here.

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Let's say we go this way, and here we have to make a choice again,

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
so do we go this way and back here or do we go this way and here?

21
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
So a little bit harder to solve because we have to make certain choices,

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
but still not quite as hard as this one over here,

23
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
which I would think is the hardest because say we start out here,

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
oh, first choice to make, this way or that way, well, that way.

25
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Oh, again, new choice, this way or that way, let's go that way.

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
So all the time we have to make choices, which city to visit next,

27
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
and this is really tough, so what does this have to do with what

28
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I just call distance from triviality?

29
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
So what does with what I just call distance from triviality?

30
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
If I mark the vertices in each of the networks,

31
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
if I mark the vertices in each of the graphs

32
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
that has more than 2 neighbors,

33
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
then here we have just 1,

34
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
here we already have a couple of them,

35
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
and this one also although this one is fairly easy, but let's be consistent here,

36
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
and here I have a lot of them,

37
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
and I'll give you one additional graph, which looks something like this.

38
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Now this has a bit fewer vertices, but that's not the point here.

39
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
The point is that this graph down here

40
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
doesn't have any vertices that I would color

41
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
because all vertices have exactly 2 neighbors,

42
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
and this here is what I would call a trivial instance for shortest path,

43
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
because you don't really have to make any choices where you want to go.

44
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Here you also don't have to make any choices,

45
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
but what you see here is that the number of vertices that have more than 2 neighbors

46
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
actually is an indicator of how hard it is to solve

47
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
shortest tour on that respective graph.

48
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
If you have a few of these blue vertices here that have more than 2 neighbors,

49
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
then it's easier to solve shortest tour.

50
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Now I cannot give you the precise algorithm for this here

51
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
because actually that is a bit more complicated to figure out

52
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
and doesn't only have to do with these vertices here,

53
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
but I think you get the intuition

54
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
that we could try to use the number of these blue vertices

55
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
or some additional structural information as a parameter,

56
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
and it turns out that if you do this the right way,

57
00:02:33,000 --> 99:59:59,999
then shortest tour is somewhat fixed-parameter tractable.
