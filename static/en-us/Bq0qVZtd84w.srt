00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:06,300
We will now dig deeper into what needs to be done in the systems software stack

2
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:11,130
to support virtualization of the hardware resources for use by the

3
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:14,220
many operating systems living on top of

4
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:18,420
the hardware simultaneously. As you've seen in

5
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:21,480
the earlier course module, on operating system

6
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,460
extensibility. The question boils down to how

7
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:30,649
to be flexible while being performance conscious and safe. You'll

8
00:00:30,649 --> 00:00:35,840
see that a bulk of our discussion on virtualization centers around

9
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:41,150
memory systems. The reason is quite simple, namely, memory hierarchy

10
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:45,980
is crucial to performance. Even efficient handling of

11
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:51,000
device virtualization is heavily reliant on how

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,700
memory system is virtualized and made available

13
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:56,380
to the operating systems running on top of

14
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:59,940
the hypervisor. So let's start with techniques for

15
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:05,046
virtualizing the memory management in a performance-conscious manner.
