1
00:00:00,004 --> 00:00:05,432
2 times 3 is just 6 and then we're multiplying that by 10 to the negative 1

2
00:00:05,432 --> 00:00:10,540
power. Now I know that a negative 1 belongs here because we multiply terms that

3
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:15,342
have the same bases, we just need to add the exponents. Negative 4 plus 3 is

4
00:00:15,342 --> 00:00:20,630
negative 1. This gives us that same answer of 0.6 that we had before.
