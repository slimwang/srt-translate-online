00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,677
The rate is included in this line, where we calculate the interest. The

2
00:00:03,677 --> 00:00:07,010
interest calculation has to happen inside the loop. Because the balance is

3
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:10,820
incremented by a different amount every year. If we moved this line out of the

4
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:15,744
loop, it would only happen once. And our interest would always be $10. Even

5
00:00:15,744 --> 00:00:19,532
when we already have 100,000 in the bank. So I'll put that back. There is some

6
00:00:19,532 --> 00:00:23,288
magic numbers still in this code. Maybe these should actually be named

7
00:00:23,288 --> 00:00:28,576
variables. So I could take this, and make this into the target. And I can take

8
00:00:28,576 --> 00:00:33,145
out the rate, and call it a rate. Now this code is much more readable. We can

9
00:00:33,145 --> 00:00:35,890
see that it goes well the balance is less than the target, and the interest

10
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:38,529
increments by the balance plus the rate.
