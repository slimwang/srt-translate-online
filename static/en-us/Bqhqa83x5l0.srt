00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:04,243
Many, many lessons ago we helped Grant choose between three different brands of

2
00:00:04,243 --> 00:00:09,586
glasses cleaning solution to sell along with his wiper sets. One brand that

3
00:00:09,586 --> 00:00:15,940
seemed like a pretty good option gave us this equation, y equals 10x plus 150.

4
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:19,580
In this equation, x stands for the number of gallons of cleaning solution that

5
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:24,984
Grant orders, y is equal to the total cost of the order. The solution cost $10

6
00:00:24,984 --> 00:00:29,858
per gallon. And there is a flat delivery fee of $150 added on, regardless of

7
00:00:29,858 --> 00:00:35,094
how much solution was ordered. Before, Grant decided how much solution to

8
00:00:35,094 --> 00:00:39,165
order, so what x should be based pretty much just on how much he wanted or

9
00:00:39,165 --> 00:00:44,890
needed. When we plug that number in for x, the function would output how much

10
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:48,730
it would cost him. However, Greg's being a bit more strict with his budget

11
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:52,641
these days. And instead of doing things the old way, he wants to set aside a

12
00:00:52,641 --> 00:00:57,427
certain amount of money to spend on cleaning solution. That means that now, we

13
00:00:57,427 --> 00:01:01,106
probably need to switch up our equation a bit. He's going to want to calculate

14
00:01:01,106 --> 00:01:06,088
the amount of solution ordered based on the amount of money spent. Since now,

15
00:01:06,088 --> 00:01:10,986
amount ordered depends on money spent, let's switch up our variable names. If

16
00:01:10,986 --> 00:01:14,640
we want x to equal the total cost of the order and y to equal the amount of

17
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:20,578
cleaning solution ordered, what will our equation look like now? Remember that

18
00:01:20,578 --> 00:01:23,926
all of our quantities are still related to each other in the same way, we're

19
00:01:23,926 --> 00:01:26,279
just changing their names.
