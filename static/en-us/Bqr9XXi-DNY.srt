1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:05,780
Okay, so I would probably put the field, put a field here on attendees

2
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:10,800
and call it Festival. Because, it seems like for, you know, any given

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,440
attendee, they're probably going to go to a

4
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:14,710
festival, but any one festival's going to have

5
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:17,030
a ton of attendees and I don't want to end like a million fields.

6
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:17,630
>> Exactly.

7
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:18,180
>> Cool.
