1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,220
We'll make the next step
in the proof an exercise.

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:04,760
If (u,v) goes from A to B,

3
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:07,470
what does that tell us about
the values of the flow?

4
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:09,790
And similarly,

5
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:14,110
if (u,v) goes from B to A what does that
tell us about the values of the flow?
