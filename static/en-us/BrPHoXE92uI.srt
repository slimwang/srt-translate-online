1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,730
You've just created your first
app that uses Google Sign In.

2
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:07,260
With this, you can now have
identity within your app

3
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:10,230
without having to roll
your own identity system.

4
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:11,920
Congratulations.

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,820
Now that you've done the basics,
in the next steps,

6
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:18,690
you'll use what you've learned to
access data about the signed in user

7
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:20,740
based on the permissions they gave you.

8
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:23,120
You'll also see how to
customize the button.

9
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:25,660
You may not want that red
Google Plus sign in, so

10
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:26,920
you'll see how you can change that.
