1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:01,890
Here is the answer.

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:04,600
Remember that the blocked
binary exchange scheme only

3
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:07,689
communicates during
the first log P stages.

4
00:00:07,689 --> 00:00:12,060
And each process has to send
n over P words at each stage.

5
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:14,000
So that's n over P words at each stage,

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,830
the cost of sending
a message os size n over P.

7
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:18,530
And log P stages of communication.
