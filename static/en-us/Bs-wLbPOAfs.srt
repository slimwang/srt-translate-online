00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:05,390
So now, I did the hard part for you. Now, it's time for you to tell me what

2
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:10,763
these values should be. That most likely contain the true population mean if all

3
00:00:10,763 --> 00:00:15,834
the people in our Klout population were to start using Bieber Tweeter. What

4
00:00:15,834 --> 00:00:21,180
would be our interval estimate that most likely contains what this population

5
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:26,202
mean would be if everyone in our Klout population started using the Bieber

6
00:00:26,202 --> 00:00:32,332
Tweeter? So, figure out what this is and this. And just a reminder, here are our

7
00:00:32,332 --> 00:00:39,736
population parameters, the mean was 37.72 and the standard deviation was 16.04.

8
00:00:39,736 --> 00:00:45,883
And then, for our sampling distribution, the mean was 37.72, like you learned in

9
00:00:45,883 --> 00:00:51,490
the last lesson, and the standard deviation is the standard error, which is

10
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:55,547
sigma divided by root n Which we found to be about 2.71
