00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,420
To help solidify our understanding
of how this process works,

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:05,120
let's do an example.

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:11,333
I want you to use the fast Fourier
transform to evaluate the polynomial

4
00:00:11,333 --> 00:00:16,400
1+0x +x squared-x cubed at
the 4th roots of unity.
