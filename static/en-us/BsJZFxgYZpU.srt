1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Well, let's take a few stabs at it.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
It seems like we definitely want 0 through 9+

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
to get the first part of any phone number.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
What about this regular expression?

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
We have 0 through 9+, and then as many times as you like

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
we have a hyphen, and then 0 through 9+ again

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
as kind of a group.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
This actually works quite well.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
However, if we were to put a star here instead of a +,

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
this one accepts -6 by just skipping this part

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and doing this part once, -6, and then we're done.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
We don't like this.

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
And as we've mentioned, regular expressions admit room for creativity.

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
What if I want to do this interesting grouping at the beginning?

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
What if I say you can have as many of the 08-78-88- things as you want

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
as long as you end with some final numbers?

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
This one also works.

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
You may remember the hyphenated word problem we had from before.

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
This hyphenated phone number problem is actually quite similar,

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
but now that we know how to do grouping

21
00:00:58,000 --> 99:59:59,999
with parentheses, it's much easier to solve.
