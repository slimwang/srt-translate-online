00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,766
Now try to do this in a more general fashion. I'm looking for a function, y of x, the derivative of which is

2
00:00:07,767 --> 00:00:16,132
minus three times its value for every x, and its initial value for x equals zero should be five.

3
00:00:16,133 --> 00:00:25,799
What's that function? Enter your solution here. A number, possibly negative, times E to a number,

4
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,000
possibly negative, times X.
