I think the only time that you should try to settle the P versus NP question is either

2
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:11,510
when you've had brilliant insight that hasn't be tried before and you've invented a new proof technique

3
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:16,190
that no one has shown is incapable of setting the P versus NP question,

4
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:18,840
and of course if you're seasoned and respected computer scientist

5
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:20,600
with nothing to lose and enough money.

6
00:00:20,600 --> 99:59:59,999
I, of course, don't want to keep you from pondering this question here.
