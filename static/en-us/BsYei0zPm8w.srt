1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,870
So I think we going to
finish it off with a quiz.

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:06,120
And that's going to bring
back sort of all the TCB,

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:09,070
trust with the competing race
requirements they're talking about.

4
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:12,160
And give us a chance
to think about them.

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,850
So the first one is saying an attack
that exploits a vulnerability in

6
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:18,750
an operating system turns off the check.

7
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:21,360
The access control check,
that we're talking about.

8
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,940
That determines whether
the target resource or

9
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:25,680
the resource that's been requested.

10
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,600
Access to it should be granted
to the source of the request or

11
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:34,790
not If you turn that off,
which TCB requirement are you violating?
