1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:04,276
Back when we used Gamespace UI we used
the Unity event system to color code

2
00:00:04,276 --> 00:00:06,210
whenever those events fired.

3
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:09,077
&gt;&gt; Right and using the Gamespace UI
is great because it would

4
00:00:09,077 --> 00:00:13,810
automatically handle layer you interact
with, whatever you were looking at.

5
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:17,750
&gt;&gt; Yeah, but suppose now we actually
want to color code regardless of what

6
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:18,630
we're looking at.

7
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:20,440
&gt;&gt; Right,
if you want to create a custom events.

8
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:23,920
So like say something
happens after ten seconds or

9
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,180
when you reach a certain point.

10
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:28,010
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and for
that we need to use C-Sharp events.

11
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:29,340
&gt;&gt; The event system.

12
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:33,840
So the event system can be your friend,
but it's a little complicated.

13
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,370
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean to be honest,
the first time I looked at it,

14
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:39,170
it was kind of a little scary and
overwhelming.

15
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:40,140
&gt;&gt; But don't worry.

16
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:44,640
It's really important and we're going to
go very carefully so you can master it.

17
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,850
Once you master it, you have so much
more flexibility in what you can do.

18
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:49,690
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so let's just go ahead and
get started with it.
