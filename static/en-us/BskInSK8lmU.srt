At its core, a network serves to route packets

2
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:05,760
between machines on the network. Lets take a look

00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:08,540
at how packets are moved across networks. It's more

4
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:11,670
complicated than it sounds at first, but quite fascinating.

00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:14,850
>> That's right. To even reach your screen, the packets that make up

00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:18,690
this video likely traveled across at least four or five networks, if not more.

00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:19,710
>> You'll learn how that works in

the routing videos on BGP, a routing protocol.
