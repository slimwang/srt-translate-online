1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,918
I decided that I'd like to switch what was on either side of the equation just

2
00:00:03,918 --> 00:00:07,649
because I prefer to have x on the left side of the equation. This is just a

3
00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:11,775
personal preference. It doesn't change the math that we're doing at all. I also

4
00:00:11,775 --> 00:00:15,303
set y equal to 0 since we are, after all, looking for the roots of this

5
00:00:15,303 --> 00:00:19,030
equation. Now, what we notice here is that you can actually factor this

6
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:23,776
expression on the left. X squared plus 8x plus 16 Is just equal to the quantity

7
00:00:23,776 --> 00:00:28,595
x plus 4 times the quantity x plus 4 well these two factors are clearly both

8
00:00:28,595 --> 00:00:33,572
going to give us the same root since they are equal to each other, so from this

9
00:00:33,572 --> 00:00:38,470
we just get one equation x plus 4 equals 0 that needs to be satisfied in order

10
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:43,549
for this equation to be satisfied Fine. So we get a root of x equals negative 4.

11
00:00:43,549 --> 00:00:47,626
Now even though we only got one answer here for x, we must notice that the

12
00:00:47,626 --> 00:00:52,031
factor that this came from appears twice in the equation. So it's not so much

13
00:00:52,031 --> 00:00:56,585
that there's just one solution, it's that the two roots of this parabola happen

14
00:00:56,585 --> 00:01:00,932
to be identical to one another. In fact this root is so special that it gets a

15
00:01:00,932 --> 00:01:03,310
special name. It's called a double root.
