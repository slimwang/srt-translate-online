One useful way to represent a line is using the point slope form. If we know the

2
00:00:04,727 --> 00:00:09,389
slope of a line, and a single point that the line goes through, we can use this

3
00:00:09,389 --> 00:00:14,088
formula to express the equation of a line. Let's say you have a line that goes

4
00:00:14,088 --> 00:00:18,684
through the point 4, 7 with slope of negative 3. What is the equation of that

00:00:18,684 --> 00:00:19,069
line?
