00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
One of the pioneers in computing was Admiral Grace Hopper.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
She was famous for walking around with nanosticks,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
which were pieces of wire that were the length light would travel in a nanosecond--

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
30 cm long.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Grace Hopper wrote one of the first languages,

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
and the language COBOL, which she is seen holding here next to UNIVAC,

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
was for a long time the most widely-used computer language.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
She was one of the first people to think about writing languages this way,

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
["Nobody believed that I had a running compiler and nobody would touch it.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
They told me computers could only do arithmetic." Grace Hopper]

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and you have this quote when she talked about writing compiler,

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
and a compiler is a program that produces other programs, like Python.

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The difference between a compiler and an interpreter like Python

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
is the compiler does all the work at once and then runs the new program

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
whereas with an interpreter like Python you're doing this work at the same time.

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
But she had this great quote talking about no one believing that she could do such a thing,

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
and they told her that computers could only do arithmetic.

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
So far we've only seen computers do arithmetic.

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
We're going to see lots more interesting things in our Python program soon.

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
There's a link on the website to a video of Grace Hopper's appearance

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
on the David Letterman Show where she gives him a nanostick.

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I hope you'll enjoy watching that.
