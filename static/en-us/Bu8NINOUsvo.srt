00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,070
In the downloadable section,
I've added some public templates, for

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:06,030
when a user is not the owner
of a restaurant or menu page.

3
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:09,440
These templates do not contain
options to Add, Edit, and Delete.

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,980
Add code to your project.pi
file that checks whether

5
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:14,622
user is the owner of a restaurant or
menu item.

6
00:00:14,622 --> 00:00:17,480
If they're the owner render
the original template, if not,

7
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:19,030
render the public page.

8
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:22,630
Also, make sure that the Create, Edit
and Delete functions always check to

9
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:25,870
make sure the owner is the one issuing
these commands before executing,

10
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:28,920
in case the user tries to visit
one of these pages via the URL.
