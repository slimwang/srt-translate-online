1
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:04,180
Key objective data
are increasingly available,

2
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:09,330
from low costs wearable devices,
like the Fitbit activity monitor, or

3
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:12,960
even sensors embedded in smartphones.

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,370
When combined with apps on the phone,

5
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:18,500
they can create a patient
self management system.

6
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:21,780
That often includes the ability for
family members or caregivers,

7
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:25,070
to monitor the status
of an elderly relative.

8
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:28,260
They're becoming more
sophisticated over time, and

9
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,770
the US Food and
Drug Administration is currently

10
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:35,870
grappling with the degree to which they
should be regulated as medical devices.

11
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:41,810
AliveCor's smart phone case, that
can monitor a patient's heartbeat is

12
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:46,510
a good example of a sophisticated device
that has been through the FDA process.

13
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:52,425
This process is designed to assure
things such as, the devices are safe,

14
00:00:52,425 --> 00:00:54,430
they won't injure the patient.

15
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:59,270
They accurately measure what they claim,
as compared to earlier devices.

16
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:04,060
They're manufactured properly and that
the manufacturer keeps records, so that

17
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:07,640
patients with a potentially defective
device can be readily identified.
