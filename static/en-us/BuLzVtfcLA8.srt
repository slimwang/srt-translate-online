1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So here we have the figure that we know and love

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
of the input domain for some software under test.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
If we think about what the generative random tester is going to do,

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
what it's probably really going to do is cluster them in some part

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
because it's very hard to cover the actual full space of inputs.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
But in any case, they're going to be spread out over some part of the region.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
What a mutation-based random tester is going to do is start with some known input,

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and what it's going to do is randomly modify it,

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and so it's going to end up with test cases

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
that in some sense are kind of in the same neighborhood as the original input.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
And so our mutation-based random tester is going to be able to access points like this.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
If we start with a different input, it's going to be able to get points like this.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
And so what's happening is we're exploring interesting parts of the input domain,

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
and it could be that we could have never reached this part of the input domain

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
using any kind of a generative random test case generator that we have time to make.

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
So this approach is extremely useful and extremely valid.

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
But on the other hand, it's generally limited to

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
exploring sort of a region of the input space that's close to the starting point.

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
One thing that you should be asking yourself right now is,

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
what are the operators that we use to mutate test cases to create new random test cases?

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
And so let's look at that a little bit.
