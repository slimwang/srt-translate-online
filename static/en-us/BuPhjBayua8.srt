1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:06,880
So because I was looking for a team and
not someone for a specific task,

2
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:11,230
I didn't do any programming
skills tests or

3
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:16,730
any other things like that that you
can really quantify the result.

4
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:22,042
I gave a few companies
the same exact project

5
00:00:22,042 --> 00:00:26,800
that I had ability to evaluate myself.

6
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,740
It was a reporting project.

7
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:33,756
I wanted them to connect all kinds
of data sources to one dashboard,

8
00:00:33,756 --> 00:00:36,399
and I told them that's what I need.

9
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:39,081
That's the brief, go out and execute it.

10
00:00:39,081 --> 00:00:41,299
You have 100 hours to do it.

11
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:46,490
Do whatever you need because one of
the things that was important to me is

12
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:49,840
to have also product abilities.

13
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,975
Not just following orders,
it's also to envision what you want,

14
00:00:54,975 --> 00:00:57,505
what I need them to do and
execute on that,

15
00:00:57,505 --> 00:01:01,565
because they didn't want to
micromanage them, I can't micromanage.

16
00:01:01,565 --> 00:01:06,025
So that was a test that he
passed in flying colors.

17
00:01:06,025 --> 00:01:08,515
It was way better than what I would do.

18
00:01:08,515 --> 00:01:11,675
And then I know okay,
we're going to work together for

19
00:01:11,675 --> 00:01:15,915
a long time, because this is exactly
what I would expect an employee of mine.

20
00:01:15,915 --> 00:01:17,565
To do better than what I would do.

21
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:21,030
To be better at things
that I did in this.

22
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:22,130
That's why I need you.

23
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:24,064
I don't need you just to follow orders.

24
00:01:24,064 --> 00:01:24,959
I need you to think.

25
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:26,724
I need you to innovate.

26
00:01:26,724 --> 00:01:29,030
And that was the test.
