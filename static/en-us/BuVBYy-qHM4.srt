So here are the answers. A package delivery service sounds

2
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:07,220
like a pull queue because each package is probably delivered by

3
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:10,680
independent workers that can pull tasks from the queue. What

4
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:13,500
about checking in for a flight? Well I would like to

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,810
know that I'm checked in, and in that case it's

6
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:19,460
neither a push queue nor a pull queue. Then the confirmation

7
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:22,630
would be delivered as part of the http response, even if

8
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:25,490
it takes a little bit of time. This is a situation

9
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:28,050
very similar to when you buy things using a credit

10
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:30,840
card on the internet, where you also often wait for

11
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:34,460
the response. What about code review? Well a code review

12
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:37,680
sounds like a pull queue, because you probably have many people

13
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,500
that can review the code, so the first one that's

14
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:44,010
available can pull the code review from the queue. And then

15
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:46,690
batch processing of images, which sounds like a push queue.

16
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:50,530
This is because your code is probably doing the processing of

17
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:53,340
the images. Therefore you want to have control over the execution.
