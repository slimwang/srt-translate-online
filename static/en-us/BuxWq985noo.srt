1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,952
Just like all the other problems, we're going to start by dividing each term by

2
00:00:04,952 --> 00:00:09,665
our divisor, 6fg squared h. 3/6 Reduces to 1/2, so that's going to start my

3
00:00:09,665 --> 00:00:14,551
answer. F cubed divided by f would leave me with f squared in the numerator, and

4
00:00:14,551 --> 00:00:19,586
then g squared divided by g squared equals 1. And then h 4th divided by h equals

5
00:00:19,586 --> 00:00:24,719
h cubed. Our second term would be 4fh squared, 24 divided by 6 equals 4 and f

6
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:29,525
squared divided by f makes f to the 1. The g squared divided by g squared

7
00:00:29,525 --> 00:00:34,722
simplifies to 1 again, and then h cubed divided by h is equal to h squared. And

8
00:00:34,722 --> 00:00:39,805
finally for our last term, we'll have negative 3 halves, f times h. F squared

9
00:00:39,805 --> 00:00:44,746
divided by f is equal to f, and our g squared divided by g squared is equal to

10
00:00:44,746 --> 00:00:49,438
1, so those simplify out. And finally, we have h squared, divided by h, which

11
00:00:49,438 --> 00:00:53,504
leaves us with h to the 1. This first term and this last term, were a little

12
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:57,662
tricky, since we had fractions, but hopefully you got most of the variables

13
00:00:57,662 --> 00:01:00,717
right. If you got everything right, excellent work.
