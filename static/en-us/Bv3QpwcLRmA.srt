All right. Parsing States. Over here on the left I've drawn a grammar.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
"S" goes to "a s b". We can loop around here, and we can have a "c" in the middle if we like.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Oh, it's just like balanced parentheses, but with central content.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
And our input is "a c b" but we've only seen the "a" and the "c" so far.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'd like to know which parsing states are in chart 2.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Remember, chart 0 is "I haven't seen anything." Chart 1 is, "I've seen just the "a"."

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Chart 2 is, "I've seen the "a" and the "c", but I haven't yet seen the "b"."

8
00:00:28,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Check all that apply.
