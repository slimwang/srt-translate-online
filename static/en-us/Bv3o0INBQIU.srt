00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:04,040
When we talk about image distortion,
we're talking about what happens when

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:07,200
a camera looks at 3D objects
in the real world and

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,609
transforms them into a 2D image.

4
00:00:09,609 --> 00:00:11,779
This transformation isn't perfect.

5
00:00:11,779 --> 00:00:16,089
For example, here's an image of a road
and some images taken through different

6
00:00:16,089 --> 00:00:18,809
camera lenses that
are slightly distorted.

7
00:00:18,809 --> 00:00:23,109
In these distorted images, you can see
that the edges of the lanes are bent and

8
00:00:23,109 --> 00:00:25,640
sort of rounded or stretched outward.

9
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:28,570
And distortion is actually
changing what the shape and

10
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:30,890
size of these objects appears to be.

11
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:31,769
This is a problem,

12
00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:35,939
because we're trying to accurately place
the self-driving car in this world.

13
00:00:35,939 --> 00:00:38,586
Eventually, we'll want to look
at the curve of a lane and

14
00:00:38,587 --> 00:00:40,031
steer the correct direction.

15
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:43,558
But if the lane is distorted,
we'll get the wrong measurement for

16
00:00:43,558 --> 00:00:47,089
curvature in the first place and
our steering angle will be wrong.

17
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:52,077
So, the frist step in analyzing camera
images is to undo this distortion so

18
00:00:52,076 --> 00:00:56,048
that we can get correct and
useful information out of them.
