00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,172
Now that Grant's has such great ideas from the glasses expo about how to run his

2
00:00:04,172 --> 00:00:08,268
business, and how to make all of his different products better, he's ready to

3
00:00:08,268 --> 00:00:12,532
get his glasses wipers, and nozzles onto the market. That means that it's time

4
00:00:12,532 --> 00:00:16,721
to talk about profit again. A while ago, Grant picked out some prices for his

5
00:00:16,721 --> 00:00:21,143
wipers and his nozzles, but he wants to use the algebra skills we've taught him,

6
00:00:21,143 --> 00:00:25,526
to check out if these really are the best choices he can make. So lets revisit

7
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:29,877
the idea of profit for a moment. If profit, which we'll call p, is equal to the

8
00:00:29,877 --> 00:00:34,093
money that Grant earns, minus the money that he spends, and if we call money

9
00:00:34,093 --> 00:00:38,649
spent m, then can you write an equation for profit, involving just single letter

10
00:00:38,649 --> 00:00:43,138
variables? Assume that the money that they earned is only coming from wipers,

11
00:00:43,138 --> 00:00:47,347
and that the number of wiper sets sold is equal to n, and the price per wiper

12
00:00:47,347 --> 00:00:48,385
set is equal to c.
