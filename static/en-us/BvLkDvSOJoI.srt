To draw the last graph or the last several graphs I had to use a set of axis.

2
00:00:04,757 --> 00:00:09,580
One for each variable we have in our equation. The standard way to set this up

3
00:00:09,592 --> 00:00:14,320
is to label the horizontal axis the x axis. This demarcates how are x values

4
00:00:14,332 --> 00:00:19,370
change. And the vertical axis is the y axis, showing how y values change. Now,

5
00:00:19,472 --> 00:00:23,840
every point on this plane is associated with both a value in the horizontal

6
00:00:23,852 --> 00:00:28,500
direction, an x value, and a value in the vertical direction, a y value. I also

7
00:00:28,512 --> 00:00:33,245
mentioned earlier that we identify points on our coordinate plane with a special

8
00:00:33,257 --> 00:00:37,600
notation. The first number listed is our x-coordinate, or our horizontal

9
00:00:37,612 --> 00:00:42,300
position. And the second number in the ordered pair is the y-coordinate or the

10
00:00:42,312 --> 00:00:46,565
vertical position of the point. The areas that you see on the ends of each axis

11
00:00:46,577 --> 00:00:50,900
represent continuation, so the x axis continues all the way out to infinity and

12
00:00:50,912 --> 00:00:55,225
also in the other direction, all the way out to negative infinity. And the same

13
00:00:55,237 --> 00:00:59,575
is true of the y axis so this coordinate plane are really able to represent, if

14
00:00:59,587 --> 00:01:03,720
we want to take as much time and paper as possible, any combination of 2 real

15
00:01:03,732 --> 00:01:08,039
numbers. And then of course we can depict it graphically. There is 1 single

16
00:01:08,051 --> 00:01:12,135
point on this graph however, 1 point out of that infinite number of points,

17
00:01:12,233 --> 00:01:16,611
that's really special. And we call it the origin. Which point of all these ones

18
00:01:16,623 --> 00:01:20,926
highlighted in teal do you think is special enough to have such an illustrious

19
00:01:20,938 --> 00:01:23,580
title as the origin? Click where you think it is.
