I was using my favorite red pen to write with yesterday, but unfortunately it

2
00:00:03,572 --> 00:00:07,270
had an accident. It exploded all over my piece of paper, and you can see I

3
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:11,120
ended up with a pretty big mess. I even got it all over my hands. I don't know

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:14,827
if you can tell but my fingers were pretty red yesterday. Now, the big problem

5
00:00:14,827 --> 00:00:19,206
however, is that I lost a bunch of the work I had done. I started out with a

6
00:00:19,206 --> 00:00:22,940
polynomial and then found all of its zeros. But now I can only see three of

7
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:28,460
them. Think you can make it out here. 1, 2 and i. So I'm trying to figure out

8
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:32,369
how much work I need to do to figure out my last zero. Do I need to actually

9
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:36,421
recalculate it? To answer this question, please just write yes or no in this

10
00:00:36,421 --> 00:00:40,358
box. In the event that you write no in this box, and we can find this fourth

11
00:00:40,358 --> 00:00:43,591
zero without really doing any math at all, write what the fourth zero is in

12
00:00:43,591 --> 00:00:45,752
this box.
