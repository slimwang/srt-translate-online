00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,550
Are you struggling with a concept?

00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:06,070
Doing your research and
still can't find anything?

3
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:10,950
Ask a question, but make sure to
think about the question first and

4
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:11,650
who you're asking.

00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:16,970

00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:21,050
Whichever online communities you choose
to interact with, make sure to read

00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:24,850
over their community guidelines and ask
questions that align with their focus.
