1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:04,240
Here's how I would suggest that
you handle disagreements around

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:05,220
best practice.

3
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:08,270
Do the thing that the other
person wants to do first.

4
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:10,740
That's always a good way, right?

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:11,790
Feels inclusive.

6
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:13,260
It's going to feel terrible to you

7
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:15,280
because you're going to feel
like you know the right thing.

8
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,250
It's going to feel awesome to them
because they're going to feel like

9
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:20,780
there's some trust and willingness.

10
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:22,530
That's one way to go about it.

11
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:25,610
Maybe an easier way to think about this

12
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:28,800
is that there's no such
thing as best practice.

13
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,310
There are good practices
that are context bound.

14
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:36,990
As a matter of fact, the things that you
are going to see that cause pain inside

15
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:42,930
of an organization or
that make the interactions

16
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:46,860
between the development staff and
the operations staff difficult.

17
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:51,180
Those are actually the result
of earlier best practices.

18
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:54,200
So the thing that we need to be very,
very clear about

19
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:59,180
is that there's only good practices and
those good practices have a lifespan.

20
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:02,250
And so when you walk in the first
thing you want to do is you want to

21
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:04,349
develop that sense of
appreciative inquiry.

22
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,440
It's not, man how did it get like this?

23
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:11,000
It's, I wonder how it got this way.

24
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,990
What was the value that
drove the organization?

25
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:16,370
What value were there chasing?

26
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:20,480
What things did they see as being
amazing that brought them to this place?

27
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:25,120
And how do we recapture the things
that we think are valuable?

28
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:29,530
It's very, very easy to declare
the thing bad and then to

29
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:34,620
want to describe some new good state and
this is often how best practices work.

30
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:37,960
I cannot tell you how many times
I have shown up on the site

31
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:42,100
to talk with some executives or
with a team and the first

32
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:46,850
thing they want to know is Jeff give me
the checklist of all the best practices.

33
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:48,330
And in fact, I can't do that.

34
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:52,170
Even if I wanted to and
often I do want to because it feels like

35
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:55,180
they would be super happy
if I could give it to them.

36
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:56,940
I know that it's a little bit of a fib

37
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:00,770
that in fact what's going to have to
happen is the organization is going to

38
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:05,040
have to work together to
find a set of tooling.

39
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:10,650
That set of tooling is different
contextually from place to place.

40
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:14,010
Different vendors take different
approaches to the problem domain and

41
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:17,640
some work better in some contexts and
others and in others and

42
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:21,760
I think your job in the role of develops
engineer is to really to help to

43
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,050
help the organization to discover
the right set of tooling.

44
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:29,880
[LAUGH] Well,
what no organization needs right now

45
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:34,310
is another voice unlike
the war on which tool is best.

46
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:39,170
It's an easy, easy trap for
a junior engineer to fall into.

47
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:43,499
I would encourage you at the beginning
of your learning process to avoid it,

48
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,360
avoid it.

49
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,000
First of all, learn all the tools.

50
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,570
There are differences in approach and

51
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:58,140
technique that are super valuable and
you never know when you're going to need

52
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:02,340
that sort of super special screwdriver
to solve that particular problem.

53
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:05,040
So as a new engineer working in the
DevOp space, you're going to come into

54
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,930
an organization and often you're
going to come in with a list of

55
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:14,125
like, these are all the best practices,
these are the best tools.

56
00:03:14,125 --> 00:03:20,560
And it would be great if you just landed
at a place where everyone agreed.

57
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,410
But in fact, what you're probably is
going to happen, is you're going to

58
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:28,060
land into a place where people are
already in sort of violent disagreement.

59
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:32,080
And if what you bring is more advocacy.

60
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,510
You're never going to get to
the place that you want to get,

61
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:36,920
which is the ability
to unlock that value.

62
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:40,530
So as it is it develops an engineer
in an organization that's

63
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:43,420
sort of can't find its
way toward a tool set.

64
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:47,360
I think is taking the stance of
advocacy for any particular tool is

65
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,960
not going to be the place where
where you're bringing value.

66
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:54,570
The most valuable stance you
can take is the one in which

67
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:58,900
you help the organization to kind of
CO discover what works in its context.
