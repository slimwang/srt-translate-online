1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,180
And I'd say the best answer would have been word order because this

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:06,070
product doesn't consider the order in which the words occur.

3
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:07,070
Whereas in the English language I

4
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:11,520
can tell you if you randomly re-order our words sentences don't make any sense.

5
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,670
This message doesn't pay attention to the word order.

6
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:16,550
So it doesn't really understand the text it just looks at

7
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:19,710
word frequencies as a way to do the classification.

8
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:21,300
That's why it's called Naive.

9
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:23,500
But it's good enough in many cases
