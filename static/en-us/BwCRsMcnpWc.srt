00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,440
So here is a giant model of our phone, and

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:06,420
our button is placed somewhere over here.

3
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:07,570
What we really want to do

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:13,560
is center line this button both vertically and horizontally.

5
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:17,590
Now, the way to figure out how to do this is by reading documentation.

6
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:19,840
So here is your opportunity to practice.

7
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,690
How would you go about making sure this button

8
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:24,950
is centered vertically and horizontally?

9
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:26,850
See if you can figure it out.
