1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:01,839
Now, we get to the ugly stuff.

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:03,220
Homogeneous coordinates.

3
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:09,048
It's not ugly, it's beautiful, for some twisted notion of aesthetic.

4
00:00:09,048 --> 00:00:15,810
So, that operation where we take x over z and y over z.

5
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:17,440
Is that a linear transformation?

6
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:19,430
Well, the answer is no.

7
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:22,950
Now, before we said that well, division's a linear operation.

8
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:25,180
Sure. Division by some constant by a,

9
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:27,740
1 over a, multiplying 1 over a, that's a linear operation.

10
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:31,010
But, here and I take x, y, and z, okay?

11
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:36,590
I actually have to pull out that z and divide the x and the y by it.

12
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:40,870
And so, if I've got another point with x1, y1, z1, I divide by that z.

13
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:42,350
So, it's not a linear operation.

14
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:44,780
I have to essentially change what's going on.

15
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:47,140
So what we're going to do is we're going to do a trick.

16
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:50,990
And the trick is, we're going to add one more coordinate, all right?

17
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:53,790
And we can do this in either two dimensions or three dimensions.

18
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:57,097
In two dimensions x,y becomes xy1.

19
00:00:57,097 --> 00:01:01,030
X,y,z becomes xyz1.

20
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:05,480
And this bottom coordinate, which right now here is written as a 1,

21
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:08,370
later we're going to, they'll, it'll take other values,

22
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:11,920
that's the homogeneous edition, the homogeneous coordinate.

23
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,010
Sometimes it's called the scale factor but I, but I think that's inappropriate,

24
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:18,430
it should just be viewed as the homogeneous coordinate.

25
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:22,470
Or the homos, homogeneous component of the vector.

26
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:26,900
So, converting from regular coordinates to homogenous and

27
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:29,450
back again is pretty easy, right?

28
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:32,906
If I have the homogeneous coordinate x,y,w I

29
00:01:32,906 --> 00:01:36,370
get the nonhomogeneous by just dividing by w.

30
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:41,380
So 2dx over w and 3d x, y, and z, each over w.

31
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:46,790
So now you see why converting xy1 to nonhomogeneous I still get back the x and

32
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:47,990
y as I had before.

33
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,980
But if that last homogenous coordinate is not 1,

34
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:52,310
then I'll get a different value.

35
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:56,670
By the way, this makes homogeneous coordinates invariant under scale.

36
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:00,270
If I were to multiply the entire homogeneous coordinate by some constant, say a.

37
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:02,246
So, I have ax, ay, aw.

38
00:02:02,246 --> 00:02:06,310
When I do the conversion back again doing the division, the a just cancels out.
