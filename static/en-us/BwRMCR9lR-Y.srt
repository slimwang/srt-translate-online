1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:01,790
And this idea of comparing labels,

2
00:00:01,790 --> 00:00:04,250
we're going to explore
that through an example.

3
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:10,150
L1 is uppercase L1 is lowercase l1,
comma Comp1.

4
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:15,390
And similarly L2 is lowercase label l2,
is lower

5
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:20,960
case l2 which is the level, sensitivity
level of label two, comma, comp two.

6
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,180
So the comparison is going to yield,

7
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:26,940
what we call what label
dominates the other label.

8
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:33,950
Okay so L1 can dominate L2,
or L1 can be dominated by L2.

9
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:36,230
Or, maybe neither one
dominates the other one.

10
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:38,000
So these are the various possibilities.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,930
So L1, label L1 is your dominate, label
L2 if, level 1 is greater than level 2,

12
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:48,720
and the categories or
the topics that make up compartment

13
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:53,370
one contain the topics or
categories that are in compartment two.

14
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:57,000
So essentially, we are saying lL is
going to dominate if it's higher

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,850
sensitive level, and the categories
actually are a superset, or

16
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:05,300
contain the categories
of compartment two.

17
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:08,050
It it's dominated then
it's the other way, okay?

18
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:12,510
So in that case,
label l2 is the dominating one, so

19
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:17,250
obviously level l2 has to be
greater than level l1, and

20
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:20,990
the containment that we had before
has to be in the other direction.

21
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:23,980
Okay, so this is the subset
relation that we have here.

22
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:27,790
For the two labels to be equal,
of course, each part has to be the same.

23
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:31,470
So the levels have to be the same, and
the compartments have to be the same.

24
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:36,080
So if L1 and L2 are not comparable,
and what do we mean by that?

25
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,800
That means it's one of the first three.

26
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,920
They're not equal, and
neither one dominates the other one.

27
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:44,090
Then we say that they're not comparable.

28
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:46,210
L1 doesn't dominate L2.

29
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:47,900
L1 is not dominated by L2.

30
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:53,850
And the reason for that is, we're
talking about a label having two parts.

31
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:56,390
So levels are obviously totally ordered.

32
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:58,930
So you cannot be,
no you're not comparable.

33
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:04,590
It's not because the levels that you
have within your label L1 and L2.

34
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:08,017
It's actually going to be because
the compartments are sets, and these

35
00:02:08,017 --> 00:02:11,573
sets are going to be, neither one is
going to be dependent on the other one.

36
00:02:11,573 --> 00:02:14,992
So, they each have some elements
the other one doesn't have, and

37
00:02:14,992 --> 00:02:18,990
because of that, this containment
property is not going to be satisfied.

38
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:22,720
And, because of that, neither of
these are going to be holding, and

39
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:27,120
when they don't, then we say that
these labels are not comparable.

40
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,110
So one thing,
if you take these labels and

41
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:33,910
arrange them sort of what
kind of structure you get.

42
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:36,550
Mathematics, actually their name for
that structure,

43
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:38,420
it's going to form a lattice.

44
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:42,980
And when you have a lattice,
you have the elements that are the least

45
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:46,910
upper bound, and the greatest
lower bound, and things like that.

46
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:51,450
So you can always find labels that
will dominate any set of labels that

47
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:51,970
you have.

48
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:56,550
So that would be finding an upper bound,
and you can find the smaller such upper

49
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:58,620
bound, so that's LUB and
things like that.

50
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:02,780
So when you compare these, instead of
arranging what's dominated by who,

51
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:06,070
we get this structure
because of the partial and

52
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:08,360
the total order we have
on the different parts.

53
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,760
The structure you get is
what is called a lattice.
