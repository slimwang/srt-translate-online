00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:04,510
The fifth section is titled variables. Design studies themselves have to

2
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:08,900
be designed. In particular the independent and dependent variables must be

3
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:13,270
identified and appropriate metrics specified. Design studies,

4
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:16,970
like experiments, allow designers, like scientists, to alter conditions and

5
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:21,620
note results. The altered conditions comprise the independent variables. And

6
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:25,500
the corresponding results comprise the dependent variables each variable has

7
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:30,870
a unique name a description and a unit of measurement such as seconds. Sometimes

8
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:35,900
the units are easy for example time other variable such as maintainability

9
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:39,893
require you to think carefully and invent an appropriate way to measure it. But

10
00:00:39,893 --> 00:00:43,364
this section of the design study describes the variables, both independent and

11
00:00:43,364 --> 00:00:47,640
dependent, the units and measures, and how the research questions address them.

12
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,810
The section should also include a summary table, with three columns, which for

13
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:54,190
each research question, lists the independent and

14
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:56,880
dependent variables you used, in answering the question.
