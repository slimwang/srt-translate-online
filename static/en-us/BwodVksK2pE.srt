00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,111
So, let's assume that the array of grades is completely filled. No partially

2
00:00:04,111 --> 00:00:07,748
filled arrays on this question. Can you write a method which returns the sum of

3
00:00:07,748 --> 00:00:12,258
the scores for the ith student? If you're ready to try this for yourself, just

4
00:00:12,258 --> 00:00:16,580
skip to the quiz. If you want to see a smaller example first, keep watching.

5
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:19,844
What if my grade book looked like this, and I wanted to calculate the total for

6
00:00:19,844 --> 00:00:27,020
Sandra. Sandra is at index i equals one. If this whole array was called grades,

7
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:31,595
then I would want to add up this cell, which would be grades [1] [0], because

8
00:00:31,595 --> 00:00:38,292
this is the first student. And the zeroth topic would be this spot, because

9
00:00:38,292 --> 00:00:44,363
it's student one and topic one. And grades [1] [2] would be this one, Student

10
00:00:44,363 --> 00:00:48,645
One, Topic Two. To get the sum for this student we would want to add all of

11
00:00:48,645 --> 00:00:53,507
these up. Now, it's your turn. Try coding this in BlueJ. But bare in mind, you

12
00:00:53,507 --> 00:00:58,088
might not know the size of the array up front. There might be a variable for

13
00:00:58,088 --> 00:01:00,919
the number of topics and the number of students.
