1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
This question is optional, but now that we know some more about

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
searching a graph, testing for connectedness,

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
and finding bridge edges, you might be able to improve

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
your Eulerian Tour finding routine from the first unit.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
If you go back to the challenge problem in unit 1 and add the line

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
use<u>harder</u>tests = True to your code

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
the grader will use more complicated graphs.
