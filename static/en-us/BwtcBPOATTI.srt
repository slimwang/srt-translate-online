00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,918
Now that we know that we can use our area model in a bunch of different cases,

2
00:00:03,918 --> 00:00:07,799
let's see if we can use it here. We're going to try and square a binomial. When

3
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:11,801
we square a binomial, we simply raise a binomial to the second power. And what

4
00:00:11,801 --> 00:00:15,906
we're wondering here is, is this equal to this? Let's use what we know to figure

5
00:00:15,906 --> 00:00:19,610
it out. I've drawn out the rectangle for you. Now I want you to fill in the

6
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:24,022
products that you would get when you multiply each of the terms. Basically,

7
00:00:24,022 --> 00:00:28,878
you're finding the area for each of these rectangles. After you find the area of

8
00:00:28,878 --> 00:00:33,480
each of the rectangles, then write the sum, or the total area, in this box.
