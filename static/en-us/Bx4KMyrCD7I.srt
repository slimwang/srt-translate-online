For the rest of the nanodegree, you're
going to be using Google App Engineâ€Ž.

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:05,660
Now this is an amazing tool, but

3
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:08,240
it can be really frustrating
to get it up and running.

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,610
This is often the case in programming,
and

5
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:12,800
there's no real shortcut,
you kind of just have to figure it out.

6
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,420
And we're going to do our best to
provide you with the most up to date

7
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:16,480
instructions.

8
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,440
But even those may not be enough.

9
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:21,980
So if you run into any problems,
persevere and remember

10
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:24,220
soon you're going to have a web page
that you can share with your friends.
