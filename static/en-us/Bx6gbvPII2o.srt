1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,560
During the response section of rails.

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:06,020
You saw that you have about 100
milliseconds to respond to user input.

3
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:10,440
But, some user interactions also require
animations which then need to run

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:11,900
at 60 frames per second.

5
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:15,860
What kind of interactions do you think
require 60 frames per second animations?

6
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:18,460
Should spinners always be
running at 60 frames per second?

7
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:20,360
What about scrolling?

8
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:22,080
Dragging and dropping.

9
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,070
Pinching.

10
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:24,480
Pulling to refresh.

11
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,590
Menus sliding out from the side.

12
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:28,075
Comment section opening from below.

13
00:00:28,075 --> 00:00:31,420
Changing the state of items and forms.

14
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:34,950
Or last but not least,
changing the themes of an app.

15
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:35,730
Check all that apply.
