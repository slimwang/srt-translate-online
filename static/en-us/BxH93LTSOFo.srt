1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,780
Another equation that we will very often use, is Amdahl's

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:06,732
law, which we need to use when we're about speed

3
00:00:06,732 --> 00:00:09,972
up on a part of the program, only some instructions,

4
00:00:09,972 --> 00:00:12,593
and so on. So, basically when we have a speed

5
00:00:12,593 --> 00:00:15,608
up, but it doesn't apply to the entire program, and

6
00:00:15,608 --> 00:00:18,087
we want to know what is the overall speedup on

7
00:00:18,087 --> 00:00:21,714
the entire program. So the overall speed up could be

8
00:00:21,714 --> 00:00:25,746
computed, as 1 over 1 minus the fraction of the program

9
00:00:25,746 --> 00:00:29,036
we didn't enhance. So for example, if we

10
00:00:29,036 --> 00:00:32,516
speed up 40% of the program, then this would

11
00:00:32,516 --> 00:00:35,735
be 60%, plus the fraction of the program

12
00:00:35,735 --> 00:00:39,258
we did enhance. In this case the 40%, divided

13
00:00:39,258 --> 00:00:41,526
by the speed up we achieved on that

14
00:00:41,526 --> 00:00:45,402
enhancement, how did we get there? So the speedup

15
00:00:45,402 --> 00:00:48,313
in this case is the improvement in performance,

16
00:00:48,313 --> 00:00:51,153
which is 1 over the new execution time relative

17
00:00:51,153 --> 00:00:55,856
to the old. So this is the part that we didn't improve, just stays

18
00:00:55,856 --> 00:01:00,920
there. The part that we did improve, is shorter by the amount of improvement on

19
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:06,184
that part. It's very, very, very important to understand

20
00:01:06,184 --> 00:01:11,244
that the fraction enhanced here, is a percentage of the original

21
00:01:11,244 --> 00:01:16,710
execution time, that is affected by our enhancemen. Okay?

22
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:24,490
So it needs to be that 40%, of the time spent on the program. Is affected by our

23
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:27,686
speed up, not for example, 40% of the instructions

24
00:01:27,686 --> 00:01:30,990
in the program, or something else other than the time.
