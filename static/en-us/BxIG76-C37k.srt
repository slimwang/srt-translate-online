1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,070
Alright so we've got states. So next is whats called

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:05,980
the model or the transition model. Sometimes people refer to

3
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:08,710
it as the transition function, and basically it is a

4
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:13,020
function of three variables. It's a state, an action, which

5
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:15,600
I haven't defined for you yet and another state. In

6
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,310
fact since I haven't defined what an action is for

7
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:20,020
you yet, let's skip that and actually do define actions

8
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:24,880
for you. So the third part of our model are actions.

9
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,500
Actions are the things that you can do in a

10
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:30,050
particular state. So what would the actions be in this world?

11
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:33,180
>> Well the four different decisions I could make were the

12
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:38,130
up, down, left and right. Though it's maybe a little confusing because

13
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:41,580
I think those were also the four possible outcomes. That's true.

14
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:43,540
Well no, there are other outcomes. You could stay where you were.

15
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:44,390
>> Right.

16
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:45,270
>> Right.

17
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:47,710
>> So these are actually the actions. These are the things that

18
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:49,890
when I'm in a given state I'm allowed to execute. I can

19
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:52,740
either go up, go down, go left or go right. You'll notice

20
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:57,640
that as I described before there was no option not to move. Mm.

21
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,730
>> But there could have been, and there could

22
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:01,370
have been other actions, like teleport, or there's anything

23
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:03,090
that you can imagine. But the point is that

24
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:06,100
your action set represents all of the things that the

25
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:08,580
agent, the robot, the person, or whatever it is

26
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:11,150
you're trying to model, is allowed to do. Now, in

27
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:13,200
its full, generalized form, we can think of the

28
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,910
set of actions that one can take as being a

29
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:17,640
function of state Because there's some stage you can do some

30
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:21,620
things and some stage you can't do those things. But most of

31
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:24,330
the time people just treat it as a set of actions. And

32
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:27,640
the actions that aren't allowable in them particular states have no effect.

33
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:30,640
Alright, so we understand states. They're the things that describe the world.

34
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,310
We understand actions. Those are the things that you can do, the

35
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:36,520
commands you can execute when your in particular states. And what a

36
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:39,960
model describes, what the transition model describes is in some sense the

37
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,880
rules of the game that you're playing. It's

38
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,640
the physics of the world. So it's a function

39
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,080
of three variables: a state, an action and

40
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:52,290
another state, which, by the way, could actually be

41
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:54,620
the same state. And what this function produces

42
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:58,830
is the probability That you will end up transitioning

43
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:01,640
the state s prime, given that you were in

44
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:05,020
state s, and you took action a. Got it?

45
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:10,300
>> I think so. so the s prime is where you end up, and the s, a is what

46
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:12,660
you're given. So it's, so you plug these three

47
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,845
in. Oh I see, and you get a probability Mm-hm.

48
00:02:14,845 --> 00:02:16,750
>> But the probabilities have to add up to one if

49
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:19,680
you if you sum it up over all the s primes.

50
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:25,270
>> Right. That's exactly right. So for example if you think about the

51
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:30,160
deterministic case where there was no noise then this is a very simple model. If

52
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,830
I'm in the state the start state. And I take the action up,

53
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:37,840
then what's the probability, I end up in the state immediately above it?

54
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,825
>> Was that a 0.08?

55
00:02:39,825 --> 00:02:43,050
>> No, in the, in, when we first started in the deterministic world.

56
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:44,960
>> Oh, that was probability one.

57
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,680
>> Right, and what would be the probability, you

58
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,340
ended up in the state to the right? Probability zero.

59
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:51,620
>> Right. In fact, the probability that you end up at any of the

60
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:55,840
other states is zero in the deterministic world. Now what about the case when

61
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,010
we were in the non-deterministic world where an action

62
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:01,080
would actually execute faithfully only 80% of the time. If

63
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,070
I'm in the start state and I go up, what's

64
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:05,260
the probability that I end up. In the state above.

65
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:06,341
>> That was 0.8

66
00:03:06,341 --> 00:03:08,770
>> Was the probability, I end up in the state to the right.

67
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:09,780
>> That was 0.1.

68
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:12,400
>> And, what was the probability I end up where I started.

69
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,595
>> That was also 0.1.

70
00:03:13,595 --> 00:03:15,990
>> Right, and 0 everywhere else. And, that's just sort of the way

71
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:21,090
it works. So, the model really is an important thing. And the reason,

72
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:23,660
it's important. Is it really does describe the rules of the game.

73
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:26,930
It tells you what you, what will happen if you do something in

74
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:30,520
a particular place. It captures Everything that you know about the transition

75
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,410
u, of the world is what you know about the rules, got it?

76
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:34,920
>> You called it physics before?

77
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,200
>> I called it the physics of the world.

78
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,160
>> Huh.

79
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:41,000
>> These are the rules that don't change.

80
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,540
>> But they're very different from real world physics.

81
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:46,140
>> Well, yeah, although they

82
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,860
don't have to be. I mean in some sense, you could argue

83
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:51,980
that a mark off decision process, what we described so far, these three

84
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:54,990
things In fact, do describe the universe, the states are, you know,

85
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:58,280
in the positions of all the atoms. The positions and velocities of all

86
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:01,370
the atoms in the universe. The transition miles as you do, take

87
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:04,150
certain positions in the world whatever they are how the state of the

88
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:07,390
universe changes in response to that. And the actions or whatever those set

89
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:11,840
of actions could be. And it can be probabilistic or it's not probabilistic.

90
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,460
>> It's definitely probabilistic. The transition

91
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:15,730
models are by their very definition probabilistic.

92
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:16,430
>> Gotcha.
