I have a rendering algorithm question for you. Here are 4 different optical

00:00:03,985 --> 00:00:09,070
illusions. Assume each object, in each of these scenes, is drawn separately.

For example, each block or square, each brick, each ring, and each dot is a

separate object. Which of these scenes most definitely could not be rendered

with the basic painter's algorithm?
