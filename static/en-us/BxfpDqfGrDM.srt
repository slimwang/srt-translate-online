00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The next thing I'd like you to do is add 
the same caching to the permalink pages.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Specifically the same way we did on the front page,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
display the age of the query that generated 
that page on the page somewhere.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I'll give you a demo on how this works on my site.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
If we go to one of these posts, we can see that 
this was recorded 0 seconds ago.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
As I reload this page, 
this timer increments.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
That's how it should work and if I'd already 
click on a--I'd probably go to a different post

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
we see that this one is 0 seconds ago.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
And as I reload this page, 
this one increments as well.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Now, in order for us to test this, we're 
probably going to submit some new posts.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'll make sure "/newpost" still works.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
And my net made it so--so you have to log in as spez to submit your posts,

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
so you guys would quit submitting spam to my site, 
but the rest of you should make this accessible.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
If we submit a new post like so,

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:58,000
this redirects to the permalink page 
where we see we are 0 seconds old.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
And when we go to the front page, 
we see our post here.

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
If we scroll down, we can see how old 
our caches, which is 55 seconds,

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,950
which is about how much time it 
took me to go out and ask Shawn

19
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:12,000
to stop submitting spam to my 
blog while I'm recording.

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
If we go back to this permalink, we 
can see that it updates accordingly.

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
When you've got that working, 
submit a URL to your blog here.
