1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:02,700
Let's check out Udacity's
website on a Mac.

2
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:08,859
See how the site dynamically changes
based on the size of the browser window.

3
00:00:08,859 --> 00:00:11,250
Now let's try it on an iPhone.

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:13,966
Does the homepage look exactly the same?

5
00:00:13,965 --> 00:00:15,059
No.

6
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:17,490
It does certainly display
the same information but

7
00:00:17,489 --> 00:00:20,369
it adapts to the size of the screen.

8
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:22,660
This is done by our
front-end developers And

9
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:26,059
in web developer jargon it's
called responsive design.

10
00:00:26,059 --> 00:00:30,799
If you've never heard this expression,
pause the video and Google for it.

11
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,869
Web developers have had
this problem since day one

12
00:00:33,869 --> 00:00:37,320
as you can freely change
the size of a browser window.

13
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,210
On the other hand,

14
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:42,859
the Android unbelievers have had to deal
with this almost since the beginning

15
00:00:42,859 --> 00:00:46,088
because of the huge number of
different Android devices out there.

16
00:00:46,088 --> 00:00:49,689
In the meantime, iOS developers
were happily programming in their

17
00:00:49,689 --> 00:00:53,679
ivory tower,
blissfully ignorant of the mess outside.

18
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:54,579
Why?

19
00:00:54,579 --> 00:00:58,789
Because until recently, there were
no other devices but iPhone and

20
00:00:58,789 --> 00:01:01,640
iPads and they all had the same size.

21
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:05,239
In the worst case scenario,
it would create a UI for iPhone and

22
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:06,130
another one for the iPad.

23
00:01:07,269 --> 00:01:11,189
The good old times are gone and now we
have to deal with different sizes of

24
00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:15,269
iPhones, iPads,
plus Apple TV and Apple Watch.

25
00:01:15,269 --> 00:01:19,269
The craft of creating adaptive
UIs is a necessary skill for

26
00:01:19,269 --> 00:01:23,629
any iOS developer and Auto Layout is
the most powerful tool in our belt.
