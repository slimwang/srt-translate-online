1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,969
Next we're going to prove that
the transformation just described

2
00:00:02,969 --> 00:00:07,080
does in fact reduce 3-CNF
satisfiability to independent set.

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:09,900
We start by arguing that
if f is satisfiable

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:13,680
then the output graph G has
an independent set of size m.

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,620
We'll let t be a satisfying
assignment for f.

6
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:22,240
In our example, let's take the one
that makes a true, b false, c false,

7
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:27,390
and d false, and
we'll set the complements accordingly.

8
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:31,730
Then, we choose one literal from
each clause in our original formula

9
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:35,390
that is true under the truth assignment,
and this will form our set S.

10
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:42,250
So in our example, I might choose this
a, this b bar and this b bar here.

11
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:45,910
Clearly the size of this set is m,
the number of clauses.

12
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:48,380
Because the vertices come
from distinct clauses,

13
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:52,670
there can't be any within clause edges
and because the truth assignment t

14
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:56,360
doesn't contradict itself,
there can't be any contradiction or

15
00:00:56,360 --> 00:01:01,280
between clause edges either,
therefore S must be an independent set.

16
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,060
And indeed it is in this example.

17
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:06,180
Let's prove the other direction next.

18
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:11,720
If G has an independent set of size m,
then the formula f, is satisfiable.

19
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:15,060
We start with an independent
set of size m in the graph.

20
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:18,120
Here I've marked an independent
set in our example graph.

21
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:21,760
The fact that there can be
no between-clause edges in S

22
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:25,330
implies that the literals in
S come from distinct clauses.

23
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:27,870
And the fact that there
are no between-clause edges

24
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:30,940
implies that the literals
in S are non-contradictory.

25
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:33,880
Therefore any assignment
consistent with the literals of S

26
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:37,138
will satisfy the original formula f.

27
00:01:37,138 --> 00:01:42,770
Here the choice of literals a, b and
c implies that a, b and c all be true.

28
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:46,870
We can set d however we like,
true or false, and

29
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:48,930
we still have a satisfying assignment.

30
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:53,940
So that completes the proof that
independent set is as hard as 3-CNF.

31
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:58,330
And that completes this chain here,
showing that both independent set and

32
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:00,680
Vertex Cover are NP-Complete.

33
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,320
Now we're going to branch out,
both in the tree here and

34
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:06,780
in the type of arguments we'll make,
by considering the Subset Sum problem.
