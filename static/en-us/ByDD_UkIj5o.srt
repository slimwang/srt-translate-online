1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,499
To find the side length of each of these squares, we actually took the square

2
00:00:03,499 --> 00:00:09,742
root of each of the areas. We can rewrite 4 as 2 squared. So we have the square

3
00:00:09,742 --> 00:00:14,362
root of 2 squared. This square root undoes the square power, leaving us with

4
00:00:14,362 --> 00:00:19,990
just two. The same thing happens for the square root of 25. We rewrite 25 as 5

5
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:25,726
squared, and then we take the square root of 5 squared, which equals 5. And the

6
00:00:25,726 --> 00:00:29,474
same is true for this third case. We have the square root of 81, which gives us

7
00:00:29,474 --> 00:00:33,879
9. This symbol is called a radical. And all three of these radicals are

8
00:00:33,879 --> 00:00:38,650
actually square roots. It's likely that you've seen these before, but you might

9
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:42,751
not have known there's an index of two here. The index indicates the route we

10
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:46,928
are taking since we don't always have to take a square root. We'll see other

11
00:00:46,928 --> 00:00:49,826
types of roots later but for now just know that all square roots have an index

12
00:00:49,826 --> 00:00:54,811
of two, but it's really rare that you'll ever see written. You'll usually just

13
00:00:54,811 --> 00:00:59,210
see it like this. This is a list of some perfect squares that you run into

14
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:03,640
often. You want to make sure that your comfortable recognizing these perfect

15
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:07,310
squaresm since they help us simplify radicals. Remember, this is the radical

16
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:12,500
symbol and in this case, the index is at 2 so we have a square root. We don't

17
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:16,124
list the 2 for square roots but we know it's there.
