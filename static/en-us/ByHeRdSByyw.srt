00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,860
Let's now take a look at the anatomy of an HTTP response. A response

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:07,900
includes a status line, which includes the

3
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:11,630
HTTP version and a response code, whether response

4
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:14,450
code may indicate a number of possible

5
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:18,700
outcomes. 100 response codes are typically informational and

6
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:22,110
200s indicate success. So an example, 200

7
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:25,250
response code is a common server response that

8
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:29,930
indicates okay. 300 response codes indicate redirection.

9
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:32,310
For example, a 301 response code indicates

10
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:37,310
that the page has moved permanently. 400s are errors, a well known one being 404

11
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:40,820
which is not found, and 500s indicate

12
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:44,970
server errors. Other headers, include the location, which

13
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:47,120
may be used for redirection. A server

14
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,650
which indicates server software. Allow which indicates the

15
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:52,960
HTTP methods that are allowed such as

16
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,650
get, head and so forth. Content-encoding, which

17
00:00:56,650 --> 00:00:58,630
describes how the content is encoded. For

18
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:02,855
example, if it's compressed. Content length, which indicates,

19
00:01:02,855 --> 00:01:07,989
how long the content is in terms of bytes. Expires which indicates, how long the

20
00:01:07,989 --> 00:01:10,865
content can be cached. And last-modified, which

21
00:01:10,865 --> 00:01:13,160
indicates the last time the page was modified.
