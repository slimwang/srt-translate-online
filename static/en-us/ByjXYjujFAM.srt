00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Since HTML is structured,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,000
we're going to want to break it up into words and punctuation and word-like elements,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
and we use the special term token to mean all of those.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
In general, a token can refer to a word, a string,

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
numbers, punctuation.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
It's the smallest unit of the output of a lexical analysis.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Remember, that's what we're currently working on.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Mostly tokens do not refer to white space,

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
which is just a formal way of referring to the spaces between words.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
We're going to be focusing on lexical analysis,

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
a process whereby we break down a string, like a sentence

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
or an utterance or a webpage, into a list of tokens.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
One string might contain many tokens

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
in the same way that one sentence might contain many words.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Here I've written 6 HTML tokens,

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
given them names on the left and examples on the right.

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Now, the naming of tokens is a bit arbitrary.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
In general, though, tokens are given uppercase names

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
to help us tell them apart from other words or variables.

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Here this left angle corresponds to an angle bracket

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
facing left presumably--not quite sure how to draw that.

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
The smaller end is to face.

23
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Left angle slash is a < followed by a /, division sign.

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
The right angle bracket, > facing to the right.

25
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Here's the angle. Here's the face.

26
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
The equal sign is just =.

27
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
A string is going to have double quotes around it,

28
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,000
and a word is anything else, welcome to my webpage, punctuation like that.

29
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Now, it turns out that the naming of tokens is not quite an arbitrary matter.

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You may think I'm as mad as a hatter.

31
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
No, that's a different story.

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
We're just going to go with these token names for now,

33
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
but if you were designing a system from the ground up,

34
00:02:09,000 --> 99:59:59,999
you can rename them to be anything you like.
