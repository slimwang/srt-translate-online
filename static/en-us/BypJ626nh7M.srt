1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,969
Now, let's do a quiz on RSA and
Diffie-Hellman.

2
00:00:02,969 --> 00:00:05,030
Check the statements that are true.

3
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:06,000
First statement.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,170
RSA is a block cipher in
which the plaintext and

5
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:14,210
ciphertext are integers between zero and
n-1 for some n.

6
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:15,120
Second.

7
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,840
If someone invents a very efficient
method to factor large integers,

8
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,428
then RSA becomes insecure.

9
00:00:21,428 --> 00:00:25,400
Third, the Diffie-Hellman
algorithm depends,

10
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:30,650
for its effectiveness, on the difficulty
of computing discrete logarithms.

11
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:34,870
Fourth, the Diffie-Hellman key
exchange protocol is vulnerable to

12
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:38,886
a man-in-the-middle attack, because it
does not authenticate the participants.

13
00:00:38,886 --> 00:00:39,565
Fifth.

14
00:00:39,565 --> 00:00:44,330
RSA and Diffie-Hellman are the only
public-key algorithms.
