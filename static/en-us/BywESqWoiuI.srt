1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,920
So which algorithm are we going
to show first to solve constraint

2
00:00:02,919 --> 00:00:04,230
satisfaction problems?

3
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:06,259
>> Well the stupid one first of course.

4
00:00:06,259 --> 00:00:07,359
>> I had to ask.

5
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:09,490
>> Then we'll add
intelligence as we need it.

6
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:11,199
>> Okay, we'll use simple search.

7
00:00:11,199 --> 00:00:13,660
States are defined by
the values assigned so far.

8
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:15,720
>> The initial state is
the empty assignment.

9
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:18,320
First we'll check to see if
the current assignment is the goal.

10
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,120
>> Then we will assign a value to
an unassigned variable that does not

11
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,960
conflict with the current assignment.

12
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,160
>> We call it a dead end if
there are no legal assignments.

13
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,660
In that case, we will back up
to the previous state, and

14
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:30,160
try another assignment.

15
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,539
>> And we recurse until we
either find the answer or

16
00:00:32,539 --> 00:00:35,500
try all the possible assignments and
report failure.

17
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:38,740
>> Let's make the algorithm
complete by doing an example.

18
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:39,370
>> Okay.

19
00:00:39,369 --> 00:00:41,259
Here's our map of Australia.

20
00:00:41,259 --> 00:00:43,724
>> We will work with
western Australia first.

21
00:00:43,725 --> 00:00:47,439
>> We could have one of three colors,
orange, green or blue.

22
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:48,659
>> I'll choose orange.

23
00:00:48,659 --> 00:00:49,579
>> Okay.

24
00:00:49,579 --> 00:00:51,939
What section do you want
us to look at next?

25
00:00:51,939 --> 00:00:53,719
>> How about the northern territory.

26
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:54,310
>> Great.

27
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:58,076
Since we chose orange for western
Australia, for northern territory,

28
00:00:58,076 --> 00:01:00,439
can have two colors, green or blue.

29
00:01:00,439 --> 00:01:01,649
>> Let's choose green.

30
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:06,349
>> Okay, now let's work with Queensland
next, it can be orange or blue.

31
00:01:06,349 --> 00:01:07,559
>> Let's choose blue.

32
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:12,010
>> But now we are in trouble, there
are no colors left for South Australia.

33
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:15,450
>> Okay, well that's a dead end,
let's back up and try the other branch,

34
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:18,109
where we only used orange and
green up to this point.

35
00:01:18,109 --> 00:01:20,489
>> And eventually we'll find
the answer this way, but

36
00:01:20,489 --> 00:01:23,059
we can improve the efficiency
of the algorithm significantly.
