00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,170
A dictionary is a collection
of key value pairs.

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:06,490
Dictionaries in Swift can be
initialized in a couple ways.

3
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:09,830
As with arrays,
you can use initializer syntax or

4
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:13,670
you can use a dictionary literal,
a list of values separated by commas.

5
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:17,660
Here between the brackets, we have the
key and value type separated by a colon,

6
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:20,740
and then a pair of parentheses
to signify the constructor.

7
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:24,350
You'll notice in the dictionary literal
the relationship between key in value is

8
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:25,548
also indicated with the colon.

9
00:00:25,548 --> 00:00:29,370
And many key-value pairs
are separated by commas.

10
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:30,920
Let's see another example.

11
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:33,750
Here's my very short dictionary
of animal life spans,

12
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:37,720
which I can initialize with initializer
syntax or with a dictionary literal.

13
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:40,845
And here, you can see the type of
the lifespan value is a range of ints.

14
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:46,610
By the way, these three dots here
represent the closed range operator.

15
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:49,930
For example, this range represents
the range from 20 to 30,

16
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:50,750
including 20 and 30.

17
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:55,350
The average lifespan of a ball nosed
dolphin in the wild is 20 to 30 years.

18
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:58,300
We'll see these range operators again
when we get to flow of control.
