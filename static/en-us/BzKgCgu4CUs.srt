1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,190
I'm here with Jason Barros
who's the program manager for

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:03,840
the Georgia Tech team here at Udacity.

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,780
He also formerly worked at
the education startup, EdMoto.

4
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:07,900
Thank you so much for
talking to us today.

5
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:09,370
>> Yeah absolutely David.

6
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:12,040
>> So the first thing I'd ask is that
many of our students in this class might

7
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:15,305
be interested in spinning up their
projects to a startup after this

8
00:00:15,305 --> 00:00:16,225
class is done.

9
00:00:16,225 --> 00:00:17,545
>> Okay.
>> What are some obstacles or

10
00:00:17,545 --> 00:00:20,145
some things to keep in
mind when dealing with

11
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:22,635
the business side of
educational technology?

12
00:00:22,635 --> 00:00:26,695
>> I mean, one, you really want to
go in and exhibit a lot of patience.

13
00:00:26,695 --> 00:00:30,375
It is really slow working
with universities and

14
00:00:30,375 --> 00:00:33,155
any educational institutions.

15
00:00:33,155 --> 00:00:36,555
There are a lot of things that they
need to consider that you may not

16
00:00:36,555 --> 00:00:37,950
necessarily be considering.

17
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:39,920
At the time you're
beginning your start up.

18
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,910
They have federal laws, state laws,
and you have to look out for

19
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:45,030
student's rights and privacy.

20
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:47,370
All that comes into play
anytime you want to work or

21
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:50,670
do anything on
an educational institution.

22
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:54,060
>> So what about ed tech when
it's not necessarily dealing with

23
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:54,700
academia though.

24
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:57,060
For example,
here at Udacity we do education but

25
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:00,530
we don't do it partnering with
a University except for Georgia Tech.

26
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:01,620
We do other programs.

27
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:05,730
So are there any specific considerations
when doing it outside of that overlap?

28
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:07,620
>> I mean one,
you really want to focus on,

29
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:11,940
what it is that you're trying to get
across or teach to the students.

30
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:15,560
While we're at Moto, you know our
primary concern was communication,

31
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,970
we wanted to make sure that
the communication flowed

32
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:21,450
between the teacher and the students,
and amongst the students themselves.

33
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:24,540
Here at Udacity, we're focused
a little bit more on the pedagogy of

34
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:26,530
actually teaching a particular subject.

35
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:29,150
So, we want to make sure that
what we're teaching, and

36
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:31,320
how we're teaching it
is particularly sound.

37
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,440
>> Some of those students who might be
interested in spinning their project up

38
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,570
into some kind of business or start up.

39
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:37,080
What would you say the first step is?

40
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,100
What do they need to do in the two or

41
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:41,300
three weeks after this semester
is over to move that along?

42
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:44,900
>> I mean, really start small and
be patient.

43
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:48,320
Share with your classmates and other
people at the educational institution

44
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:52,090
Institutions or just friends,
and present the idea to them.

45
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:56,730
And try to get a little feedback of
what they think is going to be viable.

46
00:01:56,730 --> 00:02:01,125
And then, putting together a minimum
viable product is really important.

47
00:02:01,125 --> 00:02:03,905
You don't want to go too far and

48
00:02:03,905 --> 00:02:07,125
try to build something that's going
to get a lot of users right away.

49
00:02:07,125 --> 00:02:08,354
It's going to take time.

50
00:02:09,365 --> 00:02:12,755
At Moto, we were a grassroots
organization where teachers talked to

51
00:02:12,755 --> 00:02:17,035
teachers about our product but it took
time to build up the number of users and

52
00:02:17,035 --> 00:02:22,135
after a while, the network worked such
that we were able to get millions and

53
00:02:22,135 --> 00:02:25,380
millions of students and
teachers on the platform.

54
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:28,390
But it took a long time and
a lot of patience.

55
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:29,750
>> Yeah, makes sense.

56
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:32,250
Also for the students who might want to
go into the business side of educational

57
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:35,480
technology, do you have any final
suggestions for them before we sign out?

58
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,760
>> Again, patience.

59
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:42,178
If you're going to work with any
kind of educational institution,

60
00:02:42,178 --> 00:02:43,890
they have their process.

61
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:47,837
And what I discovered here at Udacity,
working with Georgia Tech,

62
00:02:47,837 --> 00:02:51,180
is the business world moves
at the speed of light.

63
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:54,770
And unfortunately, the academic
world doesn't, and for good cause,

64
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:56,430
they need to be careful.

65
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:59,442
And they're trying to
protect their students,

66
00:02:59,442 --> 00:03:02,460
they're trying to protect
their institution.

67
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:06,192
They have state laws,
federal laws and all that stuff and

68
00:03:06,192 --> 00:03:09,160
working through that stuff,
it takes time.

69
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:13,670
And the more you can communicate and
be open with what you intend to do and

70
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:17,760
share with as many people as possible,
the better luck you're going to have.

71
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:23,290
>> I can say I participated kind of
peripherally in the NSF I-Corps process.

72
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:26,860
It looks to develop academic
research up into businesses.

73
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:28,060
And that's one of
the things they really,

74
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:30,230
really emphasize as well,
is customer discovery.

75
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:31,470
Go out and talk to your customers.

76
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:34,550
That one of the number one things that

77
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:37,200
trips up early start ups is they
assume they know their customer.

78
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,330
>> Right.
>> And they assume they know exactly

79
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:38,980
what they want.

80
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:40,780
They never talk to them
because we know what you want.

81
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:42,570
And they just assign their tool for
them.

82
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:43,330
And then hit market and

83
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:45,760
then find out they designed
something that no one wants.

84
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,650
>> Absolutely.
>> So really,

85
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:50,650
talking to the people who might want
to use the tool throughout would be,

86
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:52,570
I think, I agree, the first step to do.

87
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:55,015
>> Absolutely, and getting
the perspective is really important.

88
00:03:55,015 --> 00:03:57,705
We come in and
we want to disrupt everything.

89
00:03:57,705 --> 00:03:59,355
We want to disrupt education.

90
00:03:59,355 --> 00:04:01,745
We think we have a really
good idea in doing so and

91
00:04:01,745 --> 00:04:03,425
we have the best intentions.

92
00:04:03,425 --> 00:04:07,165
But oftentimes their perspective,
while sometimes even archaic,

93
00:04:07,165 --> 00:04:09,297
is still pretty valuable.

94
00:04:09,297 --> 00:04:11,935
You want to make sure you take that into
account because these are the people you

95
00:04:11,935 --> 00:04:12,905
are going to be working with.

96
00:04:12,905 --> 00:04:16,690
Yes we all want to serve the students
and make the world a better place.

97
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:19,450
But we need to do it
in a measured fashion.

98
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:20,649
>> Yeah.
Sounds good.

99
00:04:20,649 --> 00:04:22,430
All right, well thank you so
much for talking to us.

100
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:23,260
>> Yeah, any time, David.
