00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:05,100
The goals of Valient load balancing in the VL Two network are to spread

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:10,230
traffic evenly across the servers, and to ensure that traffic load

3
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:15,680
is balanced independently of the destinations of the traffic flows.

4
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:20,570
Field two achieves this by inserting an indirection level. Into the switching

5
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:25,800
hierarchy. When a switch at the access

6
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:32,430
layer wants to send traffic to a destination, it first selects a switch

7
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:37,940
at the indirection level to send the traffic at random. This intermediate switch

8
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:39,940
then forwards the traffic to the

9
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:44,180
ultimate destination Depending on the destination MAC

10
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:47,300
address, of the traffic. Subsequent flows might

11
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:51,270
pick different, indirection, points for the traffic,

12
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:58,290
at random. This notion of picking a random indirection point, to balance traffic

13
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:01,420
more evenly, across a topology, actually comes

14
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:05,300
from multi-processor architectures. And has been rediscovered

15
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:10,600
in the context of data centers. So, in this lesson we have explored how valiant

16
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:17,010
load balancing can be used on a slightly modified topology. To achieve

17
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:21,230
better load balance than in traditional fat tree networks,

18
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:24,990
without an interaction layer, and valiant load balancing. In the

19
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:29,920
next lesson we'll look at how a custom random topology

20
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,880
can make some of these traffic engineering problems even easier.
