1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:04,689
The more categories we have, the more degrees of freedom we have. And the

2
00:00:04,689 --> 00:00:09,638
larger our chi-squared statistic will be. We don't want to reject the null, in

3
00:00:09,638 --> 00:00:14,000
other words decide that the observed values are significantly different than

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,979
what we would have expected. Simply because there are a lot of categories.

5
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:23,460
Therefore, the more categories we have, we need a higher critical value in

6
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:29,119
order to reject the null hypothesis. For this distribution, the critical value

7
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:34,710
for 5% in the tail is further to the right. So this distribution has more

8
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:40,360
categories and therefore more degrees of freedom. All chi-squared distributions

9
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:45,290
are positively skewed, with the skewness decreasing as the number of categories

10
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:50,530
and therefore degrees of freedom increases. So you see that this red one, it

11
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:55,715
has nine degrees of freedom and the skewness is a lot less than for the

12
00:00:55,715 --> 00:01:00,190
chi-squared distribution with one degree of freedom, this yellow one. As the

13
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:05,150
degrees of freedom increase, the chi-squared distribution better approximates

14
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:08,460
normal distributions but they never become perfectly normal.
