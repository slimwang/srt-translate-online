00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,980
Now that we've talked a little bit more about changing coefficients and sine

2
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:07,748
issues of inequalities. Let's try a few problems. For each one of these

3
00:00:07,748 --> 00:00:11,814
solutions, I've already written the x for you. And in the orange box, I'd like

4
00:00:11,814 --> 00:00:15,910
you to fill in an inequality sign, so greater than, less than, greater than or

5
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:20,030
equal to, or less than or equal to. And in the teal box, I'd like you to fill in

6
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:22,103
the number that this is relating x to.
