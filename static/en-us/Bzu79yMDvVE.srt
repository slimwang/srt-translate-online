00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,594
If you chose y equals 45, excellent work. You have 45 hours to spend on the car

2
00:00:04,594 --> 00:00:09,361
rental, which means this amount can't change. On the graph, this means that the

3
00:00:09,361 --> 00:00:13,975
y value should be constant, it should always remain the same. If the y value is

4
00:00:13,975 --> 00:00:18,359
always 45 then that must mean I have a horizontal line. That would be this

5
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:23,924
choice. The first choice would mean that I only have $5 to spend, which we know

6
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:28,976
isn't true. The last choice would mean that, I drove the car for 45 hours, x is

7
00:00:28,976 --> 00:00:33,642
in hours, so x is 45. We know this isn't right. We know this equation isn't

8
00:00:33,642 --> 00:00:38,516
true. The amount of money we have doesn't depend on the number of hours, x. So

9
00:00:38,516 --> 00:00:39,815
this equation's out.
