00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,060
In astronomy, the attitude is the vertical angle, and the azimuth is the angle

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:06,524
around the horizon. You're job is to add another slider to also very the

3
00:00:06,524 --> 00:00:10,397
altitude angle of the light. To get it right you'll have to take into account

4
00:00:10,397 --> 00:00:12,762
that the x and z components need to be scaled down as the y component

5
00:00:12,762 --> 00:00:17,848
increases. So that the direction is normalized. In other words, the light

6
00:00:17,848 --> 00:00:21,845
direction should be x squared plus y squared plus z squared equals 1. Another

7
00:00:21,845 --> 00:00:25,475
handy formula you'll find is that, the cosine squared plus sine squared equals

8
00:00:25,475 --> 00:00:28,698
1. When you're done, the light should now operate with altitude and azimuth

9
00:00:28,698 --> 00:00:32,232
angles. Another way to think about is that altitude is similar to latitude on

10
00:00:32,232 --> 00:00:34,990
earth, azimuth is similar to the longitude.
