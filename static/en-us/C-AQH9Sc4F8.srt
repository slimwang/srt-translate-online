00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:03,594
There was, however, a reason that the panda population ended up as an

2
00:00:03,594 --> 00:00:07,527
endangered species. And that was because their population declined to a

3
00:00:07,527 --> 00:00:11,740
dangerously low number. More pandas were dying each year than being born since

4
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:15,510
they had lost huge portions of their habitat, making food and mates difficult

5
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:20,630
to find. Now, even though Gloria's Giant Panda Preserve is doing very well

6
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:25,850
rehabilitating its population, pandas are actually still endangered worldwide.

7
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:29,230
Preserves like hers are one of the ways that hopefully pandas will no longer be

8
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:33,760
endangered anymore someday. Their overall population will one day get to a much

9
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,904
healthier size. Which of these statements I've just written do you think makes

10
00:00:37,904 --> 00:00:42,390
the most sense in terms of the decline of the panda population? A constant

11
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:46,672
number of pandas died each year. The larger the population, the more pandas

12
00:00:46,672 --> 00:00:51,106
died each year. And the smaller the population the fewer died each year. Or

13
00:00:51,106 --> 00:00:55,075
finally, the larger the population the fewer pandas died each year, and the

14
00:00:55,075 --> 00:00:58,990
smaller the population, the more died each year.
