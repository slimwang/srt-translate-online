00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,945
Many lessons ago, we've talked about how to develop the public interface of the

2
00:00:03,945 --> 00:00:08,947
class, the methods that one might want to call on objects of the class. But

3
00:00:08,947 --> 00:00:12,605
we've always pretty much given to you the instance variables, because it turns

4
00:00:12,605 --> 00:00:18,617
out that picking the right instance variables isn't all that simple. While now,

5
00:00:18,617 --> 00:00:22,771
the time has come for you to do more of that yourself. And I'd like to give you

6
00:00:22,771 --> 00:00:27,564
a few rules of thumb, on how you might discover instance variables. To see how

7
00:00:27,564 --> 00:00:31,009
those rules of thumb work, let's have another look at the Car class from Lesson

8
00:00:31,009 --> 00:00:35,555
three. That class had an instance variable to hold the amount of gas in the

9
00:00:35,555 --> 00:00:43,508
tank. That was a method to add gas where the parameter value would be added to

10
00:00:43,508 --> 00:00:48,034
the gasInTank. Now the point that I want to make is that there is a certain

11
00:00:48,034 --> 00:00:54,474
pattern here. You have a quantity here. Here you make that quantity bigger. It

12
00:00:54,474 --> 00:00:59,220
also gets smaller when the car is driven. I like to call that pattern keeping a

13
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:05,055
total. And it occurs in many classes, not just the car. So then lots of times

14
00:01:05,055 --> 00:01:08,410
we have some class and you have some variable, which may be called total or

15
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:16,354
not. And then there's some methods that add to the total. Maybe some methods

16
00:01:16,354 --> 00:01:21,938
that clear the total, or subtract from it. I'll give you a few situations, and

17
00:01:21,938 --> 00:01:27,210
I'll ask you whether the pattern of keeping a total applies. So, would you keep

18
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:33,590
a total to model the account balance in a bank account? Friends in a social

19
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:39,816
network? A car odometer? Stripes in a flag. Check all where you think the

20
00:01:39,816 --> 00:01:42,000
pattern makes sense.
