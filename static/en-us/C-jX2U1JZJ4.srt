00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:05,930
Okay, so this is what I think. HTML response turns into Tokens which

2
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:10,200
turns into Nodes which turn into the DOM Tree. That one is true.

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:14,570
That's the process we just learned. In this one,

4
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:17,910
each token like startTag and endTag get converted into DOM nodes.

5
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:24,470
This is in fact false. A single DOM node will start with a startTag token and

6
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:28,040
end with an endTag token. Between the startTag and

7
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:34,270
endTag tokens come other tokens which will define one DOM node. In this one,

8
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:40,060
Nodes contain all relevant information about the HTML element. This is true.

9
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:44,120
The information will be described using tokens. And the last one,

10
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:49,520
Nodes are connected into a DOM tree based on token hierarchy. This one is true.

11
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,020
If another set of startTag and endTag tokens come between startTag and

12
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:56,580
endTag, you have a node inside a node,

13
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:59,650
and this is how we define the hierarchy of the DOM tree.

14
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,410
Lastly, it's also worth noting that DOM construction is incremental.
