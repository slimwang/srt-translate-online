1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,698
We're going to use these prime factorizations to find the greatest common factor

2
00:00:04,698 --> 00:00:09,395
for 216 and 192. The greatest common factor for these two terms, is the product

3
00:00:09,395 --> 00:00:13,670
of the lowest power of each of the factors that appears in each term. For

4
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:18,134
example, if we looked at 12, and 44, we could see that they both share a two to

5
00:00:18,134 --> 00:00:22,380
the second power. They don't share a power of three, and they don't share a

6
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:27,357
power of 11. So two squared, or four, would be the greatest common factor for 12

7
00:00:27,357 --> 00:00:31,880
and 44. So what do you think is the greatest common factor for these two

8
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:36,546
numbers? Write your answer in this box. You'll also want to simplify your

9
00:00:36,546 --> 00:00:41,050
answer. For example, if you think two cubed times five is the greatest common

10
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:45,466
factor, you would really write that as 40, since two cubed is eight, and eight

11
00:00:45,466 --> 00:00:46,454
times five is 40.
