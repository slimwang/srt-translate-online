1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:04,140
So now that we know that each
application saves a lot of memory.

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:07,890
And there is much less physical
memory than all the applications

3
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:09,720
actually can access.

4
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:14,110
The question is where
is the missing memory?

5
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:17,060
So let's say we have one
application with four pages.

6
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:19,680
Another application with
let's say four pages.

7
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,190
A physical memory with let's
say four physical frames.

8
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:27,060
Let's say that each of these
applications is actually using all of

9
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,190
its pages.

10
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:29,970
Because there are only four.

11
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:33,610
In this application there
is a four entry page table.

12
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:39,620
That for every page tells us
which frame contains it and

13
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:41,360
it could be any frame in memory.

14
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:47,920
This application also has some of
its pages in physical memory but

15
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,010
obviously there is not enough physical
memory for all of these pages.

16
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:54,470
So the question is where
are the rest of them.

17
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:58,030
And the answer is,
they're on the hard disk.

18
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:01,535
So some of these pages
are not actually in memory,

19
00:01:01,535 --> 00:01:05,280
they're actually stored on
the hard drive in the system.

20
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:12,340
These pages can not be directly accessed
by the processor because the processor

21
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:16,080
can only really access through loads and
stores in the physical memory.

22
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:20,660
So if the processor ever tries to access
one of these they need to be brought

23
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:22,910
from the disk before
they can be accessed.

24
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:25,690
We will shortly see how that works,
but for

25
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:30,740
now just remember that because the
virtual memory of all the applications

26
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:35,790
can significantly exceed the size of the
physical memory, some of the memory that

27
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:41,510
the applications think they have is on
the disk, not really in memory at all.
