1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
For the sum procedure to be useful and not do nothing,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,600
we need to change it.

3
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:07,262
We need to add a return statement so we actually get an output.

4
00:00:07,262 --> 00:00:10,000
So add the return statement, return a,

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and now we'll re-ask the same quiz.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,308
I'm going to erase the previous answer because the answer is no longer nothing.

7
00:00:16,308 --> 00:00:18,000
I guess I've hinted at that.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,815
You can cross this one out from your consideration,

9
00:00:20,815 --> 00:00:22,600
but see which of the others are correct,

10
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,617
and I should note it's still a tricky question.

11
00:00:24,617 --> 00:00:27,063
More than one of these is correct.
