1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:04,380
The first is hQuery where
the goal is simplicity,

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:09,510
in part by working with a limited data
set that is well standardized because

3
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:14,850
of its key role in quality measurement
and other common clinical activities.

4
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:19,730
As you can see here, hQuery provides
an attractive modern point-and-click

5
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:22,750
interface called the hQuery composer

6
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:27,040
to the query builder who might even be
a nontechnical health care provider.

7
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:28,110
At the same time,

8
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:32,189
the possible queries that can be
formulated are somewhat limited.

9
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:37,230
HQuery uses a simple patient
information model as shown here

10
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:41,430
to facilitate query building
by nontechnical users.

11
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:47,430
Queries are forwarded to an hQuery
gateway located at each source system

12
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:52,090
which receives them in a standard format
and forwards them to an adapter which

13
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:56,510
knows how to translate the query for
the source system, which might, for

14
00:00:56,510 --> 00:01:01,490
example, provide a CCDA
document in response and

15
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:05,830
can convert it into the standard
data model for transmission back.

16
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:08,060
You should watch a video to learn more.

17
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:10,000
The URL is in the instructor's notes.

18
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:15,270
HQuery presents its results
in an attractive way

19
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:18,770
that in this example includes
a frequency distribution,

20
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:23,590
a distribution over time, and a
geographic distribution of the results.
