1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,823
So you can find entire books, entire courses on how to go about analyzing and optimizing code.

2
00:00:08,823 --> 00:00:13,394
The real point is simply that you should have a systematic optimization process.

3
00:00:13,394 --> 00:00:17,645
So I'm going to introduce one systematic optimization process called APOD.

4
00:00:17,645 --> 00:00:23,958
APOD stands for Analyze, Parallelize, Optimize, and Deploy.

5
00:00:23,958 --> 00:00:27,277
And the real point to this process is that it's a cycle.

6
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:30,274
There's nothing really new here. This is just good software engineering discipline.

7
00:00:30,274 --> 00:00:35,194
But the point is that we want to break down the process of optimization into several steps

8
00:00:35,194 --> 00:00:38,941
and to remember not to short-circuit the really important one,

9
00:00:38,941 --> 00:00:43,231
which is to actually deploy the optimizations that you've made into the real world,

10
00:00:43,231 --> 00:00:48,254
get some feedback, see how they're performing on real-world data sets.

11
00:00:48,254 --> 00:00:54,277
It's too easy to spend all your time circling around these 2 steps

12
00:00:54,277 --> 00:01:00,508
and optimize in a vacuum, forgetting that actually you might be able to get a bigger speedup

13
00:01:00,508 --> 00:01:04,471
by doing a better job of thinking about what you're trying to accomplish

14
00:01:04,471 --> 00:01:09,083
or by going out and taking a partial optimization into the real world

15
00:01:09,083 --> 00:01:12,349
and seeing how it performs and getting guidance from that.

16
00:01:12,349 --> 00:01:16,112
So this is really nothing more than good software engineering discipline.

17
00:01:16,112 --> 00:01:17,950
Let's take these steps 1 at a time.
