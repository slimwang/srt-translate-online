Karl Lieberherr has developed the Law of Demeter,

2
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:09,170
which suggest limits on the classes that can be refered to by a given method.

3
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:12,440
Imagine that you are writing code for a method m of an object o.

4
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:15,110
Your code can refer to features of other objects or

5
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:18,250
features, either in attribute or a method.

6
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:22,180
The question is, what other objects is it reasonable for you to refer to?

7
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:25,760
Answering everything can lead to typely, tightly coupled systems.

8
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,120
Instead of everything,

9
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:31,390
Lieberherr proposed some limits to the objects that can be referred to.

10
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:33,990
You can refer to features in O itself.

11
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:36,040
You can refer to features.

12
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:42,580
In classes that are the, the classes for the parameters that go to the MethodM.

13
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:48,450
You can refer to any objects created or instantiated within M, and you can

14
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:54,770
refer to the objects O's direct component objects, that is, its attributes.

15
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:57,430
Obeying the Law of Demeter reduces coupling, but

16
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:00,670
sometimes requires introduction of extra wrapper classes.
