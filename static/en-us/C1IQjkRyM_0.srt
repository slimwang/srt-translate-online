1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:02,640
So this example,
this robot that's going down the hall,

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:06,689
it's got this noise sensor, this is
perfect for sort of a probabilistic

3
00:00:06,689 --> 00:00:11,712
Bayesian filter based tracker, and
the reason is, first of all, it's

4
00:00:11,712 --> 00:00:15,870
going to have some continuous belief
about where it thinks it might be.

5
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:17,670
Right?
So that's its belief, it's distribution,

6
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:22,290
it's posterior about where it thinks,
and it's measurements are noisy, and

7
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:26,450
furthermore, it's really unlikely
that depending upon those

8
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:30,270
measurements that it will have a nice
Gaussian belief about where things are.

9
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:32,049
It's belief is going to
be whatever it is.

10
00:00:32,049 --> 00:00:35,900
So we're going to make make use
of a particle filter to do this.

11
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:36,720
All right?

12
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:40,230
What you're seeing here,
is this is the prior density.

13
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:42,610
So here's our little,
should we name our robot?

14
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:46,780
Sure, what's a good name see, I would
use some like R2D2 kind of name but

15
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:48,620
then I would get sued by George Lucas.

16
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:50,520
So we'll call it R3D3.

17
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:56,666
Okay, so R3D3 is sitting over here and
this here,

18
00:00:56,666 --> 00:01:01,240
this is his prior belief
about where it is right now.

19
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:05,093
We have no idea how it got that value,
this is it's random distribution, and

20
00:01:05,093 --> 00:01:08,710
you can see it's a pretty uniform
distribution of particles.

21
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:12,244
Now the sensor reaches out and
it gets the measurement and

22
00:01:12,244 --> 00:01:16,260
let's just suppose it sticks its
stick out and it sees a hole.

23
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:18,750
What that means is,
the stick doesn't run into anything, so

24
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:20,530
it says, it's a hole.

25
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:26,210
Now using the sensor model,
the robot has to evaluate

26
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:30,830
not where it thinks it is but
first, what's the probability that

27
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:35,255
I would see a hole if I was
at each of these locations?

28
00:01:35,255 --> 00:01:39,580
So,after the robot sees the hole,
what it has to evaluate is

29
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:44,570
what is the likelihood that I would've
seen a hole, if I was at this location?

30
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:49,400
So these values here, these are not the
probability that I'm at that location,

31
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:53,790
given that I saw a hole, it's
the probability that I would see a hole,

32
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:55,780
given that I was at that location.

33
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:59,270
So the reason that it's
highest in the middle

34
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:04,150
is because even if I've got a wiggly
stick over here, the likelihood

35
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:08,220
that I see a hole is higher than if I'm
sort of at the edge of the hole, right,

36
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:11,460
because then I might sometimes run into
the wall, sometimes run into the hole,

37
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:14,980
and that's why I have this nice
tight little distribution like that.

38
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:15,550
Okay?

39
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:18,000
So remember,
that's not p of x given the hole,

40
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,590
it's the probability that I would
see a hole given that I was an x.

41
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:22,750
Then what do we do?

42
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:27,180
Well, in a particle filter
we just multiply p of z,

43
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:33,850
given x, probability the hole given x,
times my prior distribution for

44
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:37,780
everyone of these xs, okay?

45
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:41,740
So that's what this
distribution is down here,

46
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:48,230
that is the multiplication of
the prior times the likelihood,

47
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:52,790
and in math, remember, the belief is
proportional to the prediction, or

48
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:59,480
my belief prior, that's this here, times
my likelihood, that's this value here,

49
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:04,370
and then I have to normalize the whole
thing in order to get a new belief.

50
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:05,790
Okay, that's why I'm doing that.
