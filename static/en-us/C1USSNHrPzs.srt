00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Here's my answer--very simple--iterate over over the rows

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
and over the squares in each row print one out.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
A comma at the end of the print statement says put in a space but not a new line.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 99:59:59,999
At the end of each row, that's where I put in a new line.
