00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,580
And just wrapping things up here, I want to cover a few of

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:08,700
the other special selections besides .enter using a Venn Diagram that

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:14,210
Mike Bostock uses in his great blog post, Thinking with Joins.

4
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:16,630
We can think of these circles and

5
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:20,870
their overlap representing the state of things right after our

6
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:25,190
data bind when we're considering what type of special selection to make.

7
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:30,260
The left circle here, shown in blue, represents our data file.

8
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:32,720
In this case data.tsv.

9
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:37,590
And the red circle here represents our HTML page or

10
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:41,440
SVG elements on that page indexed.html.

11
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:47,730
And the intersection between these two represents the HTML elements

12
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:52,770
currently on our page that have already been bound to and associated with

13
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:59,300
a row from our data file in the previous join made with .data.

14
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:03,600
And knowing what I've mentioned about the .enter selection,

15
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,790
everything in this blue corresponds to

16
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:13,270
all the rows of our data that are not yet present on our webpage.

17
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:17,950
Which we will then add elements to a webpage for each one.

18
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:21,430
The purple can be thought of as the update selection.

19
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:26,060
And while there's not an explicit .update we need to call,

20
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:31,950
this section simple corresponds to elements already on our page from our

21
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:37,260
prior selection to the data bind, which you might update their data values, or

22
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:43,893
their styling implicitly by leaving out a .enter or .exit selection.
