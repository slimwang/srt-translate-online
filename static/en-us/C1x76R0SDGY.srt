1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,170
Okay, so actually I haven't told you, so

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:07,630
far, we're going to talk about it,
what a system call is.

3
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:10,840
But let's sort of think about
what would be a system call.

4
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:15,080
We said the operating system controls
access to protected resources.

5
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:18,850
So if the operating system is going to
control access to protected resources,

6
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:23,590
and if you are one of those
applications that needs this resource,

7
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:25,830
you have to ask the operating system.

8
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:28,610
When you ask the operating
system the way you do that is

9
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:33,040
by making a call to the operating
system, and that's called a system call.

10
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:35,910
As I said we haven't discussed this, but

11
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:40,480
I want you to sort of think about
this question here that says system

12
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:45,510
calls allow application code to
gain access to operating system,

13
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:49,120
and particular resources that
are controlled by the operating system.

14
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:53,170
A system call is different
than a regular call.

15
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:56,040
When you run code, you make function and

16
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:59,370
procedure calls all the time
to do control transfer,

17
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:03,046
to go from one part of the program
to another part of the program.

18
00:01:03,046 --> 00:01:08,240
Here we are going from the user part
of the program to the operating system,

19
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,330
and when you make a call
like that it is special and

20
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:14,510
it is called a protected procedure call.

21
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:17,990
So a protected procedure
call is different.

22
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:21,270
And the question that you should
think about at this point is

23
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:23,030
how different is it?

24
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:28,130
One way to sort of characterize
the difference is the cost of a call.

25
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:31,150
So I want you to think about

26
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:35,590
the cost differences between
these two kinds of calls.

27
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:39,956
When the system call is how a user or
application code actually goes into

28
00:01:39,956 --> 00:01:44,031
the operating system to gain access
to some resource it needs, and

29
00:01:44,031 --> 00:01:45,216
things like that.
