00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,665
Okay for this one you had 5 parts shaded, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, out of 12 parts total.

2
00:00:05,786 --> 00:00:11,348
If you count up all the triangles you'll get 12. Here I have 3 boxes that are

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:17,174
shaded out of 10 boxes in the whole temple, and in this cross I have 7 triangles

4
00:00:17,186 --> 00:00:22,659
that are shaded out, of 20 triangles total. I got 20 really quickly because I

5
00:00:22,671 --> 00:00:27,598
noticed that there are 4 triangles in 1 box, and I had 5 different boxes, so I

6
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:29,551
just did 4 times 5, which is 20.
