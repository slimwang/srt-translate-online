00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,680
Okay, Michael, so we've gotten through that quiz and you see

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:06,090
that Bayes' rule actually gives you some information. It actually helps

3
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:08,860
you make a decision. So I'm going to suggest that, that whole

4
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:12,090
exercise we went through was actually our way of walking through

5
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:16,790
an algorithm. So here's a particular algorithm that follows from what

6
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:18,220
we just did. And let me just write that down for

7
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:20,670
you. All right, so here's the algorithm, Michael, so it's very

8
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:25,590
simple. For each H in H, that is, each candidate hypothesis

9
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:27,090
in our in our hypothesis space, simply

10
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:30,170
calculate the probability of that hypothesis given

11
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:33,570
the data W which we know is equal to the probability of the data given

12
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:36,210
that hypothesis times the prior probability of

13
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:38,300
the hypothesis, divided by the probability of

14
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:40,490
the data. And then simply output whichever

15
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:43,630
hypothesis has maximum probability. Does that make sense?

16
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:44,350
>> Yeah.

17
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:46,560
>> Okay, so I do want to point out that since

18
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:50,710
all we care about is computing the argmax, as before,

19
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:53,164
we don't actually ever have to compute that little bit

20
00:00:53,164 --> 00:00:56,150
so, and that's a good thing because we don't always know

21
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:58,500
what the prior probability on the data is, so we

22
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:02,170
can ignore it for the purposes of finding the maximal hypothesis.

23
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:05,910
>> So the place you removed it from, it seems like that's not actually valid,

24
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:08,880
because it's not the case that the probability of h given d equals, it's the

25
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,800
probability of d given h times the probability of h. It just means that we

26
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,340
don't care what the probability is when

27
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:15,630
we go to compute the argmax. That's right,

28
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:20,970
so, in fact, it's probably better to say that I'm going to approximate

29
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:23,000
the probability hypothesis given the data

30
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,660
by just calculating the probability of the

31
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:28,540
data given the hypothesis times the probability of the hypothesis and just go

32
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:30,560
ahead and ignore the denominator. Precissely

33
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,300
because it doesn't change hte maximal age.

34
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:35,100
>> Yeah, so it's, it's nice that that goes away.

35
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:38,220
>> Right, because it's hard to know, often what

36
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:40,440
the prior, what the prior probability over the data is.

37
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:40,940
>> It would

38
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:42,840
be nice if we didn't have to worry about the other one, either.

39
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,120
>> Which other one?

40
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,710
>> The probability of h, where's that coming from?

41
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:48,200
>> right, so where does that come from? So that's

42
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,980
a deep philosophical question. Sometimes it's just something you believe, and

43
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:54,540
you can write down. And sometimes it's a little harder. And

44
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:56,820
that's actually good that you bring that up. When we compute,

45
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:02,080
our probabilities this way so it's actually got a name,

46
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:05,360
it's the MAP or the maximum a posteriori hypothesis and that

47
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,180
makes sense, it's the biggest posterior given all of your

48
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:11,140
priors. But you're right Michael that often it's just as hard

49
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:14,470
to say anything particular about your prior over the hypothesis

50
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:16,740
as it is to say something about your prior of the

51
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:21,040
data and, so it is very common to drop that. And,

52
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,500
in dropping that, we're actually computing the argmax over the probability

53
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,800
of the data given the hypothesis. And,

54
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:31,870
that is known as the maximum likelihood hypothesis.

55
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:34,750
>> I guess you can't call it the maximum

56
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:37,410
A priori hypothesis, because then it would also be MAP.

57
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:40,990
>> Exactly, although I've never thought about that before.

58
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:42,570
By the way, just just to be clear, we're

59
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:45,170
not really dropping this, in this case, what we

60
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:50,790
really said, is that, our prior belief is that

61
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:53,550
all hypotheses are equally likely. So we

62
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:56,050
have a uniform prior that is, the probability

63
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:58,730
of any given hypothesis is exactly the same

64
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:00,980
as the probability as any other given hypothesis.

65
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:02,820
>> I see, so you're saying if, if we assume

66
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:06,140
that they all are equally likely, then, the choice of

67
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:09,070
hypothesis doesn't change that term at all, the p of

68
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:11,540
h term, so it really is equivalent to just ignoring it.

69
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:13,190
>> Exactly, in some constant, we don't even have

70
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:15,701
to know what the constant is. But whatever it is,

71
00:03:15,701 --> 00:03:18,298
it's the same everywhere and therefor it doesn't affect

72
00:03:18,298 --> 00:03:21,660
the other terms or, in particular, affect the argmax computation.

73
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,420
>> So that's actually pretty cool right?

74
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:24,990
Once you think about what we just did.

75
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:26,656
We just took something that was very

76
00:03:26,656 --> 00:03:29,900
hard. Computing the probability of a hypothesis given

77
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,970
the data and turned it into something

78
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:35,670
much easier that is... Computing the probability of

79
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:37,610
you seeing the data labels given a particular

80
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:40,740
hypothesis and it turns out that those are

81
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:42,970
effectively the same thing if you don't have

82
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:46,330
a strong prior. So that's really cool, so we're

83
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:48,980
done right? We now know how to find

84
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:51,620
the best hypothesis You're just finding the most likely

85
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:53,920
hypothesis or the most probable one and that

86
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,460
turns out to be the same thing as just

87
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:58,010
simply finding the hypothesis that best matches the

88
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:01,021
data. We're done its all, its easy. Everythings good.

89
00:04:01,021 --> 00:04:03,212
>> So,the math seems very nice and pretty and easy

90
00:04:03,212 --> 00:04:06,050
but is isn't it hiding a lot of work to actually

91
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:07,450
do these computations?

92
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:09,610
>> Well, sure well well look you know

93
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:11,400
how to do multiplication that's pretty easy right?

94
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:11,500
>> [LAUGH].

95
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,500
>> So I guess the only hard part

96
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,440
is we have to look at every single hypothesis.

97
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,990
>> Yeah, that's just a slight, little, you know, issue.

98
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:22,390
>> So, mathematically meaningful, but computationally questionable.

99
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:22,990
>> Hm.

100
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:27,450
>> So, the big point there, is that it's not practical. Well, unless the

101
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:31,100
number of hypotheses is really, really small. But as we know, a lot of

102
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:34,820
the hypotheses spaces that we care about, like, for example, linear separators,

103
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:37,860
are actually infinite. And so it's going to be very difficult to use

104
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:40,960
this algorithm directly. But despite all that, I think that there's still

105
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,490
something important that we get out of thinking about it this way

106
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:45,680
in just the same way that we get something important out of

107
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,750
thinking about vc dimension. Even if we're not entirely sure how to

108
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:52,220
compute it in some particular case. This really gives us a gold

109
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:54,090
standard, right? We have an algorithm,

110
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:56,250
at least a conceptual algorithm, that tells

111
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:59,160
us what the right thing to do would be if we're

112
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,900
capable of computing it directly. So, that's good because we can

113
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:05,890
maybe prove things about this and compare results that we get

114
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:09,500
from some Real live algorithms to what we might expect to

115
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:12,320
get but also it turns out it's pretty cute because it

116
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,670
helps us to say other things about what it is we

117
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:17,630
actually expect to learn. And I'm going to give you a couple

118
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:21,050
examples of those just to sort of prove my point, sound good?

119
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:21,830
>> Yeah.

120
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:22,340
>> Okay.
