1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,380
We'll be experimenting with D3.js
on a webpage for this class.

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:06,810
So that way,
you can get familiar with methods and

3
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:09,240
syntax that comes along with D3.

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,010
Because D3 JS is a client-side
JavaScript library,

5
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:15,390
it means that you can load
it on any webpage and

6
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:19,250
start selecting different elements
on the page and manipulating them.

7
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:21,900
First, you'll want to
open up a web browser.

8
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:24,880
I'll be using Google's Chrome
browser throughout this course.

9
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,040
But any modern web browser will
have all the same functionality of

10
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:30,970
a JavaScript console and
in HTML inspector so

11
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:33,750
that way you can see the different
elements that are on the page.

12
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:37,555
Once you have your browser opened, you
can open up the JavaScript console by

13
00:00:37,555 --> 00:00:41,690
hitting Cmd+Opt+J, that's for Mac users.

14
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:45,840
If you're a Windows or a Linux users,
you'll want to hit Ctrl+Shift+J.

15
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,790
Now, if you are using a different web
browser, keep in mind that some of these

16
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:51,870
commands might be slightly different for
your browser.

17
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:53,970
This is the JavaScript console, and

18
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:59,430
if I click on the elements tab up here,
I can go and see the HTML inspector.

19
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:02,180
The HTML inspector allows
me to see the different

20
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:04,440
HTML DOM nodes that are on the page.

21
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,950
Another way of bringing up
this JavaScript console

22
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:09,920
is by going up to the menu in Chrome.

23
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,780
You can click on view and then you
can scroll down to developer and

24
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:17,010
then click on JavaScript console.

25
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:21,550
So now let's see how we could start
using D3 in our JavaScript console.

26
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:23,040
Let's start by loading
it on to the page.
