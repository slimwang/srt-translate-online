1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,380
Personality research consistently shows, that different personalities prefer

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:09,110
different careers and college majors. In fact, college counseling centers often

3
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:12,850
administer one personality questionnaire When trying to guide students, we are

4
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:18,919
still searching for a career that fits them. That questionnaire is Myers-Briggs

5
00:00:18,919 --> 00:00:24,360
type indicator, or the MBTI for short. The MBTI consists of opposing

6
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:31,030
personality types. Extraversion and intraversion. Thinking and feeling.

7
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:35,793
Intuition and sensing. In judging and perceiving. In other words people are

8
00:00:35,793 --> 00:00:41,025
classified, either as an extrovert or an introvert. Or as a thinker or as a

9
00:00:41,025 --> 00:00:46,002
feeler, and so on. For example, intuition and sensing describes how people

10
00:00:46,002 --> 00:00:51,890
prefer to take in information, focused on what is real and actual. So sensing.

11
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:58,032
Or on patterns and meanings and data. So intuition. Whereas thinking and

12
00:00:58,032 --> 00:01:02,384
feeling describes how people prefer to make decisions based on logical analysis

13
00:01:02,384 --> 00:01:06,672
to thinking, or prefer making decisions guided by the concern for the emotional

14
00:01:06,672 --> 00:01:13,620
impact it has on others. So feeling. Now, personality types are different than

15
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:18,100
forms of dimensions because they categorize people as either one type or the

16
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:23,860
other. Rather than on the continuum from high to low, like we see with the big

17
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:29,612
five. Researchers using the MBTI have found that extraverts prefers social and

18
00:01:29,612 --> 00:01:35,977
enterprising major such as physiology or social work even elementary education.

19
00:01:35,977 --> 00:01:40,393
Whereas thinking types prefer realistic and investigative majors such as,

20
00:01:40,393 --> 00:01:46,725
mechanical engineering or archaeology. Feeling types prefer artistic and social

21
00:01:46,725 --> 00:01:50,369
majors such as art, music or theater.
