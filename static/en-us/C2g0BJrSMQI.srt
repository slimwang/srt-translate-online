Eta squared ranges from zero to one. If eta squared is zero, this means that

2
00:00:04,476 --> 00:00:09,351
all group means are exactly the same. The distance between group means can

3
00:00:09,351 --> 00:00:14,712
never be negative. Therefore, it can never be lower than zero. But if eta

4
00:00:14,712 --> 00:00:20,950
squared is one, the between group variability equals the total variability.

5
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:25,050
Meaning there is no within group variability. The sum of squares for between

6
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:28,170
group variability can never be greater than the sum of squares for total

7
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:32,956
variability. It can only be equal to it, when the sum of squares for within

8
00:00:32,956 --> 00:00:38,563
group variability is zero. That means that eta squared is simply the sum of

9
00:00:38,563 --> 00:00:45,040
squares for between group variability divided by itself, which equals one.
