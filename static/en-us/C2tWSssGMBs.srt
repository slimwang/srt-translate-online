1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,590
So how the machine behaves is a large collection

2
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:07,650
of rules that look like if the variables are set in a certain way,

3
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:10,200
then this is what happens next.

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:14,130
Now the question is can we use a Boolean formula to express an if-then statement?

5
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:17,110
And I will actually let you figure that out in our next quiz.

6
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:19,460
So I'm going to give you the following Boolean formula,

7
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:22,570
x1 and x2 and x3.

8
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:25,280
We're going to do a big not over this

9
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:31,960
or x4 and x5 and x6.

10
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:35,270
And I'm going to give you 4 cases now to look at,

11
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:39,320
so we're going to look at this part here and this part here,

12
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:42,510
and I'm not including this big not here,

13
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:46,620
so I'm just looking at how x1, x2, and x3 evaluates;

14
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:49,240
the not is not included.

15
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:51,840
So there are 2 possibilities of course.

16
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,000
It can be either true, or it can be false,

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,780
and those variables over here, completely independent over here,

18
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:01,330
they can of course also be true and false,

19
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:04,970
so overall, we have 4 different cases,

20
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:07,330
and what I would like you to quickly tell me is

21
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:09,840
in which of these 4 cases here,

22
00:01:09,840 --> 99:59:59,999
the whole Boolean formula is satisfied.
