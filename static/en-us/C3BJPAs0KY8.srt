00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,240
There is a little bit of different solution this inequality. We could add 2 in

2
00:00:04,252 --> 00:00:08,290
our answer now, so we need a different way of writing the answer in a set of

3
00:00:08,302 --> 00:00:12,505
parenthesis. We're going to use brackets. We use a bracket to indicate that the

4
00:00:12,517 --> 00:00:16,580
variable x could take on that value. The same is true on the number line. x can

5
00:00:16,592 --> 00:00:20,915
now equal to, so we put a bracket in set of a parenthesis. And again, notice I

6
00:00:20,927 --> 00:00:24,920
have an open parenthesis for infinity. The interval is considered to be open on

7
00:00:24,932 --> 00:00:28,840
this end, because we can always count higher to a number. We can't really reach

8
00:00:28,852 --> 00:00:32,840
positive infinity, so we use a parenthesis. In general, for less than or equal

9
00:00:32,852 --> 00:00:36,810
to signs and greater than or equal to signs, you will always use a bracket. For

10
00:00:36,822 --> 00:00:41,475
less than and greater than, you'll use parentheses. And of course, parentheses

11
00:00:41,487 --> 00:00:46,630
always go around positive infinity or negative infinity. Let's put these symbols

12
00:00:46,642 --> 00:00:47,030
to use.
