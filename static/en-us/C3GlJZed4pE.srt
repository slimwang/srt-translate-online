1
00:00:00,212 --> 00:00:04,270
Ember CLI is recommended by the ember
team as the de facto way of building and

2
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:06,130
developing a new amber application.

3
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:07,410
It's incredibly powerful, and

4
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:10,460
we'll be using it to generate our
ember app, create new template, and

5
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:13,230
component files, and
maintain and update new routes.

6
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:15,660
You can do a lot more than
just these tasks though.

7
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:16,498
So let's see what it can do.

8
00:00:16,498 --> 00:00:20,030
Running ember --help gives us a list
of subcommands with their own set

9
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:21,170
of options.

10
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:22,440
There's a lot to scroll through but

11
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:25,580
we can do just one comment at
a time by using the help flag.

12
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:27,520
And passing the name of the sub command.

13
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:29,910
I'm going to clear the screen so
that there's not all this clutter.

14
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:31,390
Then to see just the new command.

15
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:33,895
Run ember -- help new.

16
00:00:33,895 --> 00:00:36,800
Ember new is the command we
will use to create a new app.

17
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,710
Notice that running this command
will create a new directory.

18
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:42,280
I like to keep stuff I work
on in a project's directory.

19
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,610
So when i use ember to
create a new project,

20
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:46,390
it'll create the app's folder in here.

21
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:48,800
Let's create our app.

22
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,550
A name is required, so
let's give it the name UdaciMeals.

23
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:55,220
This command does a number of things.

24
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:57,880
It creates an Ember app's
default file structure.

25
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,600
Creates an initial commit.

26
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,070
Runs npm install.

27
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:02,890
And runs bower install.

28
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:05,480
Installing the dependencies can
take quite a while, so I'm just

29
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:08,430
going to pause for a second until
it's finished installing everything.

30
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:09,650
And it's finished.

31
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:11,040
Let me clear the screen again.

32
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,910
Another thing that Ember CLI
includes is a built-in server.

33
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:15,820
We don't have to worry about
installing a server or

34
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:17,350
dealing with some third party code.

35
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:18,900
This is really awesome.

36
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:21,100
But the server needs to run
inside of our project, so

37
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:21,850
we need to move in there.

38
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,370
Running Ember serve
will start the server.

39
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:28,615
We can view our app at localhost:4200.

40
00:01:28,615 --> 00:01:32,830
Switching to the browser shows us our
Ember app with some starter content.

41
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:36,700
An entire development server in just
one command, isn't that awesome?

42
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:39,420
Ember CLI is an amazing tool
that's always in development,

43
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:41,540
sometimes a bug will pop
up from time to time.

44
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:44,180
While recording this video
I ran into a bug myself.

45
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:46,280
There's a story about it
in the instructor notes.

46
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:49,950
If you have any problems with Ember CLI
check out the project's issues on GitHub

47
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:51,730
to see if a fix is already in the works.

48
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:53,880
Or check the forums to see
if what you're running

49
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:54,860
into has already been solved.
