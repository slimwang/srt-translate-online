00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,088
The topic of aggression is of great importance in our lives. In fact, there's

2
00:00:04,088 --> 00:00:08,220
not way around it that we experience aggression in our lives. And other animals

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:12,724
engage in aggressive behavior to get the resources that they want. So, we can

4
00:00:12,724 --> 00:00:16,610
define aggression as violent behavior that is intended to cause psychological

5
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:22,080
or physical harm, or both, to another individual or being. Now, why are we

6
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,683
aggressive? Chances are, we're often aggressive because we've been provoked.

7
00:00:26,683 --> 00:00:29,966
And we engage in aggressive behavior because we've been provoked by feelings of

8
00:00:29,966 --> 00:00:34,743
anger. We call that hostile aggression. I'll be honest with you and then share

9
00:00:34,743 --> 00:00:37,495
an experience of hostile aggression that I had last week when I was walking at

10
00:00:37,495 --> 00:00:42,467
the campus. I was crossing the street and I had the walk sign. And another car

11
00:00:42,467 --> 00:00:46,612
came around and almost hit me. Now as a frequent pedestrian, this was not the

12
00:00:46,612 --> 00:00:51,016
first time it almost happened to me, but I was very upset. And I started to

13
00:00:51,016 --> 00:00:54,190
yell at the driver, and I had a few choice words to say to him. Now my

14
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:59,180
hostility was limited in anger to yelling at the person. But in some cases, we

15
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:02,755
see people, maybe more aggressive, and try to hit the person or chase after the

16
00:01:02,755 --> 00:01:07,900
car. In fact, the term road rage has been developed to explain such hostility

17
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:10,270
the driver sometimes experience.
