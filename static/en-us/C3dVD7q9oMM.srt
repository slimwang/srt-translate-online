1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:01,950
Let's start with Play.

2
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:05,280
On Google Fonts, I search for Play and we see it here.

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:08,710
This looks sort of similar, but not close enough for me.

4
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:10,720
All right, let's check out Rambla.

5
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:13,290
I search for Rambla and we see this here.

6
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:16,260
Once again, it's close but mm, not quite.

7
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:17,830
Next up, Lato.

8
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:19,300
Mm, Lato's looking really good.

9
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:24,350
I'm not 100%, so let's check the last one, and then we'll come back to this.

10
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:26,200
Finally we've got Arbitron.

11
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:29,460
I've searched for Arbitron and that is definitely not it.

12
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:31,100
So it looks like Lato's the winner.

13
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:33,370
Lets add it to the website and see how it looks.

14
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:34,525
I'll click here.

15
00:00:34,525 --> 00:00:36,840
I'll scroll down and copy this.

16
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:42,170
Inside the website I'll replace the sample here with the code for Lato and save

17
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:47,220
it, and now we just need to make sure we've got the right styles in our CSS.

18
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:52,640
So I'll copy this, come over to our CSS, and paste it in here.

19
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,840
So now, everything in the page should have Lato as the font.

20
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,640
We'll save it, come over to Chrome, and refresh the page.

21
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,780
Aha.

22
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:01,940
That's looking pretty good.

23
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:03,300
Let's compare it to the mock up.

24
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,220
Comparing our page to what we had in the mock up, we can see that

25
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:09,730
they're really, really similar but they're not quite exactly the same.

26
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:13,250
And that's because we have a few options that we need to play with.

27
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:15,850
I'm going to leave this as an exercise for you.

28
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:19,360
Come back into Google Fonts and start playing with how thick the lines are and

29
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,130
make sure that everything's in the right case, and

30
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:24,240
you should see this font look just like the design mock up.

31
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,820
So the correct answer here is Lato.
