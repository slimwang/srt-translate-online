1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,130
So what we now do in these
types of processes is

2
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:06,300
basically kind of start looking
at scales at different octaves.

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:10,390
And this is one of the reasons we
looked at the whole concept of doing

4
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:14,680
this kind of analysis at
different pyramid levels,

5
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:17,050
because each one of them
is a different octave.

6
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:18,900
And now we can actually
start modeling the signal,

7
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:22,670
and now we can actually start doing all
of the processing and what of course

8
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:25,610
comes out is the different scales we
can actually have these Gaussians, and

9
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:26,830
stuff like that, and

10
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:31,320
using these Gaussians, we can also start
looking at differences of Gaussians.

11
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,990
Again, very similar concept to what
we have done when we did some of

12
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:36,480
the blending using the frequency domain.

13
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,170
Basically, look at
these types of things,

14
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:40,900
you can see is that we now
actually can do the pyramids and

15
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:44,860
start looking at information
at different scales.

16
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:47,970
This basically shows us how we can
actually do the different Gaussians that

17
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:50,810
I was showing you before
between different scales.

18
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:51,680
And using that,

19
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:56,510
we can find the extrema points,
which are all these examples here.

20
00:00:56,510 --> 00:01:01,990
Of course, what we want to do now is
find a few specific extrema points.

21
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:06,400
So, of course, we would now kind of find
all the points that have high contrast

22
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:09,090
and that starts giving me more features.

23
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:12,530
There's a lot more features here and, of
course, now I've started reducing them.

24
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:17,490
And then I get rid of all of that are
not edges, just the corner features and

25
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:19,500
I get even less number of points.

26
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,890
And this starts kind of giving
me the features that I want.
