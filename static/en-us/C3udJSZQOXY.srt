00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:04,230
Another category of connector is called the adaptor connectors.

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:07,280
These are responsible for putting together components that were not designed to

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:11,750
be put together. This often means there's some kind of translation going on.

4
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:14,288
It might be converting protocols and policies and

5
00:00:14,288 --> 00:00:20,260
hence there's a conversion or transformation activity provided.

6
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:23,660
Some of the variations include invocation conversion, that is is

7
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:28,460
there a dress match, mapping? Is there marshalling, virtual memory translation,

8
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:33,480
virtual function tables? Are there conversion as far as wrappers or

9
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:38,910
packagers? Is there protocol conversion or even is the presentation conversion,

10
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:44,000
that is is the output. The actual form of the output determined by some kind of,

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,250
computation engine such as XSLT.
