00:00:04,234 --> 00:00:09,738

00:00:09,738 --> 00:00:15,168
noticed Scott was much happier. Now Johnny did not have a prescription for the

00:00:15,168 --> 00:00:21,111
pills, but Scott did. So that means BetterDay is a what, a psychoactive drug or

00:00:21,111 --> 00:00:24,793
psychotropic drug. Fill in the blank here.
