00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:03,380
So today, we talked about diagnosis which is a term we're very familiar with

2
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:06,180
from our everyday lives. But today, we talked about it specifically in

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:09,870
a knowledge-based AI sense. We started off by defining diagnosis,

4
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:12,570
which is finding the fault responsible for the malfunction in some system.

5
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:17,310
This can be computers, computer programs, cars or even people and animals.

6
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:20,990
We then talked about the process of diagnosis, mapping data onto hypotheses and

7
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:24,750
how we can see this as a form of classification. We discovered though that this

8
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:27,350
can be a very complicated process and classification might not get

9
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:31,530
us all the way there. So then we talked about diagnosis as a form of abduction.

10
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:35,560
Given a rule and effect or a symptom, we can abduce the cause of that problem,

11
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:39,830
like an illness or a software bug. Both configuration and diagnosis have been

12
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:43,820
small tasks in the broader process of design. Now that we talk about them,

13
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:46,990
we can talk about AI agents that can actually do design in the real world,

14
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:50,010
as well as what it would mean for an AI agent to really be creative.
