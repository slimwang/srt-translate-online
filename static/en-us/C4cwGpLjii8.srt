1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:01,446
Okay, quiz time.

2
00:00:01,446 --> 00:00:05,340
Recall the parallel algorithm for
finding the roots of a tree.

3
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:09,490
The key idea was to look for
the root from all nodes, simultaneously.

4
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:11,660
That's hidden in the adopt call.

5
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:15,000
Now consider the following
claims about this algorithm.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,760
Look at each of these claims and
check off the ones that you think apply.

7
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,740
Notice that I've left another box,

8
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:23,370
in case you think of anything
else you want to say.

9
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:25,690
The box is just
an ungraded free response.
