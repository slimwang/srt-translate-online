1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Think of this like a Python.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:09,000
It's 1 times the value of one step to the left--1 times the value one step to the right--

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
minus twice the value at the original position.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
And now we have to insert this Python into itself.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
If you look at this one, one step to the left, we have to go one further step to the left

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
times 1, this 1 times -2 and this 1 times 1.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
So one further step to the left is this one, two steps to the left minus 2.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
This was the one, one step to the left--1 is our original one.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Similarly for the right one, we go one further step to the right and so on and so on.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
One step to the left and minus 2 times the original one.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:54,000
For the central one, we have to multiply the Python by -2, so we've got -2, 4, -2,

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:04,000
which boils down to 1 times the value 2 steps to the left minus 4 times the value 1 step to the left

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
6 times the value at the center minus 4 times the value of 1 step to the right

14
00:01:09,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and 1 times the value 2 steps to the right.
