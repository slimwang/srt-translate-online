1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,891
The earliest versions of the camera have been known to have existed from 300 BC

2
00:00:04,891 --> 00:00:08,784
where even philosophers like Aristotle were actually looking at

3
00:00:08,784 --> 00:00:13,522
how they can capture light onto a background plate and be able to use that for

4
00:00:13,522 --> 00:00:14,749
looking at scenes.

5
00:00:14,749 --> 00:00:19,008
The earliest forms of the camera started appearing in mid 1800s, and

6
00:00:19,008 --> 00:00:22,030
this is one of those traditional classic examples of

7
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:26,835
a camera where basically a box with a lens or an optical capturing device,

8
00:00:26,835 --> 00:00:30,480
which could be a pinhole, was used to generate images.

9
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,790
Then of course came various types of processes where you could now

10
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:37,090
be able to save those images onto print forms, and

11
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:41,400
this is various types of printing mechanisms that started in the early 1900s.

12
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:45,870
1948 is where we started getting more of these compact representations.

13
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:51,380
1986 perhaps is when we start seeing examples of these disposable cameras.

14
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:56,652
This is an instance of a first generation digital single-lens reflex,

15
00:00:56,652 --> 00:00:57,415
or SLR, camera,

16
00:00:57,415 --> 00:01:03,190
a professional camera that was a digital camera came about in early 1990s.

17
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:07,700
And this was about to 1 to 2 megapixel resolution image.

18
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:11,494
And more interesting thing was when I started my career on research and

19
00:01:11,494 --> 00:01:16,010
computation photography, this camera was available for about $25,000.

20
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:18,716
And I actually got access to going to the lab to

21
00:01:18,716 --> 00:01:22,518
be able to use this to take a few pictures so I can actually start get

22
00:01:22,518 --> 00:01:26,600
playing around with the images that came from these specialized cameras.

23
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,740
Of course, 2000 is where the first generation of mobile cellphone cameras

24
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:34,050
started coming about.

25
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:38,688
So if you really think about it, we've gone a long way, where first instance of

26
00:01:38,688 --> 00:01:42,911
a real camera that actually was into a form that we think of a camera to be in

27
00:01:42,911 --> 00:01:46,607
right now, was in mid to early 1800s, to where we are now.

28
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:51,820
And of course, cameras have taken very interesting shapes and forms since then.

29
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:55,810
Interesting things to note now is cameras can be really small.

30
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:56,740
Just few examples.

31
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:57,875
As small as a pencil or

32
00:01:57,875 --> 00:02:02,650
even as, you know, small enough to be on your, just your fingertip.

33
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:04,864
Most popular cameras that you see these days are,

34
00:02:04,864 --> 00:02:06,707
of course, the cellphone cameras.

35
00:02:06,707 --> 00:02:08,130
They provide a good resolution.

36
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:10,270
We played around with them a lot, I'm sure.

37
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:15,080
And of course, these days, people wearing them in different forms, including,

38
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:18,190
of course, much more variable cameras like this one.

39
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:21,450
One thing I'd like to note is one of the other things that has changed is how we

40
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:23,240
interact with these cameras.

41
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:28,402
In the old days, when we had the cameras in much more of a bigger form factor,

42
00:02:28,402 --> 00:02:31,628
we had much more of a formal relationship,

43
00:02:31,628 --> 00:02:35,923
where we basically use this tripods and all that kind of stuff.

44
00:02:35,923 --> 00:02:38,058
Then we went to much more of a standup, but

45
00:02:38,058 --> 00:02:42,572
if you notice, most of our camera interaction is much more now stand-away, and,

46
00:02:42,572 --> 00:02:47,320
you know, we use viewfinders to be able to see it, and it's become more casual.

47
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:50,260
We've gone from more formal types of photography to

48
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:52,350
more casual photography more and more now
