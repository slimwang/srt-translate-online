00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,630
The good news is that NDB
manages caches for you.

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:07,130
There are two caching levels,
an in-context cache and memcache.

3
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:10,550
Both caches are enabled by default for
all entity types but

4
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:12,740
can be configured to
suit advanced needs.

5
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:16,460
For most applications, you can just
allow NDB to manage the caches and

6
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:17,990
leave the default settings on.

7
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:19,890
When you've deployed
your app to appspot,

8
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:23,660
you can see what entries are in Memcache
by going to the Memcache viewer.

9
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:25,300
If you used the application recently,

10
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:27,960
there may already be some
entries in the cache.

11
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:32,240
If you don't see anything, or if you see
items in cache zero, open the web front

12
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:35,730
end, make sure you have some
conferences created, and browse around.

13
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:37,820
For instance,
look at conference details.

14
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:39,930
Then refresh the Memcache viewer and

15
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:41,740
you should see that there
are some entries there.

16
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:43,660
After you've explored
the Memcashe viewer,

17
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:46,430
can you check which of the following
information you can see there?
