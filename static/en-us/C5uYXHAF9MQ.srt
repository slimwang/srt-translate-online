00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:04,830
So by now, you probably believe me that
there are plenty of tools out there.

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:06,850
So let's consider a hypothetical.

3
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:10,720
What if you have a screen
animation that is freezing up, but

4
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:13,860
all of your rendering seems
to be working correctly?

5
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:17,490
Which tool would you try next to
narrow down the cause of the problem?

6
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:20,047
TraceView to see if
it's a processor issue.

7
00:00:20,047 --> 00:00:23,950
Memory Monitor to see if
it's a memory churn issue.

8
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:27,740
Or HeapViewer to see if it is a
computational problem before the drawing

9
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:28,380
begins.
