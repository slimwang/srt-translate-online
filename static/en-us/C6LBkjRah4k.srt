Our last handler is NewPost handler. This actually should look fairly familiar to you.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
This kind of has the general kind of form submission error handling process

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
we've been using before.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
If you just do a get on that page /newpost, we return the newpost.html.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
If you post to it, we try to verify the forms.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
The first thing to do is we get the two parameters out of the request--subject and content.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Those are the name of the form fields.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
If we don't have a subject and content, we will do this clause first.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
We create an error message "subject and content please,"

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
and we render the form again with the user's entered subject, content, and error.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Newpost.html expects these parameters.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
If they did enter a good subject and content we create a new post.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I set my parent. Again, you don't have to set a parent.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
It might make future organization easier. I was learning data store myself.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I set the subject equal to subject that the user entered

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
and I set the content to be the content that the user entered.

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Remember the two date parameters created and last modified would be set automatically.

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
We call p.put to store this element in the database.

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Then I redirect the user to /blog/ the ID of the element,

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
and this is how you get an object's ID and datastore.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Let's see this in action in the browser one more time now that we know what all the pieces are.

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Here we are in the new post again. Let's submit this form without a subject and body.

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
You can see that we have the error message "subject and content please."

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
We'll enter a subject and a little body, and when we click submit,

25
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
we get redirected to /blog/4, which is the ID of this post.

26
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You can see our subject and our body, and if we go back to our blog's front page,

27
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
you can see all of our entries. That's the homework.
