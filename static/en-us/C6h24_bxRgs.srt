1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
And, yes, I don't have trust in this.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
The reason is from a 2100 square foot home that's clearly small than this one

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
the price has decreased. It'd gone down.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Do we believe that in general between a 2100 square foot home and a 2300 square foot home

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
the price should go down?

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Do we actually believe that in a scatter plot like this the functional relationship between

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
size and cost goes like this?

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Or do we instead believe it should go like this?

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
The deviations from that linear graph is what's called "noise."

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Now, noise might not be the best term, but it's the term that statisticians use.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It might be that one of them has a great view.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
The next one has an old house.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
This one has coastal access, which makes it more expensive.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
This one really requires a new kitchen.

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:01,000
There might be factors that really effect the house price beyond the size.

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:09,000
But if those factors are unincluded, to a statistician that's called "random noise."

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
But coming back to my original question, I think we don't believe the red curve.

18
00:01:14,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Let's talk about bar charts as one way to alleviate the problem.
