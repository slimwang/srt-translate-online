1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:04,680
The tightest lower bound is 4, and
the tightest upper bound is 7.

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:08,980
For the upper bound, we first use the so
called inclusion exclusion principal.

3
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:10,410
To write the probability like so.

4
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:14,180
Note that in the sum of
the first two terms,

5
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:17,130
we've counted
the probability of 2 twice.

6
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:19,120
So the third term subtracts it out.

7
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:21,260
Now all probabilities are non-negative.

8
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:25,500
So we can obtain an upper bound by
just taking the first two terms and

9
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,120
dropping the third.

10
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,340
This is called the union bound.

11
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:32,490
The probability of
the union of any two sets

12
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:35,160
is at most the probability
of the sum of the two sets.

13
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:39,170
We might be counting something twice but
we don't miss anything.

14
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:42,450
This then gives the upper bound of 7/10.

15
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:45,200
And this is as good as it gets.

16
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:50,190
The probability of 2 might be 0,while
the probability of 1 is exactly 3/10.

17
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:53,549
And the probability of 3 is 4/10.

18
00:00:53,549 --> 00:00:57,340
For the lower bound,
we break the probability up in two ways.

19
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:01,130
The quality holds here because
these sets are disjointed.

20
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:03,840
And again these probabilities
are non-negative.

21
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,300
So we obtain two lower bounds,
4/10ths being the tighter of the two
