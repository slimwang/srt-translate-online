00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,396
So basically, exponents give us a convenient notation for showing repeated

2
00:00:04,408 --> 00:00:08,728
multiplication of a given number or variable or combination of numbers and

3
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:13,018
variables. So, knowing that, how would you write 7 times 7 times 7 times 7,

4
00:00:13,119 --> 00:00:17,578
using exponent notation? So, I know that you can evaluate this expression to

5
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:22,124
equal just a number without any exponent, but for right now, I want you to make

6
00:00:22,136 --> 00:00:24,628
sure that you use exponent notation for the question.
