00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,217
I'm keeping a list of books I want to read. Realistically, this would probably

2
00:00:03,217 --> 00:00:06,974
have 50 items in it, but right now I'll keep it short. I'll start reading again

3
00:00:06,974 --> 00:00:10,067
when you're writing your own programs from scratch in Java. Let's say there are

4
00:00:10,067 --> 00:00:14,186
six books in my list to read for now. I'll store them as strings in an array

5
00:00:14,186 --> 00:00:18,220
list, so they would be indexed like this. For now I'll store them as strings to

6
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:20,740
make this exercise less typing, but if I were doing this for real, I would

7
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:23,134
probably make a book class, so I could store authors and my friend who

8
00:00:23,134 --> 00:00:28,206
recommended the book to me. Now a friend just recommended that I read Why

9
00:00:28,206 --> 00:00:32,598
Zebras Don't Get Ulcers. I've decided that I want to read it after I read Night

10
00:00:32,598 --> 00:00:37,026
Watch but before I read Next. What would method should I use to insert Why

11
00:00:37,026 --> 00:00:40,869
Zebras Don't Get Ulcers after Night Watch and before Next without removing

12
00:00:40,869 --> 00:00:43,641
anything from the list?
