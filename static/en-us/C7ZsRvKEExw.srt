1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,800
For my part I think the most important
thing about hiring early on or

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:08,060
at any point your startup but
especially early on is the same thing

3
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:11,148
that's important wiuth everything you do
as an entrepreneur, and I suspect it.

4
00:00:11,148 --> 00:00:14,260
And that's to sort of to trust your
instincts and trust your judgment.

5
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:16,630
It's good to think about these things.

6
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:18,820
It's good to read about
other people's experiences.

7
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:21,270
It's good to listen to me and
what I went through, but

8
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:25,360
the most important thing, when I've
gone wrong hiring, when I've gone wrong

9
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:29,330
with product plans and launches,
it's because I didn't trust myself.

10
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:30,980
I don't listen to myself.

11
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:33,480
If you feel like it's
a good hire go after it.

12
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:34,720
If you don't, don't.

13
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:37,960
But the most important thing is to
trust yourself as an entrepreneur.
