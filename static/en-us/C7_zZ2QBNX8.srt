Let's continue our work with functions. There are basic operations we can

2
00:00:04,111 --> 00:00:09,016
perform with functions. We can add them, subtract them, multiply them, and

3
00:00:09,016 --> 00:00:13,700
divide them. We can even do something called the composition of functions, and

4
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:19,002
we'll look at that later in this lesson. For now let's start with these two

5
00:00:19,002 --> 00:00:25,360
functions: f of x equals 3 x plus 2 and g of x equals x squared minus 1.

6
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:29,410
Remember that x is the input for our function. It's what we can change, and

7
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:34,726
input any number in here. F of x is the output for this function. It's the

8
00:00:34,726 --> 00:00:38,953
result that we get when we plug in x. And similarly, g of x is the output for

9
00:00:38,953 --> 00:00:44,773
this function. It's the result we get for whatever number we plug in for x. So,

10
00:00:44,773 --> 00:00:50,030
based on what you know about evaluating functions, what is f of 2? Write that

11
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:55,778
here. Then what's g of 2? Put that one here. And then use what you know about f

12
00:00:55,778 --> 00:01:02,356
of 2 and g of 2 to figure out this question. What's f plus g of 2? Write that

13
00:01:02,356 --> 00:01:06,724
one here. Now, I know we haven't covered what this means yet, but I think you

14
00:01:06,724 --> 00:01:08,420
can figure it out.
