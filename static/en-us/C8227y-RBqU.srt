00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:01,510
Let's talk about Knockout JS,

2
00:00:01,510 --> 00:00:05,530
the organizational library we'll be using in this lesson.

3
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:09,510
Now, since Knockout is an organization library,

4
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:14,530
we'll get most of the same things we've talked about before, models, views and

5
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:17,490
octopus, but they don't call it octopus.

6
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:20,400
In Knockout, it's called a ViewModel.

7
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,790
If you go to knockoutjs.com, you'll find a whole bunch of information here,

8
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:27,840
including some of these unfamiliar terms.

9
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,860
Let's spend a minute unpacking some of these terms.

10
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:33,042
First, we have ViewModel.

11
00:00:33,042 --> 00:00:36,770
The ViewModel is similar to the octopus that we know and love.

12
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:41,510
It's the thing that connects and separates the Model from the View.

13
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:44,070
The main difference for now is the name.

14
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:48,860
Also keep in mind that the word ViewModel is one word in this case.

15
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:53,810
So when we say MVVM, VM represents one term,

16
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:56,859
not two, the Model, the View, and the ViewModel.

17
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:00,440
Next, we have declarative bindings.

18
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:03,730
Up until now, you've been connecting your DOM elements with your

19
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:07,930
data in the model by writing code in the octopus, and

20
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:11,930
probably there have been a few times that it seemed especially tedious.

21
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:14,730
A lot of the methods that we write in the octopus end up

22
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:20,000
doing the same old thing, simply passing a value this way or this way.

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,730
Now, rather than write all of that tedious logic in the octopus or

24
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:27,370
the ViewModel, Knockout lets you connect these two

25
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:30,300
using bindings that you put in the HTML.

26
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:34,390
Now, it's important to point out that it still is going through the ViewModel to

27
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:35,340
get the data.

28
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:37,700
We are not connecting things directly.

29
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:41,600
The difference here is that instead of writing a bunch of code in the octopus,

30
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,440
or the ViewModel, which goes and

31
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:46,540
grabs portions of the view, we're going the opposite way.

32
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:51,570
We're putting the logic in the DOM in the form of bindings.

33
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:54,510
We'll get into them in more detail in just a moment.

34
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:57,360
But suffice it to say that bindings are a great way to

35
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,490
make the connections between the view and the ViewModel without writing a lot of

36
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:04,800
repetitive functions that ultimately do the same thing manually.

37
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:08,850
Next, we have automatic UI refresh.

38
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:10,949
UI stands for user interface.

39
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:13,680
And Knockout will watch your model data and

40
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,590
automatically refresh the view when it changes.

41
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:22,520
Effectively, that's some of our octopus code that Knockout is responsible for

42
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,090
doing automatically.

43
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:28,080
And if you set up the right declarative bindings in your DOM,

44
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,250
Knockout will actually watch things in your view like input boxes and

45
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:35,820
automatically update the model when view stuff changes.

46
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:38,600
Sometimes that's called two-way binding.

47
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,260
And lastly, we have dependency tracking.

48
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:45,290
Sometimes your model data depends on other model data.

49
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:48,880
For example, if we were to get our clicked cats levels,

50
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,800
which increase as the cats get more clicks,

51
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:56,120
the level data right here would depend on the clicks data.

52
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:01,270
Knockout lets us create that relationship where one model depends on another and

53
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:03,630
will automatically track those dependencies for

54
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:06,280
us and update things accordingly.

55
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:09,590
So, these four terms are some of the important new terms that

56
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:13,390
you probably should know if you're working with Knockout JS.

57
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:17,810
And in fact, if you ever pick up a new framework, always go to the website and

58
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:20,960
look for these kinds of terms that you don't already know and

59
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,510
figure out what they mean.

60
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:26,920
Usually, the concepts, once you think of them in English, are not very hard.

61
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,310
Now, in terms of these last three,

62
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:31,240
they'll make even more sense once we do it ourselves.
