1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:05,276
The clinical document architecture,
or CDA, defined HL7,

2
00:00:05,276 --> 00:00:08,850
version 3 rim based documents,

3
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:13,380
assembled from administrative and
clinical data for particular purposes.

4
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:18,420
After a period of use, a consolidation
effort removed inconsistencies,

5
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:24,750
resulting in the current
consolidated CDA or CCDA standard.

6
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:29,720
Here's a particular example of some
simple patient demographic data

7
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:34,890
we'll used to show how RIM
supports CCDA documents.

8
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:36,370
While it's difficult to read,

9
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:40,050
here's the same patient data
depicted in a RIM Roll.

10
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:43,440
And we can see, for example.

11
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:48,000
The phone number here is displayed here.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,340
Here's the data incorporated
into a CCDA document.

13
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:56,340
In this case it's the continuity
of care document or CCD.

14
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:02,330
A key electronic document for exchange
among providers at transitions of care.

15
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:07,880
When, for example, patients are admitted
to or discharged from a hospital, or

16
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:11,940
referred by a primary care
physician to a specialist.

17
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:15,540
Transitions of care
are a key risk point, so

18
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:20,340
exchanging data at them is an important
means of assuring quality and safety.
