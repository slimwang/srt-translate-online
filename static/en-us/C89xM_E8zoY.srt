1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,380
Before you go into the room with
your user, you'll want to figure out

2
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:07,040
exactly how you want to record
data from your interaction.

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,720
Generally speaking,
you have three options.

4
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:10,970
You can take notes directly,

5
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:14,560
which is the easiest to get users to
agree to, and does a really good job of

6
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:18,240
allowing you to pull out the things that
sound important to you in the moment.

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,502
Writing notes also means that you
don't need to take time later on to

8
00:00:21,502 --> 00:00:23,173
sift through the feedback again.

9
00:00:23,173 --> 00:00:26,935
You can also ask for permission to
record the audio of the conversation.

10
00:00:26,935 --> 00:00:29,953
In the next video, we'll introduce
you to the concept of talk aloud,

11
00:00:29,953 --> 00:00:31,488
which will be key to user research,

12
00:00:31,488 --> 00:00:35,450
and also allow you to get great feedback
through the voice of your user.

13
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:38,450
This is great because it allows you to
focus on the testing as its going on and

14
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:40,440
sift through the data later.

15
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,170
Additionally, you will often catch
really useful snippets of things you

16
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:44,350
did right.

17
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:47,500
Nothing convinces investors quite so
much as hearing a user be verbally

18
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,970
excited about your app design
as they're interacting with it.

19
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:52,270
Nothing, that is, except for

20
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:55,550
seeing that user be excited
about interacting with the app.

21
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:58,180
If you have the resources and
are able to get permission,

22
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:01,690
it can be really useful to record video
of both the prototype as the user's

23
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:05,880
interacting with it, and the user's face
as their interacting with the prototype.

24
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,750
This footage takes awhile
to sift through, and so,

25
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:11,230
is mainly appropriate for
higher fidelity prototypes later on.

26
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:13,870
But can be really useful in
presentations to investors.

27
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:19,270
I would suggest that for the sake of the
first prototype, you just take notes.

28
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:20,850
It's always vital to have a record but
for

29
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:23,490
the moment we're wanting to get
feedback as fast as possible.
