00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
And here is my answer.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
To get the likelihood of a set of numbers, we just need to multiply in

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
the probability of seeing every single data point.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
So we start at 1 since that's the identity.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:18,000
For every data element we go through and multiply by the probability for element i

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
and then we return it.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
If you're interested in a real challenge, note this function can actually be written on just 1 line.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
So for anyone watching who is a real Python enthusiast,

00:00:30,000 --> 99:59:59,999
feel free to post your 1-liners to the forums. Have fun.
