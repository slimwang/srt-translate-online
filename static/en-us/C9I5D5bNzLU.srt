00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,300
So Andy, when you were looking at the

2
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:04,120
source code how did, how'd you get started?

3
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:05,700
>> I probably didn't do the right way,

4
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:09,130
whatever that is. I just Googled 2048 source code.

5
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:09,510
>> Okay.

6
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:12,870
>> Found myself on GitHub. I felt very confused, but I clicked around

7
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:16,850
a bit, found some code, copied and pasted, made some changes and then-

8
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:17,196
>> Right.

9
00:00:17,196 --> 00:00:17,610
>> Ta-da.

10
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:18,600
>> [LAUGH].

11
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,200
>> Is there a better way I'm guessing?

12
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,320
>> yeah. But we'll talk about that a little

13
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,420
bit more detail later but for now let's just get

14
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:26,330
a quick look at the code.

15
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:26,880
>> Okay.

16
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,100
>> Right here in the browser. So since we're in

17
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:33,620
Chrome, we can just right click, and go to Inspect Element.

18
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:34,450
>> Okay.

19
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:36,100
>> And that brings up the development tools.

20
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:37,530
>> Oh, okay. This is all the code that

21
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:39,960
I had played with in the wrong way. That's cool.

22
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,570
>> Yeah. So this is the, this is the HTML

23
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:43,960
here. So that gives the basic structure for the page.

24
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:44,421
>> Okay.

25
00:00:44,421 --> 00:00:46,917
>> And then over here, we've got the CSS, which

26
00:00:46,917 --> 00:00:50,270
gives the page it's styling, the sort of look and feel.

27
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:50,270
>>

28
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:54,460
Okay. Cool. So, the HTML from when I was going over this. This

29
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:59,150
has things like, we have Head, which is the Header and the Body,

30
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:02,310
which is basically the whole document. And then you keep going, and we

31
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:06,760
have, oh that's the Heading. We have Above Game, Game Container and so on.

32
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,330
>> If you just hover over these things, it will

33
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:13,230
show you what part of the page that elements refers to.

34
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:15,190
>> And can I modify this right in the browser?

35
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:15,750
>> Yeah.

36
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:17,930
>> So if I were to delete?

37
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:18,270
>> Yeah.

38
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:22,030
>> Yikes, okay, I'm going to refresh cause I don't want to break anything

39
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:22,880
>> Sounds good.

40
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,236
>> Okay so what about what's going on over here?

41
00:01:25,236 --> 00:01:28,422
>> So this is basically telling us you know, what, what color

42
00:01:28,422 --> 00:01:31,736
things should be. What the, the exact positioning of things should be.

43
00:01:31,736 --> 00:01:32,136
>> huh.

44
00:01:32,136 --> 00:01:34,188
>> So for example, it gives the color for

45
00:01:34,188 --> 00:01:37,090
the background, of the main background of the page here.

46
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:40,740
>> And what does this mean? I, I see HTML, and I see Body over here. I

47
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:42,280
see HTML. I see Body here.

48
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,490
>> Yeah. So, this is basically saying this rule

49
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:48,790
applies to HTML elements that basically are called those

50
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:52,250
things. So anything that starts with HTML or body,

51
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:54,560
are going to have those rules apprised to them.

52
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:59,910
>> Okay, and so if I click on this background thing, and I change it

53
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:04,954
to. Oh that is so cool. Okay. Nice.

54
00:02:05,998 --> 00:02:09,729
So imagine I am trying to figure out what's going on here.

55
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:09,940
>> Mm hm.

56
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:12,340
>> How should I spend the next five minutes of my time?

57
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,350
>> Just, you know, pull up the page, right

58
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:18,140
click Inspect Element, sort of look around the page.

59
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:19,030
>> Uh-huh.

60
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:22,330
>> Figure out, you know, maybe like delete some

61
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:25,270
things to see what corresponds to what on the page.

62
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:26,930
>> Okay. Well, I'll give it a shot.

63
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:27,190
>> Alright.

64
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:28,461
>> Cool. [SOUND]
