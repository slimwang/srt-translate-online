00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,340
Now this is a really important concept, and we're going to try to drive this

2
00:00:04,352 --> 00:00:09,080
point home. Thomas Friedman said in his book, The Lexus and the Olive Tree, that

3
00:00:09,092 --> 00:00:13,395
no two countries with a McDonald's have ever gone to war since opening the

4
00:00:13,407 --> 00:00:17,855
McDonald's. This is called the Golden Arches Theory of Conflict Prevention.

5
00:00:17,957 --> 00:00:22,850
Let's just assume that after hearing Thomas Friedman's observation Policy makers

6
00:00:22,862 --> 00:00:27,725
concluded that if every country built at least one McDonald's, we would attain

7
00:00:27,737 --> 00:00:32,320
world peace. Well, what could be a plausible explanation for Friedman's

8
00:00:32,332 --> 00:00:37,265
observation, and which would lend for different policy conclusions? Let's ask

9
00:00:37,277 --> 00:00:39,000
some people what they think.
