1
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:04,100
These frameworks typically all provide late binding,

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:07,080
persistence, encapsulation and sub-typing.

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:10,700
They provide support for communication among components including events,

4
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:14,030
channels and uniform data transfer mechanisms.

5
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:17,130
They also offer some form of component transfer packaging,

6
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:23,170
such as JavaJar files, ComCab files, or CLI assemblies.

7
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:27,960
They all provide a way of describing deployments such as via configuration file.

8
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,850
This description is also typically available at runtime via mechanisms such as

9
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:33,670
Reflection or metadata.

10
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:36,030
Any given framework provides a way of serving,

11
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:40,182
of serving components such as an application server model like EJB,

12
00:00:40,182 --> 00:00:46,079
COM+ and CCM or web server models like JSP and ASP.Net.
