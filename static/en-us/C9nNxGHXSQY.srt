1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,270
Just like you can change the value
of an integer variable after you've

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:06,370
created it, you can also change
the value of a string variable.

3
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:10,166
You can update it to
a completely new value.

4
00:00:10,166 --> 00:00:14,730
In our Just Java app, say we wanted to
display a special drink of the day.

5
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:18,180
Then we could use a string variable
to store the name of that drink.

6
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:21,510
Here we declare a string
variable called drinkOfTheDay and

7
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:24,590
we initially set it to the value Latte.

8
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:26,910
With our box analogy this
is what it would look like.

9
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:30,152
We have the Latte value
stored inside this variable.

10
00:00:30,152 --> 00:00:35,710
On another line of code we can say
drinkOfTheDay equals a new string value.

11
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:39,000
Now the word Espresso is
stored in this string.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,550
We don't need to specify
the data type string again,

13
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:43,530
because it was already
declared as a string up here.

14
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:47,830
On the next line of code if we say
drinkOfTheDay equals Green Tea,

15
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:50,070
then we store Green Tea
into this variable now.

16
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:54,740
Here's another example where we might
want to display the store hours

17
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:56,130
within our app.

18
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:58,970
We can create a string variable
to store the text that

19
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:01,120
should be displayed on the screen.

20
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,179
The initial value is Open
today from 8AM to 5PM.

21
00:01:04,179 --> 00:01:08,160
On a different day we can update the
string variable to say Open today from

22
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:12,450
8AM to 2PM, because we want to
leave early to go to the beach.

23
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:15,980
Or on another day we can update
the store hours to say Closed today,

24
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:18,010
because we don't work on Sundays.

25
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:21,050
If our app had a running list of
all the drinks that the user wanted

26
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:23,990
then we could create a string
variable called drinksOrdered.

27
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:27,950
We could start it off with one drink,
like 1 mocha.

28
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:30,440
In the variable we would
store the text 1 mocha.

29
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:33,160
And then if the user
wants another drink,

30
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:38,350
then we can just concatenate the new
drink onto the existing drinksOrdered.

31
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:41,980
This gets stored inside the variable
drinksOrdered like this.

32
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:44,190
If I want to add another drink,

33
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:48,780
I can just concatenate that onto
the existing string drinksOrdered.

34
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:53,307
This expression evaluates to one long
string that says 1 mocha, 1 cappuccino,

35
00:01:53,307 --> 00:01:54,920
1 macchiato.

36
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,860
All of that gets stored into
this variable like this.

37
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:01,070
It might look a little
funny to have a comma and

38
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:02,900
a space at the beginning of this string,

39
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:07,460
but that just makes the list look nice
with commas in between each item.

40
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:11,430
The reason why I didn't put a comma
at the end of cappuccino is because

41
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:14,350
I can't be sure if there's going to be
another drink coming after that or not.

42
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:17,579
If there's only two drinks,
then I will say 1 mocha,

43
00:02:17,579 --> 00:02:19,972
1 cappuccino and that looks fine as is.

44
00:02:19,972 --> 00:02:23,120
If there's another drink coming,
like a macchiato,

45
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,920
then I can just add a comma because
I know another drink is coming.

46
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:29,072
Go ahead and
try this out in Android Studio.

47
00:02:29,072 --> 00:02:34,013
Add another line of code that updates
the string variable to a new value,

48
00:02:34,013 --> 00:02:38,230
or you can update it to the current
value plus some more stuff.

49
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,010
Once you're comfortable with knowing
how to update string variables in

50
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:44,090
Android Studio, then go ahead and

51
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:47,740
implement this final behavior
in the app for lesson two.

52
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:51,080
When you change the quantity and hit the
Order button, it should say Total and

53
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,690
the price, and then Thank you!

54
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:57,430
Technically you don't need to update the
string variable in order to build out

55
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:58,790
this functionality.

56
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:01,700
However, I'd still like you to do so
if you can.

57
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:05,261
In the next lesson you're going to need
to update string variables more often,

58
00:03:05,261 --> 00:03:08,659
specifically because there's going to
be more fields in this order form and

59
00:03:08,659 --> 00:03:10,930
we're going to need to
build up the order summary.

60
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,960
When you're done,
check these boxes to continue.

61
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,480
This is the last coding task
of the lesson, so good luck.
