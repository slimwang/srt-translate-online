00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,440
Let's take a look at an example HTTP

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:05,880
request now. You can see here the request line,

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:10,140
and here are some headers. Accept indicates that the

4
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:12,910
client's willing to accept any content type, that it

5
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:15,150
would like the content to be returned in English,

6
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:18,500
that it can accept pages that are encoded in

7
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:22,580
particular, compression formats. We talked about the user agents.

8
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:26,460
So in this case, its a Mozilla 5.0 browser.

9
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:30,060
Here's the host, that the request, is being

10
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:33,530
made to. This is particularly useful in cases

11
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:37,240
where a particular web server IP address, might

12
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:41,030
be hosting multiple websites on the same server.
