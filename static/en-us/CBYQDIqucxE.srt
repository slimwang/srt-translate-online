00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:03,020
Congratulations, you've finished lesson 2.

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:06,720
In this lesson, you created a Git repository and added commits to it for

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:07,910
the first time.

4
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:11,200
You also learned to use the staging area to control exactly what changes go into

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,490
each commit.

6
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:16,020
Finally, you learned to maintain parallel versions of your code using Git

7
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:20,300
branches and how to merge 2 branches together into 1 combined version.

8
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:23,320
In the next lesson, we'll see how to use GitHub to share your projects and

9
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:24,410
collaborate with other people.

10
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:25,730
See you then.
