00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,578
>> So, the mean does have a simple equation. And if you remember, it's the sum

2
00:00:05,578 --> 00:00:10,731
of x divided by n. The mean will also always change if any data value changes.

3
00:00:10,731 --> 00:00:16,059
Median will sometimes change, and mode will also sometimes change. The mean is

4
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:21,205
not affected by change bin size, it will always be the same, no matter how we

5
00:00:21,205 --> 00:00:26,561
visualize the data with a histogram, and the same with the median. But you've

6
00:00:26,561 --> 00:00:31,664
seen that the mode does change, it becomes a new interval if we change the bin

7
00:00:31,664 --> 00:00:36,425
size. You saw in the case of the Michael Jordan example that the mean is

8
00:00:36,425 --> 00:00:41,852
affected by outliers, but the median not as much, so not severely affected, same

9
00:00:41,852 --> 00:00:46,650
with the mode. And finally, it is kind of hard to find the mean and median on

10
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:50,962
the histogram. But you always know which one the mode is, because it's the

11
00:00:50,962 --> 00:00:52,215
highest frequency.
