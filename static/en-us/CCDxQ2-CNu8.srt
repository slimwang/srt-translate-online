00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,625
The answer is 3 cube root 2. Let's see how to get that. 54 is just equal to 27

2
00:00:05,637 --> 00:00:11,695
times 2. We can rewrite this as an expression with exponents and then distribute

3
00:00:11,707 --> 00:00:17,525
the exponent to the factors. 27 is equal to 3 to the 3rd power. So, this reduces

4
00:00:17,537 --> 00:00:21,190
to 3 times 2 to the 1 3rd power or just 3 cube root 2.
