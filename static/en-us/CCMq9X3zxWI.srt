1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The answer to the first open question is number 9.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
1 - p to the 1 - Xi.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
And this is actually quite remarkable.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
The reason why I wrote p to the Xi over here

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
is because we already learned every time we see a heads

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
we're going to multiply in p.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
So by putting this in the exponent, when Xi = 1, we multiply in p.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
And if Xi = 0 we multiply in 1, which has no effect.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
This is exactly the inverse.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
You're going to multiply in 1 - p for the tails probability whenever we see tails,

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
in which case 1 - Xi will be 1.

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Otherwise, 1 - Xi is 0, and we just multiply in 1, which has no effect.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
The logarithm of this guy over here is number 1, Xi log p.

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
The first derivative of this expression over here is number 7,

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
and it's interesting it's not number 2.

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
There's a minus sign over here, and the minus sign is inherited

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
from the minus sign inside the logarithm using the chain rule of differentiation.

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
That was really non-trivial.

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
This one will be number 11.

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
We're multiplying in p and 1 - p. The 1 - p stays.

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
And likewise, this here is number 4.

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Multiplying this out misses exactly 1 term, -pXi, which is number 3.

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Now we observe that these -pXi and +pXi cancel each other out,

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
so we get this expression over here = 0, which is number 12.

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
When we now take p to the other side,

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
we realize there's N additions of p, number 6.

27
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
And finally, we bring N back to the left side to use number 8, 1/N

28
00:01:36,000 --> 99:59:59,999
And we are now done.
