00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:04,510
This is the kitchen area of the

2
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:10,610
Edacity. The coffee machines and two refrigerators,

3
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:13,030
well let's go look at them. Look

4
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:15,990
inside the refrigerator compartment, two controls. One labeled

5
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:19,900
freezer, one labeled refrigerator with numbers four,

6
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:21,680
two, what does that mean? How do you

7
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,540
use it, how do you set it?

8
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:27,580
It's a bad conceptual model. Now interestingly enough,

9
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:31,690
Edacity has two refrigerators, and they have different models. The other

10
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:34,240
one has the correct conceptual model. Here, let me show you.

11
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:42,290
If a refrigerator. The control's on the outside. One marked freezer, the

12
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:44,718
temperature four degrees Fahrenheit. The other

13
00:00:44,718 --> 00:00:47,238
marked refrigerator with a temperature 37 degrees

14
00:00:47,238 --> 00:00:52,110
Fahrenheit. Makes it really easy to set. Really easy to understand exactly what

15
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:56,340
is happening. The good conceptual model which we also discussed in the lesson.
