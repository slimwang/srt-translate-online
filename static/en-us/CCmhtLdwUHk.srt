1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:05,750
So now we are going to look at non-parametric models formally.

2
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:11,560
We defined a derived feature which is x equal to the absolute

3
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:16,360
value of the difference between f-nought and f 1 divided by f-nought.

4
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:20,825
What this means in practice is that the ratio of the submitted charge,

5
00:00:20,825 --> 00:00:25,090
f-nought, to the difference between the submitted charge, and

6
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:26,660
the payment amount by Medicare.

7
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,890
When you're making a derived feature,

8
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:35,590
make sure what that represents makes sense in your given problem.

9
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:40,160
Next, we're going to look at a distribution of values of x.
