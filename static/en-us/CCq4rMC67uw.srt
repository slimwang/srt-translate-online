1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The answer is both players have a rational mixed strategy.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
For Max, he plays 1--8/17ths of the time and 2--9/17ths of the time.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Min would play 1--10/17ths and 2--7/17ths,

4
00:00:15,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and then the utility of the game to Max turns out to be 5/17ths.
