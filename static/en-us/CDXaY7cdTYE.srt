1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So, now that we have a value backup function

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
that we discussed in depth, the question now becomes

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
what's the optimal policy?

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
And it turns out this value backup function defines

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
the optimal policy as completely opposite

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
of which action to pick,

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
which is just the action that maximizes this expression over here.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
For any state S, any value function V,

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
we can define a policy,

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
and that's the one that picks the action under argmax

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
that maximizes the expression over here.

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
For the maximization, we can safely draw up gamma and R(s).

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Baked in the value iteration function was already

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
an action choice that picks the best action.

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
We just made it explicit.

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
This is the way of backing up values,

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
and once values have been backed up,

18
00:00:48,000 --> 99:59:59,999
this is the way to find the optimal thing to do.
