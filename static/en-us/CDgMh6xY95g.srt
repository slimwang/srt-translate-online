Great job getting through this course.

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:05,010
And, for some of you, this might have
been your first time programming,

3
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:08,029
so great job getting
through that as well.

4
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:10,940
Virtual reality interaction
has a lot to it,

5
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:12,930
and we've just scratched the surface.

6
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:14,770
&gt;&gt; That's right, Matt,
there's a lot more to learn.

7
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:17,640
But, one of the really important
things to remember is that

8
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,140
there's a lot to explore.

9
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,590
Nobody knows exactly what
works in virtual reality.

10
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:24,690
We've given you a few little pieces
that you can use to get started, but

11
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:28,400
it's up to you to extend this space and
come up with the future of interactions.
