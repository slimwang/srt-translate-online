1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:02,360
Jay show us how you did this one.

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:04,960
>> Sure thing,
it went a little like this.

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,110
So first I'm going to open the cache for
our images.

4
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:11,440
Once I've got the cache,
I'll look for a match for storageUrl.

5
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:15,740
If there is one I'll return it, done.

6
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,490
Otherwise, I'm going to fetch the image
from the network using the fetch API.

7
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:27,630
Once I get the response, I'll add it
to the cache using the storageUrl and

8
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:28,680
a clone at the response.

9
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:32,409
Then I'll return the original
response to the browser.

10
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:35,040
Remember, you can only read
a response's body once.

11
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,330
This is why we have one
copy going to the cache and

12
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:38,710
the original going to the browser.

13
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:42,550
Now I'm going to use Force update and
reload the page.

14
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:47,330
If we check in the Resources
panel in dev tools, yep,

15
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:49,670
we can see the new cache and
it has images in it.

16
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:54,260
If I resize this panel so
we can see the whole URL,

17
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:56,622
you can see the URL ends before
the bit with the pixel width,

18
00:00:56,622 --> 00:01:01,140
confirming the cache URLs
aren't site specific.

19
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:02,055
Let's test the serving.

20
00:01:02,055 --> 00:01:06,672
We'll bring the server down,
go offline, and reload the page.

21
00:01:06,672 --> 00:01:10,600
And the images are still loading but
here's the ultimate test.

22
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:15,860
If I change the width of the browser and
reload, yep, the images still load.

23
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:18,810
This means the service worker is
returning the image we have cached

24
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:21,370
no matter which width of
image the browser requests.
