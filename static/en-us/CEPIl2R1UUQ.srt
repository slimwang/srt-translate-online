1
00:00:00,006 --> 00:00:05,070
So a /14 network is going to
have a subnet mask that starts

2
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:09,950
with 14 bits of 1s, for the network
part, followed by 18 bits of 0s for

3
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:13,480
the host part for
a total of 32 bits as usual.

4
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,740
If we divide this up into octets,

5
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:18,390
we'll see that the first
eight bits are all ones.

6
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:21,470
So that octet has the value 255.

7
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:23,920
And the last two octets are all zeros.

8
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,000
So, we'll have the value of zero.

9
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:28,170
It's the second one that's different.

10
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:31,884
The second octet is
going to be 255 minus 3,

11
00:00:31,884 --> 00:00:37,368
the value of 11 in binary,
making it 255.252.0.0.

12
00:00:37,368 --> 00:00:42,306
And to figure out how many addresses,
we'll just note that an 18 bit host part

13
00:00:42,306 --> 00:00:46,912
Is 2 to the 18th power addresses,
which is just over 250,000.

14
00:00:46,912 --> 00:00:48,550
So that's the right answer here.
