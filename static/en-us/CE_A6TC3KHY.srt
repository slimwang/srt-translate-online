1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,844
Negative 10y to the 4th plus 8y cubed is the correct answer. That's some great

2
00:00:03,844 --> 00:00:07,406
work if you got it correct. If you got stuck somewhere, stay with me and then

3
00:00:07,406 --> 00:00:11,054
pause it when you find a mistake and then keep going. This question involved

4
00:00:11,054 --> 00:00:14,638
exponents and a negative term, so there are a couple of places where you might

5
00:00:14,638 --> 00:00:18,576
have gotten tripped up. I'm going to list this factor, 2y squared, on one side

6
00:00:18,576 --> 00:00:22,480
of a rectangle, then I'm going to have 4y, and negative 5y squared on the other

7
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,502
side of my rectangle. I'm going to consider this a positive region, because I

8
00:00:26,502 --> 00:00:30,423
have a positive number times a positive number. I shaded this region orange,

9
00:00:30,423 --> 00:00:34,449
because we're going to wind up with a positive number, here's a positive times a

10
00:00:34,449 --> 00:00:39,480
positive. For this region I've shade it grey because we have a negative number

11
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:44,409
times a positive number, we'll wind up with a negative area here. 2y squared

12
00:00:44,409 --> 00:00:49,578
times positive 4y is 8y cubed. Next I have 2y squared times negative 5y squared,

13
00:00:49,578 --> 00:00:54,557
I'm finding the area of this part of my rectangle. I know a negative area might

14
00:00:54,557 --> 00:00:59,345
not make sense, but you can think about this area as the area that you have and

15
00:00:59,345 --> 00:01:03,683
this area, about the area that you owe. We use our properties of numbers to

16
00:01:03,683 --> 00:01:07,843
multiply 2 and negative 5, and our properties of exponents to get negative 10y

17
00:01:07,843 --> 00:01:12,005
to the fourth. Finally, we reverse the order or the two terms, to get our final

18
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:16,184
answer. Negative 10y to the 4th should be our first term, and positive 8y to the

19
00:01:16,184 --> 00:01:20,381
3rd should come second. Keep in mind, the signs in front of the terms stay with

20
00:01:20,381 --> 00:01:20,726
them.
