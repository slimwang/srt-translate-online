I want you to derive a conceptual
fact about using maximal matchings to

2
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:05,990
coursing a graph.

3
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:08,870
Consider some initial graph, G0.

4
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:13,040
Now suppose you find the maximal
matching unit and use it to course it.

5
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:17,453
And let's say you repeat this process
producing a sequence of graphs from

6
00:00:17,453 --> 00:00:18,570
1 to k.

7
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:22,520
Now, let's also say that
the original graph has n vertices.

8
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:25,940
And suppose the final
graph has s vertices.

9
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:27,660
Here's my question.

10
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:31,940
How large must k be in terms of n and s?

11
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:32,490
In other words,

12
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:35,730
I'm interested in a lower bound
on the asymptotic value of k.

13
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:38,340
You can type your answer
symbolically here.
