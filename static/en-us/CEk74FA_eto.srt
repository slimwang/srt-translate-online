In the same thread, let's look at some recent stuff that people from

2
00:00:05,055 --> 00:00:08,400
thousandmemories.com put up there on their site.

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,720
This is the number of photographs taken each year and

4
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:17,380
as you notice the claim is that about 2011, 380 billion photographs were taken.

5
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:22,320
And, of course, initially, the analog number of pictures was pretty strong too,

6
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,600
but that's fading away.

7
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,990
But digital photographs are still continuing.

8
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:30,990
So in about the 200 years of photography, the claim is that

9
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:36,748
more than three five, 3.5 trillion pictures have been taken overall,

10
00:00:36,748 --> 00:00:40,558
just 4 billion of them in the last year or so.

11
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:46,570
So in essence that would suggest that 10% of all photographs that exist

12
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:50,770
in the world right now, just 10%, were taken just in the last year or

13
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:54,590
so, and that's the kind of the growth curve of number of photographs out there.
