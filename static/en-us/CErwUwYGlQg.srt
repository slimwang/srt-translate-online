1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,450
Last time, we saw how each
type of light is different.

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:05,720
But because they all use
the light component,

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:08,310
they share a lot of
the same common properties.

4
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:10,942
To really see them, let's first
switch back to a point light.

5
00:00:10,942 --> 00:00:16,254
So underneath range is the first
common property, color.

6
00:00:16,254 --> 00:00:21,265
If we click it that opens up a color
picker which we can use to color light.

7
00:00:21,265 --> 00:00:23,665
Picking a color adds
a tint to our light,

8
00:00:23,665 --> 00:00:26,000
just kind of like what
we see at a concert.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,720
Let's experiment with this by
making our point light red.

10
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:31,580
See how the walls have
a red tint to them now?

11
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:34,770
Now let's experiment with the intensity.

12
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:37,870
As you've probably guessed,

13
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:42,700
this property allows us to control
how bright Intense our light is.

14
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:47,030
We can bring it down to zero for
no effect, or

15
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:51,290
max it out to eight,
completely saturate our scene with red.

16
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:55,010
As you can see, we have a lot of
control over our light's brightness.

17
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:57,300
But for now,
let's tone it down to a one.

18
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,680
Next, let's talk about shadows
which has the real selling

19
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,450
point about using lights within unity.

20
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:08,430
Done properly, you can get some
really nice effects like this.

21
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:12,820
However, on mobile, we need to be really
careful about real time shadows as they

22
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:18,620
are fairly computationally expensive for
shadow type we have three options.

23
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:21,360
The first being no shadows,

24
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,970
the second option is hard shadows
which are shadows with sharp edges.

25
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:31,250
In the real world these shadows don't
exist but they are a lot more performant

26
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:35,290
than their counterpart soft shadows,
which is the third option.

27
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:38,950
Soft shadows tend to look more
like shadows in the real world but

28
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:42,790
at run time,
they are very impactful on performance.

29
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:47,290
On mobile, we highly recommend
not using real-time shadows, so

30
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:49,150
we're just going to turn it off.

31
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:53,170
Later, we'll show you how you could
get some nice shadows by using baking,

32
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:55,990
like we discussed briefly,
with area lights.

33
00:01:55,990 --> 00:02:00,642
The last two properties I want to touch
on are render mode, and calling mask.

34
00:02:00,642 --> 00:02:03,620
Render mode is a property
that tells you unity

35
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:06,400
how important this light is for
the scene.

36
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:12,120
By default, it set to auto but, we could
change it to important or not important.

37
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:16,450
Let's leave it as auto, with auto,
unity automatically determines if

38
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:19,970
the light is important to our scene,
if the light is not important and

39
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:23,050
unity realize the app is
not maintaining frame rate.

40
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:26,115
It can turn it off and
thus save on performance.

41
00:02:26,115 --> 00:02:27,190
Although not ideal,

42
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:32,090
it's better to have a high FPS than
an experience that makes people sick.

43
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:33,930
And last we have the culling mask.

44
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:36,850
If you remember from the cameras lesson

45
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:39,960
the culling mask let's us
choose which layers to render.

46
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:42,360
In a similar fashion,

47
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:46,300
the calling mask lets us choose which
layers this light should affect.

48
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:50,240
If we set it to nothing,
our light basically doesn't even exist.

49
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,080
Just like with the camera,
we can create our own layers and

50
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:57,090
define what objects can and
cannot interact with the light.

51
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:59,280
Let's allow our light to
interact with everything for now.

52
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,186
There are a few more properties
that are generic to most lights but

53
00:03:03,186 --> 00:03:06,280
they're not used as often compared
to the other ones I just mentioned.

54
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:09,150
So I'll leave them for
optional reading if you're interested.

55
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:12,690
At this point you now know enough to
start and come around with lights and

56
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:14,590
making each one unique in your scene.
