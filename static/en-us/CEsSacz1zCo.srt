Now that we understand the problem we need to write some code. First, add a

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:07,439
deferredKill list to the game entity class. Then, as you walk through the

3
00:00:07,439 --> 00:00:12,448
entity's list, add any killed entities to the deferred list. After that, we

4
00:00:12,448 --> 00:00:15,633
walk through the differed list again removing all elements from the original

5
00:00:15,633 --> 00:00:17,100
entities list.
