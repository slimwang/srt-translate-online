1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:04,490
I broke this course into four
stages that built on one another.

2
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:08,710
You'll start in the wrapping stage
where you'll be learning the syntax

3
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:10,670
of constructing promises.

4
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:13,970
A promise constructor in and
of itself isn't super useful.

5
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:17,740
So from there, you'll be learning how
to react the resolution of the promise.

6
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:21,840
If all goes well, you'll want to then
off the promise, or if something breaks,

7
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:27,130
you'll want to catch the air, these
are the thening and the catching stages.

8
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:30,650
You'll spend the whole second
lesson in the chaining stage

9
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:35,050
where you'll learn how to create
long sequences of asynchronous work.

10
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:38,100
It's also worth going over
some promise vocabulary.

11
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:42,040
I'm stealing these definitions from Jake
Archibald who wrote a fantastic guide on

12
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:44,350
promises that you can find
in the instructor notes.

13
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,910
There are four states
a promise can have.

14
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:52,590
You'll pick up these terms pretty
quickly, but I recommend jotting them

15
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:55,660
down on a piece of paper to help out
as you're going through the course.

16
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:56,160
Here they are.

17
00:00:57,770 --> 00:01:01,880
The first one is fulfilled, and
that means that the action related to

18
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:06,220
the promise succeeded,
this state is also known as resolved.

19
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:08,380
Then there is rejected,

20
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:11,070
this means that the action
related to the promise failed.

21
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:15,800
The next one is pending,
which means that the promise has not yet

22
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,600
fulfilled or rejected.

23
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,780
And then finally, there's settled,

24
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:23,140
which means that the promise has
either fulfilled or rejected.

25
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:27,430
Okay, now that you've got
the terms behind promises and

26
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:30,790
you know where we're going in
the course, it's time to examine how and

27
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:32,320
when promises are executed.
