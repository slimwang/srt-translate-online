00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,188
Writing up and counting out those 22 n in
the last quiz took me a really long time,

2
00:00:05,188 --> 00:00:09,110
so I can only imagine how torturous it
would have been if I had, had to multiply

3
00:00:09,122 --> 00:00:14,083
2n by a number bigger than 11. Fortunately
there is a much easier way to simplify

4
00:00:14,083 --> 00:00:17,926
terms than adding them together like we
did then. To talk about how this works,

5
00:00:18,024 --> 00:00:25,989
let's start by considering a term. Lets
say, 5x times 7y times 2z. Now remember, a term is

6
00:00:25,989 --> 00:00:29,866
a bunch of variables or numbers, or both,
that are multiplied together. And before

7
00:00:29,866 --> 00:00:33,650
we start playing around with this term,
I'd like to add one more word to our

8
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:39,062
vocabulary, factor. Now, factors are
things that we multiply together.

9
00:00:39,062 --> 00:00:43,750
Just like terms are things that we add
together. So this term, 5x times 7y

10
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:49,005
times 2z, is made up of a bunch of factors
that are all multiplied together. Another

11
00:00:49,005 --> 00:00:53,208
way to think of a factor, is that it's
something that a term is divisible by.

12
00:00:53,208 --> 00:00:57,377
Now, we can't forget that in this term
there are invisible multiplication signs

13
00:00:57,389 --> 00:01:02,567
between the five and the x, the seven and
the y, and the two and the z. So another

14
00:01:02,567 --> 00:01:07,836
way to think about this term is that it's
5 times x times 7 times y times 2 times z.
