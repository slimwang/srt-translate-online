1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,960
The next step is to add the client
side functionality to login.html.

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:06,710
Facebook has two options for
doing OAuth login.

3
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:10,720
Import the Facebook JavaScript SDK,
and use the Facebook functions.

4
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:12,460
Or construct your own Auth manually.

5
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:15,520
Since our web application only uses
JavaScript from the client side.

6
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:19,130
I will create an implementation that
uses the SDK to create a log in button

7
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:21,410
and retrieve the short
lived access token.

8
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:22,980
Similarly to the Google Plus function,

9
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,960
I will create an Ajax call to
send this token to my server.

10
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:28,430
On the server side I will
manually trade this token for

11
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:30,230
a long lived token with Python.

12
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:31,350
So, let's dive into the code.
