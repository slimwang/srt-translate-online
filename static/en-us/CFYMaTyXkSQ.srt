1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So unfortunately the factor-2 approximation that we have found for vertex cover

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
does not carry over to clique or independent set.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Well we've only shown that it doesn't carry over to independent set,

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
but since independent set and clique are, again, so closely connected

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
you can already see or at least guess why it doesn't carry over here as well.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
And I've actually mentioned a similar thing to you in the last unit

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
when we talked about fixed parameter tractability.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Where it was also the case that if you took the size of the optimum solution as a parameter,

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
there is a parameterized algorithm for vertex cover,

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
but clique and independent set are both not fixed parameter tractable.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
So the thing here is this.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
A reduction that you use to show NP-completeness

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
is, in a way, a very coarse way of reducing problems to each other.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
So coarse that it can destroy approximation factors,

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
that it can destroy fixed parameter tractability, and so on.

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
So there are special types of reductions

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
that will keep approximation factors or fixed parameter tractability.

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Unfortunately we can't go deeper into them in this course,

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
but you should just know that just because two problems are closely related,

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
that does not mean that algorithmic techniques, such as approximation algorithms,

21
00:01:11,000 --> 99:59:59,999
easily carry over from one problem to the other as well, unfortunately.
