1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:07,060
So your suggestion was to take a modeler and use it to take turn transitions

2
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:11,070
into a model, but once we have a model, you already told us last time

3
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:13,870
how we can use a planner to spit out a policy. You didn't talk about

4
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:15,010
those planners. What are, what's the name

5
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:17,420
of the algorithms that you described last time?

6
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:18,960
>> Value iteration and policy iteration.

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,017
>> Yes, right. So, so what you can do is, is run either

8
00:00:22,017 --> 00:00:25,350
of those algorithms in here. They both have the same API right, they both

9
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:26,650
take models and spit out policies.

10
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:27,400
>> True.

11
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:33,300
>> Alright, so, so let's do this as a quiz. We'll say, let's use your idea of

12
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:38,270
mapping transitions to model to policy. And what

13
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:40,700
would you call this whole box? Right? And so

14
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:42,730
as a whole box, it takes transitions in

15
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:45,620
and, and produces policy out. So it is solving

16
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:47,030
the reinforcement learning problem. But it's taking a

17
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:50,384
very particular approach to it. But let's contrast it

18
00:00:50,384 --> 00:00:53,150
with the, with kind of the opposite idea. Which is,

19
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:56,790
we can also map a model through a simulator into

20
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:59,250
transitions. And then if we have the ability to do

21
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:02,860
reinforcement learning. We can use, turn those transitions into a policy.

22
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:07,070
So again, as a, as a, composed system. This is

23
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:10,240
turning a model into a policy, so it is a kind

24
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,490
of planner, but it's a planner that uses a learner

25
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:15,660
inside and this is a learner that uses a planner inside.

26
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:19,090
So just, as, just out of curiosity I would like to,

27
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:22,071
just ask people what they'd want to call these. I'm not going to grade

28
00:01:22,071 --> 00:01:24,680
these, but I just I'm just interested. Like, what would you call

29
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:27,960
this approach? Does that make sense? Just type it in the box.

30
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,660
>> Let's pretend it makes sense.

31
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:31,870
>> Alright. Go.
