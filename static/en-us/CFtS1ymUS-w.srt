1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,120
Since the slope in this case will be the change in tax

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,360
paid, over the change in income earned, that will give us the tax

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:10,590
rate written as a decimal. If we wanted to see the tax rate

4
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:15,421
written as a percent instead, we need to multiply the decimal by 100.
