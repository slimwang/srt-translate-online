1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,130
So, for this approval process that we're doing it looks

2
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:06,370
like when we submit the first time, we lock the record.

3
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:06,650
>> Yep.

4
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:08,390
>> So nobody else can play with it.

5
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:09,700
>> No one else can modify it

6
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:12,390
until it's either been fully approved or rejected.

7
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:14,900
>> Makes sense. Okay. And we can do,

8
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:16,450
looks like we can hit other actions there?

9
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:16,990
>> Right.

10
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:20,280
>> Okay. so, let's think about this. What are we going to want to do here?

11
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,880
>> Okay, so in this case, when a new

12
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:25,230
set time is created and you know, we've added

13
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:31,000
a band or a stage, we probably want to change the field once it's

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,060
been set to in review, set the status of it from New to In Review.

15
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:39,550
>> Okay. So, let's do that.

16
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:39,700
>> Yep.

17
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:43,330
>> Field update. Change status to in review? Is that okay?

18
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:43,840
>> Yep.

19
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,590
>> And the field update is status. How

20
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:50,440
very cool. So specifying a field value, in

21
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:50,660
review.

22
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:52,110
>> And then Save.

23
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:53,600
>> Okay. That makes sense.

24
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,350
>> So, now that we have it changing

25
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:59,400
that status field, it'll notify everyone, hey, this

26
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,940
is why the record's locked. It's in review.

27
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:05,170
The next piece would be waiting for whoever was

28
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:07,730
approving it to actually say whether they approve

29
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:09,260
it or not, so there's going to be a

30
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:11,260
related list on the record where they can

31
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:13,620
do it from there, like straight from the record.

32
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:14,790
>> Oh, so the manager can do it.

33
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:15,820
>> The manager could approve,

34
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:20,520
yes or no, or if we had that email template set up, they could also approve via.

35
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:21,290
>> From the email?

36
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:21,590
>> Yes.

37
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:26,420
>> Cool. Okay, and approval steps, so this is just somebody saying,

38
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,930
this is the part of the process where somebody says, looks good.

39
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:32,370
>> Yeah. So this is talking to whoever needs to approve it, and see how

40
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:35,570
it says step one? You could add a bunch of approvers if you really wanted to.

41
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:38,370
>> Okay. But we don't, so now we can final approval actions.

42
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:38,850
>> Right.

43
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:39,520
>> Alright.

44
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,520
so looks like by default, it locks the record.

45
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:43,460
>> Yep.

46
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:47,370
>> And we want to, I guess, change the status again to Confirmed?

47
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:48,980
>> Yeah. Sounds good.

48
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:56,640
>> All right we did that. Okay and then we have Rejection Actions and

49
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,180
Recall Actions which sounds similar to me. But I guess there's a distinction.

50
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:03,650
>> So, I would say, I mean. We'd probably

51
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:06,330
want to keep using that status field to delineate where

52
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:07,220
in the process it is.

53
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:07,450
>> Yeah.

54
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:10,288
>> with Final Rejection, I would say

55
00:02:10,288 --> 00:02:12,090
that would probably be cancelled because we're like,

56
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:15,460
no we don't want this anymore. But Recall, maybe we'd send it back to New.

57
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:18,900
>> That makes sense, okay. Alright. We've got our

58
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:21,890
actions all figured out, based on what the approval says.

59
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:22,330
>> Yep.

60
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:23,930
>> So what should we do next?

61
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:25,150
>> Test it out.

62
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:25,930
>> Sounds good.
