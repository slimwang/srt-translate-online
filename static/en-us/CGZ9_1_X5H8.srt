1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,920
If we want an interval width of 1 10th, we need to choose the value that's 1

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:10,533
10th away from 1.5 and 1 10th away from 1.7. That value is 1.6. So, our new

3
00:00:10,533 --> 00:00:15,181
intervals then are going from 1.5 to 1.6, and then from 1.6 to 1.7. Now, the

4
00:00:15,181 --> 00:00:21,231
value of the function at 1.6 is negative. So, that means our zero must lie

5
00:00:21,231 --> 00:00:27,561
between 1.6 and 1.7 since we know that the function is positive at 1.7. So,

6
00:00:27,561 --> 00:00:31,255
what have we done? Well, we started out with a big graph of this function, this

7
00:00:31,255 --> 00:00:35,805
quartic function. And we were able, through testing different values of x and f

8
00:00:35,805 --> 00:00:40,546
of x to zoom in on one of the zeros of that function. We've narrowed down it's

9
00:00:40,546 --> 00:00:44,742
location to a really small interval. An interval of just 1 10th. That's really

10
00:00:44,742 --> 00:00:47,118
tiny, considering we started out looking at the domain going from negative 3 to

11
00:00:47,118 --> 00:00:52,702
3. We can see how powerful the intermediate value theorem really is.
