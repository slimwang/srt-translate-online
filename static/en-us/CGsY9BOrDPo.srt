00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Now, we talked about using language for learning,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
and this slide is demonstrating the power of language,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
how it has such a powerful connection to the real world that allows us to learning things

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
just by observing language use.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
What I've done here is I've gone to Google trends and types in two search terms--

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:29,000
"full moon" and "ice cream" and gotten back a graph of how popular those queries are over time.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
We also have a graph of the news volume for those terms over time,

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
but that's not so interesting here.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
What's interesting this side is the regularity in these patterns.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
This pattern allows me just by observing language to do amateur astronomy.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
What do I mean by that?

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Well, look at the curve for ice cream.

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Popular in the summer. Not so popular in the winter.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
What that means is if I wanted to figure out what the rotational period is of the earth around the sun,

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
all I have to do is measure these peaks, and it would come out to 365 days--

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
a very regular performance of language speakers using the term "ice cream" in the summer

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
repeatedly year after year.

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Now, there's a little bit of a blip here.

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
What happened in this case?

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Well, it turns out that a manufacturer of cell phone operating systems

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
decided to call the latest update to their operating system "Ice Cream Sandwich,"

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
and so there was a lot of searching for that when it came out.

23
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
But that just lasted a few days, and then things went back to normal.

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Similarly for the query "full moon" in blue, we see this period here,

25
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
and we can measure that period to be 28 days,

26
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
we we can do amateur astronomy and figure out how the moon works as well,

27
00:01:54,000 --> 99:59:59,999
just by observing how people in the real world use language.
