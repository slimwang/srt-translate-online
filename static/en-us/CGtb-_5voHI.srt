1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:03,000
You've gone through a lot by this point,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,010
you've written an application with
separation of concerns in mind and

3
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:08,920
you've also added a completely
unexpected feature to it.

4
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:12,160
That is nothing to sneeze at,
that's impressive.

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,650
Now rock-star developers will often
write code entirely in JavaScript

6
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:18,840
with no organizational libraries,
and that's what we just did so

7
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,760
seriously give yourself a pat
on the back, it's impressive.

8
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,900
Sometimes though, it is useful to
use an organizational framework or

9
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,080
a library to give you
the features you need,

10
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:29,700
without needing to do a ton
of work at the beginning.

11
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:33,380
We'll learn how to use one of them,
and what they name their octopus.

12
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:36,950
So, keep going, keep the momentum up,
you're doing great, and

13
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:38,480
there's some really fun stuff coming up.
