Here's a similar postcondition for resizing a window expressed in OCL.

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,560
The context part gives the signature, and it's saying that the new size is,

3
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:10,590
is an integer.

4
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:14,050
The precondition is that that new size is greater than or equal to zero.

5
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:17,680
And the post condition is that the height of the window, okay,

6
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,100
which was the percept, is going to be that new size.

7
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:22,290
So about as simple as you can get it.
