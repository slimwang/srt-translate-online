00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
One of the things we keep asking our startups to think about is

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
how big is this opportunity?

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
That's just a fancy word for saying when you're all done

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
and you're spending the next couple years in the startup

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
are you going to make a million, or are you going to make a billion?

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
That is, how potentially large is the opportunity?

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
And so what we really want to do is do what we call

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
a market and opportunity analysis.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
What you've already put together is a business model canvas

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
with your hypothesis that says, "Look, we're really passionate about

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
this product or service, and we think there's a set of customers out there,

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
and we've put together a revenue model, our first hypotheses

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
and saying we're going to make a lot of money," and that's great,

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
but there's really kind of a method to this madness,

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
and there's not only one way to do this,

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
but this is the way we kind of think of it.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
You want to identify who your customers and markets are,

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
and you have, but you now want to size the market,

19
00:00:52,000 --> 99:59:59,999
look at competitors, and figure out whether this market could grow.
