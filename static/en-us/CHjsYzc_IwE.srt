1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The answer is if we just optimize this one over here, we get the original path,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
and the reason is obvious. It's already zero for the original setting.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Further minimization doesn't make it any smaller. It's a quadratic error.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 99:59:59,999
The minimization has no effect. We just get the original path.
