1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,468
Well, it turns out there's no solution for this equation, let's see why. We know

2
00:00:05,468 --> 00:00:11,276
each of these denominators cannot equal zero, so x cannot equal positive 3 and x

3
00:00:11,276 --> 00:00:16,254
cannot equal negative 3. Remember, we don't want these fractions to be

4
00:00:16,254 --> 00:00:20,678
undefined. This number would make this denominator equal to zero. And this

5
00:00:20,678 --> 00:00:25,128
number would also make this denominator equal zero as well. This last

6
00:00:25,128 --> 00:00:29,960
denominator as factors of x plus 3 and x minus 3. So really we've already have

7
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:33,620
take in account of numbers that x can not be for it since we solved these two

8
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:38,856
equations already. If we factor this last denominator we can see that this LCD

9
00:00:38,856 --> 00:00:43,156
would be x minus 3 times x plus 3. We know this since this is a factor of this

10
00:00:43,156 --> 00:00:48,762
denominator. And this is also a factor of this denominator. Next, we multiply

11
00:00:48,762 --> 00:00:53,694
each term by the LCD. We cancel the factors that appear in the numerators and in

12
00:00:53,694 --> 00:00:58,165
the denominators. We're left with 2 times x plus 3 for the first term. And

13
00:00:58,165 --> 00:01:03,500
negative 3 times x minus 3 for the second term. Our last term is just negative

14
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:08,590
12. Since these factors reduce to 1. This is a linear equation that we're

15
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:13,340
familiar with. We simply want to distribute this 2 and this negative 3 first and

16
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:18,008
then combine our like terms and solve for x. Positive 2 x and negative 3 x

17
00:01:18,008 --> 00:01:23,583
equals negative x. And positive 6 and positive 9 equals positive 15. Make sure

18
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:27,925
you're careful on this distribution. We have negative 3 times negative 3, which

19
00:01:27,925 --> 00:01:32,498
equals positive 9. It's really easy to make that sort of mistake. I'm going to

20
00:01:32,498 --> 00:01:36,499
rewrite this equation up here. Then we subtract 15 from both sides to get

21
00:01:36,499 --> 00:01:41,449
negative x is equal to negative 3. If we multiply through by a negative 1,

22
00:01:41,449 --> 00:01:46,508
positive x would equal positive 3. But we want to be careful here. We know x

23
00:01:46,508 --> 00:01:52,026
equals 3 is an excluded value. It makes this denominator and this denominator

24
00:01:52,026 --> 00:01:57,379
equal to 0. So these fractions would be undefined. Since x equals 3 as an

25
00:01:57,379 --> 00:02:02,903
excluded value up here, we know that there's no solution. There's no real number

26
00:02:02,903 --> 00:02:05,393
that exists that can satisfy this equation.
