00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,086
Here's the starter code that we were given. We were already given the

2
00:00:03,086 --> 00:00:07,890
declaration, for this variable, but we still have to initialize it. And down

3
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:11,950
here is, the loop, that we've had at the beginning of this lesson, that

4
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:17,551
arranges, all of the pictures. This time, all of the pictures inside matches,

5
00:00:17,551 --> 00:00:22,868
so that they appear side by side. Our job is, to fill up, the ArrayList

6
00:00:22,868 --> 00:00:29,360
matches. We need to initialize the variable, and here is the expression. We

7
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:31,970
called the new operator, because we want to have a new object and the type of

8
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:37,064
the object is ArrayList off the picture. The parenthesis here, again, just

9
00:00:37,064 --> 00:00:42,720
means that we call the construct. Next, we loop through all of the pictures in

10
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:48,514
the original array list. For each one we decide whether it's a match. And so we

11
00:00:48,514 --> 00:00:53,136
added to this ArrayList, that's all. As it happens with this set of pictures

12
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:57,628
there are two matches. Those of them are displayed here. Now you've seen quite

13
00:00:57,628 --> 00:01:00,841
a few useful algorithms, but maybe your getting a bit tired of our galleries

14
00:01:00,841 --> 00:01:05,989
here. Go ahead and practice them with Sarah in a different context.
