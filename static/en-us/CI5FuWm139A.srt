00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:04,696
And the answer is, that both of these functions have inverses. Here are their

2
00:00:04,696 --> 00:00:09,038
graphs and we can see, that they each pass the horizontal line test. Once

3
00:00:09,038 --> 00:00:12,660
again, here's the original function. H of x equals 2x squared with no

4
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:16,963
restrictions on the domain at all. So, even though this function doesn't have

5
00:00:16,963 --> 00:00:21,055
an inverse, because it doesn't pass the horizontal line test. And apparently,

6
00:00:21,055 --> 00:00:24,093
for some functions at least, if we change the domain of the function, we can

7
00:00:24,093 --> 00:00:28,405
influence whether or not it has an inverse. That's pretty neat, domain

8
00:00:28,405 --> 00:00:32,090
continues to be super powerful and really, really important to keep in mind.
