1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,764
Even though we can't split this into two separate inequalities and solve, this

2
00:00:04,764 --> 00:00:09,093
inequality does tell us something. It tells us that the values of x 4 and

3
00:00:09,093 --> 00:00:13,778
negative 4 are really important. If we did consider each of these factors by

4
00:00:13,778 --> 00:00:18,450
itself an inequality these two points would be the end points of the solution

5
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:23,526
intervals. So let's say then that we're going to use these two points to break

6
00:00:23,526 --> 00:00:28,629
the entire number lineup into three sections. One over here, one in the middle

7
00:00:28,629 --> 00:00:33,622
and one over here. Now that we have these three different regions in our number

8
00:00:33,622 --> 00:00:38,334
line, I'd like you to label each of those intervals with an inequality that

9
00:00:38,334 --> 00:00:42,897
tells us what values of x lie in that interval. Make sure that you exclude

10
00:00:42,897 --> 00:00:44,425
negative four and four.
