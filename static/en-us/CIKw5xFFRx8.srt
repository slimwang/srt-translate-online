00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
First we're going to talk about correctness.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The question is what property do we need

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
in order for RSA to be invertible?

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
And let me remind you the encryption and decryption functions.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Here are the possible choices.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Which one of these do we need in order for the RSA encryption system

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
to provide the correctness property that we can invert messages

8
00:00:19,000 --> 99:59:59,999
encrypted with a public key by using the private key?
