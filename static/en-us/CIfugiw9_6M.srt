1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The answer is when we see the 14 we're not sure what this value is.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
It has to be less than or equal to 14,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
which means it might be the right path or it might not.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Once we see the one then we know that the value is less than or equal to one,

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
and we know that we have a better alternative here, so we can stop at that point.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Then we can prune off the 8.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Out of the three, only this node, the right-most, would be the one pruned away.
