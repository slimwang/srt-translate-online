00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Now, as a final epilogue, I have here a copy of a letter written by Monty Hall himself

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
in 1990 to Professor Lawrence Denenberg of Harvard

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
who, with Harry Lewis, wrote a statistics book

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
in which they used the Monty Hall Problem as an example,

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
and they wrote to Monty asking him for permission to use his name.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Monty kindly granted the permission, but in his letter,

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
he writes, "As I see it, it wouldn't make any difference after the player

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
has selected Door A, and having been shown Door C--

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
why should he then attempt to switch to Door B?

10
00:00:38,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So, we see Monty Hall himself did not understand the Monty Hall Problem.
