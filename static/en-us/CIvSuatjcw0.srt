1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:03,969
Iteration seems like a very
specific process for most products.

2
00:00:03,969 --> 00:00:06,950
I mean, entrepreneurs,
you need to analyze data and

3
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:11,050
act accordingly to improve your
specific monetization model.

4
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:13,590
And it can vary a lot by product.

5
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:17,930
But are there any instances where we can
provide specific, actionable tips for

6
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:19,070
a given product?

7
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:23,230
>> Actually yes, companies in the game
industry seems to follow a few

8
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:25,810
proven paths for increasing revenue.

9
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:30,760
First, promote certain items at
the right situation for heavy gamers.

10
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:33,780
The challenge here is to
identify these players and

11
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:35,770
to find the right situations.

12
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:39,410
Second, offer an item
with a big discount

13
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:41,900
only to the potential paid users.

14
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:44,740
The challenge is to
segment these users and

15
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:46,600
control the exposure of this discount.

16
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:51,070
Third, use ads for non paying users.

17
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:53,330
The challenge is to blend the ads and

18
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:57,620
protect the experience so
the users will still love the game.

19
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:00,300
>> And for everyone else we've
got some key takeaways for
