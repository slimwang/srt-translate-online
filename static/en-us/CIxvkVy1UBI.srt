1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:01,850
Well, this one's tricky.

2
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:05,560
X smaller than 3, yes means you're on the left side.

3
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:06,670
And if you're on the left side,

4
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:10,330
I would say 2 is a great decision boundary over here.

5
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:14,550
So, I'm going to go put in 2 over here as a test.
