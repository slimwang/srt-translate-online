00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:04,059
For example of pre and post conditions think about an operation for

2
00:00:04,059 --> 00:00:07,689
taking a square root. In English we might say something as far as

3
00:00:07,689 --> 00:00:13,060
a precondition is concerned, the argument had better be a non-negative number.

4
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:17,170
As far as a post condition is confirmed something like the square of

5
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:21,870
the computed results must equal the argument. That's a little bit backwards way

6
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:26,810
of thinking about things but in fact it is a true expression of equality okay,

7
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:31,440
that must, must be the case if square root has the meaning we expect it to have.

8
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:37,700
If we were to express these particular constraints in OCL, we might do

9
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:43,220
them in the context of the built-in class reel. And having,

10
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:50,540
adding an operation called square root, that returns as a result, a real answer.

11
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:56,170
The precondition is that the argument which is, in, in this case,

12
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:58,950
is the number we're taking a square root of had better be better than or

13
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:02,490
equal to zero. And the post condition is that

14
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:08,900
the argument should be equal to the result when multiplied by itself.
