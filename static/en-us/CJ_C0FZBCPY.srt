00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,107
>> So if the mean, median and mode are the same for both of these distributions,

00:00:04,107 --> 00:00:08,358
what's the difference between these two? There might be more than one answer.

00:00:08,358 --> 00:00:12,627
Are the salaries of people with social networking accounts more consistent? Or

4
00:00:12,627 --> 00:00:16,625
maybe the salaries of the general public are more consistent. Or is it that

00:00:16,625 --> 00:00:21,160
people with the highest salaries don't have social networking accounts? People

00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:25,483
with the lowest salaries have social networking accounts? Or finally, the

00:00:25,483 --> 00:00:30,131
distribution of salaries of the general public sample is more spread out. Check

00:00:30,131 --> 00:00:33,146
all that you think we can say about these distributions.
