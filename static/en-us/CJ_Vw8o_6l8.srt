00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,210
For this quiz,
I'm going to show you two websites.

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:07,939
And I want you, to tell me,
how many break points each website has.

3
00:00:07,939 --> 00:00:09,590
First off, there's medium.com.

4
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:12,300
Pay attention to this example.

5
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:15,560
I'll start small, and
then slowly resize the page.

6
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,180
Watch the way the content changes.

7
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:21,270
Okay?

8
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,300
And this is the sample site
I want you to check out.

9
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:27,270
Notice how this content changes,
when I resize the browser.

10
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:29,670
You can find a link to this page,
