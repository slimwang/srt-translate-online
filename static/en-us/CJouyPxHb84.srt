1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:04,230
In the previous example, we saw how we could make visualizations more clear

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:06,420
by removing extraneous elements.

3
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:10,240
We can conceptualize this relationship using something called the data

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,520
to ink ratio.

5
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:14,650
The data to ink ratio was defined in 1983 by Edward Tufte,

6
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:19,240
and describes the ratio of ink used to describe the data to the ink used to

7
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,080
describe everything else.

8
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:23,100
So what is a good data to ink ratio?

9
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:28,540
Typically, we think of high data to ink ratios as being very good.

10
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:32,080
It means that a large portion of the ink used in a visualization is used to

11
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:33,800
describe the data points themselves.

12
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,240
A low data to ink ratio is usually very bad.

13
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:40,140
And describes a visualization in which the majority of the ink is not used to

14
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:43,050
describe the data, but is actually describing something else.

15
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:47,120
In general, we want to have the highest data to ink ratio as possible.

16
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,930
If we have a low data to ink ratio,

17
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:52,700
we have extraneous elements in our visualization that should be removed.

18
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:54,230
Let's look at an example.

19
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:55,720
In this example we look at two

20
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:58,210
graphs that are representing the same information.

21
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:02,800
On the left hand side, we have a visualization that has a low data to ink ratio.

22
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,070
Notice, the extra elements in the visualization that can be removed,

23
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:08,220
such as the blue background, the horizontal and

24
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:11,460
vertical grid lines, and the outer black border.

25
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:14,070
What this shows is that a large amount of the ink used in

26
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:17,060
this visualization does not directly describe the data at hand.

27
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:19,270
On the right hand side,

28
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:23,260
we see a visualization with the same data with a high data to ink ratio.

29
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:27,520
The only ink used is ink that is actually describing the data directly.

30
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,760
Comparing both visualizations side by side, the one on the right is

31
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:34,610
not only more pleasing to the eye but it is also much easier to understand.

32
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:37,860
When we're building data visualizations, we always want to strive for

33
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:40,620
as high of a data to ink ratio as possible.

34
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:43,790
Let's go through a few more examples of how we can take a visualization with

35
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:46,710
a low data to ink ratio or extraneous elements, and

36
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:50,330
reduce it down to something that is simpler and much easier to understand.

37
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:52,640
In this example, we're going to take a visualization and

38
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,900
try to improve it's data to ink ratio.

39
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:57,970
Here, we have a bar chart showing the number of calories for

40
00:01:57,970 --> 00:01:59,320
various types of foods.

41
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:02,880
At first glance, we can see examples of bad visualization techniques that

42
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,340
we've discussed previously.

43
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:07,268
Such as this busy background, poor color choices, and

44
00:02:07,268 --> 00:02:09,750
the use of 3D shadow and gradients.

45
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:13,460
Let's walk through step by step how we can simplify this visualization and

46
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:15,420
increase it's data to ink ratio.

47
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:18,090
First, let's remove the wood background from the outside and

48
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:21,470
the gray background from the inside, increasing contrast and legibility.

49
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:25,520
We can also remove redundant labels, such as the legend and

50
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,010
some of the titles as this information is encoded elsewhere.

51
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:30,640
Now that we have removed the background,

52
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,400
the heavy borders separating the various elements are no longer necessary.

53
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,330
So let's take those out too.

54
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:39,160
Remembering our color theory, we shouldn't use more than one or

55
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:43,310
two colors in the visualization unless it is encoding some value in the data.

56
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:47,410
The color of these bars don't reflect any differences between the foods.

57
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:50,380
So let's remove all of the colors except for the food of interest.

58
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:52,490
In this case, bacon.

59
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:53,100
Great.

60
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:55,740
We've already improved the data to ink ratio quite a bit, but

61
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:57,250
there's more that we can do.

62
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:01,470
Recall that 3D graphs, including gradients and shadowing, can be misleading.

63
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:03,120
So let's flatten out those bars and

64
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,850
remove the drop shadows to make it more clear.

65
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,550
We can also make the data stand out by reducing the boldness of the labels and

66
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:11,120
the gridlines.

67
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:15,330
If we want to go even further we can remove the lines entirely, and

68
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:18,400
encode the values directly into the bars themselves, like this.

69
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:22,490
Comparing the two visualizations side by side,

70
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:25,900
you can easily the effect of improving the data to ink ratio.

71
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:29,800
The visualization with the high data-to-ink ratio is far more clear, more

72
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:33,390
interpretable, and that's all the elements you need for a great visualization.
