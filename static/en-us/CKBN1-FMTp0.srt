1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,160
So when you've identified
a problem point in your app,

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:05,440
how do you go about figuring out
what the best solution is for that?

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,950
>> So the first thing to realize is that

4
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:11,090
to some extent honestly
there is no best solution.

5
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:12,450
There are lots of best solutions.

6
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:14,390
>> Mm.
>> and your job is just to find

7
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:16,435
one the fastest you possibly can.

8
00:00:16,435 --> 00:00:17,260
>> Mm-hm.

9
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:20,680
>> So
the best way to do that is actually

10
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:22,550
through quantity rather than quality.

11
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:25,450
Don't necessarily focus on
finding the best solution,

12
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:29,030
just come up with the first thing
that you think might be better.

13
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:31,885
And then come up with the next ten
things that you think might be better.

14
00:00:31,885 --> 00:00:32,500
>> Mm-hm.

15
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,170
>> And
then make prototypes of all of those.

16
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:36,675
Again, we're going for fast and cheap.

17
00:00:36,675 --> 00:00:37,600
>> Mm-hm.

18
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,620
>> So
that this is a really quick process.

19
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:41,755
Make ten prototypes, test them all.

20
00:00:41,755 --> 00:00:43,550
>> Mm-hm.
>> And see which is better.

21
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:45,270
>> Okay.
>> Then do that three more times, or

22
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:47,720
four more times
>> Or five more times and

23
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:53,040
eventually you'll start to settle in and
really understand what people care about

24
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,670
and what's the best-
>> Mm-hm.

25
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:57,100
>> What really is valuable to them.

26
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:57,600
>> Right
