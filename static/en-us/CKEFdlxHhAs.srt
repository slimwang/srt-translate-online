00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,830
Okay, let's try to apply the CSS rules to

2
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:05,440
our DOM tree. The first div rule would set the

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:08,000
text color to red, which is a property that

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,990
cascades down to the Hello text. This next rule makes

5
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:14,450
the paragraph contents to be displayed in black and

6
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:18,090
here's the font part. The rule applies to all paragraph

7
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:21,758
nodes regardless of its parent. Hence we change the

8
00:00:21,758 --> 00:00:26,252
color of the text to black for Hello and world.

9
00:00:26,252 --> 00:00:30,919
Finally, we get to our last rule, which tells us that any paragraph node

10
00:00:30,919 --> 00:00:35,900
that has a div as its parent should be hidden from the render tree. As

11
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:41,360
a result, we can prune this branch from our render tree and all we're left with

12
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:47,720
is world. So, the final answer is world and the text color is black.
