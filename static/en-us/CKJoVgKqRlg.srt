00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,950
The first thing we want to check is whether the sound manager is actually

2
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:10,902
enabled. We define default settings for looping and volume. And we reset them

3
00:00:10,902 --> 00:00:15,790
if they are actually defined. Next, we use the path that was passed in earlier,

4
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:22,310
to locate the sound effect. We create a new audio buffer source. Next we tell

5
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:27,224
the source which sound to play, and pass in the volume, whether it's looping

6
00:00:27,224 --> 00:00:37,741
and connected to the gain node. Finally, we simply play the sound clip. [MUSIC]
