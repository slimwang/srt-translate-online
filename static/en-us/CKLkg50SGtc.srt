00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,750
I'm here with Siya Raj Purohit who is
a program manager here at Udacity,

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:06,372
managing the app
entrepreneurship degree.

3
00:00:06,372 --> 00:00:08,293
Thank you so much for
talking to us today Siya.

4
00:00:08,293 --> 00:00:08,830
>> Thanks, David.

5
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:10,240
Good to be here.

6
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,900
>> So, Siya is an experienced online
student as well as a manager of online

7
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:14,510
programs.

8
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:16,209
So I wanted to start off by asking you,

9
00:00:16,209 --> 00:00:19,717
what are some of the exciting new things
that are coming out in online education

10
00:00:19,717 --> 00:00:22,029
that some of our students might not yet
be aware of?

11
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:24,650
>> So a year ago,

12
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:28,490
Harvard Business School launched
a program called HBX CORE.

13
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:32,030
So what is really interesting about
this, is that instead of disrupting,

14
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:36,080
it's core business, which is they took
graduate students with an MBA degree.

15
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:39,280
Instead, they're extending the pipeline,
by targeting students who

16
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:44,410
are undergraduates, or just before
the MBA stage, to teach them critical

17
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:49,200
skills in economics, business
analytics and financial accounting.

18
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,210
So these are the three
classes that HPX offers.

19
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:53,550
And it's a thee month program.

20
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:55,590
It costs about $1,500 to $1,800.

21
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:58,980
And students complete it
in cohorts essentially.

22
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:02,050
So each cohort consist
of about 600 students.

23
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:04,819
And they go through the program and
gain these skills.

24
00:01:04,819 --> 00:01:08,070
And then take a final exam
at a Pearson Test Center.

25
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:10,170
So it's a pretty interesting experience,
and

26
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:12,050
I just completed that,
about two months ago.

27
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:12,560
>> That's very cool.

28
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,990
It's interesting that, I think,
when online education first got started.

29
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:18,955
And the reason why we have separate
modules in this course for

30
00:01:18,955 --> 00:01:22,329
online learning and MOOCs,
is that when online education really got

31
00:01:22,329 --> 00:01:25,020
started a few years ago MOOCs
were really all the rage.

32
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:26,597
And it was about these
giant open courses and

33
00:01:26,597 --> 00:01:29,080
we're just going to put it out there and
if we build it, they will come.

34
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:32,420
But I think we're seeing more and
more of what you're describing of more

35
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:36,036
closed, somewhat gated programs, that
have a monetary cost associated with

36
00:01:36,036 --> 00:01:38,850
them and have some kind of
credential associated at the end.

37
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:39,430
>> Yeah.

38
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:41,960
>> And we see the same thing at
Coursera and here at Udacity.

39
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:45,780
Can you comment on the new initiatives
and those directions at those companies?

40
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:49,590
>> So finding that in putting courses
together is packaged like this

41
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:52,110
improved attention rates
across all companies.

42
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:56,200
So HPX Core has
a completion rate of 85%,

43
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,930
which is really high for
online learning.

44
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:03,820
Maybe because of Harvard's name or maybe
because of the giant price tag, but

45
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:06,130
it's really working for these companies.

46
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:10,710
And across MOOCs, the average completion
rate used to be between three percent

47
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:12,098
and thirteen percent.

48
00:02:12,098 --> 00:02:16,553
And with nano-degrees, specializations
by Coursera, and the programs such

49
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:21,088
as HPX Core, they've gone up to between
60 and 80 percent completion rate.

50
00:02:21,088 --> 00:02:22,150
>> Wow.

51
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:22,990
>> Which is much more,

52
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:26,380
because I guess you get a degree
of certification at the end.

53
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:29,830
Coursera specializations
are really interesting also.

54
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:31,762
I've looked into the business
fundamentals one.

55
00:02:31,762 --> 00:02:34,930
The is providing
collaboration of Coursera.

56
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:38,450
It consists of four courses and
the capstone project in the end.

57
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:42,430
So what I really liked about it was the
capstone project was designed with 500

58
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:45,090
start ups, which was this
very cool incubator program.

59
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:48,670
And it was like, an option you
need to page 500 start ups, or

60
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:50,830
start a problem your solving.

61
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:53,730
However, what I didn't like about
the course was that all the, or

62
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:58,090
the program, was that all the four
courses were about big business things.

63
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:01,390
So that's like, about like financial
accounting the big company or

64
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:05,030
like business analysis at a big company.

65
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:08,290
And not like the start up kind of
problems you're trying to solve.

66
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:10,390
As a start up you have no data,
you have nothing to like-

67
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:10,960
>> Yeah, exactly.

68
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,480
>> No finances, either.

69
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,730
So, and it's a bit disconnected there.

70
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:16,950
But I really like where
they're going with that, and

71
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:19,590
I think that with Vordan's backing,
it may get somewhere.

72
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:22,380
>> Yeah, University of Maryland
has one on that platform that's on

73
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:23,440
entrepreneurship as well.

74
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,280
It actually has the exact opposite
thing, it covers all about funding and

75
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,120
startup issues.

76
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:31,930
And basically, by the time that you're
in a company with 15 employees,

77
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:33,550
speculation has nothing
to say about you,

78
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:36,170
it's all about getting
to that initial point.

79
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:37,760
But why do you think there's
such a move right now?

80
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,900
I guess you already commented on it.

81
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:42,680
The retention rates are higher with
these specializations or nano-degrees,

82
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:45,720
what we do, XSeries on edX.

83
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,700
Why do you think the retention
goes up when we have

84
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:52,750
those knit together programs as
opposed to the individual courses?

85
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:55,860
>> I guess because each of
the programs gives you a goal.

86
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,520
HPX is trying to pitch that this is
preparing you for business school.

87
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:01,890
And they have a huge pipeline of
students who are going to be actually

88
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:03,068
part of business school.

89
00:04:03,068 --> 00:04:08,350
Coursera is incentivizing students to
go through the Warden specialization.

90
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:11,130
Just to get free Warden
application in the end.

91
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:12,870
So those kind of
initiatives are helping.

92
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:14,840
And of course you get
[INAUDIBLE] in careers.

93
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:17,220
So we're trying to help
them get an expense for

94
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,910
careers, which is great, too.

95
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:21,980
So I think those goals are great.

96
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:26,700
And also, having a cohort system,
of students who are kind of encouraging

97
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:30,560
you, and also holding you liable
to complete, really helps, too.

98
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,900
>> Yeah.
I think we see a lot of that

99
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:32,910
in the LMS program as well.

100
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:35,740
It's actually built in very many
ways around the same model.

101
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:37,360
It's a credential at the end.

102
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,430
It's some people who join the same
semester, and the semesters are long

103
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:43,860
enough that you kind of have
a cohort within the semesters.

104
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:47,520
But I would be willing to bet, and in
fact we have evidence that suggests that

105
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,630
the courses on their own are,
they're nice,

106
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:53,870
but very few people take them if there's
not that big credential at the end.

107
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:56,782
There's something about that big
external motivator that, yeah,

108
00:04:56,782 --> 00:04:59,000
is the reason why people
go to traditional college.

109
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,819
And it sounds like they are trying
to include that in some more online

110
00:05:02,819 --> 00:05:04,293
education initiatives,

111
00:05:04,293 --> 00:05:09,010
even if it means compromising the
massiveness of these issues in the past.

112
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:12,700
>> So, sometimes I was not very
motivated during the HBX Core program,

113
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:15,460
because I have a full time job,
this is very difficult thing to do.

114
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:17,320
>> I think we can all sympathize.

115
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,680
>> Ten to fifteen hours
a week gets hard.

116
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,120
So what encouraged me during
that time was my classmates.

117
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,930
I became really good friends with
some of them and they would be like,

118
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:26,670
okay come on Siya.

119
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:27,810
The deadline's two days from now.

120
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:30,382
Let's get started [LAUGH] and
those kind of things.

121
00:05:30,382 --> 00:05:33,870
And also what HPS courted very
successfully that I think other

122
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:37,550
platforms are trying to emulate
is provided a social factor.

123
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:39,300
So you can hear your
classmates' responses and

124
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:41,230
stuff as you go through the course.

125
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:42,610
So, when they ask questions, and

126
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:46,000
then they direct questions to you,
it keeps you motivated to answer them.

127
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,970
>> Yeah.
>> So,

128
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:48,910
I think those two
components really helped.

129
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:49,700
>> Yeah, absolutely.

130
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:52,430
Do you have anything last you want
to say to our online students from

131
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:54,720
the perspective of either someone
producing online education or

132
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,010
a consumer of online education?

133
00:05:57,010 --> 00:06:00,400
>> Yes, so
it's very difficult to complete courses.

134
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,780
Especially when you
have other commitments.

135
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:06,020
But I think everyone should
find at least one friend

136
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:10,220
in every class that they take to make
sure that the buddy system works and

137
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:13,150
everyone goes through
these courses together.

138
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:16,580
I think that online
education will only work

139
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:20,200
if people get incentivized with
those kind of social interactions.

140
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:23,090
So definitely find a friend and
get started on that.

141
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:24,890
>> And as designers of ed tech also.

142
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:28,250
Designing things in such a way,
that the people using your product or

143
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:31,980
using your tools, can connect with
others and possibly partner with them.

144
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:34,570
Or even design tools that
explicitly facilitate that.

145
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:37,230
So many of you might be interested
in computer supportive collaborative

146
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:40,060
learning, where you can actually
develop tools that make

147
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:43,570
this kind of collaboration at
a distance much more easy.

148
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:46,800
I think one thing that's been very
empowering to me in this program,

149
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,420
is that the online environment kind
of creates this 24, seven classroom.

150
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:52,840
And because of that,
you always have people you can talk to.

151
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:55,480
And you can always go to the classroom
and find someone to chat with.

152
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:58,160
And building tools that can
enhance that even more.

153
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,570
That could really improve what
we do in online education.

154
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:03,540
So thank you so much for
talking to us Siya.

155
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:05,090
>> Thanks David.
>> Thank you all for watching.
