hi Brian hey David so you've got a

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:05,969
pretty impressive title vice president

3
00:00:05,969 --> 00:00:08,160
of applied deep learning research what

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,320
does a vice-president do all that

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,240
that's a great question actually right

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,949
now I'm looking for people with deep

7
00:00:13,949 --> 00:00:15,660
learning experience to come join my team

8
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:17,969
but most of my career I've spent

9
00:00:17,969 --> 00:00:19,618
building deep neural networks and

10
00:00:19,618 --> 00:00:21,300
infrastructure for deep learning and i

11
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,460
still spend a lot of my time on that

12
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:26,219
alright so impressed me what's the most

13
00:00:26,219 --> 00:00:28,260
amazing thing you've ever done with deep

14
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:29,699
neural networks

15
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:31,199
well one of the things I'm most proud of

16
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,988
is that i wrote a library that became

17
00:00:33,988 --> 00:00:36,000
cool D&N which has become really

18
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,159
important for using gpus to accelerate

19
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:40,289
deep neural network training all right

20
00:00:40,289 --> 00:00:41,700
I'm impressed

21
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:44,039
Brian's being a little modest kudiye has

22
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:45,929
become so important in fact that it's

23
00:00:45,929 --> 00:00:47,369
effectively a requirement for

24
00:00:47,369 --> 00:00:49,229
successfully training deep neural

25
00:00:49,229 --> 00:00:50,039
networks

26
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:53,520
well I certainly think so soku zan is

27
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,439
great i would be happy if I built one

28
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:57,270
project is successful coup D and then in

29
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:00,119
my life but beyond kudiye and what's the

30
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:01,890
most exciting deep neural network you've

31
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:03,329
been working on recently

32
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:05,879
well the last big project I did was at

33
00:01:05,879 --> 00:01:08,010
baidu and I was part of the deep speech

34
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:09,750
team where we built a new kind of

35
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:11,430
end-to-end deep neural network for

36
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:13,019
speech recognition in English and

37
00:01:13,019 --> 00:01:20,449
Mandarin Chinese that is amazing
