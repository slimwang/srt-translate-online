00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,556
Now that we know that these three intervals are important in some way, I would

2
00:00:04,556 --> 00:00:09,313
imagine that they each represent or don't represent solutions of x in different

3
00:00:09,313 --> 00:00:14,094
ways. What I would like to know is whether values within each reasons satisfy or

4
00:00:14,094 --> 00:00:18,807
don't satisfy the original inequality we had, x squared is greater than 16. So

5
00:00:18,807 --> 00:00:23,025
for each interval, start out by picking a value for x that lies in that

6
00:00:23,025 --> 00:00:27,273
interval. And then, secondly, check to see if that value satisfies this

7
00:00:27,273 --> 00:00:28,096
inequality.
