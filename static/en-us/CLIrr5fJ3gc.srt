00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:01,870
Let's zoom in a bit on this idea, and

2
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:04,660
see how it plays out in a bit more detailed code example.

3
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:08,630
Start by considering this function that takes two positional parameters and

4
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:11,010
makes no mention of the keyword this at all.

5
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:12,720
Looking at the code you see here,

6
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:17,470
what do you expect to be bound to the second positional parameter named "two"?

7
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:18,600
Fill in what you think it might be.
