00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,246
Now that we factored and found our vertical asymptote, let's use long division

2
00:00:03,246 --> 00:00:06,333
just like we did in the last lesson, to find the horizontal asymptote of this

3
00:00:06,333 --> 00:00:11,251
function. First though, I'm going to need to multiply the numerator out again,

4
00:00:11,251 --> 00:00:16,590
so that I have something in a form that I can divide with. Okay, so now I have

5
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:24,310
that T equals 0.966x squared plus 9.66x divided by 11x plus 50. Let's use long

6
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:28,270
division to carry out this division that we see in the fraction. So here I've

7
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:32,665
written out our division in long division form. If we solve this long division

8
00:00:32,665 --> 00:00:36,655
problem, what is the first term of our answer going to look like? Is it going

9
00:00:36,655 --> 00:00:42,420
to be some coefficient times x. Will it be a constant? Will it be a fraction

10
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:47,116
with a denominator of 11x plus 50? Or, will it not be anything because you

11
00:00:47,116 --> 00:00:49,549
refuse to do anymore long division at all.
