1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,710
Now take a look at this set of digits and

2
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:05,660
count how many times the digit nine appears.

3
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:09,340
How long did it take you to recognize the number of nines this time?

4
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:10,940
Much faster, right?

5
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:14,780
It's pretty incredible that such a small change, such as color,

6
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:18,780
can allow us to recognize and instantly process this digit nine more quickly.

7
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:22,960
I want you to take a guess at how fast pre-attentive processing just

8
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,490
happened for you.

9
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:28,630
Now, you may not know which of these is the correct answer, which is fine.

10
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:30,570
I encourage you to try each of them out and

11
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:34,310
see how the real world compares to these short timespans.

12
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:36,320
You'll see what I mean when the site gives you feedback.
