00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,070
So using this diagram, here's some quiz questions that ask you to

2
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:07,470
figure out what's really going on there. And for this quiz, you should be

3
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:12,570
aware that the events labeled A, B, C, and D correspond to the four buttons on

4
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:16,570
your stopwatch. First question is how many outermost states does the watch have?

5
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:20,995
Second, what button must be pressed to turn on the alarm clock feature?

6
00:00:20,995 --> 00:00:23,170
It's the alarm clock, not the stopwatch. Third,

7
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:28,050
in the ALIVE state, how many concurrent machines are running? Fourth, when the C

8
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:32,630
button is pressed to set the time, which part of the time, that is the day,

9
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:36,610
date, hour, minute, or second, is the first one the user can change?

10
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:40,500
And fifth, if you are changing the time on your watch and you press the B

11
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:44,940
button to indicate you are done, what unexpected side effect occurs?
