00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,150
Okay, so to share videos and photos, I

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:06,170
will click on the Discussion thread with a star.

3
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:08,990
Now, the star means that I created this thread

4
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:13,090
for you to submit your responses. Once the discussion

5
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:16,379
forum has opened, you can simply scroll down

6
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:18,550
and add a YouTube link right here to the

7
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:21,670
discussions. You will notice that there is a YouTube

8
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:24,220
video that is embedded right within the discussion forum.

9
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:30,600
There. Now let's talk about how to upload a

10
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,120
photo. To do that, I will click on this

11
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,110
tiny photo icon, and then simply upload a photo

12
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:40,950
from my computer. That's the one I want to upload.

13
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:45,930
And you will notice that much like the YouTube

14
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:49,640
video, the photo is also uploaded right here within the

15
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:54,870
discussion forums. Let me hit Submit, and done. So

16
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:57,860
here I am, back to the mini project, which is

17
00:00:57,860 --> 00:00:59,400
for you to teach the program that we have

18
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:02,610
written together, to a friend or a colleague. We also

19
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:05,310
want you to use your smartphone to record a video

20
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:09,050
of your conversation. And then share that YouTube video with

21
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:12,220
us on the discussion forum. Oh, by the way, if you are

22
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:15,030
an unable to record a video, we would love to see some

23
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:20,450
photos or some text describing your conversation with your friend. After you've

24
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:23,960
submitted your responses on the forum, make sure you check this box.
