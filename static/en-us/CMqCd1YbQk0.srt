1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:05,955
All right, so in creating your
Hello World Swift iOS app in Xcode,

2
00:00:05,955 --> 00:00:09,316
let's go to File, New, and Project.

3
00:00:09,316 --> 00:00:13,624
We're going to select Single View
Application, we're going to make sure we

4
00:00:13,624 --> 00:00:17,521
have the application section
selected under iOS and click Next.

5
00:00:17,521 --> 00:00:19,270
We're going to type in
the name of our product.

6
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:23,700
Now this iOS app is your first iOS app,
let's call it PitchPerfect.

7
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:26,320
You can put in whatever organization
name you would like and

8
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,180
identifier we're going to
cover that in a little bit.

9
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:31,280
Make sure the language selected is
Swift, that it's set to Universal,

10
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,860
and you don't need to
use Core Data right now.

11
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:35,670
We're going to use it
in a later project.

12
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:36,820
With that, click Next.

13
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:40,080
Select a location that
you'd like to put it.

14
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,270
For me here I'm just going to
put it straight in the Desktop.

15
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,150
Go ahead and click Create.

16
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:48,180
Xcode will now create a new iOS
app called PitchPerfect and

17
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:51,740
automatically create some needed
files and settings for you.

18
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:55,830
Here, you can see the iOS app that Xcode
has automatically created for you.

19
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:59,220
It has an AppDelegate class that will
listen to system events such as being

20
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:02,550
called when your app starts,
when you get a memory warning, and

21
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:04,500
when your app is sent to the background.

22
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,765
There is also a view controller and
an empty view.

23
00:01:06,765 --> 00:01:09,500
We'll add more to those soon.

24
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,960
For now you can add a single
line into the app delegate to

25
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:14,665
a function that gets called
when the app launches called

26
00:01:14,665 --> 00:01:17,640
applicationDidFinishLaunchingWithOpti-
ons.

27
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:21,470
This one line of code will print
out Hello World to the console.

28
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:22,470
So here we are here, and

29
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:26,340
we can see that in green Xcode
has highlighted comments for us.

30
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:29,290
And this function that we're talking
about here is the one where we want to

31
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:30,450
add a line.

32
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:31,568
In the AppDelegate,

33
00:01:31,568 --> 00:01:35,175
inside the application
didFinishLaunchingWithOptions functions

34
00:01:35,175 --> 00:01:38,180
we're going to add the line,
print("Hello world").

35
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:42,980
Now if you click the Run button
right up here on the top left,

36
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:45,950
we're actually going to run
this in the iPhone simulator.

37
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:49,210
You can see our brand new app
showing an all white background.

38
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:52,360
In the console you see
the words Hello World.

39
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:55,382
Five minutes and
you've already created an iOS app.

40
00:01:55,382 --> 00:01:58,120
Although it won't win any
Apple design awards just yet.

41
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:01,720
We're going to work to build it and
improve it throughout this course.

42
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,840
First let's take a closer look at Xcode.
