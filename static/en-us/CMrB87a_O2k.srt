00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,620
The first thing we need to do in order to simplify this and modify the equation

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:08,889
is to multiply out the product of these two binomials. That way, when we

3
00:00:08,889 --> 00:00:13,721
subtract 750 from both sides we can very easily combine like terms and simplify.

4
00:00:13,721 --> 00:00:18,342
You'll notice I've written the expression on the left in the standard form for

5
00:00:18,342 --> 00:00:23,113
polynomials but the highest degree term first. Great. So we have x squared plus

6
00:00:23,113 --> 00:00:25,498
35x minus 450 is less than or equal to 0.
