00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
This homework is about refactoring the bridge successor function.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I want you to write a new function.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
We'll call it bsuccessors3, which takes a bridge state as input,

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
but we're going to represent the states in a different way.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
We're going to represent them not as a set that included the light,

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
because in the old bridge successor function--bridge successor 2--

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
it just seemed kind of complicated that I had to deal with the special case of are

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
the elements of the sets on the here and there side--

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
are they people or are they the light. It just got a little bit overly verbose.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I think maybe there's a better representation, so we're going to try a different representation.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
We're going to try one where there is a set of people on the here side,

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
a set of people on the there side, and then the light is going to be an index.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:56,000
It's going to be 0 if the flash light, the torch, is on the here side and 1 if it's on the there side.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Then the tuple for the actions is going to be a little bit different.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:08,000
It's just going to be a set of people--the travelers that are going--then followed by the arrow.
