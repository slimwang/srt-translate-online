1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,770
So let's have a look back at the laws of NP completeness,

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:09,200
and the laws of NP completeness, of course, is a book that only holds unless P=NP.

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:14,490
If anybody ever proves P=NP, then we can recycle this book here or delete the e-book.

4
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:18,880
So what do the laws of NP completeness say--they say, "No polynomial algorithm."

5
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:24,970
So now it's time to think like lawyers and try to put loopholes into the statement here

6
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:27,390
and there's two loopholes that you can poke into this.

7
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:33,320
One is that we only say, "No polynomial time." We do not say, "Exponential time."

8
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:39,390
What do I mean by that? Well, what about a running time like 2^√n.

9
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:44,860
It's not exponential time--it's called sub-exponential because you don't have the n as it is

10
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:48,100
appear in the exponent, but it's also not polynomial time because you have

11
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:50,060
some function of n up here in the exponent.

12
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:55,360
A running time like this actually conforms with the law and it has an excellent speedup.

13
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:59,150
So let's think about this for a minute. Let's say n=50.

14
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:09,490
If n=50, what is the speedup of 2^√n versus 2^n. Of course, we're going to do this as a quiz.

15
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:14,140
Is it over a million, is it over a billion, or is it over a trillion.

16
00:01:14,140 --> 99:59:59,999
Of course, I only want you to select one answer here, the best possible one.
