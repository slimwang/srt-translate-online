1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:02,100
Remember, the only criteria for

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:05,110
whether something would be a fast-forward merge is if the branch you

3
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:09,250
are merging into is an ancestor of the branch that you're merging from.

4
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:10,540
This is an example of that.

5
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:11,140
It's pretty clear.

6
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:13,820
If you trace back from b you get to a.

7
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:18,310
So this one would definitely be a fast-forward merge.

8
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:19,890
In this case you can also get from b to a.

9
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:22,560
There would be another way to go.

10
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,660
But since this is in the history at all, we do check this one.

11
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:27,850
Here there's no way to get to a from b.

12
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:31,670
Nowhere in the line from b to the first commit do we find a.

13
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:34,310
So here, no, we can't do a fast forward merge.

14
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:36,600
We would have to create a new merge commit.

15
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:41,550
Similarly, in this case, a is not in the path from b to the initial commit.

16
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:43,810
So we can't do it here either.
