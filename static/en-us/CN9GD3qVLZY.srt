1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
To answer this question, we can just list off each operation in clique

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
that takes 1 unit of time.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
First, we print. Second, we evaluate range of 4, which returns (0, 1, 2, 3)

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Then since j is 0 the first time,

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
we evaluate range of 0 and nothing gets printed.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Next, we loop through again and j = 1,

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
so we evaluate range of 1, and we print once.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Now, j = 2, and we evaluate range of 2.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
In range of two, we print twice.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Going through the loop again, now j = 3.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
So, we evaluate the range of 3.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
In the inner loop we print 3 times.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:44,000
We can count this up 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 operations.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
So, our answer is 12 units.
