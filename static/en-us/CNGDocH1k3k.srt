1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:03,450
An important point. Even though we can predict the price of

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:06,170
a diamond based on a function for c's. One thing you

3
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:09,020
should not conclude with this exercise is that where you buy

4
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:12,620
your diamond is irrelevant. You almost surely pay more for the same

5
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:16,610
diamond at Tiffany's compared to Costco. Regardless you can use a

6
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:18,670
model like this to get a sense of whether you were

7
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:23,000
overpaying. One last thing, data and models are never infallible and

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,280
you can still get taken even equipped with this kind of analysis.

9
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:29,430
There's no substitute for establishing a personal connection and

10
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:31,890
lasting business relationship with a jeweler you can trust.
