1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:01,640
But before we get stuck into the code,

2
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:04,689
we're going to be in pixels
across the Atlantic to Mike.

3
00:00:04,689 --> 00:00:07,980
Mike, I hear you've got a bit of
an interactive task up your sleeve.

4
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:09,130
>> Hey, yeah, I do.

5
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:11,920
We want to make sure the project
is working correctly.

6
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,190
And you're able to
alter the connectivity.

7
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:17,400
We've already seen both servers running,
one is the app itself and

8
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,580
one has these configuration options
including this little test form.

9
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:24,440
When one of these challenges
requires you to change the project,

10
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:28,390
either by changing settings or
writing code, you get it all working.

11
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:31,770
Then, type the test name into this box,
and press Enter.

12
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:33,240
The system will run a little test,

13
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,068
and decide if everything's
working as it should.

14
00:00:35,068 --> 00:00:37,010
If you want to stop the animations for

15
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:40,710
some reason, although I don't know
why you would, who doesn't like cats?

16
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:41,810
Just clear the text field.

17
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:44,710
So on to the first challenge.

18
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:48,630
Use the connection controls to get
the app server into offline mode.

19
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:51,970
Once you've done that,
refresh the app to see what happens.

20
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:54,450
Type offline into the test field and
press Enter.
