00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:03,120
For this assignment, discuss how you'd use frames to

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,130
represent Raven's Progressive Matrices. At a basic level, what are the slots and

3
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:10,690
fillers associated with different Raven's problems? Where are these frames going

4
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:13,820
to come from? Is the agent going to receive the problem in terms of frames

5
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:17,780
initially, or it going to generate these frames based on its own reasoning?

6
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:21,560
Once it has these frames, what exactly are the reasoning methods it's going to

7
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:24,540
use to solve the problem based on these frames?

8
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:27,890
We've also talked about frames representing individual figures from the problem.

9
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:29,330
But what about a frame representing the problem,

10
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:33,500
as a whole? What about a frame representing individual shapes within figures?

11
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,630
How would representing the problems at that different level of abstraction,

12
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:39,150
help the agents solve the problem more easily.

13
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:41,880
What are frames going to enable us to do, that we couldn't do otherwise?
