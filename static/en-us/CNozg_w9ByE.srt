1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,630
So one of the key aspects of

2
00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:08,490
Quicksilver implementation is Log Maintenance. The transaction managers

3
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:10,360
write the log records for recovering the

4
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:13,500
persistent state. They're written in the log records

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,140
that are in memory data structure of

6
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:18,420
the transaction manager, and every so often, the

7
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:22,030
transaction managers do a Log Force. Of the

8
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:25,180
in memory log segment to the storage, for

9
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:29,300
persistence. And the frequency of log force impacts

10
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:33,450
performance, of course, because they are synchronous I/O operations.

11
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:36,260
And log force can also be initiated by

12
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:38,815
an application if it is concerned about about its

13
00:00:38,815 --> 00:00:43,280
persistent state. Getting onto storage but in Quicksilver

14
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,550
an app has to be very careful about often

15
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:47,920
they do a log for us. Because log maintenance

16
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,410
is done by the transaction manager at a site,

17
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:55,560
for all of the processes that are running at that node. And so the large record

18
00:00:55,560 --> 00:01:00,440
in Quicksilver actually contains all the modifications to

19
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:04,580
persistent state. Required by all the processes that

20
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:06,830
are running at this node. And therefore, if

21
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:09,730
an individual client at a node decides to

22
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:12,370
do a log force, it is actually impacting

23
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:16,150
the performance of not only that particular client,

24
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:20,890
but all the other clients as well. Therefore, services have to be very careful

25
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:24,350
about choosing the mechanisms That is available

26
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:28,420
in operating systems. Commensurate with their recovery requirments.
