1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:03,719
Now, our Cat function isn't very smart.

2
00:00:03,719 --> 00:00:07,000
It makes the same cat every single time.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,960
I'm going to refactor it a bit so
we can make all kinds of cats.

4
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:15,200
Now, right now, when you call to make a
new cat, it just runs this function and

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,830
does all of this stuff.

6
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:19,580
But we're not passing anything into it.

7
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:23,320
Let's pass an object literal into
our Cat constructor function.

8
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:24,990
I'm going to call it data.

9
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:30,040
Now, if someone gave us, say, an array
of cat data, we could easily make

10
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:35,640
those different cats by saying new
Cat and passing an object literal.

11
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,820
See?
Thinking ahead is good.

12
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:40,350
Now let's go through
the steps to make this work.

13
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:45,010
Now, before we tackle this part here,
let's tackle what gets passed in.

14
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:50,000
Down here when I say new Cat, I'm
going to pass in that object literal.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,570
Later on, we'll actually have multiple
cats, so we'll be doing this again and

16
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:55,590
again and again for each Cat object.

17
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,320
Now here are the various properties for

18
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,930
the same cat that our Cat function up
above was making over and over again.

19
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:06,403
Now we're passing them into
the Cat constructor function.

20
00:01:06,403 --> 00:01:10,073
Now up at the top, instead of actually
setting these values like this,

21
00:01:10,073 --> 00:01:13,652
we're going to actually set them based
on the data that gets passed in.

22
00:01:13,652 --> 00:01:19,990
So, this.clickCount will actually
be equal to data.clickCount.

23
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:23,660
From the object literal that we
passed down below into here,

24
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:27,480
we'll set the clickCount of
that to the cat we're creating.

25
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,232
We'll do the same thing for
all the rest of them.

26
00:01:29,232 --> 00:01:35,420
Now, this.title stays exactly the same
because for every cat, if the clicks

27
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:40,870
are less than ten, the title will be
Newborn, less than 50 is Infant, etc.

28
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:43,330
That's hard coded into the cat.

29
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:47,950
And now, rather than having our
data actually explicitly set here,

30
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:51,970
we're setting the data down here
where we create these cats.

31
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:53,650
Now we're ready for more cats.

32
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:55,020
Let's add them in the next video.
