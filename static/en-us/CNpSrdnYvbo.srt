1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Let's use the cancer example from my last unit.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
There's a specific cancer that occurs in 1% of the population,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
and a test for this cancer and with 90% chance

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
it is positive if they have this cancer, C.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
That's usually called the sensitivity.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
But the test sometimes is positive,

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
even if you don't have C.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Let's say with another 90% chance

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
it's negative if we don't have C.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,000
That's usually called the specificity.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
So here's my question.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Without further symptoms, you take the test,

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
and the test comes back positive.

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
What do you think is the probability of having

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
that specific type of cancer?

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
To answer this, let's draw a diagram.

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Suppose these are all of the people,

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
and some of them, exactly 1%, have cancer.

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
99% is cancer free.

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
We know there's a test

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
that if you have cancer,

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
correctly diagnose it with 90% chance.

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
So if we draw the area where the test is positive,

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
cancer and test positive,

25
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
then this area over here

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
is 90% of the cancer circle.

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
However, this isn't the full truth.

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The test sent out as positive

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
even if the person doesn't have cancer.

30
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
In fact, in our case,

31
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
it happened to be in 10% of all cases.

32
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
So we have to add more area,

33
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
as big as 10% of this large area

34
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
that is as big as 10% of this large area

35
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
where the test might go positive,

36
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
but the person doesn't have cancer.

37
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
So this blue area is 10% of all the area over here

38
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
minus the little small cancer circle.

39
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
And clearly, all the area outside these circles

40
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
corresponds a situation of no cancer,

41
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
and the test is negative.

42
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
So let me ask you again.

43
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Suppose we have a positive test,

44
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
what do you think?

45
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Would a prior probability of cancer

46
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
of 1%,

47
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
a sensitivity and specificity of 90%,

48
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Do you think your new chances are now

49
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
90%

50
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
or 8%

51
00:02:34,000 --> 99:59:59,999
or still just 1%?
