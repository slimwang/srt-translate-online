1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:04,280
So let's look at the solution for our latency and throughput quiz.

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:09,770
We have a website that has 2 servers. A server takes a millisecond to process

3
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:16,059
an order, so the latency of an order is clearly 1 millisecond.

4
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:21,360
That's how long it takes from the time the order arrives until the time it

5
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:26,420
is actually served. The throughput of a single server, because it

6
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:32,060
cannot do anything else while processing the order, is going to be one order

7
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:37,670
per millisecond or a 1000 orders per second. But we have two such servers, so

8
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:44,010
we can process 2000 orders per second. So this illustrates again

9
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:49,080
the situation where the throughput is not just equal to 1 over the latency.

10
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:53,490
If it were like that, we would have only 1000 orders per second. But we can

11
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:58,550
buy more throughput, simply through replication of service in this case and thus

12
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:02,960
achieve a higher throughput than the latency of a single server would indicate.
