Just to give you a simple answer,
the Mahalanobis distance is ideal for

2
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:08,690
samples drawn from
identical distributions.

3
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:14,390
It is useful to use more advanced
clustering techniques like k-means or

4
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:18,370
others to find outliers
in multidimensional data.

5
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:22,800
Ideally we should inspect all
variables that are uncorrelated

6
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,790
to find true outliers
in the entire dataset.

7
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:30,630
However, if you want to explore
more advanced techniques,

8
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:34,210
discuss it in the forum and
try them out on your own.
