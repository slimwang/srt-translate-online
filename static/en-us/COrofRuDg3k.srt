00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:06,232
To answer this question, the very first thing we observe is that each statement implies itself.

2
00:00:06,233 --> 00:00:12,232
So we will draw every element of the diagonal as true.

3
00:00:12,233 --> 00:00:18,699
We also observe that "not pink" implies "green" is the same as pink or green.

4
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:26,399
If you do the truth table, you find that this is true either if green is true, which will be the case of B as well,

5
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:34,299
or if pink is true, in which case the precondition which is implied will be false, and therefore the entire statement is true.

6
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:39,132
So we can find out that B is exactly the same as D.

7
00:00:39,133 --> 00:00:44,266
With that in mind, we answer the question for A to C first.

8
00:00:44,267 --> 00:00:51,632
Pink clearly implies that pink or green is true. It doesn't imply that pink and green is true, so C is not open.

9
00:00:51,633 --> 00:00:55,799
But because B is equivalent to D, we also check over here.

10
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:05,399
Pink or green doesn't imply pink, because green might be true, and doesn't imply pink and green because green might be false.

11
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:11,599
But it does imply D because D is exactly the same as B.

12
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:17,966
Pink and green implies pink. It also implies pink or green.

13
00:01:17,967 --> 00:01:22,499
And since B is the same as D, implies D.

14
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:29,600
And finally, for this one over here, we just copy over B. So we get this guy and this guy over here.
