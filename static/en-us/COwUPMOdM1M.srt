00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,172
In this problem we wanted to find the maximum volume, and we successfully did

2
00:00:04,172 --> 00:00:08,380
that. We found the coordinates of this top point for this portion of the curve.

3
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:12,460
Finding maximum and minimum is something we're often interested in, in math.

4
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:16,681
It's a matter of identifying the point on a graph that is highest or lowest on

5
00:00:16,681 --> 00:00:20,931
the vertical axis. In a given area of the domain. So what is the minimum of this

6
00:00:20,931 --> 00:00:24,894
function? Please fill in the two blanks right here. Tell me first what the

7
00:00:24,894 --> 00:00:28,926
minimum value of the function is, where we can tell the value of the function

8
00:00:28,926 --> 00:00:33,022
based on the vertical axis here, which represents f of x, and tell me then what

9
00:00:33,022 --> 00:00:35,019
the x coordinate of this maximum is.
