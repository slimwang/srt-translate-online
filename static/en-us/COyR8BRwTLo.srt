1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Our last question was basically our next steps.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I mean we've learned a lot of service side technology, introduction of programming-type things,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Where do our students go from here and what would you recommend they learn next?

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Sure. So I would start getting good at two main technologies.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
One is JavaScript, which is a completely separate programing language

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
from anything we've talked about in this class

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
in that it runs in the browser, and so you can make your web page do fancier things.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
The other is CSS--I've had some CSS in the homeworks and in the lectures

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
but I've never quizzed you guys on it because we don't know how to even grade the CSS yet.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
And this is how you described what your pages look like--

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
colors and font sizes and boxes and layouts and all that sort of stuff.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Basically everything you've learned in the class, you can make

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
a pretty substantial website with everything you've learned in this class up until this point.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
And JavaScript and CSS, you can make your website look more professional,

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
look more like a website, but functionally, you can do all the major things.

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
JavaScript and CSS--if you learned those, you'll have a lot of tools in your toolbox.

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Okay. Great! I think that's all the questions we had.

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Unit 6 and homework 6 has just been posted--anything you want to say

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
about that or about week 7 and the final?

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Unit 6 is caching, basically 101 ways to use memcache.

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
That should be a fun one--the homework should be pretty straightforward I think..

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
And in Unit 7, no more quizzes in Unit 7.

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
It's basically we're just going to talk about a lot of the real world stuff we did with growing Reddit,

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
and we'll talk to some of the Udacity engineers about how they app engine in production.

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Then the final is basically going to be building another

26
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:52,000
website similar to your blog but this time all at once and we''ll talk all about that in Unit 7.

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000
One last question I just remembered was how to prep for the final, and I would recommend

28
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
personally that you just make sure you have all the homework done and you understand it.

29
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
If you have those things done, I would say the final really shouldn't be bad.

30
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Yeah! If you've done the homeworks, the final shouldn't be any problem.

31
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
In fact, after I wrote the final code, about two-thirds of that code is from homeworks.

32
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,000
The user a registration stuff, the caching stuff-it's all--you'll find yourself when you're writing

33
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
any web application a lot about that--a lot of that code will get reused over and over again.

34
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
That why we taught it.

35
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
If you can do the homework, you shouldn't have any problem with the finals.

36
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Okay. Great! Well, see you in class. >>Right. Bye guys!
