1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,140
It looks like females on average have slightly more friends

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:05,600
than men. Since I can see that this median line

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,640
is slightly higher. That's what this black line is. It

4
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:12,290
represents the median or the middle 50% of friend counts for

5
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:16,300
females and for males. Now this difference isn't very large.

6
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:19,060
So let's zoom in to take a closer look. This box

7
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:22,535
for females and this box for males Represents the middle

8
00:00:22,535 --> 00:00:25,340
50% of values in our sample. So, I think it makes

9
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:27,330
sense that we zoom in even more to take a closer

10
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:32,479
look. We should consider any values less than 250. Now, there's no

11
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:35,740
exact choice here, I'm just choosing something that seems reasonable, since the

12
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:38,570
bulk of my data is down here. After running this code, we

13
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:40,740
can now see that the bulk of user friend count is

14
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:43,640
similar for the middle 50% of men as it is for the

15
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:47,050
middle 50% of women. Its just our females are slightly higher for

16
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:50,550
friend count. Lets look at actual values though and compare the values

17
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,690
to what we see in our box plot. We can look at

18
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:55,960
those values by using the by command and running a summary of

19
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:59,070
our friend count split by gender. So first, I want to include

20
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:01,960
my friend count which is the variable I want a summary of. I

21
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:05,170
want to split it over gender and I want a summary. Running this

22
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:07,760
code, I get an output of my table, which shows me the

23
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:12,050
minimum maximum values for both genders, as well as the core tiles.

24
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:15,600
The first core tile for women is 37 and that looks about right

25
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,750
in our graph. The third quartile or the 75%

26
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:21,600
mark is at 244 and that's all the way up

27
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,270
here. This means that 75% of female users have friend

28
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:28,370
counts below 244. Or another way to say this is

29
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:31,260
that 25% of female users have more than 244 friends.

30
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:34,870
Similarly for the men, we can see how the first

31
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:37,650
quartiles and the third quartiles match up to the box

32
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:40,730
plot. Now, you might have remembered that we used coord_cartesian

33
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:43,330
in the solution video from before. We did this so that

34
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:46,400
way, the table output would match our box plots. If we would

35
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:49,480
have just used the ylim parameter inside of qplot, we would have

36
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:52,820
gotten different quantiles that wouldn't match our picture. This is just a

37
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:54,920
subtle difference that you should be aware of when working in

38
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:59,430
R. Now, it's your turn to answer a different question. On average,

39
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:03,360
who initiated more friendships in our sample? Was it men or was

40
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,380
it women? Used some of the techniques that we just covered and

41
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:08,139
then write a few sentences explaining how you

42
00:02:08,139 --> 00:02:10,660
came up with your answer. This second question won't

43
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:12,810
be automatically graded, but it's important that you

44
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:14,880
know how to communicate your analysis to other people.
