00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,830
Here are two other expressions with absolute value. I'm going to apply the

2
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:08,254
order of operations and then the absolute value to get my answer. Absolute

3
00:00:08,254 --> 00:00:12,126
value acts as a grouping symbol. I need to evaluate any expressions inside of

4
00:00:12,126 --> 00:00:15,778
it first. But it's a particular grouping symbol, because it means the distance

5
00:00:15,778 --> 00:00:19,784
from zero. So whenever I get my answer, I need to figure out, how far is that

6
00:00:19,784 --> 00:00:26,780
answer from zero? Have the absolute value of the negative of 3 squared plus 2

7
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:32,240
times 4 squared. Remember, whenever there's a negative sign standing alone.

8
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:37,173
It's really a negative 1 times. So I'm going to have my absolute value. I'll

9
00:00:37,173 --> 00:00:43,728
have 3 squared, which is 9. The negative one right before it. Then plus 2 times

10
00:00:43,728 --> 00:00:48,746
4 squared. When I look at what to do next, I know I still have a power. I'm

11
00:00:48,746 --> 00:00:54,440
going to do 4 squared. 4 times 4 is 16. Now I'm going to do the multiplication.

12
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:01,908
Negative 1 times 9 is negative 9. And 2 times 16 is 32. I'm going to add 32 and

13
00:01:01,908 --> 00:01:08,336
negative nine, or 32 minus nine. And I get the absolute value of 23. The

14
00:01:08,336 --> 00:01:14,354
absolute value or the distance of 23 from zero is 23. Okay for the second

15
00:01:14,354 --> 00:01:19,730
problem I have the negative of the absolute value of negative 9 minus 3, times

16
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:25,985
the quantity 5 minus 2 squared. Remember, here's a negative side standing

17
00:01:25,985 --> 00:01:30,988
alone. So I really have negative 1 times this value. So negative 1's on the

18
00:01:30,988 --> 00:01:36,278
outside, and then absolute value symbol. When thinking about what to do next, I

19
00:01:36,278 --> 00:01:40,122
need to start with this inside parentheses. I'm going to go ahead and list

20
00:01:40,122 --> 00:01:46,626
negative 9 minus 3. For this inside parentheses, I'll do 5 minus 2 squared. I

21
00:01:46,626 --> 00:01:52,034
know 2 squared is 4. So I have 5 minus 4. My negative 1 is still on the

22
00:01:52,034 --> 00:01:58,412
outside. I have absolute value of negative 9 minus 3 times 1. Now I'm going to

23
00:01:58,412 --> 00:02:05,145
do multiplication. I have the absent value of negative 3 minus 3,. Minus 9 and

24
00:02:05,145 --> 00:02:10,176
minus 3 is negative 12. So, I have minus 1 on my outside and minus 12 inside my

25
00:02:10,176 --> 00:02:16,450
absolute value. When I take the absolute value of negative 12, I get positive

26
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:22,872
12. The distance, or the absolute value of negative 12 from 0 is 12. So I have

27
00:02:22,872 --> 00:02:28,373
negative 1 times a 12. Notice that when I take the absolute value of something,

28
00:02:28,373 --> 00:02:32,510
I no longer need to write the symbol absolute value. I've taken its positive

29
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:38,234
distance from 0. The distance of negative 12 from 0 is 12. Then, my final

30
00:02:38,234 --> 00:02:41,104
answer, I have negative 1 times 12, or negative 12.
