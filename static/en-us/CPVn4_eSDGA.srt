This conversation reminds me of a game
show that has a very interesting and

2
00:00:04,242 --> 00:00:05,960
non intuitive problem
associated with it.

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:07,689
>> Are you thinking
the Monty Hall problem?

4
00:00:07,689 --> 00:00:09,109
>> Yes, I am.

5
00:00:09,109 --> 00:00:10,480
You're shown three doors,

6
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,339
behind one of them is a shiny new car,
while the other two have a goat.

7
00:00:15,619 --> 00:00:18,660
These are randomly assigned so
you don't know which is which.

8
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:22,050
You're asked to pick one door,
then the host, Monty Hall,

9
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:25,350
opens one of the other two
doors to reveal a goat.

10
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:29,100
Note that Monty never opens
the door with the car behind it.

11
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:33,685
Now, you can choose to either stay or
switch to the other closed door.

12
00:00:33,685 --> 00:00:37,440
Monty then reveals what is behind
the door you decided to go with.

13
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:41,719
If you stayed with your original door
and the car is behind it, then you win.

14
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:43,530
Similarly, if you switch
to the other door and

15
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:46,320
the car is behind that one, you win.

16
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,850
Ending up with a goat
is considered a loss.

17
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:54,359
>> Now the question is, which is better
overall strategy, stay or switch?

18
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:56,579
Or is it the case that
neither is clearly better?
