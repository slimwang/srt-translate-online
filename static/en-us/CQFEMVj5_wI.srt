1
00:00:00,175 --> 00:00:06,030
Let's take a quick example. Suppose the message forma is as follows. Y, d and x,

2
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:12,590
where x is the origin of the message. Y is the node being claimed as root and do

3
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:15,730
is the distance of the particular node sending

4
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:19,100
this message, x from a claimed root. So, initially

5
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:21,290
every switch in the network broadcast a message

6
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:25,410
like x,0,x to indicate that the node that it

7
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:28,730
think itself is the root. When other switches hear

8
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:31,860
this method, they compare the ID of the sender to

9
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:35,070
their owner ID, and they update their opinion of who

10
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:38,000
the root is based on the comparison of these IDs.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,800
Let's suppose that we have the following graph and

12
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,450
switch number 4 thinks it's the root. So we will

13
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:50,170
send a message 4, 0, 4 to nodes 2 and 7. But 2 also thinks it is the root, so.

14
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:52,520
4 is going to receive the message 2, 0, 2

15
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:56,010
from node 2, and then it's going to realize that

16
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:59,260
4 is just one hop away from node 2. So

17
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:02,460
node 4 will update its view of the root to

18
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:05,129
be node 2, eventually 4 will also hear a

19
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:08,980
message 2, 1, 7 from node 7; indicating that node

20
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:12,800
7 thinks it is one hop away. From its view

21
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,960
of the root, which is node 2. It will realize

22
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:19,310
that the path through node 7 is a longer

23
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:22,595
path to the root, and it will remove the link

24
00:01:22,595 --> 00:01:25,740
4, 7 from the tree. We can repeat this process

25
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:28,520
and ultimately we will end up with a spanning tree.
