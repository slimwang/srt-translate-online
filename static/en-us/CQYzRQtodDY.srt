00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:04,522
Why did you sign up for this online general psychology course? Or why did I

2
00:00:04,522 --> 00:00:07,210
take twelve months of training to try to get to the top of half dome at

3
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:11,843
Yosemite National Park. Why did you wait in line for three hours to see the new

4
00:00:11,843 --> 00:00:15,659
Star Trek film? Or why did I order a double cheeseburger and chocolate shake,

5
00:00:15,659 --> 00:00:20,050
even though I know they're not good for me? Well, maybe the cheeseburger makes

6
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:23,513
me feel good, so emotion can play a role. Or maybe I ordered it because I was

7
00:00:23,513 --> 00:00:24,765
just plain hungry.

8
00:00:24,765 --> 00:00:27,411
>> Well, in order to do all the things that Susan just talked about, you can need

9
00:00:27,411 --> 00:00:32,110
motivation, and that's exactly what we're going to talk about in this lesson.

10
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:35,440
First we're going to start with talking about the theories of motivation. Then

11
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,281
we'll talk about how motivations actually drive our behaviours. And we're going

12
00:00:39,281 --> 00:00:41,055
to end the lesson by talking about emotion.

13
00:00:41,055 --> 00:00:45,402
>> That's right. Now the word motivation comes from the Latin verb, which means to

14
00:00:45,402 --> 00:00:49,270
move. And so here we're interested in our movements and actions and what

15
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:53,270
determines those movements and actions. And now Lauren is going to start

16
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:55,705
talking a little bit about motivation in depth.

17
00:00:55,705 --> 00:00:56,947
>> Let's go do that.
