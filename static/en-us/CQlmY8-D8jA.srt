The answer is the third option. The default parameters get initialized when

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,320
functions are defined. We have to be really careful if we use a default

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:11,064
parameter that's a mutable object, which is the case with a list. So, this same

4
00:00:11,064 --> 00:00:15,453
object gets reused every time the functions called without passing a parameter.
