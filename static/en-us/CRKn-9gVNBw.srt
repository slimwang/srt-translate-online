1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:01,859
The first thing we're going to review,

2
00:00:01,859 --> 00:00:05,420
is a framework that will help us
decide how to approach a problem.

3
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:07,920
We're going to use a methodology
that was built initially for

4
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:12,200
data mining problems, but works well for
all types of business problems.

5
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:15,750
This methodology is called the cross
industry standard process for

6
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:19,100
data mining, or CRISP-DM.

7
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:21,840
The framework in this lesson is
generalized from the CRISP-DM

8
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,470
methodology, to work for
all types of business problems.

9
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:29,370
Moving forward, we're going to call
this the problem solving framework.

10
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:31,920
Let's start with a review of
the steps within the framework.
