00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,636
So now let's look at our original parent equation of y equals x squared. What

2
00:00:05,636 --> 00:00:10,966
happens if we multiply that parent equation by 2? Does it open facing the

3
00:00:10,966 --> 00:00:16,364
opposite direction? Is it wider? Is it narrower? Or does it face the same

4
00:00:16,364 --> 00:00:18,805
direction? Pick all that apply.
