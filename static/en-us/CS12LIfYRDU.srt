1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,030
Games usually have
a lot of image assets.

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:04,059
Not always.

3
00:00:04,059 --> 00:00:06,770
Some games create quite a bit
of their imagery programatically

4
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:09,280
actually using simple
graphics primitives.

5
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,650
But it's definitely more
common to represent actors and

6
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:15,900
objects with sprite images or 3D models,
depending on the type of game.

7
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:20,260
When you add textures, backgrounds,
icons, badges, buttons, and

8
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:21,770
other UI elements.

9
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:25,320
The list of image resources you have to
keep track of just keeps getting longer

10
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,240
and longer, especially when you may
need multiple copies of an image

11
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:31,600
with a different level of detail for
each.

12
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:35,500
In these cases, it becomes more
efficient to combine related images into

13
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:38,300
a single sprite sheet or texture atlas.

14
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:41,190
There's a little more overhead in the
drawing code but loading becomes much

15
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:45,480
faster, much simpler and
typically you even save storage space

16
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,970
because the combined images compress
better than they do individually.
