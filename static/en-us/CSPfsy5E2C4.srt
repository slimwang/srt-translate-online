1
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:04,050
The answer is no, we're not done yet.

2
00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:05,979
We have reached the goal state.

3
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:10,550
We put a path onto the frontier that
reaches the goal Bucharest, but

4
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:14,035
we haven't popped that
path off the frontier.

5
00:00:14,035 --> 00:00:18,460
And uniform cost search continues to
search until we pop it off the frontier.

6
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:22,039
We can continue looking to see if
there's a better path that also reaches

7
00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:22,574
the goal.

8
00:00:22,574 --> 00:00:23,256
So, let's see.

9
00:00:23,257 --> 00:00:28,200
I forgot to say Fagaras is explored,
so let's continue.

10
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:32,839
Let's take the cheapest path on
the frontier and expand that.

11
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:37,522
The cheapest path is this 146,
we'll expand that.

12
00:00:37,521 --> 00:00:42,993
Get another path into Sibiu, that's
the worse path that we had before.

13
00:00:42,993 --> 00:00:46,557
So we'll drop it then
let's see what's next.

14
00:00:46,557 --> 00:00:54,084
Looking on the frontier, the cheapest
now is here at 299, we'll expand that.

15
00:00:54,084 --> 00:00:59,720
We get a path of cost 374,
put that on the frontier.

16
00:00:59,719 --> 00:01:01,650
Now let's go again.

17
00:01:01,651 --> 00:01:06,359
Now the cheapest path
is over here at 317.

18
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:10,609
We'll mark that as explored and
add two more paths.

19
00:01:10,609 --> 00:01:11,239
One here.

20
00:01:11,239 --> 00:01:14,079
That's a worse path, so it gets dropped.

21
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:17,911
And one path that also reaches the goal.

22
00:01:17,912 --> 00:01:22,586
And that has a total cost of 418.

23
00:01:22,585 --> 00:01:25,215
So that just shows it's
a good thing we waited,

24
00:01:25,215 --> 00:01:29,200
a good thing we didn't stop when we
found the first path to the goal.

25
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,790
Because now this second path found

26
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:34,859
is actually cheaper than
the first path found.

27
00:01:34,859 --> 00:01:36,379
But we're not going to stop here,

28
00:01:36,379 --> 00:01:40,159
because we still haven't popped
off a path that reaches the goal.

29
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:41,390
So we'll continue.

30
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:42,281
What's next?

31
00:01:42,281 --> 00:01:47,264
Now the cheapest path on
the frontier is here at 366.

32
00:01:47,263 --> 00:01:48,643
We expand that and

33
00:01:48,644 --> 00:01:54,170
we get paths that are worse paths to
points we've already seen before.

34
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:56,430
So nothing new goes on the frontier.

35
00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:00,700
Next, the cheapest path on
the frontier is at 374.

36
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:04,656
Again, expanding that
leaves nothing useful,

37
00:02:04,656 --> 00:02:08,135
only worse paths than we've seen before.

38
00:02:08,135 --> 00:02:14,007
And now finally, the cheapest
path on the frontier is this 418,

39
00:02:14,007 --> 00:02:17,313
paths to Bucharest so we pop that off.

40
00:02:17,313 --> 00:02:20,590
And now we reach the goal and
now we stop.

41
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:25,450
So even though we found the 460
path first, we don't stop there

42
00:02:25,449 --> 00:02:29,179
because there might be another path that
also reaches the goal that's cheaper.

43
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:35,040
We keep on going until we pop a path off
of the frontier that reaches the goal.

44
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:38,370
And that's why uniform
cost search is guaranteed

45
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:40,060
to find the cheapest path to the goal.
