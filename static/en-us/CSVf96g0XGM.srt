00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,480
There's a lot of noise in our graph since we are

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:06,450
plotting the mean of y for every possible tenure x value.

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:09,740
Recall from lesson four that we can adjust this noise by

4
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:13,540
bending our x-axis differently. Let me show you one of those changes

5
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:16,309
in the bend width. Here's our code from before, and instead

6
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:20,080
of using tenure here, I'm going to replace this with a different version

7
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,190
or formula so that way I can bend some of the

8
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:26,110
tenures together. Now let's see the difference when I plot this graph.

9
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:28,920
Notice how I have slightly less noise in my plot.

10
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,380
We still see some of the same peaks from before,

11
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:35,290
especially here, but it's much smoother in general. Here's another

12
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:38,370
one using the number 30 instead of the number seven

13
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:41,320
and here's a graph with very high bias, but much

14
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:45,110
less variance using the number 90. Here I plotted all

15
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:47,470
the graphs so we could compare it to the original

16
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:51,370
one. Notice that as the bin size increases we see less

17
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:53,860
noise on the plot. Our estimates are adjusted

18
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:56,010
since we have more data points for our new

19
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:59,090
values of tenure. In lesson four we introduce

20
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:01,770
smoothers as one tool for an analyst to use

21
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:04,670
in these types of situations. So instead of

22
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:07,100
using gm line here, I'd like you to use

23
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,380
gm smooth, to add a smoother, to this

24
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:12,490
plot. Try doing this, in this next programming assignment.
