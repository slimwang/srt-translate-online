1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
And let's say in expectation, when you go forward 100 m and come back 100 m,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
you are to be where you started.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:14,000
So 7 will be the correct mean. Now σ‘² is more difficult. It turns out the variances still add up.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
And the way to see this is if we started over here at a well-defined zero position,

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
and you go to over here and you have some uncertainty as to where you might be.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
And then you hit the ball back over here, your uncertainty will increase. It won't decrease.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
That makes 2σ² the correct answer.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
So even though we substituted the plus sign by a minus sign,

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
the uncertainty that comes in for either of these steps over here

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
will add up just the way it did before.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
And I have to grant you, this wasn't an easy question and I hope you got it right.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
If not, think about it and perhaps do the same quiz again.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
There's some deep insight here, which is for the means the arithmetic I'm giving you

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
always apply straight, but for the variances things are counter-intuitive.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
When we add to random variables, the variances always

16
00:00:59,000 --> 99:59:59,999
just add up no matter what the operation is plus or minus.
