1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
And I would say the answer is this one, because these quadrants were equally spaced

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and these bars are of equal sizes.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Whereas these three seem to have slices that are significantly different in size,

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
which would imply significantly different cuts.
