>> The answer is y equals negative x squared over 8 plus 4x minus 14. This is

2
00:00:04,793 --> 00:00:09,941
the only equation that is satisfied by all three of the sets of coordinates that

3
00:00:09,941 --> 00:00:14,889
we saw in our x y table before. And it's the only equation of these equations

4
00:00:14,889 --> 00:00:19,656
that will fit any point that we pick along this path. Since every point along

5
00:00:19,656 --> 00:00:24,145
the curve satisfies this equation, this must be the equation that produces this

6
00:00:24,145 --> 00:00:27,760
curve. Now that's great, except that this equation and this graph both look

7
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,613
really different from anything we've played with before. It looks like we've got

8
00:00:31,613 --> 00:00:32,655
some exploring to do.
