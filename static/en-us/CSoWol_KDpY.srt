1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,190
So how would constraint propagation be useful for Raven's progressive matrices?

2
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:07,110
This concept has a strong correspondence to the final project where

3
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:09,750
you'll be asked to reason over the images of the problem directly instead of

4
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:13,290
over the propositional representations that we've given you in the past. So

5
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:17,240
first, if constraint propagation leverages a library of primitive constraints,

6
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:19,680
what will your constraints be for the final project?

7
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,070
How will you propagate those constraints into the image to understand it?

8
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:26,620
Then once you've actually propagated those constraints, how will you actually

9
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:30,710
use those inferences? Will you abstract out propositional representations? Or

10
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:33,390
will you stick to the visual reasoning and transfer the results directly?
