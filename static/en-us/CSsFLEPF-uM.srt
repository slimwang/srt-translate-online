1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,240
To find the updated total future earnings,
we're going to start by writing down the

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:08,756
initial total future earnings we had. So,
this is our baseline, this is what we

3
00:00:08,768 --> 00:00:13,277
start out with, and now, I'm going to show
how these two changes affect the equation.

4
00:00:13,373 --> 00:00:17,832
The first thing that happens is that Mr.
Belvedere triples the amount of money that

5
00:00:17,844 --> 00:00:22,092
Grant will eventually make off of these
first orders. So, that means we need to

6
00:00:22,104 --> 00:00:26,832
multiply this quantity, 84w+60n, by 3.
So I'm going to have to put parentheses

7
00:00:26,844 --> 00:00:31,186
around it and write a 3 out front.
Great. Then the 2nd step is that a

8
00:00:31,198 --> 00:00:36,410
school orders, one set of wipers and one
pair of nozzles for each of its 150

9
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:39,858
students. So that means that for one
student, the school wants one wiper set

10
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:44,468
and two nozzles since they're a pair of
nozzles. And we know that one wiper set

11
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:49,715
costs w dollars, so for one student, the
school is going to pay w plus the cost for

12
00:00:49,727 --> 00:00:55,463
the two nozzles, which we know is 2n. So
the school pays w+2n for every student.

13
00:00:55,582 --> 00:00:59,665
However, they have 150 students to pay
for, so that means that the amount the

14
00:00:59,665 --> 00:01:07,100
school will pay is 150(w+2n), so this is
our final equation. The updated total

15
00:01:07,112 --> 00:01:11,955
future earnings will be equal to 3
times the quantity 84w+60n, and then,

16
00:01:11,967 --> 00:01:18,768
added onto that, 150(w+2n) to account for
the orders from the school. So looking

17
00:01:18,768 --> 00:01:22,716
back at the quiz that you took, I'm sorry,
I left out the word total from the quiz,

18
00:01:22,806 --> 00:01:26,717
these are the same quantity. So we need to
figure out which of these four choices

19
00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:30,746
corresponds with or is equal to this
expression up here and the correct answer

20
00:01:30,758 --> 00:01:35,274
is this 4th choice. Now this doesn't
look exactly like this equation, number

21
00:01:35,274 --> 00:01:39,990
for number, and that's because the 150 has
been distributed to the two terms inside

22
00:01:40,002 --> 00:01:44,472
the parentheses. So, if we do that, we
keep the first part of the expression the

23
00:01:44,484 --> 00:01:49,032
same and then I just multiply 150 by
either the terms in the parentheses, just

24
00:01:49,044 --> 00:01:52,192
like you did with all of your practice
using the distributive property. 150 times w is

25
00:01:52,192 --> 00:01:58,314
just 150w and 150 times 2n is 300n. So that's
why the final answer is the correct

26
00:01:58,314 --> 00:02:02,369
choice. Great. Now, we're one step closer
to giving Grant a very nice and easy to

27
00:02:02,381 --> 00:02:06,109
use equation for the amount of money he's
going to earn.
