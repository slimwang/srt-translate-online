00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,670
Besides the need for routing tables, the most important

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:04,750
thing to understand about the Internet is that it is

3
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:06,880
not run by any single entity, but by a

4
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:10,860
collection of thousands of autonomous systems that share information. Examples

5
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:14,890
of these autonomous systems or AS's for short include

6
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:18,320
Google, MIT, Georgia Tech, Comcast, and so forth. Each of

7
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,540
these autonomous systems is responsible for routing traffic within itself.

8
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:25,880
This is called intra-domain routing. And as you might imagine,

9
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:28,330
there are some interesting algorithmic problems here, that have the

10
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:31,570
shortest path-like character. You can explore this further by taking

11
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:34,170
a networking class, or consulting the links in the instructor

12
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:36,540
notes. Inter-domain routing, which is

13
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:38,290
essential to connecting these often regional

14
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:41,120
AS's together, gets a little more complex because of the

15
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,780
various business interests among these entities. They don't share all of

16
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:47,520
their routing information with each other, but they do advertise

17
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,960
their ability to reach public IPs with a protocol called BGP,

18
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,990
for Border Gateway Protocol. The essentials of such an

19
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:58,830
advertisement are the IP address that they're advertising that they

20
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:01,940
can reach. The Next Hop or the address of

21
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:05,690
the entry point into the advertising AS. And the AS

22
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:08,290
Path, which captures the sequence of AS's that a

23
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:11,225
packet along the route would need to travel through. And

24
00:01:11,225 --> 00:01:14,670
AS receiving such a message would incorporate the information

25
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:16,980
into its own routing tables, so that it knows where

26
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:20,300
to forward packets. To take an example, suppose Comcast

27
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:23,590
wanted to advertise my IP address. Then it would

28
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:26,620
send an advertisement to its partners, which would include

29
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:29,560
let's say a level 3. The AS path on the

30
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:32,860
advertisement would just be Comcast's own AS number. And

31
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:35,350
the next hop would be the desired entry point, or

32
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:39,160
gateway, into the Comcast network. One of Comcast's partners,

33
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:42,050
let's say level 3, then might want to advertise my IP

34
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:45,060
address to say, the Apple AS. And so it

35
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:48,930
would send another BGP packet, with my IP address,

36
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:52,040
their gateway as the next hop, and the AS

37
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:56,360
path of level 3 and then Comcast. That's where all

38
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:00,080
this information has been incorporated into the routing tables.

39
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,810
All the routers in the Apple network know how

40
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:04,600
to send the data back to my machine. They

41
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,240
have their own internal routing before sending it to layer

42
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:11,790
3, who does its own internal routing, before sending it to Comcast, who

43
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:14,780
then does its own internal routing to get the message to my house.
