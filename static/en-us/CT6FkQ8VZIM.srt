Before we jump into a bunch more practice problems, let's look at one more

2
00:00:04,326 --> 00:00:08,584
instance of a domain that is restricted because of what make sense. Just like

3
00:00:08,584 --> 00:00:12,670
Athena couldn't make a room with negative dimensions. Let's look at this

4
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:17,430
function, A of r that describes the area of a circle with radius r. We have the

5
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:21,770
function A of r equals pi times r squared, so if this is our circle that we're

6
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:26,390
considering, the radius is this length, from the center of the circle out to its

7
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:30,396
edge. What I'd like to know is what the domain for this function is. Is it all

8
00:00:30,396 --> 00:00:36,768
the real numbers, r is greater than equal to 0, r is less than 0, or r is not

9
00:00:36,768 --> 00:00:37,908
equal to pi?
