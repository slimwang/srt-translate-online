1
00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:00,577
All right.
So

2
00:00:00,577 --> 00:00:02,930
let's go through the changes
that I'm making.

3
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:07,800
So, first of all, all of these cats are
going to be in an unordered list, and

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,580
each one of them will be a list item.

5
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:14,390
Now, how do I make an li for
every single one of our cats?

6
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:21,260
I can say ul data-bind
is foreach: catList.

7
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:25,230
That will make an li for
each one of the items inside of catList.

8
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,360
And inside of the li,
I'm going to add data-bind as well.

9
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:33,435
It's going to have text
as the name of the cat.

10
00:00:33,435 --> 00:00:37,858
If I save this and refresh it in
the browser, let's see what happens.

11
00:00:37,858 --> 00:00:40,650
And sure enough,
we get the list of all of our cats here.

12
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:42,620
Pretty good.

13
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:46,040
Now we've got our cats showing
up in a list, all we need to do

14
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:48,950
is make the current cat change
when you click on one of them.

15
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,430
That second part is a little
bit more difficult.

16
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:56,530
We know that we need
a click somewhere in here.

17
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:58,710
We don't necessarily
know what it will be yet.

18
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:04,272
But we want a click on this
list item to somehow wire up to

19
00:01:04,272 --> 00:01:06,800
something inside of app.js.

20
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:07,750
Now like I said,

21
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:11,740
bindings can be a little bit difficult
because it's a little bit more difficult

22
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:15,080
to visualize where you are,
what your binding context is.

23
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,915
I might normally feel inclined to do
something like this, on click, setCat.

24
00:01:20,915 --> 00:01:22,900
And then in our app.js,

25
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:27,550
down here in the ViewModel, as it
turns out, that's not going to work.

26
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:28,645
Here's why.

27
00:01:28,645 --> 00:01:33,445
When you click on this, it looks for
setCat within this binding context,

28
00:01:33,445 --> 00:01:36,465
which is within the cat itself.

29
00:01:36,465 --> 00:01:41,905
What we need to do is get up outside of
that binding context to the view model.

30
00:01:41,905 --> 00:01:46,549
The way we get up out of a binding
context is using $.parent.

31
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,056
I'm going to save both of these, and

32
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:51,680
I'll put a console.log statement
in here just to make sure.

33
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:56,510
If I go back to my browser here and
I refresh, sure enough now,

34
00:01:56,510 --> 00:02:00,210
when I click on this,
I get console.logs of hi.

35
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:02,110
Now, rather than running console.log,

36
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:05,010
all I have to do is
update the current cat.

37
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:09,860
To access the current cat,
I'm going to use self.currentCat.

38
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:13,120
Remember, self is referring
to the ViewModel and

39
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,150
that is where currentCat lives.

40
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:18,330
And what are we going to set it to?

41
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:21,580
Well, if you look in the documentation
for click, you'll find that when you

42
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:25,940
click on something and it runs
a function, it passes in the object

43
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:29,009
you clicked on, specifically
the model we're talking about.

44
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:34,724
So when setCat gets run, and
the clickedCat model gets passed in,

45
00:02:34,724 --> 00:02:38,171
we're going to set the currentCat
to the clickedCat,

46
00:02:38,171 --> 00:02:40,780
to the one we just clicked on.

47
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:43,720
Let's save this and hop back into
the browser and see if that works.

48
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:50,020
Now if I click on Shadow,
sure enough, it changes.

49
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:54,070
And if I click, you can see that
Shadow has his own counter and

50
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:57,680
Tiger has his own counter, etc.

51
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,900
So now we've made the cats
show up in a list.

52
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:03,080
We've made the current cat change
when you click on one of them.

53
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,350
I hope you've given
yourself a high five.

54
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:08,870
Although giving yourself a high
five is kind of just a clap, so

55
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:11,370
go find someone else and
give them a high five.

56
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:15,240
You just built together with
me a pretty amazing app, and

57
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:19,350
a lot of it was driven by
you doing it yourself, going

58
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:23,450
through the documentation, learning
things on your own, and trying things.

59
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,360
Seriously good work.
