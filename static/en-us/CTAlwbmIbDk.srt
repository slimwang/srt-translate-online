Okay, here's another question. Suppose a 22 bit address space, a 512

2
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:10,540
byte cache, and a cache block size of 64 bytes. And

3
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:12,810
I want you to tell me how many bits are used

4
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:16,570
for the index, and how many bits are used for the tag.
