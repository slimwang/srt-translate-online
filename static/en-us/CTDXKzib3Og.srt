00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:04,620
Now that we know the slope, we can replace it in our generic equation. Instead

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:10,650
of b, we'll have 0.2. We still need to know our y-intercept, though. Which of

3
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:15,960
the following, if known, will enable use to find the y-intercept? There's one

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:20,930
correct answer. A point on the regression line. The standard deviation of the X

5
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:27,180
values or any one of the data values, meaning the x and y values for any one of

6
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:27,700
these points.
