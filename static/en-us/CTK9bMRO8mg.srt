00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,570
Like lots of Web sites, Udacity uses jQuery.

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:05,990
But what is jQuery actually?

3
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:08,280
What's its relationship to JavaScript?

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:10,310
I want you to find out for yourself.

5
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:14,300
Open up your browser's JavaScript console on the Udacity website.

6
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:17,290
Simply type jQuery and press Enter.

7
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:21,210
Remember, case matters, so the Q has to be capitalized.

8
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:24,749
What shows up? Do you see a function, an object,

9
00:00:24,749 --> 00:00:29,690
something magical, or a non-JavaScript function?
