00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hmmm--it turns out the answer we're looking for is -8.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
And here's how to see it:

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
If Subtraction is Left Associative,

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
then we want to put as many of these parentheses

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
as far to the left as possible.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
So we're going to do (1 - 2) first, and then subtract 3--and then subtract 4.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
So (1 - 2) is -1.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
(-1 - 3) is -4.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
(-4 - 4) is -8.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 99:59:59,999
And that's the answer we got.
