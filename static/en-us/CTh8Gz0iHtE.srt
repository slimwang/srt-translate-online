00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,650
I created the storefront template and
added it to the index file.

2
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:06,560
Then I added the ng controller
directive to add the Lego store

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,100
controller to this template.

4
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:10,910
First, I display the basic
information of the store's name, and

5
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:13,590
the number of bricks it offers
with a couple of expressions.

6
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:16,890
Then I used ng-repeat to loop
through each of the colors.

7
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:21,240
Then I used another nested ng-repeat
to display each color's item size.

8
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,950
So this is what we currently have.

9
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:25,898
Now I need to add the classes and
the more coming soon message.

10
00:00:25,898 --> 00:00:29,740
I used ng-class to test
the item stock levels.

11
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:32,439
If they are less than 10 then
I add the low stock class.

12
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:36,315
Then I used ng-if to display this
message if the quantity is less than 5.

13
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,510
Now to hook up these buttons so
that they actually work.

14
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:43,910
When this button is clicked,
I need to tell the store which color and

15
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:45,490
size were bought.

16
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:48,730
The same information needs to be passed
when the return button is also clicked.

17
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:51,520
In the controller, I created these
functions to change the bricks quantity.

18
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,140
And that's it.

19
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:55,730
We used a number of different
directives in this quiz.

20
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:57,840
But I hope you see the power
that directives give us.

21
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,910
I mean look at how small this template
is and yet we have an app that displays

22
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:03,630
dynamic information and
lets customers interact with the data.

23
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:06,300
I'll say it again,
directives are awesome.
