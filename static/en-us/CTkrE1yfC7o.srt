1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:02,100
So when I was in high school,

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:07,020
I grew up in Canada in the Toronto
area specifically in the Milton area.

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:11,750
And there really wasn't a lot of money
to be had when I was in high school.

4
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:13,590
Poor kids running around farm country.

5
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:17,120
And I had a friend who had a truck,
and one day he turned to me and

6
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:19,600
said, hey you're smart.

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,300
Why don't you figure out a way
that we could make some money.

8
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:25,561
And I was just like okay, so
as he would drive me to and

9
00:00:25,561 --> 00:00:30,157
from school I kept looking out the
window as you do when you're driving and

10
00:00:30,157 --> 00:00:32,695
I would see farm equipment everywhere.

11
00:00:32,695 --> 00:00:38,830
Old farm equipment rooting in
fields rusted, dilapidated etc.

12
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:44,200
One day, we were in the town and we
passed by building that had a huge sign

13
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,440
over it that said,
we buy your scrap metal.

14
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:51,140
Research revealed that this was
a recycling plant and then it struck me.

15
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:53,550
Hey, my friend's got a truck.

16
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:56,480
There's all this old farm
equipment rotting in fields that's

17
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:57,810
obviously not wanted.

18
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:00,510
And here's a place that's
willing to buy metal.

19
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:04,209
So I turned my friend and I said hey,
how would you feel about calling these

20
00:01:04,209 --> 00:01:08,790
people up or just visiting them out of
the blue and saying why don't you pay us

21
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:12,390
to remove your old equipment
that's just dying in your yard.

22
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:13,110
We'll take it away.

23
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,410
And then we would take that
equipment to the recycle plant.

24
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:19,760
He thought this was a brilliant idea.

25
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:22,340
He was willing to
contribute his truck and

26
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:26,640
both of us would use our physical
prowess to move this heavy equipment.

27
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,950
And shortly after doing that, we had
quickly cleared out the territory that

28
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:35,990
we were in, farm equipment and had quite
a bit of money in our bank accounts.
