1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:04,260
So, you might be wondering why anyone
would ever choose pulling over pushing

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:06,210
because there's no obvious
advantage to pulling.

3
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:08,820
So does that mean that
you missed something?

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:10,280
No, you didn't.

5
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:13,540
Properly configured pushing will
always be less expensive for

6
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:15,180
the device on which your app is running.

7
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:18,910
It will lead to fewer syncs, which will
lead to fewer uses of the cellular

8
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:21,850
radio, which will lead
to longer battery life.

9
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:23,580
It also makes things
easier on your server,

10
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:27,600
who won't have to deal with
nagging devices all day everyday.

11
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,570
Note, however,
that I said properly configured.

12
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:34,460
The cost here is extra engineering
effort to set up the pushing server.

13
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:36,530
And it isn't always a simple process.

14
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:39,340
So that's why we introduced
Google Cloud Messaging,

15
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:41,890
to make it easy to communicate
with your applications.
