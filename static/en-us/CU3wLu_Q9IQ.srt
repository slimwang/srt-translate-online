1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:04,110
Okay let's get started with
creating an S3 bucket.

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:07,740
Go to S3 manager AWS,
this is what you should see.

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,550
Click on Create Bucket, there.

4
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:12,810
And give it a unique name.

5
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:17,880
This can only contain lowercase letters,
hyphens, and periods separating words.

6
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:21,175
Make sure to choose
a region close to you.

7
00:00:21,175 --> 00:00:28,040
Okay, go in here and create a folder
to hold input data which is call input.

8
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:31,200
Similarly, create an output
folder called output.

9
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:35,380
You also need somewhere to store
mapreduce and other analysis files.

10
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:37,619
Create a folder for that stuff too.

11
00:00:37,619 --> 00:00:40,013
Okay, now that you have
somewhere to store your data,

12
00:00:40,013 --> 00:00:41,455
it's time to launch a cluster.

13
00:00:41,455 --> 00:00:43,260
Thank you editor, that's great.
