00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:04,930
Hi there, my name is Carl and I'd like
to welcome you to SQL for data analysis.

2
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:08,360
An SQL database is a valuable tool for
managing, organizing, and

3
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:09,660
querying your data.

4
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:10,960
By the end of this course,

5
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:15,010
you'll be able to do all this using data
in your own local relational database.

6
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:17,590
You'll master the basics of SQL,
the language for querying and

7
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:18,800
populating databases.

8
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:21,820
Let's have a look at what you'll
be doing throughout each lesson of

9
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:23,150
the course.

10
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:26,050
In the first lesson you'll learn
some important concepts about how

11
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:28,890
we organize data in
relational databases.

12
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:32,229
In the second lesson, you'll learn
how to use SQL to fetch data out of

13
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:35,110
a database and insert new data into it.

14
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:39,340
And in third lesson, you'll define new
tables, perform more advanced queries

15
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:43,270
and extend the power of your analysis
by connecting python to your database.

16
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:45,870
After each lesson there's
an optional problem set.

17
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:49,550
These are meant to help you gain even
more familiarity with the SQL language,

18
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:52,100
while setting up your
own local database.

19
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:53,800
If you're in the data analyst program,

20
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:57,520
this problem sets also focus on getting
you prepared for one of the projects.

21
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,380
To finish this project you'll need to be
able to define schemas, import data, and

22
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:04,379
perform queries on data from
the OpenStreetMaps dataset.

23
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:06,875
After this course that's
exactly you'll be able to do.

24
00:01:06,875 --> 00:01:09,210
Okay great, let's get started.
