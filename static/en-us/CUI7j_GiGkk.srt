1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:06,120
Conversely, when the activity stops,
Android calls the onStop override.

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:06,830
In this case,

3
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:11,850
if the client is still connected,
we should disconnect Google API Client.

4
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:14,550
So fill in the lines of code
that will achieve this.

5
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:17,210
You want to check if the client
is still connected, and

6
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:19,700
if it is, you want to disconnect
the Google API Client.

7
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:21,180
How would you do that?
