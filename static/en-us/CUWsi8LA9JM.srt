1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:02,290
Let's practice computing these costs and

2
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:04,920
extracting the alignment
with an exercise.

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:06,810
We'll align SNOWY with SUNNY,

4
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:12,180
and we'll use an alpha value of 1.5 for
flipping a character.

5
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:16,800
This makes flipping a character more
expensive than an insertion or deletion.

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,640
Compute the minimum cost by
filling out this table here, and

7
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,900
write out the alignment here
using a single dash to indicate

8
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,410
where a character isn't matched.
