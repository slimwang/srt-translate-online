00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,912
We can notice that we have an x squared and an x here. So, one of our x's from

2
00:00:03,912 --> 00:00:08,166
the top will cancel with the x from the bottom. We can also combine our two

3
00:00:08,166 --> 00:00:14,525
coefficients by just dividing 1.932 over 2. That gives us a reduced form of

4
00:00:14,525 --> 00:00:19,707
0.966x times x plus 10 over 11x plus 50.
