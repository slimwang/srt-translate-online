1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:04,210
Now, the network section of the cash manifest contains files

2
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:07,840
that explicitly needs a network connection. Foe example, we can't

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:12,110
really cash the google-analytics page because the connection is important.

4
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:14,520
If you have a image resource that's a live webcam

5
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:16,940
image or some other kind of data that has to

6
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:19,440
be loaded over the network, putting that resource in this

7
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:22,440
section will bypass the out cash. And try loading the

8
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:26,410
resource from the network, even while it's offline. And finally,

9
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:28,920
the Fallback section is where you set up alt

10
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,740
cache alternatives for resources that need to come from the

11
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:35,569
network. For example that live webcam image. Maybe you want to

12
00:00:35,569 --> 00:00:38,540
cache an old version of it. The browser will use

13
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:41,210
the rules in this section to load an alternative.

14
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:43,570
But only after trying to load the resource from the

15
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:46,870
network first. For that reason you should use the Fallback

16
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:50,180
section sparingly because it will await for a network timeout.
