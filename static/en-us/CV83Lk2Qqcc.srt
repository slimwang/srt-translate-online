00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:04,635
Each organization should determine it's own severity classification, based on

2
00:00:04,635 --> 00:00:09,540
its release and artifact peculiarities and whatever source issue tracking system

3
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:12,790
or source control system that they have. Here's one possible schema.

4
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:17,950
It includes three different levels. The least severe is that minor re,

5
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:23,100
rework is required. That this rework can be verified by the author.

6
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:28,970
This would be the case if there were questions about the comments or

7
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:33,850
standards conformance, something like that. A somewhat more severe level would

8
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:39,640
be where there's conditional rework that it would be verified by the moderator.

9
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:45,150
And then, for major rework situations, reinspection is required. And here

10
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:49,820
a guideline would be that if greater than 20% of the document or 20 hours of

11
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:54,070
work or 100 lines of code have been affected then a rereview might be required.
