1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,260
Instead of a typical quiz,
I would like for

2
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:05,480
you to do a self check of
your analytical skills.

3
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:09,583
Here is a diagram that's summarizing
the performance results that Fedorova

4
00:00:09,583 --> 00:00:13,320
gathered from running the experiments
that we showed before.

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,990
What do you think these
results tell us about

6
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:20,790
the use of a metric-like cycles
per instruction for scheduling?

7
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:22,580
Again, this is not really a quiz.

8
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:25,790
This is more of a self check
of your analytical skills.

9
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:30,730
Try answering this question and then
see our summary of the results of using

10
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:33,220
CPI as a scheduling
metric in the next video.
