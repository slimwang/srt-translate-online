00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:04,340
So far you've seen several examples of
closure expressions being passed as

2
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:06,080
arguments to functions.

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,630
Just like any other variable that's
passed as an argument to a function,

4
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:11,900
a closure expression has a type.

5
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:15,600
This closure expression we pass to
the sort function had this type.

6
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:18,910
You can see it takes in two Ints and
returns a Bool.

7
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:22,740
This other closure expression we pass
to the sort function had this type.

8
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:25,590
You can see it takes in two doubles and
also returns a bool.

9
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,370
Here's another example.

10
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:30,460
Here, we have an array of soup names,
and

11
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:32,549
we want to put them in
alphabetical order.

12
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:35,030
The code to do that looks like this.

13
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:37,980
What is the type of the closure
expression being passed

14
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:40,090
into the sorted function?

15
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:42,190
