1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,820
Now's your turn to use
Alteryx to aggregate data.

2
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:06,850
You're going to work with
a file of Wyoming schools.

3
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:08,850
If you're not familiar with Wyoming,

4
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:11,520
it's a state in
the United States of America.

5
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:15,610
It's known for the beautiful Yellowstone
National Park, which is famous for

6
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:17,590
a geyser called Old Faithful,

7
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:21,110
that erupts with water in
the air every few hours.

8
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:22,400
Now that you have a feel for

9
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,020
where Wyoming is,
let's get back to the exercise.

10
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:30,731
Taking the Wyoming school's sample file,
found in the notes below the video,

11
00:00:30,731 --> 00:00:33,060
summarize the school data by zip code.

12
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:37,153
And count the total school
enrollment by zip code.

13
00:00:37,153 --> 00:00:39,809
And count the number of
schools in each zip code.

14
00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:41,867
[BLANK_AUDIO]

15
00:00:41,867 --> 00:00:48,220
What is the total enrollment
in zip code 82009?
