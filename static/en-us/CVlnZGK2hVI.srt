1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,719
So watch the sagas array as we run this line of code.

2
00:00:02,719 --> 00:00:06,430
At this point, a new function has been added to the sagas array.

3
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:09,370
And even though that function is being referenced by a variable in

4
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:14,520
the global scope, the function itself has the blue type of scope access because

5
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:19,160
it's fundamentally a blue function that originated inside that red function.

6
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:21,030
So we've reached the big question.

7
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:24,160
What do you think is going to happen when we try to run one of

8
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,770
these blue saga functions that was created inside the red context but

9
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:32,020
is now being accessed from the green context?

10
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:34,930
Remember the red context that it was created in

11
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:37,490
has already completed and returned.

12
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:40,200
So any variables that are referenced by this blue

13
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:45,210
function from the red context seem perhaps like they should be unavailable.

14
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:48,760
So, when we invoke this saga sub zero function,

15
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:51,600
a blue box should appear somewhere in our diagram.

16
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,750
Based on your understanding of how these contexts work,

17
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:57,540
where would you expect that blue box to appear?
