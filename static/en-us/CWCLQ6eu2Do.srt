1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:05,410
There's another approach, it's a
data-centric approach or instance based

2
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:10,500
approach where we keep the data and
we use it when we make a query.

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:15,430
So here's an example, let's suppose
our barometric pressure has gone down

4
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:17,870
by 5 millimeters and

5
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:21,400
we want to consult our model to see
how much it's going to rain today.

6
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:25,070
So our query here is at -5 millimeters.

7
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:28,000
And let's suppose that K is equal to 3.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,820
So we will find the 3 nearest
historical data points to this query.

9
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:40,600
And those are 1, 2, 3.

10
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,770
And we'll use them to estimate
how much it's going to rain today
