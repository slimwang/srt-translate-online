1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,600
x squared minus 9 is equal to the quantity x plus 3 times the quantity x minus

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:08,872
3. We know from looking at the left side of the equation, the original

3
00:00:08,872 --> 00:00:13,682
expression that we had, that the two numbers we insert here as being added to x,

4
00:00:13,682 --> 00:00:18,530
need to multiply to give us negative 9 and need to add to give us 0. And sure

5
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:24,546
enough, 3 times negative 3 equals negative 9, and 3 plus negative 3 or 3 minus 3

6
00:00:24,546 --> 00:00:25,340
equals 0.
