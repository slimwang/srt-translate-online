00:00:00,232 --> 00:00:02,981
The first unit of CS212 uses poker as a vehicle to

2
00:00:02,981 --> 00:00:05,849
teach about the design of computer programs. If you

3
00:00:05,849 --> 00:00:07,899
don’t know the rules of poker yet, don’t worry, that’s

4
00:00:07,899 --> 00:00:10,452
exactly what this video is for. Now of all you know

5
00:00:10,452 --> 00:00:12,527
about poker is what you’ve seen on TV or in a

6
00:00:12,527 --> 00:00:15,216
casino, you may think it’s pretty complicated. There

7
00:00:15,216 --> 00:00:17,932
is that intimidating green table and it’s surrounded

8
00:00:17,932 --> 00:00:21,129
by some very serious looking people and these

9
00:00:21,129 --> 00:00:24,412
people often have very silly hats or ridiculous

10
00:00:24,412 --> 00:00:30,613
sunglasses and they are saying things like, raise, or

11
00:00:30,613 --> 00:00:33,765
all-in. Now if you ever want to actually play poker,

12
00:00:33,765 --> 00:00:35,648
you are going to have to learn what all this means.

13
00:00:35,648 --> 00:00:37,340
There is betting, there is folding, there is calling,

14
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:40,474
there is raising, and it can get pretty complicated.

15
00:00:40,474 --> 00:00:42,445
There is a lot of strategy involved. But for the

16
00:00:42,445 --> 00:00:45,442
purposes of this unit, we only need to know the most

17
00:00:45,442 --> 00:00:48,396
basic aspect of poker and this aspect is common to

18
00:00:48,396 --> 00:00:52,099
every single variation of poker and that’s how hands

19
00:00:52,099 --> 00:00:53,946
are arranged because at the end of the day, all of

20
00:00:53,946 --> 00:00:55,917
these different versions of poker have to do with

21
00:00:55,917 --> 00:00:58,451
making the best five card hand that you can. Now

22
00:00:58,451 --> 00:01:00,722
these different hands each have different names and

23
00:01:00,722 --> 00:01:02,677
there are nine of them. So let’s talk about what each

24
00:01:02,677 --> 00:01:05,242
of these names mean and since this class uses

25
00:01:05,242 --> 00:01:07,958
python, I’ll start my numbering at zero.

26
00:01:07,958 --> 00:01:10,194
The best hand and this one that you almost never

27
00:01:10,194 --> 00:01:13,761
see in poker is the straight flush and here we have a

28
00:01:13,761 --> 00:01:16,917
straight flush. The suit here is hearts, so you can

29
00:01:16,917 --> 00:01:19,441
see every single card is a heart and they are all in

30
00:01:19,441 --> 00:01:23,358
sequential order, nine, ten, jack, queen, king. If you

31
00:01:23,358 --> 00:01:26,629
ever go into a poker form online, you would see

32
00:01:26,629 --> 00:01:32,276
these cards were in as 9H, TH, JH, QH, KH and

33
00:01:32,276 --> 00:01:34,123
that’s the system we’re going to use here.

34
00:01:34,123 --> 00:01:36,844
The next best hand is four of a kind and here we

35
00:01:36,844 --> 00:01:41,178
have a four of a kind with four aces and a six. The

36
00:01:41,178 --> 00:01:44,185
six is usually irrelevant to this hand but we’ll talk a

37
00:01:44,185 --> 00:01:47,116
little bit about how to break ties in class. Next best is

38
00:01:47,116 --> 00:01:51,234
the full house and a full house is just three cards of

39
00:01:51,234 --> 00:01:53,615
one rank, so here we have three tens and two of

40
00:01:53,615 --> 00:01:57,005
another, so two, twos. This hand is a full house so

41
00:01:57,005 --> 00:02:00,386
we would call it tens full of twos. Next is the flush

42
00:02:00,386 --> 00:02:05,280
and a flush is five cards of the same suit and here

43
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,047
the ranks don’t matter. You can see we have a

44
00:02:07,047 --> 00:02:10,878
three, six, jack, queen and king but they’re all of the

45
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:15,214
suit spade. Next we have the street and a street is

46
00:02:15,214 --> 00:02:17,876
just five cards in sequential order, five, six, seven,

47
00:02:17,876 --> 00:02:21,009
eight, nine and here the suit doesn’t matter at all.

48
00:02:21,009 --> 00:02:24,074
We have a spade, diamond, club, diamond and

49
00:02:24,074 --> 00:02:27,699
another spade. Our next hand is the three of a kind

50
00:02:27,699 --> 00:02:30,847
and three of a kind is just three cards of the same

51
00:02:30,847 --> 00:02:35,299
rank, so these three fours are what’s relevant. The

52
00:02:35,299 --> 00:02:37,969
queen and again in some special circumstances

53
00:02:37,969 --> 00:02:41,581
where we’re playing with multiple decks, they may

54
00:02:41,581 --> 00:02:43,177
be used to break a tie and again we’ll talk about that

55
00:02:43,177 --> 00:02:48,460
in class. Next we have two pair, for example, a pair

56
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:51,662
of jacks and a pair of nines would be two pair. The

57
00:02:51,662 --> 00:02:55,058
second worst hand is a pair and a pair is just two

58
00:02:55,058 --> 00:02:57,808
cards of the same rank, here we have two threes.

59
00:02:57,808 --> 00:03:00,593
The eight, five, two don’t do much to help our hand

60
00:03:00,593 --> 00:03:06,158
here. Finally, we have nothing. So we could also call

61
00:03:06,158 --> 00:03:10,072
that high card because when two people who have

62
00:03:10,072 --> 00:03:13,341
nothing show down their hands, the one with the

63
00:03:13,341 --> 00:03:16,485
highest card wins.

64
00:03:16,485 --> 00:03:21,533
Here we have king high and this is really quite a bad

65
00:03:21,533 --> 00:03:23,653
hand. If you are ever in a casino, I wouldn’t go

66
00:03:23,653 --> 00:03:27,442
playing this and expecting win. And that’s it; those

67
00:03:27,442 --> 00:03:30,214
are our nine hands, straight flush, four of a kind, full

68
00:03:30,214 --> 00:03:33,905
house, flush, straight, three of a kind, two pair, pair

69
00:03:33,905 --> 00:03:36,410
and nothing. Noticeably design them all in number,

70
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:39,487
zero through eight. This is one of the numbers we’ll

71
00:03:39,487 --> 00:03:42,904
be using in our poker program to compare hands. It

72
00:03:42,904 --> 00:03:45,114
turns out, we’ll need a few other numbers to

73
00:03:45,114 --> 00:03:48,818
distinguish between for example two full houses, six

74
00:03:48,818 --> 00:03:51,246
for six is inadequate, we’ll need to add some other

75
00:03:51,246 --> 00:03:54,127
numbers in there but we’ll explain that in class and

76
00:03:54,127 --> 00:03:56,201
for now you should understand the rules of poker

77
00:03:56,201 --> 00:03:59,000
well enough to follow on.
