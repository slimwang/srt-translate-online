1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,110
So if a pet were entered
by mistake into the list,

2
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:05,520
they can remove from the list
simply by clicking the X button.

3
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:10,210
Now in the final version of the app,
we'll store all this data.

4
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:11,650
But to start out, we'll make an MVP.

5
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:15,600
And that stands for
minimum viable product.

6
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,720
So this will store the most important
attributes as identified by the shelter.

7
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:24,450
So first we'll have Name,
Breed, Gender and the Weight.

8
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:25,750
Now as we saw in the quiz,

9
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:29,530
using the SQLiteDatabase seems to
make the most sense for our pets app.

10
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:32,450
But how will we store all the
information about these different types

11
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:34,600
of animals into our database?

12
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:38,160
So let's say we're given
information about these three pets.

13
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,900
But the information came
to us all unorganized.

14
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:44,290
Now, given the three methods that we
know about data storage, let's look at

15
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:47,990
how we can structure this data into
a way that we can effectively use it.

16
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:50,910
These were the features
of the SQLiteDatabase.

17
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:53,260
SQLiteDatabases look
a lot like spreadsheets.

18
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:57,380
Now, just as a single spreadsheet
can contain multiple sheets,

19
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:01,070
a single database can
contain multiple tables.

20
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:05,340
So in this case, we're only interested
in our one table, our table about pets.

21
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:11,080
So if the SQLite tables are like
the pages of a spreadsheet, let's make

22
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:15,380
a single page in a spreadsheet represent
the pets that come into the shelter.

23
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:18,310
So how would you organize
the information about those three pets

24
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:21,500
that we saw earlier,
into this spreadsheet format?

25
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,440
We'll here's your
chance to try that out.

26
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:24,680
So for this exercise,

27
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:29,280
given these three example pets,
I'd like to either sketch or use Google

28
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,890
sheets to organize information of
these three pets into a table.

29
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:35,230
And if you need help with Google sheets,

30
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:37,030
take a look in
the instructors notes below.

31
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:39,920
I've linked it out where you can learn
about it as well as download it.

32
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,170
And then afterwards,
answer these questions.

33
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:45,330
Excluding a row where you might
have to put column headers,

34
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:48,070
how many rows does the spreadsheet have?

35
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:51,340
Thirdly, how many columns
does your spreadsheet have?

36
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:54,950
And then lastly, which one of these
attributes could be a column header?

37
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:59,560
Pets, weight, the name Toto or male.

38
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,570
So give this a try and
I'll see you in the next video.
