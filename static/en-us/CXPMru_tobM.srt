1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:04,560
So if you hit an unexpected paint like
you just saw, you've got another tool at

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:07,410
your disposal, and
it is called the Paint Profiler.

3
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:08,540
You can find it in the Timeline tab.

4
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:11,750
The Paint Profiler makes
it really easy to identify

5
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:14,990
what areas of the page are being
painted and when they're being painted.

6
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:18,930
For this quiz, go back to the scene you
were on and turn on the Paint Profiler.

7
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:21,740
Hit the record button,
and scroll up and down.

8
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:24,770
You should see a bunch of
long-running paint records.

9
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:27,560
Click on one of the paints, and then
check out what you find in the paint

10
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,810
profiler tab down here by the details.

11
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:31,970
Scroll through what you find
in the paint profiler and

12
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:35,930
then tell me what is the first
paint command that is listed there.

13
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:36,550
Type it in here.
