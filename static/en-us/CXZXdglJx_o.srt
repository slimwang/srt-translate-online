00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,151
The last part of graphing an inequality is figuring our which region to shade.

2
00:00:04,151 --> 00:00:08,454
We could either shade this top region, region 1, or this lower region, region 2.

3
00:00:08,454 --> 00:00:12,452
One of these has to be correct. To figure it out, we can use a test point. We

4
00:00:12,452 --> 00:00:16,548
can choose any point in one of the regions to determine whether or not it makes

5
00:00:16,548 --> 00:00:21,503
the inequality true. I want to make sure I don't choose a point along this line.

6
00:00:21,503 --> 00:00:26,553
Because these points have been excluded. It's dashed. The origin is usually a

7
00:00:26,553 --> 00:00:31,494
great point to check. It's zeroes, and it's easy to plug in. So you check it,

8
00:00:31,494 --> 00:00:36,109
and determine. Should we shade region 1 or region 2? If 0,0 makes a true

9
00:00:36,109 --> 00:00:41,225
statement here, we want region 2. If 0, 0 doesn't make a true statement in this

10
00:00:41,225 --> 00:00:43,585
inequality, then we want region 1.
