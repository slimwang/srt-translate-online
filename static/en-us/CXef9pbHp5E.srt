00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:04,519
Let's learn about the chi-square test with an example. This is Mount Shasta,

2
00:00:04,519 --> 00:00:10,200
and this photo was taken by Professor Rogers. Mount Shasta is the solitary

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:20,330
giant of Northern California. And it rises 14,179 feet or 4322 meters. It's the

4
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:24,940
fifth highest peak in California. Doctor Rogers would like to successfully

5
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:29,050
climb Mount Shasta this summer, but he needs statistic to help make some

6
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:37,460
choices. According to summitpost.org, only about 33% of the 15,000 summit

7
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:42,950
attempts each year are successful. Being an amateur mountaineer, Doctor Rogers

8
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:47,580
plans to make his summit attempt with the aid of a professional guide company.

9
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:52,470
He's considering a guide company called Summit Up. I made that up, but let's go

10
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:57,180
with it. And they state that of the 100 trips they had last year, 41

11
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:01,670
successfully reached the summit. Does this represent a significantly better

12
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:06,660
success rate than would be expected by chance? In other words, should he hire

13
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:10,760
this company? What do you notice about these data compared to the types of data

14
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:14,220
sets we've used before? Select all that apply.
