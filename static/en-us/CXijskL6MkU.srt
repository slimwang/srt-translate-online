1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,390
Alright Charles, let's, let's figure this one out. It turns out,

2
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:04,600
as I said, there's lots of different ways to make this work,

3
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:07,370
but, what we're going to do is move that line that we had

4
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:10,140
for conjunction. If we, what we really want to do now is figure

5
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:14,290
out how to move it down ,so that now, these three points,

6
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:17,870
are, in the green zone. They're going to output, one, because they're the

7
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:21,170
or, and the only one in the, that's left in the zero

8
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:23,800
zone in the, in the red zone is the zero, zero case.

9
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:23,920
>> Right.

10
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,408
>> So, How are we going to be able to do that?

11
00:00:25,408 --> 00:00:29,980
>> Well, since ,we want it to be case that, either,

12
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:37,130
X2 or X1, being one get you above the line, then, we need a threshold

13
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:39,890
and a set of weights ,that put either one of them over. You

14
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:41,510
don't have to have both of them, you only need one of them.

15
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:41,900
>> Okay.

16
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:44,350
>> So, let's imagine a case where X1 is one

17
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:50,570
and X2 is zero ,then basically, oh, there you're right,

18
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:52,230
there's a whole lot of answers, so a weight

19
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:57,120
of 1, for X1, would give you a one. Right?

20
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,300
>> Yes, Huh

21
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:04,190
>> And so, if we made the threshold 1, that would work.

22
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:05,440
>> What about weight 2?

23
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:10,740
>> Well, we do exactly the same thing. So, we set, weight 2 equal to 1.

24
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:15,940
And that means, that in the case where both of them are 0, you get 0 plus 0,

25
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:19,560
which gives you something less than 1. If ,one of them

26
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:22,120
is 1 and the other is 0, you get 1, which

27
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:26,660
gives you right at the threshold. And, if both of them,

28
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:29,830
are, one then you get two, which is still greater than one.

29
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,260
>> Good, alright, that seems like it worked. The other

30
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,140
way we could do it, is we can keep the weights

31
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:38,700
at in another way we can do it, is keep

32
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,010
the weights where they were before, that just moves this line

33
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:43,510
nice and smoothly down. And then, right? So

34
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:46,550
before, we had a, a threshold of, one

35
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:49,710
and a half. Now we need a threshold of, like, a half ,ought to do it.

36
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:50,410
>> Yep.

37
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:55,190
>> Or even less, as long as it's greater

38
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:56,840
than zero. So, a quarter should work, as well.

39
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,170
 

40
00:01:58,170 --> 00:01:59,750
>> So, good, so, lots, lots of different ways

41
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:03,320
to do that. And, cool. Can we do not?

42
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,880
>> What's not of two variables?

43
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,720
>> That's a good question.

44
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,030
Let's do not of one variable, then.

45
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:08,729
>> Okay.
