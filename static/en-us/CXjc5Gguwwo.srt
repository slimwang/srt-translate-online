So what is language? Well, words are just arbitrary sounds put together. Which

2
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:08,980
is clear when you listen to languages that you don't know. However, when it's a

3
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:13,580
language that you do know, these sounds have deep and immediate meaning.

4
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:18,580
Language expresses ideas, thoughts, and intentions. Language and thought go

5
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:22,924
really well together. However, they're not the exact same thing. We can express

6
00:00:22,924 --> 00:00:26,554
thoughts without language sometimes. For example, if we use things like

7
00:00:26,554 --> 00:00:29,200
imagery, art, music, or even dance.
