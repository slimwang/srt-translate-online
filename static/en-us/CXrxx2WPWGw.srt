1
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:04,620
How many business records
are duplicates of other businesses?

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:09,060
To Fuzzy Match the businesses,
we attach the Fuzzy Match tool, and

3
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:13,800
then we select the purge mode, since
we're dealing with just one dataset.

4
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:19,620
The ID field can be used as the record
ID, since it's unique to each record.

5
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:21,650
How can we be sure of this?

6
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:26,490
Well we can attach the unique tool and
see that no duplicates flow through.

7
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:30,710
No records can make the D side and
all the records come out the U side so

8
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:31,390
they're all unique.

9
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:36,230
Next we select the field that
contains the business names,

10
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:40,110
which is called account holder,
and then select the match style,

11
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:44,080
called company name as it
best fits with the data.

12
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:49,470
Lastly, we add the unique tool after and
select ID and

13
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:53,540
ID2 to eliminate duplicate matches.

14
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:56,860
There are three businesses that have
duplicates and they're identified here.
