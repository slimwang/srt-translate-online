1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,459
Let's fix the issue of determining when

2
00:00:02,459 --> 00:00:04,080
we should transition to the second View Controller.

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,150
We can do this by changing

4
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:08,609
the Segue to only be called from code

5
00:00:08,609 --> 00:00:10,800
and not directly from Storyboard

6
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,638
when we press the Stop Recording button.

7
00:00:14,638 --> 00:00:16,048
We know that we are recording our voice in the

8
00:00:16,048 --> 00:00:18,868
Record Sounds View Controller.

9
00:00:18,868 --> 00:00:20,250
And once our recording is finished, we need to

10
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:22,199
send that file over to the second scene.

11
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:24,600
But how do we change the current Segue

12
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,760
to be called just by code and not from

13
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,579
the UI button. If you look in the

14
00:00:29,579 --> 00:00:31,739
Main.storyboard file, we can see that the

15
00:00:31,739 --> 00:00:34,049
two scenes are connected via the Segue.

16
00:00:34,049 --> 00:00:37,020
In particular it's the Segue that's

17
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:38,789
wired up from the stop recording button.

18
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:40,710
Every time this button is pressed,

19
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:43,289
Storyboard performs the Segue for us.

20
00:00:43,289 --> 00:00:45,869
What we want to be able to do is call

21
00:00:45,869 --> 00:00:48,270
the Segue programmatically once we know

22
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:49,950
the AV Audio Recorder has finished

23
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:53,429
writing out the file. This is easy to do.

24
00:00:53,429 --> 00:00:55,229
Let me walk you through it now.

25
00:00:55,229 --> 00:00:58,079
Let's start by deleting the current Segue.

26
00:00:58,079 --> 00:00:59,698
Make sure you have the Segue selected and

27
00:00:59,698 --> 00:01:02,789
then press the Delete key. Once you

28
00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:04,438
delete the Segue Xcode is going to

29
00:01:04,438 --> 00:01:06,209
complain that the second scene is no

30
00:01:06,209 --> 00:01:08,250
longer reachable since we have no way to

31
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:10,438
segue into it from anywhere else on the Storyboard.

32
00:01:10,438 --> 00:01:12,868
We can see that warning mentioned here.

33
00:01:12,868 --> 00:01:15,659
To fix the warning and

34
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:17,009
set up a Segue that we can call

35
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:19,109
programmatically, we need to rewire a Segue.

36
00:01:19,109 --> 00:01:21,478
But instead of going from the stop

37
00:01:21,478 --> 00:01:23,430
button to the second View Controller,

38
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:24,930
We just need to go straight from the first

39
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:26,459
View Controller to the second View Controller.

40
00:01:26,459 --> 00:01:29,040
The easiest way to do this is

41
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,409
from the Document Outline. So make sure

42
00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:32,640
you have the first View Controller

43
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,170
selected the record sound View Controller.

44
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:36,840
Hold down the control key and

45
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,400
then click drag to the second View Controller.

46
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,259
And make sure we select Show

47
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:47,250
is the type of Segue. Now that these two

48
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:49,530
scenes are connected via Segue, we can

49
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:51,209
have the Storyboard performed the Segue

50
00:01:51,209 --> 00:01:53,219
for us by calling a special function

51
00:01:53,219 --> 00:01:56,519
named performSegue. will set up the call shortly.

52
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:58,409
But in order to distinguish this

53
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:00,420
Segue from any other, we need to give it

54
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:03,390
a unique name. So make sure you have the

55
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:07,319
Segue selected and then in the Attributes

56
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:08,639
Inspector, we want to give it a unique

57
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:11,818
identifier

58
00:02:11,818 --> 00:02:15,780
I'll use “stopRecording”. These names are

59
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:17,400
case sensitive by the way, so make sure

60
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,989
you spell it correctly.

61
00:02:18,989 --> 00:02:21,509
Next we need to know that the AV Audio

62
00:02:21,509 --> 00:02:23,248
Recorder has finished writing out the

63
00:02:23,248 --> 00:02:25,769
recorded voice Wav file. And to do that,

64
00:02:25,769 --> 00:02:27,060
we're going to use a concept called

65
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:33,109
delegation.
