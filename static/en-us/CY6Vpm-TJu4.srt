00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:01,160
Let's take a quiz and

2
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:05,070
look at an example of how the pthreads threading library can interact with

3
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:08,850
a kernel to manage the level of concurrency that a process gets.

4
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:10,260
The first question is,

5
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:14,690
in the pthreads library, which function sets the concurrency level?

6
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:16,840
We're looking for a function name here.

7
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:20,500
For the second question, given the above function,

8
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:25,030
what is the concurrency value that instructs the underlying implementation to

9
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:28,270
manage concurrency as it finds appropriate?

10
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:30,480
And we're looking for an integer value here.

11
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,230
And please feel free to use the Internet as a resource to

12
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:35,160
understand the answer to this question.
