Hey Travis.

2
00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:04,000
We're about to try our hand at
building a more complex app that uses

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,670
the movie database.

4
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:09,220
But before we do, we were wondering,
what kind of apps would you like to see?

5
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:12,200
What makes a great app that
uses the movie database?

6
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:13,220
>> You know, honestly anything and

7
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:17,900
everything around movies, TV shows and,
and actors and actresses.

8
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:19,270
We have apps that let you, you know,

9
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:24,480
keep track of personal watch lists,
let you search your favorite movies,

10
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,310
and find out who is in
that movie with so and so.

11
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:33,590
You know, my favorite apps are the ones
that, you know, combine a nice, sleek,

12
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:36,940
well thought out interface and

13
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:40,880
tie in all those account features
that we make available via sessions.

14
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:47,170
It's really, really awesome when
you see your hard work be taken

15
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:52,480
by another developer and designer and,
you know, lay it out on an iPhone.

16
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:59,690
And you just see how that
API powers the experience.

17
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:03,148
You know, behind the scenes,
and it's so seamless.

18
00:01:03,148 --> 00:01:06,439
And, you know,
it's my job to make sure that that is,

19
00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:09,172
is as seamless as possible,
and just works.

20
00:01:09,172 --> 00:01:13,876
And, you know, the more we
get to see of that, you know,

21
00:01:13,876 --> 00:01:18,892
those, the pretty mobile apps,
websites the better.

22
00:01:18,892 --> 00:01:20,259
>> Awesome.

23
00:01:20,259 --> 00:01:21,560
Thanks Travis.

24
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,650
So, what to make of this?

25
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:26,580
The big take away from Travis's answer
is that his favorite apps are ones

26
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:29,360
that are sleek and just work.

27
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,900
I'd imagine that most people would agree
with this statement because at the end

28
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:34,420
of the day,
users don't care about the code,

29
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:36,300
they just care about the end product.

30
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:37,490
But there's a catch.

31
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:39,940
To make sure the end product
is as seamless as possible,

32
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:42,300
we have to have well-designed code.

33
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:44,990
So let's take a look at our end
product now, the Movie Manager.
