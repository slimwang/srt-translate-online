1
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:32,119
>> That's good David.

2
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:35,980
So the de Morgan's law is saying that when we try to distribute negation

3
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:41,840
over the predicate inside the parentheses that are connected with a conjunction,

4
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,540
then the conjunction becomes a disjunction between the negations of the pre,

5
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:50,460
predicates. The same would have been true if we had a disjunction here.

6
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:54,550
When we distribute the negation, it would have become a conjunction here. David,

7
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:59,630
before we go ahead further, let's remember why we are trying to do all of this.

8
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:03,920
So do you recall we said in the beginning of the lesson that a logical agent

9
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,740
will have a knowledge base, and then formal rules of inference that will apply

10
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:11,600
on these sentences as knowledge base. The knowledge base itself may be coming

11
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:15,290
from many places. Some sentences in the knowledge base may be boot strapped into

12
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:19,830
the logical agent. Other sentences may be coming from perception. Now when we're

13
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:23,600
trying to apply these rules of inferences to the synthesis of the knowledge base

14
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,910
it is sometimes very useful to rewrite the sentences in different forms. And

15
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:29,140
that's what we are trying to do.

16
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:33,340
These properties will allow us to rewrite the sentences in such a way that we

17
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:36,780
can in fact apply the rules of inferences that we will see in a minute.
