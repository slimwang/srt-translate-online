00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,107
Now we've learned a lot about some basic functions, like this one, y equals x

2
00:00:04,107 --> 00:00:09,522
squared, who's graph is this lovely purple parabola. You also learned about

3
00:00:09,522 --> 00:00:13,321
some other polynomial functions. For example, we have y equals x cubed also,

4
00:00:13,321 --> 00:00:18,316
which produced this really different and really interesting graph. So clearly

5
00:00:18,316 --> 00:00:21,772
the large scale behavior of different functions Is really different on what

6
00:00:21,772 --> 00:00:25,833
their equation looks like. And it also changes from region to region of the

7
00:00:25,833 --> 00:00:29,224
domain. I wonder what would happen if we increased the degree of polynomial

8
00:00:29,224 --> 00:00:34,124
function even more. Like, let's say we have y to the x to the fourth. Well

9
00:00:34,124 --> 00:00:37,182
that's totally different again, that's really interesting. Maybe I'll just get

10
00:00:37,182 --> 00:00:40,250
rid of these two that we already know a lot about and just focus on this one.

11
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:45,721
Let's do something else, y equals x to the fourth plus. x. Well that's cool.

12
00:00:45,721 --> 00:00:49,872
That's totally different from anything we've ever seen before, together. Of

13
00:00:49,872 --> 00:00:53,530
course we can add and change terms. If we made this x squared, that changes the

14
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:57,954
behavior again. What if I made this x cubed instead? Everything makes these

15
00:00:57,954 --> 00:01:02,580
little, minute adjustments in the middle of the graph here. That's pretty cool.

16
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:06,600
Now I wonder, I just changed one exponent. What if I change this first one? The

17
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:12,120
exponent of the leading term. Wow, now this graph is completely different. Once

18
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:15,228
again changing the degree of the polynomial, seems to really change the overall

19
00:01:15,228 --> 00:01:19,830
behavior. What if I make this sign negative? Well that's really interesting, oh

20
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:23,558
my gosh. Clearly changing different terms in polynomials, especially the

21
00:01:23,558 --> 00:01:28,310
leading term, the term at the highest power has major affects on the graph. I

22
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:31,668
think this merits some more exploration. In this lesson we're going to

23
00:01:31,668 --> 00:01:34,864
investigate the overall appearance of different polynomial functions in terms

24
00:01:34,864 --> 00:01:37,731
of how they look when we're zoomed way, way out, and when we're zoomed in on

25
00:01:37,731 --> 00:01:42,934
the middle of the graph. In particular we're going to see where these functions

26
00:01:42,934 --> 00:01:47,300
intersect the x axis. And how this relates to factors in routes of

27
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:50,243
polynominals. I'm really exicted about the content of this lesson.
