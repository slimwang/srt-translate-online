1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:05,470
Here's the third constraint, having to do with the displaying of the document.

2
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:11,060
In this case it's an invariant, it's an indirect, indirect guarantee.

3
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:17,380
And it's relating the contents that are visible in the viewport to the data

4
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:22,310
that's provided by the file manager, as far as it's document is concerned.

5
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:27,770
And it's saying in, in, in effect that the sequence of lines

6
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:32,880
that we see are determined by the handle position of the scroll, scrollbar,

7
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,920
that is the top line we see is determined by the handle position of

8
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:41,390
the scrollbar, and we're going to see subsequent lines that and

9
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:45,160
the number of them is the, is the height minus 1.

10
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:48,180
That is the number of additional lines plus the top line, that gives us height,

11
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:49,680
which is what we would expect.

12
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,670
What this says is that what we will see in the view contents percept is that

13
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:58,520
subsequence of lines that the document, from the document starting with

14
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:02,110
the line indicated by the scrollbar's handle position and continuing for

15
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:04,050
height minus one additional lines.
