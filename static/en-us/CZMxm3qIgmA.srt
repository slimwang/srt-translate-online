Consider this network,
I have a bunch of questions for you.

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,300
How many nodes does it have?

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:08,189
How many links does it have?

4
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:10,000
What's its diameter?

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,680
What is its bisection width, and what,
pray tell, is the meaning of life?

6
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:16,970
Type your answers as
integers in the boxes.
