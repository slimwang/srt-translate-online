00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:04,100
Before we talk about specific drugs and their physiological, behavioral and

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:08,414
psychological effects. It's important to review some of the material that we

3
00:00:08,414 --> 00:00:12,921
learned in lesson three, the Biology of Behavior. First, remember that the

4
00:00:12,921 --> 00:00:17,956
central nervous system is comprised of the brain and the spinal cord. You

5
00:00:17,956 --> 00:00:21,284
should also review the autonomic nervous system as many drugs effect both of

6
00:00:21,284 --> 00:00:27,010
these nervous systems as well as their functioning. In addition, review the

7
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:33,253
material on neurons, neurotransmission, neurotransmitters, and receptors. And

8
00:00:33,253 --> 00:00:36,466
then finally, be sure to look at the brain structures as well as the dopamine

9
00:00:36,466 --> 00:00:38,090
reward pathway.
