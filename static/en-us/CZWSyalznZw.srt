00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,300
Usually, the painter's
algorithm works out fine.

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:06,628
Shapes drawn later on appear over
top of shapes drawn earlier and

3
00:00:06,628 --> 00:00:07,806
that's the end of it.

4
00:00:07,806 --> 00:00:12,060
However, there's an interesting
condition called cyclic overlap.

5
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:16,590
It mostly comes up in 3D applications,
but consider these three shapes.

6
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:20,770
Red is partially underneath green,
green is partially underneath blue, and

7
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:22,840
blue is partially underneath red.

8
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,700
How would you draw this?

9
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:27,540
Check out the to-do's to get
a closer look at this problem and

10
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:29,890
see if you can add a hacky
fix to get this to appear.
