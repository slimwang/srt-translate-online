00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,110
Okay so let's do a quiz. What I'd like you to do, is use the developer tools

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:07,050
in whatever browser you're using, to figure out exactly

3
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:09,200
how many parameters we're going to need to pass

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,520
as form data, in order to successfully execute requests

5
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:15,260
against this website. You can do that, by following

6
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:17,400
the steps I followed to get here, and scrolling

7
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,140
down further, to see all of the form data.
