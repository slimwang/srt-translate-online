1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,265
Notice that I put this negative sign with the 3 in the numerator. I could have

2
00:00:04,265 --> 00:00:08,586
also put the negative sign with the 1 in the denominator. Doing this allows us

3
00:00:08,586 --> 00:00:12,722
to make some other moves with slope. Instead of going down 3 units and then

4
00:00:12,722 --> 00:00:17,036
right 1, we're going to move up 3 units and left 1. We move left because the run

5
00:00:17,036 --> 00:00:21,430
is negative. So here is my y intercept, and I move up 3 and then left 1. Notice

6
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:25,357
I still lined up with a point on my graph. And the same is true if I did it

7
00:00:25,357 --> 00:00:29,641
again. So either way that we use the slope we can still wind up with our line.

8
00:00:29,641 --> 00:00:33,839
Just be sure you use the negative in only one of the directions. In this case

9
00:00:33,839 --> 00:00:38,208
the negative was with the rise, which was down. And in this case, the negative

10
00:00:38,208 --> 00:00:40,631
sign was with the run, which is to the left.
