00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,390
Here you can see a simple app that
creates a table showing someone's

2
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:04,610
favorite things.

3
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:06,430
Remember that at the very least,

4
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:09,300
this table needs two things
from its data source.

5
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:12,300
The number of rows, and
the cell for each row.

6
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:15,820
If we focus on the ViewController.swf
file for a second, here we can see

7
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:18,575
the favorite things model,
which is just an array of strings.

8
00:00:18,575 --> 00:00:22,430
So how does the UITableView
know how many rows it has?

9
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:26,300
A table view finds out how many rows
it has by asking its data source.

10
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:29,970
More specifically, by invoking
the data source protocol method,

11
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:31,990
number of rows in section.

12
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:34,490
Check out the get branch
in the instructor notes.

13
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:37,350
And inspect the project in
ViewController.swf files.

14
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:39,090
Play around with the methods
to see what they do,

15
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:41,700
and then indicate your choice below.

16
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:45,170
Given that the table will invoke
this method on the view controller,

17
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:46,780
which implementation seems right?
