1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So in the solution to this problem set, we've added a for loop whose index

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
ranges from 0 to the number of steps.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
We put the number of steps plus 1 as the argument for range

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
because i will go up to the number inside minus 1.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Inside the loop, we've created a variable called angle, which is equal to 2Ï€ times the index

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
divided by the number of steps that are taken in the trajectory.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Have you look over this picture. You can sort of see what's happening.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
The moon starts in this position, then after 1 time step,

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
it's into this position and so on and so forth.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The number of segments will equal the number of steps

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
and the number of lines will equal the number of steps plus 1.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
After this, we use the array x to define the horizontal

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
and vertical positions of the moon at any given time step.

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
It's at this point that we have to remember our trigonometric functions--sine and cosine.

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:56,000
In this first line right here, we're defining the horizontal position of x for the i-the timestep.

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
In the second line, which is a sine, is what's going to show us the vertical position.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
This is one of those cases where being able to see a right triangle in this picture is very helpful.

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Looking at our picture, this horizontal line right here that extends from the earth out to the moon's orbit

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
is the 0 radian or the 0 degree line.

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
We're measuring all of the angles that the moon is going to be marked at up from this line.

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:27,000
That means that at any given moment, we can draw a line from the moon down to this horizontal line

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
to create a right triangle, which will then allow us to use sine and cosine in conjunction with this angle

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
to determine the moon's vertical and horizontal distance from the earth.

24
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Going back to our code, after all of these is filled in, if we run the program,

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
we end up with a perfect circle, just like we were hoping to get

26
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
for the trajectory of the moon around the earth in this ideal simulation.
