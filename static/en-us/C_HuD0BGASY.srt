Peering between two ISPs involves inter-domain routing, as

does peering between a university network and its

00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:08,820
ISP. Or any peering at an Internet exchange

00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:11,370
point, for that matter. Routing between multiple data

00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:14,660
centers typically involves routing in a wide area,

00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:17,840
and hence may involve inter-domain routing. Routing within

00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:20,160
a single data center concerns routing in a

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,580
single domain and hence does not concern inter-domain routing.
