00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
[Norvig] The answer is shuffle2 is still order N squared,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and you can see that because it's similar to shuffle1 in the way it goes through

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
and checks off the elements that are swapped.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
But it is in fact correct.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
It does give a balanced result that any outcome is equally likely,

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
and you can see that by running the shuffler test on it.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Shuffle3, on the other hand, has a nice order N runtime,

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
but unfortunately, it's not correct. It's biased in the results that it produces.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
So in conclusion, we should stick to the original shuffle--

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
that is, not the teacher's function, not any attempts to fix it up,

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
but the one I was able to come up with in class

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
and the one that's in the literature of Knuth and others.
