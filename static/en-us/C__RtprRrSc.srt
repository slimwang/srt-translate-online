1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:05,610
So the second one is a file called
syslog, inside the directory called log,

2
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:08,880
inside var, inside the root.

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,725
So we write that as /var/log/syslog.

4
00:00:13,725 --> 00:00:18,806
This one here is Friend.png,
inside the directory otter,

5
00:00:18,806 --> 00:00:21,504
inside home, inside the root.

6
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:27,470
So it's /home/otter/friend.png.

7
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:33,299
And this one is
/home/otter/favorites.txt.
