1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,160
Yeah market segmentation
is probably at the very,

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:06,620
very center of a go to market
strategy that's successful.

3
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:09,620
So first let's talk about
what is a market segment.

4
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:14,030
So a market segment is a group of
people that have two things in common.

5
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:15,250
One is a used case.

6
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:18,590
They have a common set of needs that
they would be fulfilling through

7
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:20,860
a product like yours or someone elses.

8
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:24,730
And secondly, and this is the one
people miss, they talk to each other.

9
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:28,290
So a segment is actually a unit of
conversation and therefore, and

10
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:32,479
the reason why that's so important is
if you can get your marketing message

11
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:36,350
circulating inside a segment,
the segment will circulate it for you.

12
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:38,350
No entrepreneur can afford to go out and

13
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:41,400
pay to address every prospect
that they want to sell to.

14
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,060
You have to have your
community selling for you.

15
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:49,230
But that means you have to be able to
model the boundaries of that community

16
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:53,230
and be able to aim your marketing
communications activities in

17
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:58,850
a way that that community embraces them
and it resonates inside that community.

18
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:02,020
So just to make that
point crystal clear.

19
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:05,780
When yo talk about your product,
your saying things that apply to many

20
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:09,450
communities, that will not
resonate inside a community.

21
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:13,350
When you talk about the specific needs
of that community in the language that

22
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:17,650
community talks to itself about even
when your not talking about you

23
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:19,480
now your going to resonate
with that community.

24
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:22,510
So this market segmentation
in that sense.

25
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:26,790
Is a communications vehicle to make sure
you talk the talk of the customer so

26
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:29,730
they can then walk the walk
with you going forward.

27
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:30,940
That's idea number one.

28
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:35,830
The second thing about market
segmentation and this is kind of a fun

29
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:37,730
experience you have if you've
been marketing for awhile.

30
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:40,950
Fun if you like learning with pain.

31
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:44,150
So, the idea is whenever
you think about a segment,

32
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:49,530
people usually draw a circle they say,
okay so we're targeting this segment.

33
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:53,430
And then inevitably somebody comes along
and says, what about this customer who's

34
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:57,290
right at the edge of the circle and
almost inside but not quite.

35
00:01:57,290 --> 00:01:59,210
And then well you,
well okay we'll bring them in too.

36
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:01,750
And then well, we'll bring these
people in here, and then we'll bring.

37
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:05,250
And pretty soon there's just no
integrity in the process at all.

38
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:09,229
So what we've learned about segments
is you cannot define a segment

39
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:10,389
by its boundary.

40
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:12,890
because wherever you draw a line
there'll be somebody just on the other

41
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:17,310
side of that line who's pretty
darn close to the segment, right.

42
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:20,950
So what you do instead is you define
segments by their center points.

43
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:23,200
This is where they get this
idea called the poster child.

44
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:28,150
The poster child is
the perfect exemplar, the ideal

45
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:32,430
representation of the target customer
with the compelling reason to buy.

46
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:37,030
And that person, and often you create
something they call a persona,

47
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:41,210
which would be the embodiment
of that target customer, and

48
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:45,380
then you aim all of your marketing
communications at that one person

49
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:48,760
because they resonate with
all the people around them.

50
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:52,110
And furthermore you get your engineering
and you name, aim all of your

51
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:56,600
engineering at solving the use case
exactly the way that customer would like

52
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:01,640
it solved, and again that engineering
will resonate with people around, and so

53
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:07,250
therefore you can act on the world
in units of used cases and

54
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:08,800
word of mouth groups.

55
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,670
And so segmentation is designed to
allow you to leverage engineering

56
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:15,490
to the point where
the world is on your side.

57
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:18,770
As soon as you go outside the use
case and as soon as you go outside

58
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:21,880
the conversation group the world
is no longer working with you.

59
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:25,260
They may not be working against you,
but they're not working with you.

60
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:27,030
And as an entrepreneur,
at the beginning,

61
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:30,340
you desperately need
the world to work with you.

62
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:32,880
Eventually, if you become
a global standard,

63
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,180
then you don't need conversation groups.

64
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:39,440
Google does not need a conversation
group, it is a global standard.

65
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,180
But most of us are not Google, and
so particularly at the beginning.

66
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,040
And even at the beginning,

67
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,740
Google was not Google, so how do you
get started with those early groups?
