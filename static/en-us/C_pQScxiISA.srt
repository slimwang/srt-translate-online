00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,520
This brings us to Branch Prediction Requirements.

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:07,140
What do we need in order to successfully predict whether a branch is taken or

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:10,930
not? And where is it going if it's taken? Branch prediction needs to

4
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:15,570
work using only the knowledge of where we fetched the current instruction from.

5
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:21,420
And what we needed to guess is the PC of the next instruction to fetch. So

6
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:25,590
branch predictor must correctly guess, is this a branch?

7
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:31,192
If not, then it's certainly not taken. If it is a branch, is it taken?

8
00:00:31,192 --> 00:00:36,900
And if it is a taken branch, what is the target PC? Where is this branch going?

9
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:41,350
These two decisions really can be boiled down to one which is.

10
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:47,271
Is this a taken branch? It doesn't matter if we have a non-branch instruction,

11
00:00:47,271 --> 00:00:51,360
or a non-taken branch instruction. In both cases, we just fetch

12
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,640
the instruction that follows the branch in memory. So the only thing we

13
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:59,450
really need to decide is whether this a taken branch, or something else.
