00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,719
Textcat was the name of the R package that Corey

2
00:00:02,719 --> 00:00:06,490
used. We'll discuss R packages in the next video and what

3
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:10,000
they allow us to do. For the second question, the

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,210
automated system captures between ten tweets to 20 tweets a day.

5
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:16,680
For each of the tweets, the system will recommend that

6
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:20,070
whoever sent the tweet file a report. Now, for this last

7
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:23,040
question, we accepted any text answer here. I thought that

8
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,870
the most interesting part was that Cory showed the open source

9
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:29,730
R code classifier on GitHub. GitHub is a repository for

10
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:32,689
sharing code. You can learn more about GitHub by following the

11
00:00:32,689 --> 00:00:35,730
links in the instructor notes. It's the most popular repository

12
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:38,820
for open source projects and it's really easy to get started.
