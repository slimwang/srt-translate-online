1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,340
We want to caution, however, that although genetic factors play an important

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:06,604
role in the development of schizophrenia, just having a genetic predisposition

3
00:00:06,604 --> 00:00:12,558
does not mean that somebody is going to develop the disorder. However, research

4
00:00:12,558 --> 00:00:16,328
studies have shown that children who are exposed to abuse and neglect early in

5
00:00:16,328 --> 00:00:21,613
life, are more likely to develop schizophrenia later in life. And that brings

6
00:00:21,613 --> 00:00:24,622
us to a discussion that we had in lesson three on epigenetics, that is, a

7
00:00:24,622 --> 00:00:28,039
person can have a genetic predisposition and go throughout their lives without

8
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:33,673
developing the disorder. Or they can have that genetic predisposition, be

9
00:00:33,673 --> 00:00:39,008
exposed to an environmental event, and then develop the disorder. Now we've

10
00:00:39,008 --> 00:00:42,592
talked before that drugs can serve as epigenetic agents, and we see here that

11
00:00:42,592 --> 00:00:46,344
abuse and neglect can also serve as epigenetic agents which are responsible for

12
00:00:46,344 --> 00:00:49,560
the onset of schizophrenia.
