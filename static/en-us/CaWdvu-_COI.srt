1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,760
So now that we've learned, a bunch of new words

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:05,796
related with classes and objects, we will move on to

3
00:00:05,796 --> 00:00:09,072
creating a movie website. And here is the final output

4
00:00:09,072 --> 00:00:11,808
that we are after. All of our favorite movies, on a

5
00:00:11,808 --> 00:00:14,595
web page. And as you have seen previously, if you

6
00:00:14,595 --> 00:00:17,640
click on anyone of these movies, we see its trailer.

7
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:21,030
Let's build this. So here I am, back with my

8
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:24,970
code. Now thus far, we've made only two movie objects. Toy

9
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:28,610
Story and Avatar. I'm going to make a few more.

10
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:31,600
In fact, four more movie objects. But before I do

11
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,940
that, I want to make this window, a little bit

12
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:37,320
bigger, so we can see all of this code really easily.

13
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,620
Okay. So here are the two instances we have created

14
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:43,740
thus far. Toy Story and Avatar. Now before I proceed, I

15
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:46,780
will go ahead and comment ou the previous output statements

16
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:50,260
that I created. This print statement and the show trailer method.

17
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:52,087
So let me just add a comment there,

18
00:00:52,087 --> 00:00:56,070
[SOUND] and there. Done. Now, I'm going to add

19
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:58,860
a new movie object, for a movie called, School

20
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:02,400
of Rock. There it is. You will notice, that

21
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,239
I have changed the name of the movie,

22
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,750
its story-line, its poster image, and its future trailer

23
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:11,720
values appropriately. Next, I will add another movie object.

24
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:15,900
This time, for an animated movie called Ratatouille. Next,

25
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:18,420
I will add a movie object called, Midnight in

26
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,850
Paris. Now this, happens to be one of my

27
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:24,100
favorite movies. And the final movie object I will

28
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:26,560
add, is for a movie called, the Hunger Games.

29
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:30,650
Okay, so thus far, we have created six movie

30
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:34,020
objects. So far, so good. Now, to turn this

31
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:36,340
into a movie website. You will need a piece

32
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:39,590
of code that weed out. Now we call this code,

33
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:42,970
fresh_tomatoes.py. By the way, this file is available

34
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:45,110
for you to download in the instructor notes. Now

35
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:46,950
before we use it, let's see what this

36
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:51,823
file actually does. This file, fresh_tomatoes.py, has a function

37
00:01:51,823 --> 00:01:55,600
inside it called, open_movies_page. Let's look at this

38
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,650
function a bit more closely. Now, what this function

39
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:01,360
does, is that it takes in, a list of

40
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:05,190
movies as input, and as output it creates and

41
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:08,300
opens an HTML page or a website, that shows

42
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:11,030
the movies you gave it in the first place.

43
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:13,140
So what I'm going to do next, is use

44
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:15,610
this file, fresh_tomatoes.py, and it's

45
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:18,390
function, open_movies_page, inside our code.
