>> As much as I love the new equation we just came up with, it took us a really

2
00:00:03,847 --> 00:00:07,912
long time and a bunch of steps to get it in this nice form. It would be really

3
00:00:07,912 --> 00:00:11,880
great if we could come up with a shortcut for how to get to the same end result

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:16,219
without having to do quite as much work. The information that we used to develop

5
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:20,350
our equation in the last problem was a point and a slope. Let's consider a

6
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:24,909
general situation like this. Let's say that we have a line, and we know that the

7
00:00:24,909 --> 00:00:29,303
slope of the line is m. We also know that this line goes through the point, s,

8
00:00:29,303 --> 00:00:33,910
t, where s is our x coordinate, and t is our y coordinate. I'd like to start off

9
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:38,698
by having you substitute these values in to the proper places of an equation

10
00:00:38,698 --> 00:00:43,585
that's in slope-intercept form. So we want to start off with y equals mx plus b,

11
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:47,317
but then substitute in these quantities to the proper spots.
