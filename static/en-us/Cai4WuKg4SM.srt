00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:03,500
So, maybe you can see a pattern here. For the quiz,

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:06,180
I'm going to see if you can figure out how many times we'll

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:11,480
need to evaluate Fibonacci 30. Evaluate fibo 30 when we're evaluating fibo

4
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:15,140
36. See if you can figure this out without drawing out the

5
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:17,000
whole thing and counting it, that's going to be a lot of

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,810
work. But if you think about what we've seen so far, maybe

7
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:22,360
you see a pattern here, and you can figure out the result

8
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:25,590
for how many calls there would be to fibo 30 without doing

9
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:27,020
all that work. So see if you can

10
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:31,739
figure out the answer without working out every step.
