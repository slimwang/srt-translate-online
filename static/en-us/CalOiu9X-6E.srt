00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,026
We need a number greater than or equal to 1 and less than 10 in this box. So I'm

2
00:00:05,038 --> 00:00:09,929
going to use 1.6. I know large numbers have positive powers of 10. So I know

3
00:00:09,941 --> 00:00:15,099
there needs to be a positive number in this box. When I think about changing 1.6

4
00:00:15,111 --> 00:00:19,952
into 16 million, I know the decimal place needs to move 7 places to the right.

5
00:00:20,062 --> 00:00:21,491
So I have 1.6 times 10 to the 7th.
