1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,840
I'll start by comparing
the image's x dimension, or

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:06,700
its horizontal dimension here,
and on the original image.

3
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:10,340
Notice how on the site, the whole
horizontal dimension is fitting.

4
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:11,850
However, the y dimension, or

5
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:15,060
the vertical dimension,
does not entirely fit on the page.

6
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:16,470
Notice how on the original,

7
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:19,730
the image goes down far enough to
see a bit more of the tree trunk.

8
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:22,050
While on the site that part's cut off.

9
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:25,050
So for cover, the image kept
just as small as possible,

10
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:29,650
so that its smallest dimension matches
its container's smallest dimension.

11
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:33,020
However, its largest dimension
actually overflows the container.

12
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:34,460
Compare that to Contain,

13
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:39,700
in this case the y matches its container
dimensions but the x is now smaller.

14
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:43,520
Back to the statements, the first
one is going to be describing cover.

15
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,610
Cover ensures that the container
is completely filled,

16
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:49,870
even if that means one of the dimensions
is a little bit too large.

17
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:52,120
The second statement describes contain.

18
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:55,270
With contain, the image will
be completely visible, but

19
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:58,170
in order to do so,
that means that one of its dimensions

20
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:00,400
might be smaller than
the containers dimensions.
