00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Now we can say what the order of a solver is.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
A solver is a method such as the forward Euler method

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
that we used to solve differential equations on the computer going step by step.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
For the forward Euler method, we know that the global truncation error, the error after a finite time

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
is something like a constant times the step size.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:30,000
In the general case, it may not be the step size but this step size raise to a certain power,

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
and that power is called the order.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The forward Euler method has an order of one, so that we end up with the constant times h.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
More powerful methods we have larger orders, say two or four,

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
and again, we have to keep in mind that this constant depends on time.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
It may grow exponentially with time for instance.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
This constant does not depends on step size, however. Know this site.

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Be sure not to confuse this notion of order with the notion of order of a differential equation.

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:09,000
When we have differential equation of this sort for instance, this is of order two.

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The order of a differential equation is a different story.
