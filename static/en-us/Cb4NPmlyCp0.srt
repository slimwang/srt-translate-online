00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:05,110
To download Xcode, click on the link in the instructor notes.

2
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:06,850
This software will help us make our app.

3
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:11,990
Xcode comes prepackaged with the programming language Swift.

4
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:14,930
So this is the only thing you need to install.

5
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:19,550
Depending on your Internet speed, however, this download can take a while.

6
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:23,330
So while you're downloading Xcode I want to present you with a puzzle.

7
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:27,170
I will show you some Swift code in a second.

8
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:28,360
This code is going to look new.

9
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:31,400
And it's okay if you do not understand it fully.

10
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,500
I just want you to read through the code and

11
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,560
make a prediction around what you think this code does.

12
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:37,580
So here's the code.

13
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:42,240
Now as you're reading through this I want you to find as many clues as you can.

14
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,870
But, I'm going to start you off with one of own.

15
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:47,690
This code runs on a really popular app on your phone.

16
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:51,390
You should think about the following questions.

17
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:54,250
Which app on your phone uses this code?

18
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:56,620
What even triggers this code?

19
00:00:56,620 --> 00:01:00,440
And also things about the code that you do not understand just yet.

20
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:02,360
So here's the question one last time.

21
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:03,510
What do you think this code does?
