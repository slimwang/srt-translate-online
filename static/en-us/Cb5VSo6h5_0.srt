1
00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:04,670
In fact, interdomain routing can oscillate indefinitely. To see why,

2
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:09,880
consider the following 4 AS topology, where each AS specifies

3
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:15,450
preferred paths, presumably via local preference. So each AS prefers

4
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:18,170
the AS in the clockwise direction, rather

5
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:20,770
than the shorter, direct path. Now it's pretty

6
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:22,120
easy to see that there's no stable

7
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:25,270
solution. Let's suppose that we started off with

8
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:30,620
everybody selecting the direct path. Well, in this case, any one of these ASs

9
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:37,110
would notice that it has a more preferred path. So for example, AS1 would see

10
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:42,560
that because AS3 has picked the direct path, then, in fact, it could prefer

11
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,390
1 3 0. Now we enter into

12
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:50,220
a situation where oscillations can occur indefinitely. Similarly,

13
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:55,590
here now AS3 sees that it has a more preferred path, 3 2 0, so it might

14
00:00:55,590 --> 00:01:01,032
switch to that. In doing so, it breaks AS1's path. 1 3 0 no longer

15
00:01:01,032 --> 00:01:04,550
works. So AS1 has to switch back to

16
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:07,080
its less preferred direct path, but now we're

17
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,910
in the same situation all over again. Because

18
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:15,180
now AS2's preferred path becomes available via 1,

19
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:21,530
so AS2 now reroutes, and AS3's most preferred path, 3 2 0, no longer works. So

20
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:23,350
it must switch to the direct path. Now,

21
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:25,780
it's very easy to see that this oscillation

22
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:29,970
continues ad infinitum. This particular pathology was first

23
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:32,750
discovered by Varadhan, Govindan, and Estrin, in a

24
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:36,210
paper called persistent route oscillation in interdomain routing,

25
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:41,130
in 1996. Later, Tim Griffin formalized this pathology and

26
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:44,700
derived conditions for stability. Those stability conditions

27
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,350
came to be known as a BGP

28
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:49,600
correctness property called safety. It turns out,

29
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,760
that if ASs follow the ranking and export

30
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:56,370
rules that we discussed, that safety is

31
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:59,260
guaranteed. But, there are various times when

32
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:02,540
those rules are violated. Business relationships, such

33
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:06,270
as regional peering, and paid peering can occasionally

34
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:09,990
cause those conditions to be violated. So as it

35
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:14,020
turns out, to this day, BGP is not guaranteed to

36
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:18,160
be stable in practice, and many common practices result

37
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,090
in the potential for this type of oscillation to occur.
