1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,950
The correct answer to this is, it depends.

2
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:04,980
With shared memory based communication,

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:07,710
the individual data exchange may be cheap,

4
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:11,870
because they don't require that the data is copied in and out of the kernel.

5
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:16,690
However, the actual operation of mapping memory between two processes,

6
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:19,250
that operation itself is expensive.

7
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:23,570
So, it only makes sense to do shared memory-based communication if that cost,

8
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:28,610
the setup cost, can be amortized across a sufficiently large number of messages.

9
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:30,080
That's why the real answer is, it depends.
