00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,780
Congratulations on completing the course. We've covered lots of

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:05,840
material in this course and there's lots more that we

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:09,920
couldn't get to. Mobile web development is a huge topic

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,970
and you're probably wondering where to go from here. Now

5
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:15,500
that you understand the basic concepts, you probably have

6
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:19,860
questions about things like scaffolding and getting started, which libraries

7
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:22,530
to use and how to deploy your applications, how to

8
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:25,229
really incorporate this knowledge into your day to day work.

9
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:28,360
To learn more, you can visit HTML5

10
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:31,380
Rocks, follow Chrome developers on Google Plus,

11
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:32,700
and check out the chrome channel on

12
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,080
Google developers live for more information on dev

13
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:37,590
tools. There are many handy tools out

14
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:40,134
there that can further streamline your development

15
00:00:40,134 --> 00:00:42,750
workflow. Yeoman and Grunt for example allow

16
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:45,220
you to scaffold and easily build your projects.
