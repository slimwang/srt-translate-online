1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:04,300
So going about and finding
co-founders is a lot like dating.

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:07,270
You want to press the flesh and
leverage your social network and

3
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:11,330
find out who your friends know and
who their friends know, but maybe not so

4
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:15,420
much in a social sense but in a business
sense which businesses do you know?

5
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:17,100
Who do you respect in
these companies and

6
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,460
who can refer you to
the right kind of people?

7
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:25,030
And when you meet them it's a lot like a
date, you are evaluating each other for

8
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:29,320
a potential match and a commitment
that's on par with marriage.

9
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:32,790
Because when you actually go into
business with somebody as a co-founder,

10
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:34,440
it is a bonded commitment.

11
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,640
You're spending the majority
of your time with this person,

12
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,220
you are looking in the same
direction as the these people or

13
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:41,470
this person and
you're all committed to the same thing.
