1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
All right. Here's how we decode the message.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
We start off with the 15-bit message. We write it down.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Then we write the bits down in a column in order,

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
and we label each bit with its position number in binary

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
from 0001 all the way to 1111.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
There's 15 bits. We're starting with 1. That's how we get the codes.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Then we make note of which bit positions have 1s in the broadcast message,

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
and then we pull out those numbers, and we add them together with wraparound.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
So, in the right-most column, we have 00110, and that's three 1s,

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
so the sum is going to be a 1. It's an odd number of 1s.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
In the second column from the right, it's 011010.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
That's three 1s again, so that sum will be 1 in that position.

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
In the third column from the right, 111001.

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
That's four 1s, so we'll have a 0 in that position because it's even.

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
In the first position, again, three 1s gives us a 1.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So, that is the message that we're looking for--1011.
