Where on the coordinate plane does this graph lie, then? We know that the

2
00:00:03,408 --> 00:00:07,791
Asymptotes, which I've drawn here, divide the plane into sections. And we can

3
00:00:07,791 --> 00:00:11,256
find the graph of the rational function in some of those areas, but not all of

4
00:00:11,256 --> 00:00:15,539
them. Please check off all the spots that the function will pass through.
