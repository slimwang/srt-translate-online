00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,870
In this section,
you're going to go ahead and

2
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:05,040
replace those strings in your
return statements with templates.

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,990
In your templates directory, make eight
new files with the following names.

4
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:12,090
Replace the previous return statements
such that they now return render

5
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:15,460
templates for each of your
methods in final project.py.

6
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:18,310
But wait a second, if we design
our templates before connecting to

7
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:21,320
a database, Python will throw an error
message when we try to refer to

8
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:24,790
restaurants and menu items that
don't yet exist in our application.

9
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:28,020
To get around this problem, we can
temporarily make a fake database out of

10
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:30,610
dictionaries inside of our
final-project.py file.

11
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:33,910
I have made some dictionaries which
will serve as dummy variables for

12
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:37,150
one restaurant, a collection of
restaurants, one menu item, and

13
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:38,870
a collection of menu items.

14
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:42,170
The source code for these dictionaries
is available in the instructor notes.

15
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:44,983
Go ahead and leave hashtags in
the form action and href path,

16
00:00:44,983 --> 00:00:48,347
since we are focusing more on the
structure of our pages in this step, and

17
00:00:48,347 --> 00:00:50,350
not so much their functionality.

18
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:52,557
Now, when a user revisits
these links in a browser,

19
00:00:52,557 --> 00:00:54,570
they should see something like this.

20
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:57,560
The functionality isn't going to be in
place just yet, but we've just created

21
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:01,070
another prototype that we can use
to present our progress thus far.

22
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:04,019
Your template should also return a
different message to the user if there's

23
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:07,760
an empty menu, or empty list of
restaurants, maybe something like this.

24
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,150
Try and see if you can accommodate for

25
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:11,060
this corner case in
your templates as well.
