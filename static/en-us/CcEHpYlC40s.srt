1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:02,540
The answer is it depends.

2
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:05,310
There's a deliberate ambiguity here.

3
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:08,660
For example, suppose node zero
sends to node eight via this path.

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,680
If the second message takes this route,
then the two paths intersect

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:18,060
going in the same direction and
there will be congestion at this link.

6
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:23,960
If instead the second message takes
this route, then there's no contention.

7
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:27,170
So, in fact, if these are the only
two pending messages,

8
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:29,490
you can overlap them by
choosing good routes.

9
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,770
In genera,l for some analysis, you're
going to need to reason about whether or

10
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:36,610
not congestion or
contention are occurring.

11
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:38,940
We'll discuss some techniques to do so
in a different lesson.

12
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,760
Now the question asks for the minimum
time, so if you assume optimistically

13
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:48,682
the non-colliding paths, then you
would get just a plus b times n.
