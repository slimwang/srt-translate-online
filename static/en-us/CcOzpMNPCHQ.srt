1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:04,210
And for the next question, what would
you use to send a 500 kilobyte image

2
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:05,270
from a phone to a wearable?

3
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:09,290
Would you use a data item and
the putString() method?

4
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:10,970
A data item and putAsset()?

5
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:12,170
Or a message with a byte array?
