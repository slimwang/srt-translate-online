Hi everybody.

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:05,020
I'll be answering the question,
what do you know about our company?.

3
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:07,390
So before the interview
I did a bit of research.

4
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:10,210
I read articles,
I checked out some blog posts.

5
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:13,630
I went on the Udacity website and
read the about us section and

6
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:16,120
then checked out a few
courses in nanodegrees.

7
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:17,730
And what I learned is
that Udacity is trying to

8
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:19,740
change the way that people learn.

9
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:23,090
Before, it was thought that education
is something that happens at the first

10
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:25,730
four years of adulthood,
and stops right there.

11
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:28,090
The rest of your career you
don't need to worry about it.

12
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:31,200
But, of course, the world is changing
much, much, much too rapidly for

13
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,790
that to still be the case.

14
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:35,064
Today people have to learn
throughout their careers.

15
00:00:35,064 --> 00:00:38,310
So what Udacity is doing is
trying to change education and

16
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:42,109
turn it into something that people
can do throughout their lives.

17
00:00:42,109 --> 00:00:46,497
It's an education that can happen when
people want it and how people want it.

18
00:00:46,497 --> 00:00:48,685
And it also is there to
help people get new jobs.

19
00:00:48,685 --> 00:00:52,850
Udacity also has the opportunity
to teach people a new way simply

20
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:55,300
because this education
is happening online.

21
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:58,770
People have computers in front of them
which means that you can go much beyond

22
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:03,320
simply offering videos and quizzes,
and you can create totally

23
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:06,550
new educational experiences that not
just connect people with material,

24
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:09,140
but also connect people with each other.

25
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:12,320
So I think that Udascity is
a company that's doing their best

26
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,740
to change the way that people learn and
I think they're doing it for the better.

27
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:16,240
Thanks.
