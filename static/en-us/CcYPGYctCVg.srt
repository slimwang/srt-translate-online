00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:04,790
Alright. So, why are statistical significance tests useful? So,

2
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:07,210
they do provide a formalized framework for comparing and

3
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:10,760
evaluating data. And they do enable us to evaluate

4
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:13,470
whether perceived effects in our data set reflect differences across

5
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:16,149
the whole population. They do not make a bad

6
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:19,190
result look good. Significant sets are useful because they provide

7
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:22,640
a formalized framework for comparing and evaluating data. Different

8
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,500
tests have different assumptions and rules that they incorporate, and

9
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,780
using a particular test ensures that everyone is on the

10
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:30,990
same page in so far as what we're assuming about

11
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:34,820
our data. Significance tests also enable us to evaluate whether

12
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:37,550
perceived effects in our data set reflect differences across the whole

13
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:40,796
population. As was the case with our company, where ten

14
00:00:40,796 --> 00:00:45,180
out of ten people polled preferred the color blue. Sometimes an

15
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:47,770
affect that we seen in a small sample does not

16
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:51,500
reflect what might be true across the entire population. A statistical

17
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:54,420
significance test let's us formally determine whether or not this might

18
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,940
be the case. Unfortunately, a bad result is not going to

19
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:00,390
look any better or worse as a result of using a

20
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:02,950
statistical significance test. If our data's

21
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:05,010
bad, or there's really no difference

22
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:07,930
between our two samples. We're not going to be able to

23
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:11,470
undo that with a test. It is possible though that different tests

24
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:14,890
might give us different results. The really important thing and we'll

25
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:16,580
go into this a bit more is that you need to use

26
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:19,290
the right test in the right situations. Why don't we talk a

27
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:22,430
little bit about how we might actually run a statistical significance test.
