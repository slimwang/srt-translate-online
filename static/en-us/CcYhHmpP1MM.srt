00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:04,116
So, from an evolutionary perspective, it makes sense that our bodies have these

2
00:00:04,116 --> 00:00:07,828
internal mechanisms that propel us to act in ways necessary for survival and

3
00:00:07,828 --> 00:00:15,150
reproduction. Let's take hunger and thirst, for example. So these needs propel

4
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:20,594
us to act in ways toward, to look for food and water. And if we're successful,

5
00:00:20,594 --> 00:00:24,945
we survive, we reproduce, we pass on our genes. Now we also have a need to

6
00:00:24,945 --> 00:00:29,085
reproduce. Now as individuals we don't actually need to reproduce in order to

7
00:00:29,085 --> 00:00:32,820
survive. Although, of course, as a species we do. it's a little more

8
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:36,230
complicated, so we'll talk more about sex and reproduction later on in the

9
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:37,680
lesson.
