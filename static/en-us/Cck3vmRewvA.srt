1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,123
Now for the big quiz.

2
00:00:02,803 --> 00:00:05,806
In all seriousness, this is the most
complicated exercise

3
00:00:05,806 --> 00:00:08,270
I've given you so far this lesson.

4
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:13,100
I want you to implement the DetailsView 
using the CursorLoader

5
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:15,426
and multiple TextView widgets.

6
00:00:16,206 --> 00:00:18,522
And I've got some hints for you.

7
00:00:18,522 --> 00:00:23,200
Use loaders not adapters. 
What does this mean?

8
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,913
Well, it makes sense.

9
00:00:24,913 --> 00:00:28,860
Your DetailView does not contain a list,
so you don't need to use an adapter.

10
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:32,113
but you can still use the loader pattern.

11
00:00:32,113 --> 00:00:35,776
The loader pattern will automatically
observe for changes in the URI

12
00:00:35,776 --> 00:00:37,810
with a CursorLoader.

13
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:42,850
The second thing you want
to do is pass the date into your intent.

14
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:44,450
The date is the important thing

15
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:46,640
that the DetailView needs
to have passed into it,

16
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,540
to properly query the content provider.

17
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:52,603
Now remember, you can actually get 
the current location settings

18
00:00:52,603 --> 00:00:54,816
from the utility function.

19
00:00:54,816 --> 00:00:59,070
So all you really need is the date. 
I hope that helps.
