00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,910
Let's reinforce
the Loomis-Whitney Theorem.

2
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:06,240
Suppose I assign you part
of a matrix multiply.

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,530
That is, let's say I give you
a piece of A, which is 3 x 5,

4
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:13,640
a piece of B which is 5 x 4, and
a piece of C which is 2 x 2.

5
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:15,700
Here is my question.

6
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:20,230
What is the minimum and maximum number
of multiplies you could possibly do?

7
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:22,700
I want you to fill in these
blanks with a suitable integer.
