00:00:00,756 --> 00:00:03,800
Again, I'll want to use a fun quiz

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:07,939
to get you situated with respect to the concept

3
00:00:07,939 --> 00:00:10,780
of an abstraction. Now remember what I told

4
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:14,890
you about an abstraction, that it's an interface that

5
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:20,670
allows us to hide all the details. With that in mind, what I want you to do

6
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:23,960
Is to think about the objects and the terms

7
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:26,830
that I've laid out on this panel for you.

8
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:33,260
And you may have come across many of them and from this set tell me which of

9
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:37,080
these is not an abstraction. There may be more

10
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,840
than one item in this set that I've shown

11
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,470
you on this panel that may not be an

12
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:46,290
abstraction and I want you to identify all of

13
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:50,170
the items that you think is not an abstraction.

14
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:52,570
The first choice I have is a door knob.

15
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:57,510
The second choice I have for you is instruction set architecture. The

16
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:02,660
third choice I have is the number of pins coming out of a chip, like a processor

17
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:07,700
chip. And the next choice I have for you is a logic gate such as

18
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:12,630
and gate that does the and function. And the next item I

19
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:17,830
have for you is a transistor. And the next item I have for you is the

20
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:23,480
INT data type in a programming language like C. And the last item I have for you

21
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:28,080
is exact location of base pads in a

22
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,620
baseball field. So these are the choices that I'm

23
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:31,980
giving you and what I want you to

24
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:37,110
do is think about these different items. Which you

25
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:39,690
may have come across for sure in your every

26
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:43,340
day experience, and tell me which one of these

27
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:51,734
does not qualify as an abstraction. And as I've said, there

28
00:01:51,734 --> 00:01:52,599
could be more than one that does not qualify as an abstraction.
