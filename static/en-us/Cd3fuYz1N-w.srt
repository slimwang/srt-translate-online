00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:04,560
For modular multiplication,
the story is a bit more complicated.

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:10,369
First, similar to modular
addition,in modular multiplication

3
00:00:10,369 --> 00:00:16,293
the result of x times y not m is
the remainder of x times y divided by m.

4
00:00:16,293 --> 00:00:18,760
In modular multiplication,

5
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:23,501
the result of a number times
its inverse, MOD M, is one.

6
00:00:23,501 --> 00:00:29,072
For example, if the modular is 10,
then three and seven are inverse

7
00:00:29,072 --> 00:00:35,220
of each other because three times
seven is 21 and 21 MOD 10 is one.

8
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:39,060
Because, the remainder of
21 divided by 10 is one.

9
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:44,460
It turns out, that, for a given modular,
only some numbers have inverse.

10
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:49,126
For example, if the modular is 10,
then the numbers two,

11
00:00:49,126 --> 00:00:52,710
five, six, eight do not have inverse.

12
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:56,680
For example, for the number two,
can you find its inverse,

13
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:01,150
say x, such that two times x,
MOD 10 is one?

14
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:03,020
There's no such x.

15
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:08,120
The great mathematician Euclid invented
the method to find multiplicative

16
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:08,890
inverse.

17
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:14,640
That is, for the modular n given X,
Euclid had an algorithm to find Y.

18
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,940
Such that X times Y mod N equal to one.

19
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:22,920
Euclid also proved that only
the numbers relatively prime to N

20
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,380
has MOD N multiplicative inverse.
