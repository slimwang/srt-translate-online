1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,070
So, remembering this rule that we talked about before, that the factors that

2
00:00:04,082 --> 00:00:08,415
have exponents with the same base are multiplied together, their exponents just

3
00:00:08,427 --> 00:00:12,705
add. What would be a different way to write x squared times x to the fourth time

4
00:00:12,717 --> 00:00:15,305
times x to the third using exponential notation?
