00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,560
Next, we will look at techniques that make independence instructions easier for

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:07,520
a processor to find. So ideal processor would find them because it is able to

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:10,720
look at an infinite number of instructions, potentially, but

4
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:14,260
the real processor can only see so many instructions ahead. So it actually

5
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:17,880
doesn't see that there are independent instructions further down the code.

6
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:22,110
We will really look at two techniques. One is instruction scheduling for

7
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:25,430
simple branch-free sequences of instructions.

8
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:29,670
Then we will look at techniques specific to loops, such as loop unrolling, and

9
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:33,090
how they interact with the instruction scheduling, and then,

10
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:37,300
we will briefly look at the more powerful technique called trace scheduling.
