00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,590
Now that we have the corrects substitution to use, we can replace 4m minus 3

2
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:11,750
with the variable u. So, this part becomes u, and this part becomes u. So,

3
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:19,004
we'll have 2u squared plus 7u plus 5 equals 0. Now that we have a quadratic

4
00:00:19,004 --> 00:00:22,124
equation to solve, I want you to find the factored expression for the left hand

5
00:00:22,124 --> 00:00:28,270
side of the equation. And then I want you to solve this equation for u. Be sure

6
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:31,320
when you enter your answers here, you enter them as a set.
