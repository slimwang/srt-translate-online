1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Here's the result code and what we want to do is replace the list tocrawl and crawled with sets.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
This make more sense--what we really want these things to be is an ordered collections

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
without duplicates, which is exactly what a set is.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
The first thing we need to do is change the initialization.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Instead of starting out with the listed, we need to start it out with the set containing that one only.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
For crawled, we want to start with an empty set.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The good news is we don't actually have to change much of the rest of this code.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Here we're using page not in crawled that in operation behaves similarly for sets as it did for list.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
So we can use that just as we were. We don't need to change anything.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
What we want to do is change the part where we used the union and we're going to change this

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,000
to use the set update passing in out links and updating the value of tocrawl

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
to be union of tocrawl in outlinks.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
We need to make one other change, which is here. We use append which is define for list.

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The reason it's not called append for sets is because it doesn't add to the end of a set.

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
The set has new order, so it makes more sense to call this add,

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
which is the name of the set up operation that adds an element to the set.

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
So these are all the changes that we need to make.

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
The other change that we can make is now we can delete the union code,

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
which we no longer need because sets are already defined to provide union..
