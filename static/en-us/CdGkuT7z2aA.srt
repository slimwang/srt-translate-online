1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,440
We saw many of the common software
vulnerabilities or bugs and

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:06,500
how they can be exploited.

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:11,910
We also learned about a number of
defenses, including what we can do and

4
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:14,940
also what the operating
system can do for us.

5
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:19,930
At this point, hopefully, you are well
aware of some of the secure programming

6
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:22,120
practices that we should all be using.
