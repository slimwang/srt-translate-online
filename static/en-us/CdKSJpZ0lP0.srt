00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:04,936
For floating point, each color channel is defined as values from 0 to 1. 0, 0, 0

2
00:00:04,936 --> 00:00:11,110
is black, 1, 1, 1 is white. Setting just the red channel gives red, green to

3
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:16,198
green and blue to blue. Where things go off the tracks for some people is when

4
00:00:16,198 --> 00:00:21,228
we set a color as follows, RGB of 1, 1 and 0. This is to make a color using the

5
00:00:21,228 --> 00:00:25,460
red and green channels at their maximum and with no blue. If I take red paint

6
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:30,456
and green paint and mix them together, I get at best a murky brown. This happens

7
00:00:30,456 --> 00:00:34,287
because paint colors are formed by absorption of various wave lengths of light.

8
00:00:34,288 --> 00:00:38,401
The color model for mixing paints and inks is called subtractive color. The

9
00:00:38,401 --> 00:00:43,406
three primary colors used in printing are cyan Magenta and yellow, with black

10
00:00:43,406 --> 00:00:47,832
added as its own dark ink. This printing system is called CMYK with K standing

11
00:00:47,832 --> 00:00:52,031
for key and essentially meaning black. As different colors are mixed, the

12
00:00:52,031 --> 00:00:56,472
pigments become darker over all. In computer graphics a monitor, such as this

13
00:00:56,472 --> 00:01:00,978
one, emits light of different labelings. Our eyes see light in wavelengths

14
00:01:00,978 --> 00:01:06,370
between 390 and 750 manometers. Longer wavelength light is red, shorter is blue

15
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:10,337
with the rainbow in between. If we specify some red and some green light then

16
00:01:10,337 --> 00:01:14,478
these contributions are added together giving a brighter color overall. This

17
00:01:14,478 --> 00:01:18,277
color model is called additive color. See the additional course material for

18
00:01:18,277 --> 00:01:22,218
more articles about this area. If you want a particular color, the additive

19
00:01:22,218 --> 00:01:26,464
color RGB values are what you will need to determine. To get familiar with this

20
00:01:26,464 --> 00:01:29,223
way of mixing colors try out the demo that follows.
