00:00:00,109 --> 00:00:05,908
Okay, so in this case, the answer is Y is not allowed to be passed to the child kernel

2
00:00:05,908 --> 00:00:10,420
because Y is in shared memory, and shared memory is private to a block,

3
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:15,399
which means that the launched kernel possessing different blocks will not be

4
00:00:15,399 --> 00:00:18,225
permitted to have access to that shared memory.

5
00:00:18,225 --> 00:00:23,493
Note, in this case, when I created Z, I allocated it from the heap.

6
00:00:23,493 --> 00:00:28,465
A heap allocation goes in global memory and is therefore permitted to be passed in.

7
00:00:28,465 --> 00:00:35,195
So, X and Z are both in global memory, X being declared at global scope and Z being allocated,

8
00:00:35,209 --> 00:00:38,378
Y is in shared memory and would need to be copied before it's passed in.
