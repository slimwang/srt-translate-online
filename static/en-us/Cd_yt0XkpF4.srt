1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:01,736
Alright, you're done.

2
00:00:01,736 --> 00:00:03,282
Lets take a look at the solution.

3
00:00:03,282 --> 00:00:05,540
Now we're going to need some TextViews.

4
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:07,390
First of all let's look 
at our LinearLayout.

5
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:08,513
It's vertical.

6
00:00:08,533 --> 00:00:10,696
We're going to want it to be horizontal.

7
00:00:10,696 --> 00:00:13,450
The next thing we're going to want
are a bunch of TextViews.

8
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:15,110
Lets just drag them in.

9
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:19,480
Now remember, we had all those ID's 
that were given to us in the last quiz.

10
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:23,910
The first one is the 
list_item_date_TextView,

11
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:25,840
and we'll give it some text 
that makes sense

12
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,650
when we help to layout the layout.

13
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:31,370
We'll remove this before 
we actually submit it to our project.

14
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:34,926
And for fun, let's switch to landscape.

15
00:00:34,926 --> 00:00:37,462
It'll make things a little more legible.

16
00:00:37,462 --> 00:00:40,140
Also, let's just zoom in a little bit.

17
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:45,840
Alright, so that's our 
list_item_date_TextView.

18
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,863
Now, right next to that, 
we want another TextView.

19
00:00:50,863 --> 00:00:55,306
Since we want the design to be the same,
this one doesn't need to have an ID.

20
00:00:55,306 --> 00:00:59,730
If you remember, our design had the date,

21
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:03,720
followed by a dash, 
followed by the Forecast,

22
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:07,530
followed by a dash, 
followed by the high,

23
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:09,940
followed by a slash, 
followed by low.

24
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:13,980
So this is just going to be a view 
that contains a dash.

25
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:18,946
And we can even hardcode this in for now.

26
00:01:18,946 --> 00:01:21,742
Then we're going to create 
another TextView next to that.

27
00:01:21,742 --> 00:01:25,420
Our placeholder text 
will be a forecast, like clear.

28
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:31,398
The ID for this will be 
list_item_forecast_TextView.

29
00:01:31,398 --> 00:01:33,550
Now we need another TextView.

30
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:35,986
Once again, this one's
not going to have an ID

31
00:01:35,986 --> 00:01:37,492
because we don't need it.

32
00:01:37,492 --> 00:01:39,350
And we'll add another dash.

33
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:42,820
Now we're actually getting 
to the high and low forecasts.

34
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:45,276
Let's say a high of 23,

35
00:01:45,276 --> 00:01:48,732
one more plain TextView, 
this one with a slash,

36
00:01:48,732 --> 00:01:51,770
and once again, with no ID.

37
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:53,453
And for our high forecast,

38
00:01:53,453 --> 00:01:57,666
it better be list_item_high_text_view.

39
00:01:57,666 --> 00:02:00,180
Finally, we'll add 
one more plain TextView.

40
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,646
This one will be for our low,
and of course,

41
00:02:02,646 --> 00:02:07,812
that means it's going to be
list_item_low_text_view.

42
00:02:07,812 --> 00:02:11,479
And there we have it,
our multiple TextView Layout.

43
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:13,470
Now we might want to make this prettier,

44
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:15,268
but this is a good start, 
and it just plays

45
00:02:15,268 --> 00:02:17,036
the four fields that we asked for.

46
00:02:17,036 --> 00:02:19,396
They're all part of a LinearLayout.

47
00:02:19,396 --> 00:02:22,602
Before we actually would submit this,
let's remove the placeholder tags

48
00:02:22,602 --> 00:02:25,330
for everything except for
the static fields.

49
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:27,580
We'll also have to remove 
these empty IDs,

50
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:30,650
it's actually important to understand 
what's going on in these TextViews.

51
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:34,420
And there we have it, that's what 
your layout should look like,

52
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:36,936
at least if you want to make
it look almost identical

53
00:02:36,936 --> 00:02:38,592
to the layout we started out with.

54
00:02:38,592 --> 00:02:40,240
Of course you can go wild 
with these designs

55
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,900
and there's a lot you can do 
with the layout editor

56
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,490
and with different kinds of layouts.

57
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:45,580
We'll be learning more 
about that in the next lesson.

58
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:48,840
Alright, we finally get to start 
hooking this up to our UX.

59
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,290
Let's go back to ForecastFragment.
