00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,535
>> Before we start this unit, let's take another look at MathQuill. In the last

2
00:00:03,535 --> 00:00:07,055
section, we were able to type in inequalities and interval notations for our

3
00:00:07,055 --> 00:00:10,787
answers. Now, we're going to try some fractions. In a fraction in MathQuill is

4
00:00:10,787 --> 00:00:14,518
very similar to what you've done in the past. You simply going to type in the

5
00:00:14,518 --> 00:00:18,317
numerator then the forward slash and then the denominator. Mathquill will do all

6
00:00:18,317 --> 00:00:22,140
the hard work for you and will make your fraction look nice. But sometimes we

7
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:26,176
don't want just a fraction, sometimes you want a little bit more. After typing

8
00:00:26,176 --> 00:00:30,278
in a fraction, you'll notice that your cursor bar is in the denominator. To move

9
00:00:30,278 --> 00:00:34,246
the cursor bar from the denominator, simply hit the over arrow key and it will

10
00:00:34,246 --> 00:00:38,133
shift back up to the main line. And now you're ready to continue typing just

11
00:00:38,133 --> 00:00:42,091
like before. You would type x plus sign and then 1. And it turns out anytime

12
00:00:42,091 --> 00:00:45,571
you're typing inside a MathQuill box, you can just use your arrow keys as

13
00:00:45,571 --> 00:00:49,491
navigation. Try playing around with MathQuill and use these arrow keys. Don't

14
00:00:49,491 --> 00:00:53,238
worry about making a mistake because you can always hit Delete. When you play

15
00:00:53,238 --> 00:00:56,950
around with it, you'll notice that the cursor bar will move up and down inside

16
00:00:56,950 --> 00:01:00,599
of a fraction. You can even hit the carrot symbol and then you can create an

17
00:01:00,599 --> 00:01:04,922
exponent cursor. We won't cover this now, but if you want to play around with

18
00:01:04,922 --> 00:01:07,312
it, feel free to. We'll do this again later.
