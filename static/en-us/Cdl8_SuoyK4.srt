1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
We would like to add digital signatures to the course accomplishment certificates

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
that would allow someone who knows KU,CA, the public key of our certificate authority,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
to validate that a certificate was generated by Udacity and earned by the person

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
whose name is in the certificate.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Assume m is the certificate string.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
For example, "Certificate of accomplishment with highest distinction earned

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
by Alice Hacker in CS587."

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Assume E is a strong public key encryption algorithm,

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
H is a cryptographic hash function, and r si a random nonce.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Which of these schemes would allow Udacity to generate unforgable,

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
verifiable, signed certificates.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Check all that are valid.
