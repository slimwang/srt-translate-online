1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,316
In general, we want to use the pooled variance since it corrects for the

2
00:00:03,316 --> 00:00:08,050
different sample sizes. In the problem set, you'll get more practice using the

3
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:12,850
pooled variance. But the way the t statistic is calculated is essentially the

4
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:17,634
same. We divide the observed difference between the mean of X and the mean of Y

5
00:00:17,634 --> 00:00:23,990
by the standard error, which is calculated slightly differently. Where these

6
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:29,908
guys here are this pooled variance. Note that this is the t-statistic when we

7
00:00:29,908 --> 00:00:36,054
expect that the true populations that these samples come from are the same. In

8
00:00:36,054 --> 00:00:41,198
other words, that the difference between the population parameters is zero.

9
00:00:41,198 --> 00:00:46,326
But, say that we expect that the difference is equal to 10, for example. Then

10
00:00:46,326 --> 00:00:50,681
here, we would subtract this expected difference from the observed difference

11
00:00:50,681 --> 00:00:56,272
and this observed difference is what we get from our sample. So, this is our

12
00:00:56,272 --> 00:01:00,965
full t-statistic for independent samples. But in general in this class, our

13
00:01:00,965 --> 00:01:04,705
null hypothesis has been that there's no significant difference between the two

14
00:01:04,705 --> 00:01:08,988
populations. In other words, we expect that the difference between the

15
00:01:08,988 --> 00:01:13,356
parameters is about zero. There are a few assumptions to keep in mind when

16
00:01:13,356 --> 00:01:18,268
using the pooled variance as there are with any method of measurement. First of

17
00:01:18,268 --> 00:01:23,720
all, X and Y should be random samples from two independent populations.

18
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:28,494
Remember when we looked at dependent samples. Data coming from the same subject

19
00:01:28,494 --> 00:01:34,666
twice. In this case, the population should be independent. The second, is that

20
00:01:34,666 --> 00:01:39,345
the populations that X and Y come from should be approximately normal. This is

21
00:01:39,345 --> 00:01:45,358
less important when the sample sizes are very large, greater than 30. A third

22
00:01:45,358 --> 00:01:49,201
assumption is that the sample data can be used to estimate the population

23
00:01:49,201 --> 00:01:54,696
variances and finally. The population variances should be roughly equal,

24
00:01:54,696 --> 00:01:59,130
allowing us to use this pooled variance as an estimate of both.
