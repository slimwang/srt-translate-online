00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So the last thing I'm going to talk about this unit is bitcoin

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
which is a way to do digital cash in a completely decentralized way.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
This means that there's no bank--there's no trusted authority--

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
but everyone who participates in the protocol is considered a peer,

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
and they all have an equal say as to what's valued and what's not.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Bitcoin combines lots of ideas from previous protocols,

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
but the particular way that bitcoin does it

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
was proposed by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
The way it avoids needing a centralized bank

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
is to keep track of every single transaction that ever happens.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
So in order to track transactions we have a chain of signatures.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
So here's how that works.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Some coin comes in, and we'll have to talk

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
about how that value gets created, next.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
For Alice to transfer that coin, what she'll do is to create a message

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
that includes the coin, includes that she's transferring it to Bob,

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
and she'll sign that with her key.

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
So then she sends that to Bob.

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Bob can verify the signature.

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
For Bob to transfer the coin, he'll add transfer to Cathy to that

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
and then sign the whole thing with his private key.

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
And now Cathy would do the same thing--

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
take everything that Bob sent, add a transfer message to it,

24
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
and sign the whole thing with her private key.

25
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
And then she can transfer it on to Doug.

26
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
At every link in this chain--

27
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
as long as they have all the public keys they need--

28
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
can verify the entire history of transactions.

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
So Cathy can verify the signature of Bob--

30
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
open that up--

31
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
verify the signature of Alice inside it,

32
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
and verify that the original coin.

33
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
So this is a way to use public key cryptography

34
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
to keep track of an entire history of transactions.

35
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Does it provide enough to provide digital cash?

36
00:01:43,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So how many times can Bob spend the coin?
