00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:02,827
It's an interesting question
about finding people early on,

2
00:00:02,827 --> 00:00:04,774
especially those first
couple of key hires,

3
00:00:04,774 --> 00:00:07,850
which can give you a lot of anxiety
because you feel like you're betting

4
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:10,543
the whole company on those first,
especially the first one.

5
00:00:10,543 --> 00:00:14,081
But the first two or three, and people
will tell you that the first ten can

6
00:00:14,081 --> 00:00:17,260
make or break your company,
and it's absolutely true.

7
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:23,460
For me, what I usually did was find
fans of the product in the community.

8
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:27,140
Because typically, I wasn't looking for,

9
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:30,860
in the early days, technical skills
because I was able to do that work.

10
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:36,410
And super enthusiastic users that
loved the product were the best

11
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:37,700
people to bring in.

12
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:40,010
So I remember the first person,

13
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:43,110
I told you, I had trouble with
operations, it turned out somebody that

14
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:46,710
loved the product had been
an accountant in a previous life.

15
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:51,450
And so I brought him in, and
he sort of took over all that for me.

16
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:53,710
Oddly enough,
my second employer was my wife.

17
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:56,408
And she was amazing,
a little difficult to work with, but

18
00:00:56,408 --> 00:00:57,463
[LAUGH] did a great job.

19
00:00:57,463 --> 00:01:01,691
And but yeah, for me, it was actually
finding users of the product that had

20
00:01:01,691 --> 00:01:04,620
skills, so they were already passionate.

21
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:07,955
They were all excited, and
I've seen this model elsewhere.

22
00:01:07,955 --> 00:01:10,660
37 Signals talks about this too,
they find people that already

23
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:12,750
use the product,
they're really passionate about it.

24
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:16,255
They're active in the community,
helping people already in forums.

25
00:01:16,255 --> 00:01:19,800
But this is the best people because
they've already sort of self-selected,

26
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,450
based on their passion for the product.

27
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:24,104
In my experience, finding people that
are already passionate about your

28
00:01:24,104 --> 00:01:25,129
product, even just a tiny,

29
00:01:25,129 --> 00:01:27,840
you're going to have a tiny audience
at that point when it's just you.

30
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,260
But that's great,
that those people are super passionate.

31
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:31,500
They sought you out.

32
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,910
And so finding people with the skills
you need in that group has always really

33
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:38,150
worked well for me throughout my
sort of entrepreneurial career.
