1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,240
In each lesson, you'll build a specific piece of the festival

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,290
lab. So that you can understand the use case, Samantha and

3
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:09,050
Andy are going to take you to an actual music festival, so

4
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:12,470
that you can really understand the problem you're solving in that lesson.

5
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:15,368
>> As Andy and I guide you through building the app, I'll

6
00:00:15,368 --> 00:00:18,632
be teaching you and him how to actually build the app itself.

7
00:00:18,632 --> 00:00:20,963
>> And since I truly don't know anything about

8
00:00:20,963 --> 00:00:24,323
Salesforce I'll be playing the role of the student. Sam?

9
00:00:24,323 --> 00:00:24,323
>>

10
00:00:24,323 --> 00:00:24,723
[LAUGH]

11
00:00:24,723 --> 00:00:25,123
Yes.

12
00:00:25,123 --> 00:00:26,509
>> You are teaching me how to build the app.

13
00:00:26,509 --> 00:00:27,510
>> Right.

14
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:28,250
>> And I'm building the app.

15
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:28,676
>> Yep.

16
00:00:28,676 --> 00:00:29,474
>> And, Mario?

17
00:00:29,474 --> 00:00:30,643
>> Interrupting you.

18
00:00:30,643 --> 00:00:32,390
>> You're, thanks, Mario.

19
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:36,080
>> And I'll be interrupting the class every so often to give context about

20
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:37,590
what we're learning as well as to

21
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:39,930
explain some of the more difficult concepts. While

22
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:43,700
also asking you a lot of the questions like what was the first concert

23
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:46,320
you went to? Answering these questions is

24
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,840
really going to help to facilitate your learning.

25
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:49,728
>> So what was the first concert

26
00:00:49,728 --> 00:00:50,568
that you went to, Mario?

27
00:00:50,568 --> 00:00:52,333
>> Boston.

28
00:00:52,333 --> 00:00:52,840
>> Boston.

29
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:53,745
>> Green Day.

30
00:00:53,745 --> 00:00:55,520
>> Blink 182. What about you?
