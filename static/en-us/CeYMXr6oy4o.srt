1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:04,360
For this quiz, I want you to figure out which components are required for

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:05,510
AJAX requests.

3
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:08,870
But to answer this question, I want you to do some research on your own.

4
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:10,750
When it comes to learning a new language or

5
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:14,280
a new library, the documentation is really your best friend.

6
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:17,580
So for this exercise, I want you to take a look at the documentation linked in

7
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:20,550
the instructor notes, and then check off the minimum amount of

8
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:23,360
information that's required to make an AJAX request.
