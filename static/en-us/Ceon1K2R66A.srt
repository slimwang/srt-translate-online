Here's a chance for you to try out how
this works using a slightly bigger

2
00:00:04,163 --> 00:00:08,992
polynomial. So we have a polynomial of two
terms, as our first factor, multiplied by a

3
00:00:09,004 --> 00:00:13,744
polynomial of three terms, as our second
factor. So remember start with the 3x over

4
00:00:13,756 --> 00:00:18,521
here and multiply it by each of the three
terms in the second set of parentheses, and

5
00:00:18,533 --> 00:00:22,783
then, distribute the 1 to each of these. So
all we're really doing is using the

6
00:00:22,795 --> 00:00:26,893
distributor property first, only looking
at the 3x and then second, only looking at

7
00:00:26,905 --> 00:00:30,679
the 1. So, give it a try. If this is
difficult that makes perfect sense, this

8
00:00:30,691 --> 00:00:34,549
is a really tricky concept to grasp. We
will give you plenty of practice to make

9
00:00:34,324 --> 00:00:34,324
sure that you understand it.
