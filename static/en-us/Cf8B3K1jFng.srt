1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,030
So we just discussed the number of distribution channels available to a startup

2
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:13,010
and we talked about picking one but what's really interesting is the solution complexity

3
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:15,660
that each channel can handle.

4
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:21,550
That is system integrators are designed to handle complex systems.

5
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:29,500
And so therefore on the x-axis, we see increasing complexity of what each channel can actually have.

6
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:35,240
And what's the sales and marketing complexity of each sale on the y-axis?

7
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:41,550
So for example, system integrators are great for putting in defense systems

8
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:46,950
or telecom systems that require hundreds or thousands

9
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:50,120
of moving parts and software and hardware.

10
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:56,960
Where on the other extreme, the complexity of selling toner over the web. Incredibly simple.

11
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,180
Simply, consumers already know what they want

12
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:04,190
and the channel just simply is there to fulfill end-user demand.

13
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:09,270
And the marketing complexity, would simply just say toner for you printer.

14
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:15,160
So when we look at a sales channel, we talk about what's called value-added.

15
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:18,380
How much value is the channel adding?

16
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:24,420
And as we go up this curve, we're seeing higher value added at each step.

17
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:29,710
Web: Telesales, almost no value added. Retail maybe adds a little support.

18
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:35,540
VARs, a lot of integration and support. Direct sales, that's direct connection to your factory.

19
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:39,870
System integrators, not only supporting, servicing, and integrating your products

20
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:41,670
but potentially tens of others.

21
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:46,210
So each portion of this channel is adding higher and higher value.

22
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:50,810
Now what's interesting is this higher value added comes with a cost.

23
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:56,030
Typically, higher volume systems are at the low end.

24
00:01:56,030 --> 00:02:01,430
So you might be selling hundreds or hundreds of thousands of cases of toners,

25
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:05,610
but you might be doing ten large system integrations a year.

26
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:10,030
So more examples, retail channel might carry PCs.

27
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:14,910
VARs might do video editing systems that are turnkey.

28
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:17,420
For direct sales though, this is the anomaly.

29
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:20,660
Remember, these are the salespeople who work for you directly.

30
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:24,770
One of the interesting things that you'll be considering later is

31
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:30,380
how much you're paying your salespeople and how many dollars they need to be bringing in

32
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:35,700
every year to justify their existence and bringing a profit to their company.

33
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:38,310
So this ends up to be an interesting calculation.

34
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:43,200
Your direct sales people can actually be the one talking to the consumers directly

35
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,920
or they could be the ones selling to system integrators,

36
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:52,920
VARs, retail, and web and telesales people and so this is a math problem we'll think about

37
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:56,300
in the coming discussions.
