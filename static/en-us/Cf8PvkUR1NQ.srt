1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:05,344
These two alternative hypotheses are one-tailed tests. If our sample mean lies

2
00:00:05,344 --> 00:00:08,704
out here in the critical region, significantly higher than the current

3
00:00:08,704 --> 00:00:12,400
population mean, then we're guessing that the population parameter after the

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:18,241
intervention will be greater than the current. Similarly, if our sample mean

5
00:00:18,241 --> 00:00:22,230
lies in the critical region below the current population parameter, the

6
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:26,177
population parameter with the intervention will have a lower score than it does

7
00:00:26,177 --> 00:00:32,337
currently. And finally, if our sample mean lies in the critical region either

8
00:00:32,337 --> 00:00:36,692
higher or lower than the current population parameter, then we conclude that

9
00:00:36,692 --> 00:00:43,132
the new population will be significantly different. We choose a one-tailed, or

10
00:00:43,132 --> 00:00:46,914
directional hypothesis test when we predict a direction of the treatment

11
00:00:46,914 --> 00:00:52,206
effect. For example, when we predict that a song illustrating the concepts in

12
00:00:52,206 --> 00:00:57,322
this lesson, will increase or decrease engagement. Alternatively, we would

13
00:00:57,322 --> 00:01:01,402
choose a two-tailed, or non-directional hypothesis test, when we do not predict

14
00:01:01,402 --> 00:01:06,760
a direction of the treatment effect. In general we use two-tailed tests because

15
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:10,894
they are more conservative. We are less likely to reject the null when it's

16
00:01:10,894 --> 00:01:15,240
true. We'll get more into that later. But also because, as you saw before, we

17
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:19,463
might be wrong about the direction. We might predict that the treatment's going

18
00:01:19,463 --> 00:01:22,697
to increase engagement, when in fact it decreases engagement, in which case we

19
00:01:22,697 --> 00:01:27,140
should have a two-tailed test. If we just use the one-tailed test in the

20
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:30,500
positive direction, we may miss the fact that the treatment is doing the

21
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:35,615
opposite of what we would expect. One exception to this general rule is when

22
00:01:35,615 --> 00:01:40,262
we're comparing a new treatment with an established treatment. In such cases,

23
00:01:40,262 --> 00:01:44,487
we often only care if the new treatment is better than the old one. We don't

24
00:01:44,487 --> 00:01:48,579
care if the new one is much worse. So that's when we would use a one-tailed

25
00:01:48,579 --> 00:01:49,913
directional test.
