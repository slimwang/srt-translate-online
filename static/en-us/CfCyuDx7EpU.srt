This triangle has it's sides in a ratio of 7 to 24 to 25. Great thinking if you

2
00:00:06,774 --> 00:00:11,519
chose that ratio. We know that sense if we multiply this leg by 5 we would get

3
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:17,767
35. And if we multiply the hypotenuse of 25 by 5, we would get a hypotenuse of

4
00:00:17,767 --> 00:00:24,260
125. This means that 5 is the multiplier for our ratio, so to find the missing

5
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:30,106
leg, we simply simplify multiply 24 by 5. This gives us a side length of 120

6
00:00:30,106 --> 00:00:31,060
units.
