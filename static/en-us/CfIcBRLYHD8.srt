00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Welcome to the first problem of Unit 4. In this situation, we're going to pretend that we are fishermen.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
And we're interested in catching this red type of fish right here.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
However, whenever we try to catch the red fish we also end up catching

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
a bunch of these smaller green fish, as you can see from the contents of the net right here.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
What we're going to do in this problem is model logistic growth for both species of fish--

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
the red and the green with the constants and initial values

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
that we've already included in the supplied code.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Just a reference--I included a general equation from logistic growth right here.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
F is the population that we're looking at, r is the growth rate of the population,

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
and c is the carrying capacity of the surrounding environment.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Now, remember when we model the change in population for both types of fish,

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
we need to include both population growth, which is dictated by this equation,

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
but also the harvesting rate.

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
We've created this parameter called p to represent the fraction of the total fish that we catch

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
that are part of the green fish population, so we might also call this the fraction of the by-catch.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Just to start, we've inserted a value of 0.5 for p.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
What you're going to do is calculate the threshold value of p for fish 2 to not go extinct.

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
In other words, what is the highest possible value of p

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
that will allow for equilibrium situation in the population of fish 2?

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
After you've calculated the correct value of p, come down to the for loop

21
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
and use, as we've done so many times before, the forward Euler method.

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
You'll notice that we've already included a line for you to prevent the population

23
00:01:26,000 --> 99:59:59,999
of either type of fish from becoming negative--good luck.
