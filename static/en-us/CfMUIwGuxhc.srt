1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:04,110
Let's do an exercise on this
idea of a dual optimal solution.

2
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:10,360
Given that X, as shown here, is an
optimal solution to this linear program,

3
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:13,310
I want you to find
the dual optimal solution.

4
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:16,600
We'll let Y1 correspond to
this first constraint, and

5
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,330
Y2 correspond to the second.
