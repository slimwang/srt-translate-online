1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,180
So now I'm going to
show you a variety of

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:06,730
conditions where actually would allow us
to both increase the envelope and figure

3
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:11,750
out the best possible smooth paths to
the original red path here of a camera.

4
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:12,490
So, for example,

5
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:16,400
we can define various ways of defining
how big we want the envelope to be.

6
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:20,770
And, of course, in that condition's
based on different types of constraints

7
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:24,486
we can add, we can actually look
at different types of paths.

8
00:00:24,486 --> 00:00:28,331
We can actually have constant length
paths, linear paths, that actually now,

9
00:00:28,331 --> 00:00:31,800
if you notice, there's linear
connections on the blue line itself.

10
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,820
Parabolic ones, which start giving
it more curves, much more smoother.

11
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:38,950
And if you notice, these basically
are now allowing us to control

12
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:41,920
how we can actually figure
out both the envelope.

13
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,460
And this envel,
envelope defines, of course,

14
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:48,660
how big my crop window is going to
be and how smooth the path would be.

15
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:51,820
We actually did a lot of analysis in
this work to figure out some best paths,

16
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:53,700
and that's what we refer
to as the YouTube paths.

17
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:56,180
That's the one that's been widely
used in the system right now.
