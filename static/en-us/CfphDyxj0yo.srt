1
00:00:00,136 --> 00:00:03,788
So finally, we can talk about full camera parameters or

2
00:00:03,788 --> 00:00:05,973
camera and calibration matrix.

3
00:00:05,973 --> 00:00:09,326
The camera and its matrix M, and sometimes it's called pi, and

4
00:00:09,326 --> 00:00:13,748
that's what I've written here, as we know, is described by several parameters.

5
00:00:13,748 --> 00:00:18,185
It's got a translation T of the optical center from the origin of the world.

6
00:00:18,185 --> 00:00:21,655
We've got a rotation R of the coordinate system.

7
00:00:21,655 --> 00:00:24,792
We've got a focal length and aspect, f and a.

8
00:00:24,792 --> 00:00:28,963
Pixels or, or pixel size, sx sy.

9
00:00:28,963 --> 00:00:34,686
A principle point, that's the offset x, xc, yc or cx cy.

10
00:00:34,686 --> 00:00:36,370
And skew.

11
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:40,043
And in this slide, the blue parameters are called the extrinsics and

12
00:00:40,043 --> 00:00:41,575
the red are the intrinsics.

13
00:00:41,575 --> 00:00:44,486
And we can put the whole thing together,

14
00:00:44,486 --> 00:00:47,915
we want to find this as a sort of a single matrix.

15
00:00:47,915 --> 00:00:53,474
M is going to be built up of all of the effects of our parameters,

16
00:00:53,474 --> 00:00:56,090
and so that looks like this.

17
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:56,690
Okay?

18
00:00:56,690 --> 00:01:01,430
What is says is that M is a combination of translate,

19
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:04,465
this is extrinsic, and rotate.

20
00:01:04,465 --> 00:01:08,504
So now we have the point in the 3D camera coordinate system.

21
00:01:08,504 --> 00:01:12,582
Project, this is just the extraction of the xyz, and

22
00:01:12,582 --> 00:01:15,943
then you pump that through the intrinsics.

23
00:01:15,943 --> 00:01:18,345
And how many degrees of freedom are there here?

24
00:01:18,345 --> 00:01:19,647
Well, there are 11.

25
00:01:19,647 --> 00:01:24,685
Five for the intrinsics, three for the rotation, three for the translation.

26
00:01:24,685 --> 00:01:26,354
I'll get rid of all that scribble.

27
00:01:26,354 --> 00:01:31,470
That equation there, that M, that is the full camera calibration matrix.
