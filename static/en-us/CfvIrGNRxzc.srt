1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,850
While we're recording these, actually we thought it wasn't a very challenging example

2
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:10,430
and then we got it wrong about 4 times, but the correct answer here is that these three lines

3
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:13,300
take 11 time steps to execute.

4
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:19,270
The first line is free as in the first quiz and the second line is actually why we had

5
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:22,160
to count a few times until we all got it right.

6
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:27,870
This line here is executed 6 times--once for s=5

7
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:32,549
and then s is decreased by 1 each time this line down here is executed.

8
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:40,520
So, s starts out as 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 and 0, which means this line here is executed 6 times

9
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:46,320
whereas this line down here is only executed 5 times because once s is equal to 0

10
00:00:46,320 --> 99:59:59,999
this line here is not executed anymore, which makes for a total of 11 time steps.
