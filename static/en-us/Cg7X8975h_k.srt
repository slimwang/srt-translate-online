1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,525
Now you might have been tempted to write that our linear factor was x minus one

2
00:00:03,525 --> 00:00:08,825
half, since if we set this equal to 0 and solve for x we get one half. However

3
00:00:08,825 --> 00:00:13,831
I want an integer coefficient in constant terms here. This way we can transform

4
00:00:13,831 --> 00:00:18,623
our linear factor to be like that. Is by multiplying both sides by 2, since

5
00:00:18,623 --> 00:00:23,194
that's the denominator of our fraction here. If we do that, we end up with a

6
00:00:23,194 --> 00:00:27,958
linear factor instead of 2x minus 1. We can double check, and sure enough, the

7
00:00:27,958 --> 00:00:32,914
greatest common factor between 2 and negative 1, is 1. Perfect, this must be

8
00:00:32,914 --> 00:00:34,659
one of our linear factors.
