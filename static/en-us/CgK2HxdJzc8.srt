00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:04,687
[SOUND] Hi, I'm Lyla Fujiwara.

2
00:00:04,687 --> 00:00:06,623
I'm a course developer
here at Udacity and

3
00:00:06,623 --> 00:00:09,670
these are my thoughts
on crappy interviews.

4
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:12,470
So this is kind of funny
because interviews are like

5
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:14,360
a little bit the bane of my existence.

6
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:17,165
I'm sort of like, I've thought
about this story a little bit but

7
00:00:17,165 --> 00:00:20,486
I'm shaking a little bit right now just
because I'm being asked a question.

8
00:00:20,486 --> 00:00:25,210
In my senior year, a lot of people
were applying to go work in big

9
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:29,311
tech companies and
I was sort of thinking about it, but

10
00:00:29,311 --> 00:00:34,126
I wasn't quite sure what I wanted
to do with the rest of my life and

11
00:00:34,126 --> 00:00:37,780
sort of one of the things
in my mind was like well,

12
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:41,115
I have this very clear path for
what I can do.

13
00:00:41,115 --> 00:00:42,060
I'm going to have this degree.

14
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:44,890
It could probably get me into like
a really nice tech company and

15
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:48,080
I could just keep doing what I'm doing,
but at the time I was a little bit,

16
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:50,890
you know, just questioning
if that's what I wanted.

17
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:57,135
Anyways, I had TAed for this professor
who's actually a leader in graphics,

18
00:00:57,135 --> 00:01:02,490
the field of graphics and had been a TA
from one of his larger classes and

19
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:07,510
I think this is what got me on
sort of the short list for a list

20
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:11,222
of students that a large tech company
was particularly trying to recruit.

21
00:01:11,222 --> 00:01:16,575
So I got this invite and I kind of
like didn't respond for a while and

22
00:01:16,575 --> 00:01:21,082
I'm like whatever free trip
out to the West Coast.

23
00:01:21,082 --> 00:01:24,672
So I did it, I went there and
I got put in,

24
00:01:24,672 --> 00:01:29,761
it was either my first or
my second technical interview.

25
00:01:29,761 --> 00:01:33,996
And technical interviews are super
stressful [LAUGH] I feel like,

26
00:01:33,996 --> 00:01:37,260
partially just because there's so
exhausting.

27
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:40,645
They're ten hour ordeals, or
at least this one was, and

28
00:01:40,645 --> 00:01:43,500
you're being bused around and
meeting all the different teams.

29
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:48,646
And I remember early in the morning
of that interview, talking to

30
00:01:48,646 --> 00:01:53,470
a guy who was super friendly and I was
having a good conversation with him,

31
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:58,570
but we were talking about printer
drivers and in the back of my head while

32
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:02,630
I'm trying to answer questions from
this guy, I'm thinking, printer drivers.

33
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:06,182
That's the most boring thing
I can ever think of and

34
00:02:06,182 --> 00:02:10,351
I talked to some other people
during that interview experience.

35
00:02:10,351 --> 00:02:14,452
There's a part that I don't remember
quite how I flubbed it, but

36
00:02:14,452 --> 00:02:18,852
I was talking to a guy about how a web
page was put together with how it's

37
00:02:18,852 --> 00:02:23,402
actually parsed on a server and I had
no idea how that was actually done and

38
00:02:23,402 --> 00:02:26,860
he was getting kind of
frustrated with me or whatever.

39
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:35,550
But I got far along in the process, so
I was feeling pretty good of myself and

40
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:37,760
like, I just really breezed
through this interview.

41
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,830
Yeah sure, I messed up some things with
a seed graph, and a web server, or

42
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:43,350
something, but I'll be fine.

43
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:50,110
And about a week later,
I got a phone call saying,

44
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:53,420
which is probably fairly obvious to you,
that I didn't get the job and

45
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:56,251
I was kind of sitting there and
feeling really sorry for myself.

46
00:02:56,251 --> 00:03:02,990
But I think the thing
that I got out of it and

47
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:07,314
kind of what I want to convey
I guess to Udacity students is

48
00:03:07,314 --> 00:03:13,050
that I wasn't really supposed
to be at that interview.

49
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:18,950
That job wasn't something that I
was particularly interested in.

50
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:24,030
I didn't really take ownership for
the job application process.

51
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:29,909
And so actually what I did end up doing
was instead of going off and working

52
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:34,220
with a big tech company, I went into the
Peace Corps and I taught for two years.

53
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:37,330
And after coming back from the Peace
Corps in a similar thing, I say I should

54
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:40,560
apply to these large tech companies
who do the whole interview process.

55
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:45,080
But one of the things that I did
differently the second time around, was

56
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:50,381
in a dusty Kenyan market,
I bought this book called

57
00:03:50,381 --> 00:03:55,980
What Color Is Your Parachute, which is
a quintessential career guidance book.

58
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:59,190
And one of the sort of silly
things that it made me do was walk

59
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:03,130
through a series of exercises to learn
about what actually is important to you,

60
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:07,070
what you're interested in more than
just you what your skillset is or

61
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:08,940
what you happenned to
get your degree in.

62
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:15,937
And through doing that, I was a lot
better able to verbalize what I wanted.

63
00:04:15,937 --> 00:04:20,690
And as I was going through the job
search, I didn't apply to a lot of jobs

64
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:24,492
which on paper looked kind of good,
if I got hired there,

65
00:04:24,492 --> 00:04:28,610
it would be a good thing to brag
to my family and friends about or

66
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:32,994
whatever, but they weren't jobs
I was actually interested in.

67
00:04:32,994 --> 00:04:37,127
And the first job that I applied for was
Udacity and I read the job description,

68
00:04:37,127 --> 00:04:40,897
and I went this is perfect, this is
awesome and this is where I want to be.
