00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:00,910
Great.

2
00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:04,300
Now that we understand what
the fuse location provider is,

3
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:06,270
let's create a simple
application that uses it.

4
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:10,480
It's a very basic application that
contains a single text field.

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,970
When you run it,
your latitude is determined and

6
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:14,710
written into this text field.

7
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:17,390
If you don't already have
a development environment set up for

8
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:20,230
Android development,
check the videos linked below

9
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:23,210
from Developing Android Apps,
Android Fundamentals.

10
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:24,620
To get your environment set up for

11
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:28,430
location services, check back to
the intro lesson for this course.

12
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:29,530
Once you're good to go,

13
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:33,199
we can build your first
location-sensitive app together.
