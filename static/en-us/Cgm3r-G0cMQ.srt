Hi, and welcome to Introduction to Data Science. My name's

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:07,590
Dave, and I'll be the instructor for this course. I've

3
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:10,200
worked as a data scientist in Silicon Valley, most recently

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,590
at a small company called Yub and before that at

5
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:16,530
a company called TrialPay. I'm formally trained as a physicist,

6
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:18,970
and I originally became interested in data scientist because I

7
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:22,100
love the idea of improving the quality of people's lives

8
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:26,560
or. Building really cool products by using data and mathematics.

9
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,480
In this lesson, we'll discuss data science at a high level.

10
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:32,750
Together we'll find out what data science is and discuss what skills

11
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:36,260
are required to be a data scientist. We'll also hear from a

12
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:40,000
bunch of other data scientists about interesting projects they worked on. And

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,180
discuss how data science is being used to solve a bunch

14
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:45,440
of different problems. This lesson in particular is going to be a

15
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,910
little bit different than the others. We're not going to build as

16
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:51,680
much. I think it's important to understand data science at high level

17
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,940
before we dive into the details. Alright, well I'm really

18
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:56,970
excited about this course, so why don't we get started.
