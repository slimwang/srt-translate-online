1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
That one is tricky.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I'm going to answer it the following way--

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
21 is just halfway between 1800 and 2400.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
If you take halfway between $144,000 and $192,000,

5
00:00:15,000 --> 99:59:59,999
we get the mean of 144 and 192 thousand, and that is $168,000.
