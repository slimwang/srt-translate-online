1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:02,830
Okay. So we now come to the part where

2
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:06,090
we will create a new project for App Engine. You

3
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:09,180
create new projects using the developer console, which can be

4
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:12,630
accessed at this URL. This is a console that allows

5
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:15,420
you to configure many different Google services. But in

6
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:18,450
this course we will focus on the App Engine specific

7
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:22,620
parts. Go there and create a new project. We will

8
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:25,740
talk about installing the development environment a bit later on,

9
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:28,950
so don't worry about that right now. While creating

10
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:31,630
the project, you will be presented with the following dialog

11
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:35,360
box. Pay special attention to the project ID. The project

12
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,800
ID must be unique and it has certain naming restrictions.

13
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,150
Having a project ID you're happy with, though, can

14
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:44,630
be quite handy, since you can access your application through

15
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:48,893
a URL containing it. After you've created your project, this

16
00:00:48,893 --> 00:00:50,696
is the URL that you can use to access it.

17
00:00:50,696 --> 00:00:55,028
So in this example, the final URL will become

18
00:00:55,028 --> 00:01:01,312
http://apt-octagon-533.appspot.com. See, that's the

19
00:01:01,312 --> 00:01:06,990
project ID was this. So it's now time for you to go and create your new project.
