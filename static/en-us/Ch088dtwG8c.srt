To compute the average, you first need to compute the sum using the algorithm

2
00:00:04,848 --> 00:00:11,146
from lesson seven, we traverse all elements in the array. Ask each of it for

3
00:00:11,146 --> 00:00:16,422
its area and sum them all up. Then we return the sum over the count, which is

4
00:00:16,422 --> 00:00:22,120
the sum over the length of the array. And as you can see here, I was a little

5
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:26,945
nervous. What if someone gives me an array of length zero, then I don't want to

6
00:00:26,945 --> 00:00:31,922
divide by zero. So, I'm checking for that, and in the admittedly unlikely case

7
00:00:31,922 --> 00:00:39,346
that I do get an empty array, I return zero. When you run the program, It gives

8
00:00:39,346 --> 00:00:45,612
you an average area of about 75,000 square kilometers. That's actually not very

9
00:00:45,612 --> 00:00:51,158
large, it's a bit larger than West Virginia. Next, let's see how we can compute

10
00:00:51,158 --> 00:00:53,710
the average of another set of objects.
