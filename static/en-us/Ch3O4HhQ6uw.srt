1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:01,480
Here's the answer.

2
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:05,260
The minimum possible value is zero and
the maximum is 34.

3
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:08,683
The minimum is zero because there
might not be any intersection among

4
00:00:08,683 --> 00:00:10,990
the elements of the blobs.

5
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:14,770
For example, here are three blobs
that are in opposite corners of their

6
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:16,670
respective faces.

7
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:19,730
And although the perspective is totally
messed up hopefully you can kind of

8
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:20,430
believe that.

9
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:21,860
They don't intersect.

10
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:26,580
The maximum would occur under some best
case alignment of the three operands.

11
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:28,870
The Loomis Whitney theorem
gives us an upper bound.

12
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:31,820
If you take the square root
of the product and the sizes,

13
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:34,584
you'll get about 34.
