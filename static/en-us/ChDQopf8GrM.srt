1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
All right, so the two choices are that it is an NP and it is NP hard, so it NP complete--

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:16,000
4-colorability is NP complete, and the reasons are--well, so this one's true,

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
we can in fact quickly verify a certificate that list the color assignments.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,000
We actually did that in general already earlier in the unit, so yeah, 4-colorability is definitely an NP.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
It's not necessarily an NP because the number of colors is bigger. Well, no.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
The first argument is the correct one.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
It's not necessarily NP hard because having four colors to work with makes things easier.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
That is kind of true--four colors does give you a little bit more slack

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
and there's things that you can 4-color that you can't 3-color, but this argument

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
is less compelling than the next argument that says that it is NP hard.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
The reason for that is because the solution to 4 colorability solves 3 colorability.

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
So if you give me a graph and say--is this 3 colorable and to help you out,

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'll give you an algorithm for solving 4 colorability.

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
All I need to do is add a node to the graph, connect that node t every other node in the graph

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
that means that that new node is going to have to have a different color

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
than everything else in the graph.

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
And now you say--okay, is this graph 4 colorable and if it is 4 colorable,

18
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
then the color for this newly added node would be different from all the other ones,

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
so the rest of the graph has been 3 colored, so it actually solve 3 colorability,

20
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,000
and that's why knowing that 3 colorability is NP hard tells us 4 colorability is NP hard.

21
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
And, no no's. Since any graph that is 3 colorable is 4 colorable--that's true.

22
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
It doesn't make them equivalent because it would also have to go the other way,

23
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
every 4 colorable graph would also have to be 3 colorable and that's just not true.

24
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
So this is actually the proof that 4 colorability is NP complete.
