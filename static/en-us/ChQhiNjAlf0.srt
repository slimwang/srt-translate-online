You might have done some mental math or you might have shown all the work.

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:08,758
Either way, the final answer is negative 1, 0, and 1. First, I factor 6z out

3
00:00:08,758 --> 00:00:13,151
from both terms. This is the greatest common factor. Next, we factor this

4
00:00:13,151 --> 00:00:18,176
difference of two squares. You have a squared minus b squared. So I can write z

5
00:00:18,176 --> 00:00:24,075
plus 1 and Z minus 1. And we know the product of these factors equals 0. We set

6
00:00:24,075 --> 00:00:29,470
each of the factors equal to 0 and then we solve for z. So z could equal 0,

7
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:31,876
negative 1, or positive 1.
