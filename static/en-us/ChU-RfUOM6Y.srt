00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:05,580
You can think of a design study as an empirical scientific experiment. As such,

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:10,040
there are research questions, subjects of study, experimental conditions,

3
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:13,990
methods, tools, metrics, independent and dependent variables, data collection,

4
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:18,020
statistical analysis, and conclusions. As with a scientific experiment and

5
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:23,050
overall goal of a design study is repeatability. That is, someone else should be

6
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:27,430
able to take your study report, use it to recreate the study conditions, and

7
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:29,660
reach the same conclusions that you did.

8
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:32,610
It is one of the goals of this class that you'll learn the skills to produce and

9
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:34,820
present an industrial quality design study.
