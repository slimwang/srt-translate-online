00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The next question we had was about internationalization and localization.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
A lot of our students are all across the world. How do we support something on that scale?

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
It's actually not that hard. The hardest part is doing the translation.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
There's a package you can use called gettext,

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
and this is built into Python in most major languages.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Basically what you do is in your templates, you either put all of your strings in one place,

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
in one module, and in your templates, and in that module you--

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I think in Python, the function that we use looks like an underscore,

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
and you just put all your strings inside this underscore function.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Then you just have a separate file that's a database of all of the--for in our case,

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
English language strings to whatever language and then your website just kind of works.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Well, you'll basically say, "Here's the language I want to use,

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
and here is where I store all my translation files."

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
And then everything will just kind of translate on its own.

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Basically, Google for gettext Python,

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
and you will see a whole bunch of information.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
And we'll include some links on that in the office hours instructor comments

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
just to help you guys out. >>Great. Great. That's why he's here.
