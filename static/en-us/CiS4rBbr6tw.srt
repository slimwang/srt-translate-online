1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:02,910
We've done two things up to this point. We

2
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:06,740
created a variable called year_joined, based on the tenure variable,

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:10,990
and we converted year_joined, to the variable year_joined_bucket. A categorical

4
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:14,970
variable. That bin their users into different groups. Let's table

5
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:18,320
this new variable to see the distribution in each group.

6
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,340
Here we can see that we have our four bins

7
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:23,260
of users, depending on when they joined Facebook, and it

8
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:26,550
looks like two people have a value of NA. Let's

9
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:28,920
use this new year joined bucket variable to create a

10
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,370
line graph Like we did for gender at the start of

11
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:34,790
the lesson. As a reminder, here's the code that generated this

12
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:38,610
plot earlier. Also, notice how we compute the median friend count

13
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:42,080
for each age using the fun.wide parameter, and the summary for

14
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:45,550
the stat parameter. Using a similar code structure that we see

15
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:48,260
here. I want you to create a plot for friend count

16
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:51,590
versus age, so that each year join bucket has its own

17
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:54,170
line on the graph. In other words, each

18
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:56,480
bucket will be a color line that tracks the

19
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,330
median friend count across the age of users,

20
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:01,250
just as it did in this plot for genders.
