The last thing that we want to figure out is when Grant is going to break even

2
00:00:04,042 --> 00:00:08,502
from this investment in advertising. Remember that, the moment of break even is

3
00:00:08,502 --> 00:00:12,722
when profit is equal to zero. So please tell me how many days it's going to take

4
00:00:12,722 --> 00:00:13,830
for this to happen.
