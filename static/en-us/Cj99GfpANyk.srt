00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:04,460
While this entire course will cover many elements of an operating system, it

2
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:08,780
would be nice to have a simple illustration of what an operating system is like.

3
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:11,590
So, to give a visual metaphor using our toy theme,

4
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:16,100
we can say that an operating system is like a toy shop manager.

5
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:21,030
At a high level, how is a toy shop manager like an operating system?

6
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:25,880
First, a toy shop manager directs operational resources in the shop.

7
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:29,490
Second, a toy shop manager enforces working policies.

8
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:34,400
And finally, a toy shop manager mitigates the difficulty of complex tasks.

9
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:38,110
For instance, for any toy shop manager, they must be in charge of

10
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:42,690
their employees and direct their working efforts towards completing the work.

11
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:47,580
Additionally, a toy shop manager is responsible for scheduling, for allocating,

12
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:51,760
for distributing the resources in the shop, the parts and the tools, and for

13
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,130
determining which of the employees will work on which orders and

14
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:56,420
use which tools.

15
00:00:56,420 --> 00:01:00,130
Toy shop managers are also the ones that enforce working policies in

16
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:01,330
the toy shop.

17
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:05,120
This can be policies regarding fairness, safety, clean-up.

18
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:09,240
For instance, how workers working on two different orders have to

19
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:14,300
share one of the shared resources, shared parts and tools for instance.

20
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:17,510
Another example is policy regarding how to

21
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:23,470
clean up after yourselves once a worker is done with processing a toy order.

22
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:29,010
Finally, a toy shop manager helps mitigate the effects of complex tasks.

23
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:32,240
It does that by trying to make the overall operation of

24
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,930
the toy shop more optimized and more simple.

25
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:38,860
Without a manger, for instance, employers may not know how to

26
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:43,990
establish order among themselves, how to decide, how to handle the workload.

27
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:47,412
So the toy shop manager has to deal with this situation so

28
00:01:47,412 --> 00:01:50,800
as to avoid dealing with a much more complex task.

29
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,560
So, the question then is,

30
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:58,220
what parallels are there between a toy shop manager with an operating system?

31
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:01,255
Operating systems do direct operating resources.

32
00:02:01,255 --> 00:02:05,182
In particular, they control the use of the hardware, CPU,

33
00:02:05,182 --> 00:02:09,497
memory, peripheral devices such as disk, network cards, etc.

34
00:02:09,497 --> 00:02:14,170
And they decide how these resources with be allocated to applications.

35
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:18,700
Along those lines, operating systems actually enforce some policies.

36
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:22,680
This can include polices regarding how these resources are used, for

37
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:26,800
instance, to control fair access to the shared resources.

38
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,270
Or it can be even to impose certain limits to allocate maximum amount of

39
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:35,360
a certain resource that a particular application or process can use.

40
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,650
Examples of such limits are, for instance,

41
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:42,970
the number of open files that can be open per process, or some thresholds

42
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:48,130
that need to be passed in order for some memory management daemons to kick in.

43
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:51,620
There are numerous other examples of limiting resource usage.

44
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:57,660
And finally, the operating system helps with the difficulty of complex tasks.

45
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:02,090
And particularly important is that it simplifies the view of

46
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:05,980
the underlying hardware that's observed by the applications that

47
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:08,290
are running on that particular platform.

48
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:13,280
Instead, applications interact via system calls with the operating system, and

49
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,090
the operating system takes care of managing those difficult tasks for them.
