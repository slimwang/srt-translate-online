00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:04,670
To have a tessellated surface made of triangles look smooth, we introduce the

2
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:08,786
idea of a shading normal. For a tessellated sphere the geometric normal's for

3
00:00:08,786 --> 00:00:12,976
the triangles look like this. Each triangle has geometric normal's that are all

4
00:00:12,976 --> 00:00:17,473
the same along its surface. In other words the triangle's flat. So you get these

5
00:00:17,473 --> 00:00:22,536
discontinuities at the vertices. Instead of using geometric normals, we can

6
00:00:22,536 --> 00:00:26,866
store a shading normal at each vertex. These shading normals are created by the

7
00:00:26,866 --> 00:00:30,815
application in some way. Sometimes you can get this normal from the underlying

8
00:00:30,815 --> 00:00:34,138
surface. A sphere is a good example, as the normal at a point is always the

9
00:00:34,138 --> 00:00:38,750
direction from the sphere's center. However shading normal is entirely made up.

10
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:42,804
You can set it however you want. In fact, there are different ways of averaging

11
00:00:42,804 --> 00:00:46,801
the geometric normals of a triangle that share a vertex. None of these ways is

12
00:00:46,801 --> 00:00:50,140
perfect, but each has its own strengths and weaknesses, so there's no right

13
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:54,548
answer. Shading normals are different from geometric normals. If you're given a

14
00:00:54,548 --> 00:00:58,343
triangle, you can always get its geometric normal. That's a property that's

15
00:00:58,343 --> 00:01:00,633
derived from the triangle's points.
