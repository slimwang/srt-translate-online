1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,540
With the view transform in place, we now have all our coordinates in the

2
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:05,540
cameras frame of reference. What we now want to do is define a box in this

3
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:09,358
space to contain everything we're going to render. It's sort of like defining

4
00:00:09,358 --> 00:00:13,339
the size of a stage. As noted before, the orthographic camera's definition is

5
00:00:13,339 --> 00:00:17,890
to give a left, right, top, bottom, near, far set of values to define this box.

6
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:20,578
These six numbers define the corners of a rectangular box in the view space of

7
00:00:20,578 --> 00:00:24,390
your camera. The first time I explained it, we made a box and then oriented it

8
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:28,618
in space. What's happening as far as the matrices go is the reverse. We first

9
00:00:28,618 --> 00:00:32,009
orient the world to the camera's view of things. Then define our box with

10
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:35,296
respect to the camera. In practical terms we usually make the left and right

11
00:00:35,296 --> 00:00:39,066
the opposites, along with the top and bottom. The near value is often zero,

12
00:00:39,066 --> 00:00:42,503
though can be any number. The idea is that the view matrix moved everything in

13
00:00:42,503 --> 00:00:46,015
the world to be placed relative to the lens of our camera. Creating the

14
00:00:46,015 --> 00:00:50,022
orthographic camera itself, makes a projection matrix. The box defined by the

15
00:00:50,022 --> 00:00:52,882
projection matrix is then in front of the camera and symmetric around its view

16
00:00:52,882 --> 00:00:57,792
axis. This box called the view volume in fact performs a projection. We're not

17
00:00:57,792 --> 00:01:00,564
just defining a box, we're saying take everything in this box and project it

18
00:01:00,564 --> 00:01:04,804
onto the plus z side of the box and make an image. You may have been wondering

19
00:01:04,804 --> 00:01:07,660
why are we looking down the negative z angle axis. This is done because it

20
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:11,500
makes for a right handed coordinate system for the camera. The y direction is

21
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:15,536
up. X is to the right. Giving a Cartesian coordinate system for the image

22
00:01:15,536 --> 00:01:18,725
formed. To keep things right handed, the z axis must be pointing toward the

23
00:01:18,725 --> 00:01:23,482
viewer. Meaning we have to look down the negative z axis. That said, three j s

24
00:01:23,482 --> 00:01:27,700
thinks about the orthographic camera is going in a positive direction. So the

25
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:32,140
far value is specified as a distance along the negative z axis. Our chain of

26
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:35,706
matrixes adds this projection to the front. In other words, the projection is

27
00:01:35,706 --> 00:01:38,715
applied next. When applied, a coordinate will get a new value in this

28
00:01:38,715 --> 00:01:42,800
projection's frame of reference. This frame uses what are called Normalized

29
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:47,201
Device Coordinates or NDC for short. These NDC coordinates are in the range

30
00:01:47,201 --> 00:01:51,304
from -1 to 1 for X, Y, and Z. We'll talk more about this transform in a minute,

31
00:01:51,304 --> 00:01:53,988
but the point is, is that whatever is inside the box will have coordinates

32
00:01:53,988 --> 00:01:56,320
transformed to this new range.
