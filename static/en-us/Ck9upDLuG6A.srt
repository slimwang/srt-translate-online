00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:02,830
Now that you have a basic
understanding of authentication and

2
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:06,750
authorization, it's time to see
how OAuth 2 makes it all happen.

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:08,740
In this lesson, you're going to
learn about the different types of

4
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:12,000
OAuth implementations,
also known as OAuth flows.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,570
And then, you'll use one of these
flows to add security to an existing

00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:15,110
web application.
