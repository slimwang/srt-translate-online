1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:01,780
Copying that over.

2
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:05,360
Well, this is just matrix multiplication.

3
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:10,670
I hope you all know that a b bracket transpose is just b transpose a transpose.

4
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:13,070
If not, trust me, all right?

5
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:18,130
So I can regroup using the associative property here.

6
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:21,960
Such that here I have the transpose and

7
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,640
that's where this comes from, from, from that.

8
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:25,530
Okay.

9
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:31,036
And then what I can do is I can combine this whole thing,

10
00:00:31,036 --> 00:00:36,667
the K inverse intrinsics from the right transpose times

11
00:00:36,667 --> 00:00:41,479
Z times K inverse of the intrinsics on the left.

12
00:00:41,479 --> 00:00:45,170
Remember I don't know what they are but I just know that they exist.

13
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:48,510
And I'm going to call that whole thing F.

14
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:53,940
And when I do that I end up with this beautiful, beautiful, beautiful equation.

15
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:59,840
It just says that p transpose of the image point on the right,

16
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:04,690
'kay, so this is from the image now, times F

17
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:10,546
times p in the image on the left equals zero.

18
00:01:10,546 --> 00:01:11,440
Okay?

19
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:15,870
And this is a relationship between image points, which I can just write

20
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:20,920
this way a p transpose F p prime equals zero.

21
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:24,240
P being in one frame, p prime being in the other frame.

22
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,500
That is the fundamental matrix constraint.

23
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:32,580
That's what's going to allow us to solve for the relationship

24
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:36,850
between one view and another given enough points that correspond.

25
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:41,000
Enough p and p primes that correspond, we're going to be able to solve for F.

26
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,070
And once we do that we know what relates the two images, or

27
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:48,470
this can just be written as p transpose F p prime equals 0.

28
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:50,220
P in one frame,

29
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:54,079
p prime in the other frame it's the relationship between the points.

30
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:59,070
Now, with this equation, I'm going to be able to do a lot of things.

31
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:02,480
In a minute, I'm going to show you how we can solve for F.

32
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:05,670
That is, if you give me enough points p and

33
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:09,280
p prime that correspond, I'll be able to solve for F.

34
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,810
But the other thing is F is actually very powerful in terms of

35
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:17,360
describing how the epipolar geometry works.
