1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:04,290
Let's take a moment to meditate on the fact that this code, like many

2
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:09,670
class patterns in Java Script, has two distinct and very different sections.

3
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:12,840
This will be true of every pseudo classical, prototypal, and

4
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,330
functional shared class that you write.

5
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:18,920
One section, you will find specifying how all the instances of

6
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:20,910
a class should be similar.

7
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:23,000
In the case of the pseudo classical pattern,

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,700
these similarities are generally stored as properties of the prototype object.

9
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:31,030
In the other section, you'll be writing code that specifies how

10
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:34,780
each instance should be different from all the other instances.

11
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:38,960
As with most programming languages, this will take place inside the body of

12
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,060
the Constructor Function, and it'll allow us to specify how one instance of

13
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:46,370
the class will be different from another instance of the class.

14
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:49,280
All of the work that gets done to specify that Amy and

15
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,710
Ben have unique locations is done inside that Constructor Function.

16
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:57,920
For now, this is just an interesting observation about classes, but

17
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,640
knowing that these two categories of code exist for every class will

18
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:05,379
become very important later when we start to discuss subclassing.

19
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:07,600
Looking back at the functional version of this class for

20
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,860
a moment, it's also interesting to notice that functional classes without shared

21
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:14,060
methods make no such distinction.

22
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:18,000
In this style, all the code for both categories appears in one place.

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,240
The similarities and the differences across instances appear here,

24
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,030
indented two spaces inside the car function.

25
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:28,060
Depending on your perspective, you could call this an asset or

26
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:29,560
a failing of the functional pattern.
