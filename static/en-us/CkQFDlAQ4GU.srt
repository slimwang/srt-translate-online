00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,840
Consider a distributed bitonic merge
using a block distribution scheme.

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:06,280
How much time is needed for

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:10,420
communication, assuming
a hypercube with P processes?

4
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:13,420
I want you to type your
answers symbolically here.

5
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:16,490
You can assume that the problem
size n and P are both powers of 2,

6
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:19,460
and that P divides n, and furthermore,

7
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:23,770
let's assume our usual alpha-beta
cost model for messaging.

8
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:27,130
When you type your answer, use little
a for alpha and little b for beta.
