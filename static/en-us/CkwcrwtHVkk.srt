1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:02,800
So we just took a look at
the Unity documentation,

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:05,140
and you've seen how it's organized.

3
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:07,530
Now, it's time to test your knowledge.

4
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:09,910
&gt;&gt; So
we're going to think about namespaces.

5
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:11,778
Which of these statements is true?

6
00:00:11,778 --> 00:00:16,970
The Unity Engine namespace contains
the code that runs live in your VR app.

7
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:22,250
The Unity Engine namespace organizes
that code into a tree of functionality.

8
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:26,225
The Unity Editor namespace is
actually what you'll be using most

9
00:00:26,225 --> 00:00:27,968
when you're starting off.

10
00:00:27,968 --> 00:00:28,680
&gt;&gt; What do you think?
