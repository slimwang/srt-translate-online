1
00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:02,300
Imagine Jarred here.

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:04,980
He represents the client, and
he wants to make a request for

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:06,410
the Udacity homepage.

4
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:10,160
But to do so,
he has to make an http request.

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,656
The request itself can
get pretty complex.

6
00:00:12,656 --> 00:00:17,530
But all Jarred really needs to know is
the uniform resource locator or URL.

7
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:21,030
For Jarred, he writes the URL for
Udacity homepage.

8
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:24,820
Once he's written that request,
he places it on his desk to be handled.

9
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:27,610
This request gets picked up by Jason,
who then travels

10
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:31,530
over the network to Jessica because
she has the Udacity homepage.

11
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:33,970
Jessica represents the server.

12
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:37,470
Jessica analyzes the request to
make sure that it's valid, and

13
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:39,630
then she looks for the Udacity homepage.

14
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:43,100
If she can't find it, she'll send
an error code back to Jarred.

15
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:46,020
But as we can see,
Jessica's found the resource, and

16
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:48,490
she prepares it to be
sent back to Jarred.

17
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:52,810
She gives the response to Jason,
who then carries it back to Jarred.

18
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:55,540
Finally, once Jason's
brought the response back,

19
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:58,080
the http request is finished.

20
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:01,480
This specific example
is an http get request.

21
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:05,730
And we'll learn about the other types
of requests later, also called methods.

22
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:09,150
Of course, there are many complexities
that I'm not mentioning right now.

23
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:11,960
But all you really need to
remember is to send and

24
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:17,200
receive data via http,
a client makes a request to a server.

25
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,100
If you'd like to take
a deeper look into http,

http in the instructor notes.
