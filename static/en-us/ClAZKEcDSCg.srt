1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,310
So great,
you've now created your application.

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:04,860
So the next thing to do
is to edit your layout.

3
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:08,685
To do this, you're going to use
a StreetViewPanoramaFragment.

4
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:14,580
You can add a StreetViewPanoramaFragment
to your layout.xml simply like this.

5
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:17,385
You create a new fragment,
and you give it this name,

6
00:00:17,385 --> 00:00:23,470
com.google.android.gms.maps.StreetViewP-
anoramaFragment.

7
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:27,510
Now over time this name may change
because of refactoring of the code, so

8
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:30,375
if this doesn't work for you,
just check the latest documentation for,

9
00:00:30,375 --> 00:00:34,300
StreetViewPanoramaFragment, to
see the package that it's in.

10
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,990
Once you've done that,
in the standard way, you give it a name.

11
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:39,010
I've just called it streetViewPanorama.

12
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:40,580
And you give it a width and a height.

13
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:43,340
And for this application,
I just matched the parent to them.

14
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:48,270
So go ahead and edit your layout.xml
now to add this fragment to it.
