1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:01,580
So how would you use generate and

2
00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:04,200
test to actually solve
Raven's Progressive Matrices?

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,780
We've talked about this
a little bit already, but

4
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:08,490
take it a little bit further and talk
about how you would actually implement

5
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:10,640
the problem solving
approach you've seen today.

6
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:12,510
We talked about a couple
different ways of going about it.

7
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:14,480
We talked about generating
multiple answers and

8
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,250
testing them against the answer options.

9
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:17,570
Or generating one answer and

10
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:20,820
testing it more intelligently against
the different options available to you.

11
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,160
So talk about which one you would do and
how you would actually implement it.

12
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,090
In doing so, make sure to think of
three by three problems as well.

13
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:29,560
With more transformations and
more figures going on,

14
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:31,570
it can be a lot more difficult
to figure out what to generate,

15
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:34,700
and the problem space can
explode very quickly.

16
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:37,560
Also make sure to think about how you're
actually going to infer the mapping

17
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,310
between different
figures in the problem.

18
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:42,100
How do you know which shape in
one frame maps up to a different

19
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:42,870
shape in another frame?

20
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:45,620
And then talk about how you
would use that information

21
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:47,230
to generate what you
think the answer is.
