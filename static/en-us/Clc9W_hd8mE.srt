00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Our second guest is Tina Eliassi-Rad, a computer science professor

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
at Rutger's University.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
She studies data mining and machine learning with a special emphasis

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
on the data that comes up in network science.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
There's been an explosion in interest in studying networks and network science.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
If you could comment a little bit about where Big Data is coming from.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
[Tina Eliassi-Rad, Associate Professers, Rutgers University] Big Data is being generated by us.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
We go on Twitter and we tweet away.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
We go on Facebook, and we post photos and we post status updates.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
That's actually where a lot of the Big Data nowadays is coming from.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Also, the other aspects, if you think about healthcare--

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
all the MRI imaging and all these other kinds of tasks that now are done with computers,

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
that's where Big Data is coming from.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
In particular, because the idea is that if you analyze the data,

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
that data will tell you something about your customers

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
and then you can better serve your customers and then your profits will go higher.
