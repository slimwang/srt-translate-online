00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,164
So for this quiz I want to see if you understand the difference between static

2
00:00:03,164 --> 00:00:07,039
and dynamic typing. For each property listing below you should select which type

3
00:00:07,039 --> 00:00:11,110
of language whether it's statically type language or a dynamically type language

4
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:14,998
is typically more likely to have that property. Here are the properties it

5
00:00:14,998 --> 00:00:19,820
requires less code for the same amount of computation. Check whether you think

6
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:23,541
it's more likely for a statically type language to require less code, or a

7
00:00:23,541 --> 00:00:27,696
dynamically type language. It's less likely for programs to crash when they are

8
00:00:27,696 --> 00:00:31,082
running. It's more fun to program in. This is certainly a little subjective.

9
00:00:31,082 --> 00:00:36,180
Programs should execute faster, and it would be a better choice for programming

10
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:40,300
avionics flight control software for a new fighter jet. This is a bit

11
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:43,692
subjective, and might require a little bit of speculation on your part, but I

12
00:00:43,692 --> 00:00:47,137
think if you think carefully about the difference between static and dynamic

13
00:00:47,137 --> 00:00:50,423
type checking, you'll be able to answer correctly, or at least get the same

14
00:00:50,423 --> 00:00:51,453
answer that I will.
