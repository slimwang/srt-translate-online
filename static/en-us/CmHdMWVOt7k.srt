1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,250
Let's see what the correct answers are.

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:05,840
So which of the following are not a responsibility of the scheduler?

3
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:12,320
First, the scheduler has no control over when I/O operations occur.

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,860
So clearly the first choice should be marked.

5
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:17,100
One exception are the timer interrupts.

6
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:22,660
Depending on the scheduling algorithm, the scheduler chooses when a process

7
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:27,740
will be interrupted, so when it will context switch, so clearly it has

8
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:33,500
some influence over when events based on the timer interrupt will be generated.

9
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,370
This also answers the third question.

10
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:38,530
It is the scheduler, based on the scheduling algorithm,

11
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:41,290
that decides when a process should be context switched, so

12
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:45,170
this clearly is responsibility of the scheduler.

13
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:49,510
Similarly, it is the scheduler that's in charge of maintaining the ready queue.

14
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:53,810
It is the one that decides which one of the processes in the ready queue will be

15
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:55,940
scheduled to execute next.

16
00:00:55,940 --> 00:01:01,030
And finally, the scheduler really has no control over when external events can

17
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:04,950
be generated, other than the timer interrupt as we discussed.

18
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:09,300
So it has no control over events that a process may be waiting on.

19
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:11,050
So this choice should be marked as well.
