1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,630
Okay, so we've talked about
bag insert and bag union.

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:06,090
But what about bag splitting?

3
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:09,600
Remember, we need bag splitting because
we want to implement efficient divide

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,960
and conquer style algorithms very often.

5
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:14,354
So how do we do it?

6
00:00:14,354 --> 00:00:15,724
Just to see if you
were paying attention.

7
00:00:15,724 --> 00:00:19,566
Even before I show you how to do it,
I want you to answer the question of

8
00:00:19,566 --> 00:00:22,030
what's the running
time of bag splitting?

9
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:25,080
And again to be a little
bit more precise,

10
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:30,290
a bag split means breaking it
up into two roughly equal parts.

11
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:33,225
Your answer choices are constant time,
log time,

12
00:00:33,225 --> 00:00:37,470
n time, linear time I mean,
or n log n time.

13
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:37,970
Choose one.
