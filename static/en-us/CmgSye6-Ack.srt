We saw earlier how scaling and then rotating is often the most convenient order.

2
00:00:05,298 --> 00:00:10,412
With our snow man the arms were positioned by rotating then translating. Here's

3
00:00:10,412 --> 00:00:14,368
the stick without any transform on it. I made the snowman transparent and

4
00:00:14,368 --> 00:00:18,268
removed the ground plains so we can see the stick's position. It's actually

5
00:00:18,268 --> 00:00:22,131
inside the snowman halfway through the ground. Whenever you create most

6
00:00:22,131 --> 00:00:26,562
geometric objects in 3JS, the object is centered around the origin. The rotation

7
00:00:26,562 --> 00:00:31,668
along the x axis put the stick into its proper orientation. Then the translation

8
00:00:31,668 --> 00:00:35,168
moved it upward in world coordinates to the proper location. Let's see what

9
00:00:35,168 --> 00:00:38,693
would happen if we first translated then rotated. First we move the stick

10
00:00:38,693 --> 00:00:42,789
upwards 50 units. The center of the stick is now in place in the middle of the

11
00:00:42,789 --> 00:00:46,724
body. So far so good. Now if we rotate the stick after positioning it, we

12
00:00:46,724 --> 00:00:50,826
suddenly see it lying on the ground. What happened? The problem is that the

13
00:00:50,826 --> 00:00:55,622
rotation takes place with respect to the origin. In the first step we moved our

14
00:00:55,622 --> 00:00:59,680
stick up above the origin. In the second we rotated the stick but it rotated

15
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:04,513
around the origin. Let's watch this disaster in slow motion. The stick starts

16
00:01:04,513 --> 00:01:09,579
centered at the origin. We move it upwards 50 units, now it's center is at the

17
00:01:09,579 --> 00:01:13,859
right height. However, when we then apply a rotation, the object rotates around

18
00:01:13,859 --> 00:01:17,853
the origin, down here, instead of rotating around its center. Finishing the 90

19
00:01:17,853 --> 00:01:22,482
degree rotation, the sticks landed on the ground. Another way to think about it

20
00:01:22,482 --> 00:01:27,570
is that translating an object moves its center. You're moving the object up.

21
00:01:27,571 --> 00:01:31,480
Relative to the stick, you're moving the point it will rotate around down. We've

22
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:35,815
established that scaling before rotating is usually what we want. And rotating

23
00:01:35,815 --> 00:01:40,040
before translating is also generally more useful. This is why 3JS uses this

24
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:45,273
order, scale, rotate, translate when dealing with a single object.
