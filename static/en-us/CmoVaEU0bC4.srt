00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:04,428
Growing bigger brains definitely has its costs, including the need for more

2
00:00:04,428 --> 00:00:10,769
food or energy to handle all the extra brain activity. Additionally, bigger

3
00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:17,301
brains mean bigger heads, making childbirth far more painful. In humans, this

4
00:00:17,301 --> 00:00:20,949
resulted in human beings, being born earlier before the head is so big that it

5
00:00:20,949 --> 00:00:25,985
can't pass through the birth canal. Now of course there are benefits to having

6
00:00:25,985 --> 00:00:29,690
a big brain like the ability to store more complex information and the ability

7
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:35,337
to think critically. Okay, let's go talk more to Greg about how our brains

8
00:00:35,337 --> 00:00:36,799
evolved.
