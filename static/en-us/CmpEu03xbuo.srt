There are several possible
interpretations of what foo does.

2
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:05,990
Here are two things I might have said.

3
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:08,300
One is that it reverses the list.

4
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:13,735
The second is that it computes
an array P such that the collection V,

5
00:00:13,735 --> 00:00:16,395
N, and P is now a doubly linked list.

6
00:00:17,405 --> 00:00:19,895
You can see that it iterates
over the next pointers.

7
00:00:20,935 --> 00:00:25,265
For each next pointer, it sets
the next pointer's P value to itself.
