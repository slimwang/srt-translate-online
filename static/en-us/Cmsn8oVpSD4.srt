00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,690
Let us look at analogical retrieval more closely. Once again,

2
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:07,532
we have come across this idea earlier. We did analogical retrieval in

3
00:00:07,532 --> 00:00:11,930
recording cases by the k nearest neighbor method. We did analogical retrieval on

4
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:15,300
a case based reasoning using two different methods, the array method and

5
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:19,570
the discrimination tree method. Here the criteria for evaluating similarity were

6
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:24,340
very clear, as we discussed earlier. [UNKNOWN] distance, same tags,

7
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:28,190
as well as placement in this discrimination tree. The question now becomes,

8
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:31,940
what criteria should be used to decide on the similarity between the target

9
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:36,240
problem and the source case, given that they come from different domains?

10
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:39,748
On surface, there seems to be little similar between the two. None of

11
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:43,740
the objects are similar. None of the values of features are similar. Yet,

12
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:48,390
there is a deep similarity there. We can distinguish now between superficial

13
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:53,370
similarity between two situations and deep similarity between two situations.

14
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:57,590
Superficial similarity deals with features of objects or counts of objects or

15
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:02,710
objects themselves. Deep similarity deals with relationships between objects, or

16
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:07,052
sometimes relationships between relationships. Examples of this arise from

17
00:01:07,052 --> 00:01:10,850
the variables test with which you are already familiar. Features here refer to

18
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:14,690
the size of the square, the size of the circle, or perhaps where there is

19
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:20,230
a hollow square, or a solid dot. The count refers to the number of squares,

20
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:24,900
or number of circles, in a particular image. Objects here refer to circles and

21
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:28,250
squares and dots. Let us look at relationship between objects.

22
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:30,789
Two situations are said to be deeply similar,

23
00:01:30,789 --> 00:01:36,170
if the relationship between the objects is similar. As an example, a and

24
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:41,510
b are similar, in that, that the dot is outside the circle here and

25
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:45,250
the square is outside the circle here. A and

26
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:50,710
b are also similar in that the dot is above the circle here and the square is

27
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:55,520
above the circle here. What about relationships between relationships?

28
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:01,140
Let us compare a and b. In going from A to B, the dot has disappeared, and

29
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:06,270
a square has come outside the circle, and become bigger. Now we can compare this

30
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:10,310
relationship between a and b, with some of the relationship between a c and

31
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:14,250
a b, in which too, some object might be disappearing, and

32
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:17,590
another object which may be in the center of the circle comes out of the circle.

33
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:20,600
I'm sure you've come across problems like that on the variable test.

34
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:25,260
This is an example of a binary relationship, a relationship between two objects.

35
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:30,120
This is an example of a higher order relationship, a tertiary relationship if

36
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,730
you wish. This is a relationship between the relationship between objects.

37
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:38,470
You might even say that these are examples of unary relationships.

38
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:41,319
These are just examples of objects and their features and

39
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:46,231
counts. In general, as we go from unary relationships to binary relationships to

40
00:02:46,231 --> 00:02:50,129
tertiary relationships to even higher order relationships, the similarity

41
00:02:50,129 --> 00:02:54,320
becomes deeper and deeper. This means that mind decides two situations to

42
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:58,900
be more similar if the similarity is at the level of relationship between

43
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:02,820
objects rather simply at the level of objects or features or counts and objects.
