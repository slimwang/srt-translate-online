1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,500
So, welcome to
the Android Basics Data Storage course.

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:05,170
Right now, we're at a pet shelter, and

3
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:07,240
we'll get to exactly why
we're here in a moment.

4
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:09,570
>> The most important thing is
that this is the last course of

5
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:11,980
the Android Basics Nanodegree,
so you're almost done.

6
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:15,645
>> And so far you've built a lot
of different apps along the way.

7
00:00:15,645 --> 00:00:19,175
You have your birthday card app,
one for ordering coffee, another for

8
00:00:19,175 --> 00:00:21,975
learning languages, and even one for
fetching data from the internet,

9
00:00:21,975 --> 00:00:23,455
such as earthquake information.

10
00:00:23,455 --> 00:00:27,035
>> Yeah, and you're probably anxious now
to go off and build your own app, but

11
00:00:27,035 --> 00:00:28,975
some of you might not
have a specific idea.

12
00:00:30,015 --> 00:00:32,865
A really good way to practice would
be to ask a local small business or

13
00:00:32,865 --> 00:00:35,755
a non-profit if they need any help
with building an Android app.

14
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:40,020
>> So, a lot of small businesses in the
neighbourhood have information they need

15
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:41,440
to provide to customers.

16
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,550
For example, restaurants have menus and
dry cleaners and

17
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:47,450
tailors have a list of
services that they offer.

18
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:50,110
>> And even more likely will need
to store all this data somewhere,

19
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:54,200
like in an app, so that way we can
access it at any time from our pocket.

20
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,600
This app could be used by
customers like you and

21
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,440
me, or it could be used
internally within the business to

22
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:03,020
manage like the day to day operations,
or you can track inventory.

23
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:06,400
>> Exactly, and one example that we're
going to explore is the idea of using

24
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,004
a mobile app for the staff to keep track
of all the different pets in this local

25
00:01:10,004 --> 00:01:13,280
shelter, and
that leads us to exactly why we're here.

26
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,035
>> Besides the fact that Jessica and
I also wanted to pet furry animals.

27
00:01:16,035 --> 00:01:19,910
[LAUGH] We're at the Humane Society
Silicon Valley in Milpitas, California,

28
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:24,000
so we can chat with a staff member about
what the day-to-day operations are like.

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,770
>> So, let's go ahead and meet with
Jessica, the Supervisor of Adoptions

30
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:29,940
here, to learn more about the data they
collect and how they keep track of it.
