1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,885
To help us understand kind of how to
do this analysis of camera motion,

2
00:00:03,885 --> 00:00:06,015
let's look at some of the motion models.

3
00:00:06,015 --> 00:00:08,703
Now this will remind you
of the stuff that we looked

4
00:00:08,703 --> 00:00:12,799
at in one of the previous lectures about
image transformations where we were

5
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:16,648
trying to model how an image would be
transformed from one to the other.

6
00:00:16,648 --> 00:00:20,150
Now, all of a sudden, this should start
making sense in the context of how we

7
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:21,259
can do this with video.

8
00:00:21,259 --> 00:00:24,510
So here, for example is a video
that we are interested in.

9
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:27,205
What we are interested
now in is finding,

10
00:00:27,205 --> 00:00:30,677
in this image by these point
moving around like this.

11
00:00:30,677 --> 00:00:35,282
What's the best possible camera
motion in terms of a variety

12
00:00:35,282 --> 00:00:37,097
of degrees of freedom.

13
00:00:37,097 --> 00:00:37,821
And of course,

14
00:00:37,821 --> 00:00:41,128
we want to be able to model the least
number of these degrees of freedom.

15
00:00:41,128 --> 00:00:44,122
Remember, the degrees of freedom when
we talked about image transformation?

16
00:00:44,122 --> 00:00:46,821
Well, the image transformation
is here is from one frame

17
00:00:46,821 --> 00:00:48,452
to the other in the video volume and

18
00:00:48,452 --> 00:00:51,897
we're now interested in finding out
what those degrees of freedom are.

19
00:00:51,897 --> 00:00:56,106
Let's start off with of course,
the simplest one, translation.

20
00:00:56,106 --> 00:00:59,707
So here, of course, we basically
are looking for a translation where

21
00:00:59,707 --> 00:01:02,830
the frame is just moving from one
print to the other in x and y.

22
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:05,843
If we just did this,
this is a two degree of freedom.

23
00:01:05,843 --> 00:01:09,086
And here, you basically see the example
that I've just modeled the two degree

24
00:01:09,086 --> 00:01:09,637
of freedom.

25
00:01:09,637 --> 00:01:13,400
And if I was to show you the result of
how the stabilized crop window would

26
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,608
look like,
that would be on the top here.

27
00:01:15,608 --> 00:01:18,325
And you see it,
it has a little bit of wobble still.

28
00:01:18,325 --> 00:01:23,481
Which suggests that just by doing
a two degree of freedom transformation

29
00:01:23,481 --> 00:01:27,970
between frames here is not going to
result in a very stable video.

30
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:31,081
You can see the jerkiness in
the middle of the video here, right?

31
00:01:31,081 --> 00:01:34,772
Of course, we have learned that when
we can't actually model it with just

32
00:01:34,772 --> 00:01:38,461
the translation x and y, we can also
start thinking of adding rotation and

33
00:01:38,461 --> 00:01:40,204
perhaps scale into the equation.

34
00:01:40,204 --> 00:01:41,255
So let's do that.

35
00:01:41,255 --> 00:01:43,762
Of course,
we can look at translation in x and y.

36
00:01:43,762 --> 00:01:48,742
But also let's add uniform scale,
scale in both x and y and rotation.

37
00:01:48,742 --> 00:01:53,711
Of course, we know very well that, that
is basically a four degree of freedom,

38
00:01:53,711 --> 00:01:56,541
where now we have a theta x and
y and the scale.

39
00:01:56,541 --> 00:01:58,602
It's a uniform scale, so
it's the same in both.

40
00:01:58,602 --> 00:02:02,013
That basically suggest that now my crop
window can rotate a little bit, but

41
00:02:02,013 --> 00:02:04,246
also can get bigger and
smaller a little bit too.

42
00:02:04,246 --> 00:02:07,618
And that actually results
in this solution here.

43
00:02:07,618 --> 00:02:08,830
Good.

44
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:13,199
It's not very shaky, but
still has a lot of little, you know,

45
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:15,604
wobble in the middle of the image.

46
00:02:15,604 --> 00:02:17,287
You can see this part shaking around.

47
00:02:17,287 --> 00:02:20,033
Of course, let's move to homography.

48
00:02:20,033 --> 00:02:23,023
We did all of this kind of stuff
when we talked about image

49
00:02:23,023 --> 00:02:24,460
transformations again.

50
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:27,531
In this case, we want to be able
to translate the image from one

51
00:02:27,531 --> 00:02:30,059
frame to the other in an x and
y rotating scale, but

52
00:02:30,059 --> 00:02:32,908
let's now add perspective and
skew to the whole thing.

53
00:02:32,908 --> 00:02:36,618
That basically now means is now we
have an eight degree of freedom model.

54
00:02:36,618 --> 00:02:38,981
We remember that from
our early lectures.

55
00:02:38,981 --> 00:02:42,874
And now, I basically have a crop
window that can also have a shear and

56
00:02:42,874 --> 00:02:46,905
perspective whole thing going on,
in addition to the translation and

57
00:02:46,905 --> 00:02:48,837
rotation and this is the output.

58
00:02:48,837 --> 00:02:51,078
So, if you notice this
looks much stable.

59
00:02:51,078 --> 00:02:55,376
In essence, we're basically what we
have done is now gone through the steps

60
00:02:55,376 --> 00:02:59,471
of identifying the camera path by
looking at these degrees of freedom for

61
00:02:59,471 --> 00:03:02,043
this rectangular region,
the crop window.

62
00:03:02,043 --> 00:03:04,915
And if I can figure out those,
those degrees of freedom are,

63
00:03:04,915 --> 00:03:07,066
I can actually start
generating a new video.

64
00:03:07,066 --> 00:03:09,140
Just showing you the small region here,

65
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:12,445
which is basically moving around
in the larger viewpoint here.

66
00:03:12,445 --> 00:03:16,347
And remember, we are cropping the image,
but of course, in this case,

67
00:03:16,347 --> 00:03:19,000
we're getting something
nice in the output there.
