1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:04,700
Wow, this page looks oddly similar
to a certain website's catalog.

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:08,109
I wonder, anyway, here's what I picked.

3
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:10,410
For the top most element,
you could have chose header,

4
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:13,680
but I think the most
appropriate answer is nav.

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:17,200
If this entire area was selected
with the navigation links and

6
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:20,360
the company name,
then header might have made more sense.

7
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:24,020
Headers have navigation elements and
heading elements, but

8
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:27,250
because Company Name wasn't
part of the selected area and

9
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:31,640
these elements are navigation links,
the is the best answer.

10
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,850
For the next one, I chose artical.

11
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:38,210
Now you could have used section here,
but section seems a little too generic

12
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:41,340
when you consider MDN's definition for
an article.

13
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:43,510
An article is self-contained and

14
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:46,530
intended to be independently
distributable.

15
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:49,716
It also says that an article
should be identified, typically,

16
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:52,671
by including a heading,
which leads me to my third answer.

17
00:00:52,671 --> 00:00:56,468
I chose an h3 tag, but really,
you could have used any heading here.

18
00:00:56,468 --> 00:01:00,080
One thing to keep in mind is that your
headings should go from biggest to

19
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,040
smallest.

20
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:04,590
So, your h1 is the biggest,
then h2, and so on.

21
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:09,270
For me, I would have used an h1 on
the text logo and maybe an h2 for

22
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:13,170
the profile name in the sidebar,
so h3 sseemed like a good option.

23
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:17,480
Next, at the bottom of the page,
I chose a footer.

24
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:21,330
Again, you could have used section here,
but would be more appropriate

25
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:24,350
because this area signifies
the end of the page and

26
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:26,130
contains copyright information.

27
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:27,311
So, footer it is.

28
00:01:27,311 --> 00:01:31,678
To the left of the page, the aside
element makes the most sense, and

29
00:01:31,678 --> 00:01:34,984
is often represented
by sidebar or insert.

30
00:01:34,984 --> 00:01:37,791
This side bar, which looks to
contain a profile picture and

31
00:01:37,791 --> 00:01:41,380
some additional information,
definitely fits the bill.

32
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:44,760
Last, I used the img tag for
the lessons image.

33
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:47,560
This one was sort of given
away by the thumbnail icon,

34
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:52,180
but you could of inserted another type
of multimedia like video or picture.

35
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:54,350
We haven't really touched
much on these yet, but

36
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:57,260
as you start looking at more advanced
topics, they will pop up more.
