1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Well, here's one way to do it.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:09,000
In state 2, I could put another edge for a - z,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:19,000
and now if there's a new input, like abc1, we would start here, a, b, c, 1, and accept.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
However, there's an alternative answer where we add this edge to state 1,

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
still labeled a - z.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Now if we see the abc1, it's a, b, c, 1.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Both of these approaches work, and you'll just have to decide which one you like more.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
This is an instance of creativity.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Typically in computer science, we prefer the green solution

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
because the red solution is a little ambiguous.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Here in state 1, we have 2 edges going out of state 1, both labeled a - z.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
That could get a bit confusing.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
By contrast in the green solution--solution going off of state 2,

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
we don't see as much.

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
We can either transition here on 0 - 9 or transition on a - z,

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,327
but we have to always know just what to do.
