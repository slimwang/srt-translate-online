1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,500
So how do we identify who
the owner in the group are?

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:05,230
If we look back at our
directory listing,

3
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:08,480
we'll see two columns,
here in the middle.

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,680
Most of the entries read
student student, but

5
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:14,160
there's one here that reads root root,
and I'll come back to that one.

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,110
These two columns identify the owner and
the group for each entry in this list.

7
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:22,520
Now it's important to remember, although
each of these has the same word,

8
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:25,100
student, listed in the two columns,

9
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:28,070
they're in two entirely
different things.

10
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:31,880
The system has a username student,
which is the owner of the file.

11
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:33,260
And a group name student,

12
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:35,728
which was automatically created
when we made this user.

13
00:00:35,728 --> 00:00:39,330
This is pre-common practice
on a Linux system,

14
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:41,910
to have a group name
the same as the user.

15
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:45,090
Just remember that they are two
entirely different things.

16
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:47,980
So, what's up with this entry
here that has root root?

17
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:52,800
We can see that the entry's name is ..,
and that's just a shortcut for

18
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,390
the parent directory.

19
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:56,385
And we know we're in our
student's home directory.

20
00:00:56,385 --> 00:01:00,730
So this entry here,
is the equivalent of /home.

21
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:05,010
That directory is owned by the root
user, and has a group of root.

22
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:06,350
And if we look at the permissions,

23
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:11,080
we see that only the root user
can write to that directory.

24
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:13,260
Lets test this out for ourselves.

25
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:16,272
I'll move into the directory using cd..

26
00:01:16,272 --> 00:01:17,590
And then I'll try to write a file.

27
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:20,240
You'll get a permission denied error,

28
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,150
just as this permission
system told us we would.

29
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:26,340
Only root is allowed to
write in this directory.

30
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:29,110
And our current user's
definitely not root.

31
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:34,040
We can still list the files in this
directory, because we have read access,

32
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:37,400
and we even entered the directory
because we have execute.

33
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,903
We just can't write.
