[Norvig] So now I'm ready to tackle the main function, poker.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
And we said it takes as input a list of hands,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
and it's going to return the best hand.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
So it takes as input the list, returns the best hand.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I haven't quite figured out how to write the function itself,

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
but at least I've got the prototype going.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Now, out of a list of hands we want poker to return the highest ranking hand.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Do we know of something that will help us do that? Think about it.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Do you know of a built-in function in Python that selects the highest ranking item from a list?

10
00:00:33,000 --> 99:59:59,999
If you do, go ahead and give its name.
