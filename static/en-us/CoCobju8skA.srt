1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:02,770
The world around us is complex.

2
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:07,580
We're constantly being bombarded with
visual information, pictures, words,

3
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:09,600
symbols, and more.

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:12,400
When it comes to quickly
processing that information,

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,129
we make sense of the chaos
around us by using a few tricks.

6
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:19,430
We recognize patterns,
compare and contrast things, and

7
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:24,400
refer to our past experiences all in
an instant without even realizing it.

8
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,920
We can make sense of
how our brains do this

9
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:29,980
by looking in the field
of cognitive psychology.

10
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:34,760
More specifically, a set of principles
called the Gestalt Laws of Grouping.

11
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:36,980
Let's take a quiz to get started.

12
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:41,480
Here's a UI from which we
removed all the images and text.

13
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:43,340
What do you think this app does?

14
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:45,070
There may be more than
one correct answers,

15
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:46,780
so don't think about it too hard.
