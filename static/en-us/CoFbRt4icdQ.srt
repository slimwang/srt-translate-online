1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:08,015
Remember that the whole area under the curve in terms of proportions is 1. And

2
00:00:08,015 --> 00:00:15,132
therefore, if 95% or 0.95 is between negative 2 and 2. Remember, these are the z

3
00:00:15,132 --> 00:00:20,216
scores. And same with this skinny normal distribution. 95% is between two

4
00:00:20,216 --> 00:00:25,875
standard deviations below, and two standard deviations above the mean. So, that

5
00:00:25,875 --> 00:00:31,925
must mean that the remaining proportions here, are 1 minus .095, which is 0.05.

6
00:00:31,925 --> 00:00:38,203
So, a proportion of 0.05, or 5%, is either below 2 or above 2 standard

7
00:00:38,203 --> 00:00:45,651
deviations. That means then that since this data is symmetrical, 2.5% is on this

8
00:00:45,651 --> 00:00:52,292
tail and 2.5% is on this tail, same here. You don't have to memorize this. If

9
00:00:52,292 --> 00:00:58,820
you know that 68% is within one standard deviation, and 95% is within two, you

10
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:05,348
can always know the percentage, or the proportion in between any two integer

11
00:01:05,348 --> 00:01:10,945
standard deviations for the mean. We're going to practice that now.
