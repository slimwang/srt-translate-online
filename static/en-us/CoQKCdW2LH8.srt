00:00:00,403 --> 00:00:02,684
So as I’ve stated in the problem, some of these are

2
00:00:02,684 --> 00:00:06,944
subjective, but here is my answer. I believe that the most

3
00:00:06,944 --> 00:00:11,078
severe threat is if Alice’s onion proxy is compromised.

4
00:00:11,078 --> 00:00:14,181
if an attacker has access to Alice’s onion proxy,

5
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:17,361
if Alice’s onion proxy is compromised, an attacker can learn

6
00:00:17,361 --> 00:00:21,393
all of Alice’s traffic. The least severe threat is option A.

7
00:00:21,393 --> 00:00:23,999
If an attacker in the middle intercepts the Relay Extend

8
00:00:23,999 --> 00:00:26,908
request between onion router 2 and onion router 3,

9
00:00:26,908 --> 00:00:29,430
in attempts to set up a different Diffie-Hellman key,

10
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:31,709
the hash check will detect problem. And so I think

11
00:00:31,709 --> 00:00:35,049
this is the least threatening between E and F, I think that

12
00:00:35,049 --> 00:00:38,579
E is more threatening than F having control of the entry

13
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:41,492
and exit nodes is more powerful than having control of

14
00:00:41,492 --> 00:00:43,945
this just the entry and some node in the middle.

15
00:00:43,945 --> 00:00:47,317
And so now we need to figure out where to put D and B.

16
00:00:47,317 --> 00:00:49,843
I think that D is a weaker threat than F just being able to

17
00:00:49,843 --> 00:00:53,455
observe network traffic is not very useful if you cannot

18
00:00:53,455 --> 00:00:56,296
correlate anything. Having control of two routers will give an

19
00:00:56,296 --> 00:00:59,057
attacker some ability to correlate traffic perhaps through

20
00:00:59,057 --> 00:01:03,148
timing attacks. So D is a weaker attack than F. I think that B

21
00:01:03,148 --> 00:01:06,697
is a more threat than E. If an attacker controls the directory

22
00:01:06,697 --> 00:01:10,399
server, it could possibly return only nodes under its control.

23
00:01:10,399 --> 00:01:13,166
Then having control of three nodes is a more serious threat

24
00:01:13,166 --> 00:01:15,358
than having control only two nodes

25
00:01:15,358 --> 00:01:19,358
So my answer is C, B, E, F, D and A.
