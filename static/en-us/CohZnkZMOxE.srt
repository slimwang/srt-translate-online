1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So this unit is a tough one.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
We're going to talk about perhaps the holy grail

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
of probabilistic inference.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
It's called Bayes Rule.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Bayes Rule is based on Reverend Thomas Bayes,

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
who used this principle to infer the existence of God,

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
but in doing so, he created a new family

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
of methods that has vastly influenced artificial intelligence

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
and statistics.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So let's dive in!
