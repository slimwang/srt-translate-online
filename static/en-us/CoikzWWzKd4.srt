00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,705
Now, Javascript at first glance really doesn't resemble the same sort of object

2
00:00:04,717 --> 00:00:08,833
oriented programming languages that you see in C and C++ code.

3
00:00:08,837 --> 00:00:13,515
Now these are typically the languages that games are written in, NES, Super NES,

4
00:00:13,617 --> 00:00:18,165
XBox 360, PS3, all had some resemblance of this. Now Javascript provides a way

5
00:00:18,177 --> 00:00:22,700
that you can define a set of variables as well as functions encapsulated as an

6
00:00:22,712 --> 00:00:26,642
object called a prototype. But for game dev, we're really missing the

7
00:00:26,654 --> 00:00:30,253
inheritance factor, that is the ability to define that prototype and have

8
00:00:30,265 --> 00:00:34,126
another one inherent from it. Luckily, we can duct tape JavaScript just enough

9
00:00:34,138 --> 00:00:38,588
to make it look like we're getting classes and structure definitions. Now this

10
00:00:38,604 --> 00:00:42,673
type of setup is actually the backbone of how everything works inside of grids.

11
00:00:42,673 --> 00:00:46,845
So, before we move on, make sure that you're very, very familiar with this type of programming model.
