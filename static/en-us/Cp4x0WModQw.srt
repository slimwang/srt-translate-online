1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:04,010
If any user can decide
what files to be accessed,

2
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:07,560
then of course,
there's no mandatory aspect to it.

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:10,840
They should be able to decide
about their files, not any file,

4
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:13,760
but that doesn't make
it mandatory access.

5
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:17,665
The fact that only the company can
dictate, somebody on behalf of

6
00:00:17,665 --> 00:00:22,351
the company, for example, sysadmin,
what programs can access what files.

7
00:00:22,351 --> 00:00:24,510
That's what makes it mandatory, okay.

8
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:28,262
So somebody, other than the user
who creates a resource,

9
00:00:28,262 --> 00:00:30,951
is required to specify
how it can be used.

10
00:00:30,951 --> 00:00:32,506
That's what makes it mandatory.

11
00:00:32,506 --> 00:00:36,039
And here, the company or
company's representative,

12
00:00:36,039 --> 00:00:41,240
someone in the security organization,
is deciding it which makes it mandatory.
