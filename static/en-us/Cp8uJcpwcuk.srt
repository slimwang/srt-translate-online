1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,880
Okay so Michaell here's the tree version, of what I just

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:07,380
said. So remember I draw squares as chance nodes. And so,

3
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:10,880
chance takes a, chance. And half the time we end up

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,700
in a state, where I have, where A has a red card.

5
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:15,480
And half the time I end up in a state where

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,760
A has, or we end up in a state, where A has

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,260
a black card. Okay? If A has the black card. Then

8
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:25,240
B gets to choose whether to hold or not, so let me

9
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:26,850
add a little bit of color for you since you wanted

10
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:30,540
some color. This is the place where A gets to make a

11
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:34,530
decision. Okay. Yep. And then this is the place where B

12
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:38,440
gets to make a decision. Got it. Okay? So, A is going

13
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:40,740
to either be in a red state or a black state.

14
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:44,110
Only A knows this. B does not know this, does not know

15
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:47,460
what state He is in. And so let's say A is

16
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,650
in a black state. Well, A can only hold in that case.

17
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:54,060
In part because it makes no sense to resign. And

18
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:58,290
then B gets to decide whether to resign, and therefore

19
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:01,360
A gets ten cents or to see, in which case

20
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:03,750
A gets thirty cents. By contrast, when we're in the

21
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:06,880
red state A can either hold or resign. If A

22
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,960
resigns he loses 20 cents. If A holds then B

23
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:13,070
gets to decide whether to resign and which case A

24
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:15,800
gets 10 cents, or to see the card in which case

25
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:19,240
A loses 40 cents and B of course gains 40 cents. So this

26
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,460
is just a tree version of what I just wrote. Does that make sense?

27
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:25,010
>> Okay, yeah I can see how this kind of captures the flow of information but

28
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:26,720
I feel like there might be a missing

29
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,250
constraint to it. So [INAUDIBLE] I don't know if

30
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:30,690
there's actually a constraint in this thing but

31
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:32,870
let me just point out something. And that

32
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:35,110
is that B has no idea which of

33
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:38,570
these two states his in, and its hidden information.

34
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,840
>> And because B doesn't know what

35
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:46,230
states he's in. He doesn't know whether resign over see. In particular B knew

36
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:50,010
that he was in this left mode state then he would always say see.

37
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:52,700
If B knew he was always in the rightmost state, then he would always

38
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:57,080
resign. But he doesn't know which one, so it's not entirely clear what to do.

39
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:59,931
>> Neat! Where did you get this game? This game is awesome! .

40
00:01:59,931 --> 00:02:01,081
>> I got this game like I got all

41
00:02:01,081 --> 00:02:03,750
of the examples that we're using today, from Andrew Moore.

42
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:04,930
>> He's clever.

43
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:06,000
>> He is clever. And

44
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,150
I have shamelessly stolen... All of his examples

45
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:11,300
and materials for this. But he said it was

46
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,450
okay, by putting up slides in the world and

47
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:15,300
saying, feel free to steal all of the stuff.

48
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:18,210
>> You want to write his name so that people can credit him?

49
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:20,380
>> Yeah, I'm going to write it at the very end. When we talk about.

50
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:20,570
>> Okay.

51
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:21,120
>> What we've learned.

52
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,480
>> Awesome.

53
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,680
>> Okay. So here's a question for you Michael. We know that I wrote down

54
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:30,470
a bunch of words which describe the game, and then I made it a tree,

55
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:33,200
because I could do that. And it makes it nice and easy

56
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,530
to see what's going on. But now we know, that at least

57
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:39,470
everything else we've done. We want to make a little matrix. And so

58
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:43,050
we want to figure out what the value is for different strategies for A

59
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:45,750
and B. So I'm going to assert, and I think it's pretty

60
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:49,550
easy to see, I hope. That A basically has only two strategies. Either

61
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:52,610
A is the type of person that resigns when a card is

62
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:55,610
read. Or A is the type of person who holds, when a card

63
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:56,750
is read. Agreed?

64
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,180
>> Interesting, okay. Yeah. Right. So

65
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:00,570
it really is a conditional policy, right?

66
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:06,390
It's basically If red hold to resign, if black hold to resign, but your

67
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:09,520
point is that black isn't really a choice, red is a choice, and

68
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:13,340
there's only two choices. Okay I can see that as the two strategies sure.

69
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:15,400
>> Right and of course this does say,

70
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,340
this is, this does kind of say when you're

71
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:18,400
in the black case you know you're going

72
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,840
to hold. So you know what's going to happen. Ultimately

73
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:24,060
B can either be the kind of person who resigns,

74
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:29,930
whenever A holds or chooses to see, whenever A holds. Right?

75
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:34,060
>> I see so, like in the previous trees. B would have four different

76
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:38,370
strategies Resigner see in the left state, resigner see in the right state. Here

77
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:40,570
there's this kind of extra connection, this

78
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:43,380
sort of a quantum entanglement between these

79
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:45,990
two states that it, that makes them have to be the same. So there really

80
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:46,870
is just those two choices.

81
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:49,250
>> That's exactly right, although, I probably wouldn't have used

82
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:52,510
the phrase quantum entanglement. But yes, there's an entanglement, certainly.

83
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:54,510
because we can't tell which state we're in. You're either

84
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:55,810
going to resign or you're going to see. And you

85
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:58,060
just don't know what else to do. Okay so A's

86
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:00,850
a resigner or holder. B's a resigner or a seer.

87
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:04,790
So the question is what numbers go in this matrix?

88
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:07,130
And we're going to figure that out by having a quiz.

89
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:08,550
>> I kind of saw that coming.

90
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:10,660
>> Mm-hm, do you think you can figure this

91
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:15,360
out? yeah, yeah. Sure. Sure. Yeah, I think so.

92
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,640
>> Yeah, see, see, see. Yeah, I can

93
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:20,300
do that. Okay, cool. So, let's go then. Go.
