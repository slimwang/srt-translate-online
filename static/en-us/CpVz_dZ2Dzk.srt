1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,570
What I've got plotted here and
sort of a notional plot,

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:07,210
this is a loss, expected loss, right?

3
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:12,003
On the left hand side, that's the
probability that it's a four given an x

4
00:00:12,003 --> 00:00:15,502
times the loss of that it's a four and
I call it a nine.

5
00:00:15,502 --> 00:00:19,577
Over here, this is the probability
that it's a nine, but

6
00:00:19,577 --> 00:00:21,580
I actually called it a four.

7
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:27,657
And the decision boundary is where
these values are equal to one another.

8
00:00:27,657 --> 00:00:31,110
And of course, what is hard about this?

9
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:35,090
Well, knowing what the losses are,
that's easy, okay?

10
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:35,685
You just tell me, right?

11
00:00:35,685 --> 00:00:39,704
You tell me, how expensive is it for
me to call a smart person not so

12
00:00:39,704 --> 00:00:42,776
smart versus calling a not so
smart person smart,

13
00:00:42,776 --> 00:00:46,230
will probably have something
to do with their stature.

14
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:47,241
Okay?

15
00:00:47,241 --> 00:00:51,900
So my losses might be asymmetric,
or my losses might be symmetric.

16
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:53,520
Like, I'm doing zip codes, right?

17
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,290
And if I call a four, a nine you know,
it goes to California and

18
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:58,880
it should have gone,
what starts with four?

19
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:59,820
What zip codes start with four?

20
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:00,760
I have no idea.

21
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:01,800
I don't know, let's say Forest, Texas.

22
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:04,769
So, if I called it a four and
it really was a nine,

23
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:06,750
it's supposed to go to California,
it goes to Texas.

24
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:09,000
If I call it a, etc., it goes to te.

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,970
So assuming that it's not any worse
ending up in Texas than it is, or

26
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:15,400
ending up in California, which is
a difficult assumption, I understand.

27
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:18,130
See there are more people in
California than there are Texas, so

28
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:19,150
I have to in, so

29
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:24,060
my loss of insulting Texas is lower than
my loss of insulting Cal, oh nevermind.

30
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:26,200
Okay, getting back to this.

31
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,290
So I know what my losses are.

32
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:31,650
The thing that I don't
know is the probabilities.

33
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:32,180
Right?

34
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:32,970
For a given x,

35
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:36,490
how do I actually know what
the probability is that it's a four?

36
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:39,080
I have to somehow learn that or
know that.

37
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,830
So who's going to help me?
