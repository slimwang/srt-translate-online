Now, let's look at mixed numbers with octagons. An octagon is just a shape with

2
00:00:03,932 --> 00:00:07,925
eight sides. What would be the mixed number and the improper fraction for these

3
00:00:07,937 --> 00:00:11,825
octagons? You want to think about splitting these octagons up into equal parts.

4
00:00:11,917 --> 00:00:15,650
You will also want to reduce your answer. So, for example, if I had 5 and 6

5
00:00:15,662 --> 00:00:20,465
12th, I'd really want to write that as 5 and one-half. I know 6 goes into 6 one

6
00:00:20,477 --> 00:00:25,785
time, and I know 6 goes into 12 two times. So, 6 12th reduces to one-half.
