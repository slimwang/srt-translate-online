00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,835
We would get a horizontal line. If A is equal to 0, then this entire first term

2
00:00:04,835 --> 00:00:09,474
is equal to 0, so our equation would just be by equals C. If we solve for y or

3
00:00:09,474 --> 00:00:14,218
isolate y, we have the equation y equals C over B. So, y equals a constant,

00:00:14,218 --> 00:00:17,100
which we know is the form of a horizontal line.
