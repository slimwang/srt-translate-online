1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,620
The second piece of data
we need from this group,

2
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:06,120
is the longitude, which we'll get
from the coordinates of each game.

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:11,070
Here we're using the map function,
defined on JavaScript arrays,

4
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:15,900
which simply transforms every element
of an array, and returns an array back.

5
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:20,450
So again, in the callback
function we passed a map.

6
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:24,190
It gets passed d,
which is every elements of leaves, and

7
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:28,790
whatever we've returned gets
stored in the return array cords.

8
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:34,240
In this case, we want to go from the
latitude and longitude of our data point

9
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:37,950
to some pixel value,
which we get from our projection here.

10
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:42,060
So again, the projection can be
thought of just like a scale

11
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:45,910
that takes as input a longitude and
latitude pair.

12
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:51,040
And gives as output a pixel X and
Y back.

13
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,210
Now you might be wondering

14
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:54,930
what we're actually doing
with the coordinates here.

15
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:59,000
Well we could have of looked up
the home country name from our data.

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,130
And centered each circle on our map and
the center of that country.

17
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:05,090
But for maximum flexibility,

18
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:08,530
especially since West Germany
is no longer a country.

19
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:13,650
And the 2002 World Cup was held
in both South Korea and Japan.

20
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:17,360
I simply chose to compute
the central location

21
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,690
of all the locations of games for
a given year.

22
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:25,720
Or, more visually, if there were
four stadiums for a given year, we

23
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:30,550
first convert the latitude and longitude
of each stadium to a pixel value,

24
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:35,730
since averaging latitude and longitude
can be slightly more complicated.

25
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:41,065
And since in the end we want to a pixel
value to plot on our webpage anyways.

26
00:01:41,065 --> 00:01:45,290
We're going to simply compute
the average x-value and the average

27
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:50,205
y-value of all the games to get some
point they'll be placed centrally.
