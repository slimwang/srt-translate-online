1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,880
One quick note.

2
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:04,380
If, instead of doing this in black and

3
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:08,690
white, you were actually doing this in
red, green, blue, in a colored version,

4
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:13,820
right, you would now have, instead of
25 equations, you'd have how many?

5
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:16,170
You'd have 75 equations,
five times five times three.

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,520
Now, if you're really shrewd,
you might say wait a minute, wait,

7
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,870
wait, suppose my window
was only a single pixel.

8
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:29,680
You told me professor Bobbitt
that we had this problem, okay?

9
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:33,540
That we had one equation and
two unknowns.

10
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:37,500
But with R, G and B I now have
three equations, and two unknowns.

11
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,260
Can't I solve it?

12
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:43,070
>> Well, no Frodo,
you can not, all right?

13
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:46,340
The problem is is that the R,
G and B images,

14
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:50,900
you can just think of the image planes,
are quite correlated, okay?

15
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:54,110
So, you know,
you have a change of intensity but

16
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:57,160
you had the same changes of intensity
because of the edge of my shirt,

17
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:00,340
both in the green and in,
and in the blue channels.

18
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:01,370
Now one might get brighter and

19
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:05,560
one might get darker but the gradients
will be in the same direction.

20
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,760
So the gradients are very correlated, so

21
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,380
you can't just use the different
color planes in order to solve it.

22
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:13,230
Good try though, sort of.
