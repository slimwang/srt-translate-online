00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:04,485
Let's start with our first equation over here. If log based 10 of 100 all taken

2
00:00:04,485 --> 00:00:11,094
to the third power, equals 3 times log base 10 of 100. So let's see what each

3
00:00:11,094 --> 00:00:15,900
side is equal to. Well first you need to figure out what log base 10 of 100 is.

4
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:20,230
And it's two, since 100 is 10 squared. That means on the left-hand side, we

5
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:26,875
have 2 cubed, or 8. And on the right-hand side, we have 3 times 2, or 6. 8 is

6
00:00:26,875 --> 00:00:32,497
definitely not equal to 8, so this equation is not true. Let's move on to our

7
00:00:32,497 --> 00:00:37,580
second equation. Log base 10 of 100 cubed is equal to 3 times log base 10 of

8
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:43,606
100. On the left hand side we can rewrite 100 as 10 squared and that means we

9
00:00:43,606 --> 00:00:49,860
have log based 10 of 10 squared taken to the 3rd power. We know from our rules

10
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:55,972
of exponents that this is just log bas 10 of 10 to the 6th. We need to multiply

11
00:00:55,972 --> 00:01:01,172
the 2 and the 3, and that just simplifies to 6. Awesome. What about the

12
00:01:01,172 --> 00:01:05,316
right-hand side? Well once again we make use of the fact that log base 10 of

13
00:01:05,316 --> 00:01:11,143
100 is just 2, 3 times 2 is just 6. So this equation is true. Awesome. And now

14
00:01:11,143 --> 00:01:17,470
for this last one over here. Log base 10 of 100 cubed, equals 3 times log base

15
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:22,830
10 of 100. The only difference between this equation and this one is the use of

16
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:27,366
parentheses here around the 100 cubed. However in this case the parentheses

17
00:01:27,366 --> 00:01:31,449
don't actually change the way we're evaluating the expression. The first thing

18
00:01:31,449 --> 00:01:34,576
we did over here was find what 100 cubed was equal to and that was 10 to the

19
00:01:34,576 --> 00:01:39,950
6th. So that means that this is going to be equal to what we got here, just 6.

20
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:43,112
Once again the right-hand side is the same as it's been the other 2 times and

21
00:01:43,112 --> 00:01:47,380
we know that we got 6 before. So look at that, this time we have 2 true

22
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:52,530
equations. Wonderful. Both of these show proper uses of the product rule. And

23
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:58,150
in both cases the exponent is only applying to the input of the log expression.

24
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:02,180
It doesn't go around the entire log expression, which is why this first one was

25
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:03,889
not correct.
