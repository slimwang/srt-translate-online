1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:05,630
I'm going to ask you to sort of go back,
transport yourself back in time,

2
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:08,029
about 10 years back,
I guess, when you were here.

3
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:11,230
And if there's anything interesting
you recall from the time that you

4
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:12,450
spent with us.

5
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:15,290
>> I would say that what impressed
me the most was the talent of

6
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:16,890
the students that I worked with.

7
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:21,270
The talent of the faculty that I
worked with, their passion for

8
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:26,170
the discipline of computer science for
information security in particular.

9
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:29,760
The fact that they treated me
as a professional colleague.

10
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,180
And really I learned as much
as I could humanly learn.

11
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:37,220
Didn't sleep much during that time.

12
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:40,410
I would encourage those listening
whether they're doing this full time or

13
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:41,747
part time at night,

14
00:00:41,747 --> 00:00:45,290
just drink deeply from the well
while you have this opportunity.

15
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:49,820
And really when you're done
to understand that this

16
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:54,640
a constantly evolving space and
that you need to not stop learning.

17
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,420
You have to continually feed your mind
with new information, new knowledge.

18
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:00,640
>> I have advised many PhD students,

19
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:05,120
but you clearly stand out in that
one respect, the uncommon army

20
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:09,200
discipline that you brought to the
academic environment that we have here.

21
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:15,055
And I thank you for coming down today
and having this conversation with us.

22
00:01:15,055 --> 00:01:16,825
You actually have a website, isn't it?

23
00:01:16,825 --> 00:01:18,875
>> So my personal one is gregconti.com.

24
00:01:18,875 --> 00:01:20,965
And actually that's a good point.

25
00:01:20,965 --> 00:01:24,185
It's important to have, I think,
a professional presence online,

26
00:01:24,185 --> 00:01:27,145
something each researcher
controls themselves.

27
00:01:27,145 --> 00:01:30,884
And then my professional
website is cyber.army.mil.
