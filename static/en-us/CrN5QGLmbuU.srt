00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:01,890
Cool. Now that we know that we can use

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:04,600
logging to debug our app, we're going to return to

3
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:07,210
this networking code snippet here and drop it into

4
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:11,380
the sunshine app to query for actual weather data. Open

5
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:14,550
up your project in main activity.java. In this class,

6
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:18,420
scroll down to the placeholder fragment class within the placeholder

7
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:22,010
fragment class in the on create view method, scroll down

8
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:25,490
and go ahead and add the networking code snippet here.

9
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:30,410
To get her blank, is pasted below again if you need it. You may need to enable

10
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:33,700
these options in auto import or add the imports

11
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:37,990
manually. See the instructions below. When you run the

12
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:40,930
app, you'll see that is crashes. Use log

13
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:43,430
cat to figure out which error is the guilty

14
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:47,290
culprit that caused the crash. We're assuming that for

15
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:50,080
this quiz question. You're using a device that's running

16
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:53,160
honeycomb or later. Use the emulator if needed.
