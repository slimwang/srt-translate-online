00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Another one to take the forward Euler's method that you already know so well

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
and turned it into one of these wondrous methods that consist of phase space area.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Here I wrote down the equations for standard forward Euler's method.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Now, there is a single change that's going to do the job.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I do not compute the force at the original position. I compute the force at the new position.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
This leads to the following. This looks like a programming error on first sight.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Soon, I'll be using the initial values on the right-hand side to compute the new values,

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
but actually, it turns out that this the right thing to be doing in contrast to the forward Euler's method.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Now, these two steps are executed in sequence. First, we change the position.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
And you already saw that this does not change

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
the area in phase space and then we take the new position.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The velocity remained unchanged and compute the new velocity,

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
which also does not change the area in phase space, which we saw before

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
and then we repeat the first step and so on and so on.

15
00:01:04,000 --> 99:59:59,999
This is now a symplectic method. It does not change the area in phase space.
