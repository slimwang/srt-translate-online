1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:02,660
All right, positioning.

2
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:04,750
So this is what we have right now and

3
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:07,890
like I said before, for the most
part things are in the right place.

4
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:10,570
The image seems to be pretty
much centered in the screen,

5
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:13,010
happy birthday is in
the upper-left corner.

6
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:16,160
Really, the only thing that's
an issue is that From Lyla is

7
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,240
not in the correct place.

8
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:19,600
It should be in
the lower-right hand corner.

9
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,490
You can see here at our goal,
we've managed to move it down here.

10
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:26,630
Let's go ahead and
fix this and turn it into this.

11
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:30,920
To start, select the attribute or
attributes that you need to position

12
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:33,440
From Lyla in the correct
place on the screen.

13
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,620
Namely the lower left-hand corner.

14
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:38,090
Here's a list of attributes and
you can go ahead and

15
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:40,360
check next to the ones
that you think you need.

16
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:43,940
Once you've done that, submit your
answer to see if it's correct.

17
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:47,160
Once you know the correct attributes
to use, open up your code and

18
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,100
go ahead and add those attributes
to the From Lyla text view.
