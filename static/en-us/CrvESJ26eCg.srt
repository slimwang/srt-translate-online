00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:05,215
You can see in the documentation that a
Switch being thrown triggers the event,

2
00:00:05,215 --> 00:00:07,332
UI control event ValueChanged.

3
00:00:07,332 --> 00:00:11,024
And we know whether a switch is on or
off by checking its" on" property.

4
00:00:11,024 --> 00:00:15,004
So, we'll connect each of these three
Switch actions to the UI control event

5
00:00:15,004 --> 00:00:15,870
ValueChanged.
