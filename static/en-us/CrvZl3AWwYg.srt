1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So now, there's a quiz.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Our JavaScript interpreter is going to have to compute the value of 6 factorial,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
a function call within a function call within a function call.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
It's turtles all the way down.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
How many different environment frames will be created by the interpreter for

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
factorial 6 above?

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Include the global frame in your answer.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
How many total environment frames will we be juggling at the same time?

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Fill in the blank.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Question 2--In how many of those frames will n have the same value?

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
So if you could find 3 frames where n was 77, then the answer here would be 3.
