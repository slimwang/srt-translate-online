00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:01,900
So, the real issue,
I think, is on Nexus 7,

2
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:04,682
we didn't have enough width and that's--
>> Can you just hold this for a second?

3
00:00:04,682 --> 00:00:05,523
Thanks.

4
00:00:05,523 --> 00:00:06,970
>> Hey guys, talking about Sunshine?

5
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:09,540
>> Yeah, we're brainstorming all
the things we need to cover and

6
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:11,140
what we need to do and
it seems there's kind of a lot,

7
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:14,420
so I was thinking we would each
do one improvement per lesson.

8
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:16,120
>> All right.
So, where do we begin?

9
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:18,130
>> Well, you were assigned
all those arrow cases, right?

10
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:19,542
So I think you should start with those.

11
00:00:19,542 --> 00:00:22,500
>> Yeah,
a solid base is always a great idea.

12
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:23,230
>> Right.

13
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:25,790
Solid base, then improve from there.

14
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:26,570
I like it.

15
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:28,790
And I'll keep you
apprised on my progress?

16
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:30,400
>> We are just so
excited to see what you do.
