1
00:00:00,097 --> 00:00:02,711
So in summary and revenue model for this class,

2
00:00:02,711 --> 00:00:06,765
the best thing that you could do is start drawing the diagram.

3
00:00:06,765 --> 00:00:09,680
So what I want you to do is draw the diagram

4
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:12,781
of both your revenue streams and your pricing,

5
00:00:12,781 --> 00:00:14,459
and I want you to actually put numbers in.

6
00:00:14,459 --> 00:00:17,015
So let's assume this is your company over here.

7
00:00:17,015 --> 00:00:22,697
What you've discovered is that there are 3 different customer segments; look at that.

8
00:00:22,697 --> 00:00:25,432
Tenants, property owners, and leasing companies.

9
00:00:25,432 --> 00:00:29,766
I want to know if this is subscription, what is the revenue stream

10
00:00:29,766 --> 00:00:32,676
that you have between each one of these customer segments,

11
00:00:32,676 --> 00:00:35,480
and what are the pricing tactics?

12
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:40,351
And then how do you make money and what do you provide.

13
00:00:40,351 --> 00:00:42,766
And out of sudden you can now see

14
00:00:42,766 --> 00:00:47,032
that the revenue stream and the pricing is going back and forth.

15
00:00:47,032 --> 00:00:51,688
I just really believe that if you could draw you have a handle on understanding it.

16
00:00:51,688 --> 00:00:55,182
And don't worry, on day one you start drawing and then realize

17
00:00:55,182 --> 00:00:57,182
I really don't understand this stuff.

18
00:00:57,182 --> 00:01:00,141
That's just a signal - time to get out of building again,

19
00:01:00,141 --> 00:01:02,237
talk to some more people and say:

20
00:01:02,237 --> 00:01:03,977
well, how are we gonna make money here?

21
00:01:03,977 --> 00:01:06,031
Cause i can't even explain it to myself.
