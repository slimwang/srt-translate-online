1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:02,200
Okay, you're doing a great job.

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:04,970
And, the functionality for
the app is almost finished.

3
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:07,000
We've got one more thing to
add before styling the app,

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,890
and that's adding the Reset Button.

5
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:13,220
The functionality of
the Reset Button is this.

6
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:15,510
So, I can start making a score.

7
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:19,200
Let's say that the teams
have some points.

8
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,410
When the game ends,
you could hit the Reset button, and

9
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:24,700
both of the scores will go back to 0.

10
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:28,590
You can then add more points,
and they'll add from 0.

11
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:29,590
Before you start coding,

12
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:32,890
I want you to plan out what
you're going to do in PseudoCode.

13
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:34,190
Here's a space for you to do that.

14
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:38,300
To make this a little more
challenging and true to real life,

15
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:42,010
I'm actually not going to tell you the
PseudoCode that I would use after this.

16
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:45,690
Instead, you'll jump right in
to transforming your PseudoCode

17
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:47,940
into your actual Java code.

18
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:49,640
Okay, so write your thoughts here.
