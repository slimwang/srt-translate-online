00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:05,670
Knockout has another kind of model data object, called, a Computed Observable.

2
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:09,960
Computed observables are really nice, because they can create a value when

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:13,640
they're accessed, rather than just retrieve it from somewhere.

4
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:16,630
One good example is fullName.

5
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:18,150
That should take your first name and

6
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:21,550
your last name, combine them together, and return it.

7
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:24,240
Maybe if there's a middle name defined, it should add that in too.

8
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:29,420
Now, it doesn't make any sense to store the fullName as an actual string here,

9
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:31,270
because that's redundant.

10
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:35,900
We already have all of the information we need, to figure out the full name.

11
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:40,100
So, rather than store it as a string, why not store it as an action,

12
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:40,840
as a function?

13
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:43,998
So, that's exactly what we do.

14
00:00:43,998 --> 00:00:47,580
We store fullName as a special kind of function, and

15
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:50,550
when you want to get the full name, you run that function, and

16
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:55,710
it returns the first name plus a space, plus the last name.

17
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:59,700
The great thing is, when all of your variables are observables, or

18
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:03,950
computed observables, you can treat them all exactly the same.

19
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:08,310
So, it's just as easy for us to use, but we get the benefit of having

20
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:12,880
a data object that computes itself, based on other data that we're storing.
