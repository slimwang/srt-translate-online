1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,540
You know, what kinds of operations
do you want to do on binary images?

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:07,700
So, you know, often what you
want to do is you want to separate

3
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:10,900
objects one from another, that
are sort of accidentally touching, and

4
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:14,820
you want to collect together pixels
that all belong to the same object.

5
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:18,220
And then another thing you might
want to do is compute the features

6
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:19,670
of a binary object.

7
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:20,880
And we actually did this also.

8
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,365
Remember we talked about hue moments,

9
00:00:22,365 --> 00:00:24,125
and we were talking about
moments in general?

10
00:00:24,125 --> 00:00:27,830
And moments are a descriptor of
the shape of a binary patch.

11
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:33,279
And so, again, those are things
that you would do on binary images.

12
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:35,880
So here's an example.

13
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:39,000
This was a thresholded,
red blood cell image.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,590
And by the way in the old days,
not so old, in fact mom, sorry.

15
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:49,930
My mother, I think her first job out
of college was as a medical technician.

16
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:53,250
One of the things you had to do
was count white blood cells in a,

17
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:56,810
under a microscope and for a certain
amount, and you would count the density.

18
00:00:56,810 --> 00:01:00,140
Actually, people sometimes
still do that, even today.

19
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:02,780
But what you'd really like to be
able to do is spread out a bunch of

20
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:04,709
blood cells and
have a machine do the counting.

21
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:05,610
How many red blood cells?

22
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:06,780
How many white blood cells?

23
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:10,200
Especially, if instead of just
doing a patient at a time,

24
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,730
you were doing a massive study, and

25
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:15,620
you had tens of thousands of
samples you wanted counted, right?

26
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:19,870
So, here's an example of taking
an image, thresholding it.

27
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:21,130
And, you know,

28
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:23,910
if I were to ask you to count how
many red blood cells there were,

29
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:28,008
you could probably find all of the, well
let's start with one that's easy, right?

30
00:01:28,008 --> 00:01:31,410
You say a-ha, here's one that's
pretty separated, no problem,

31
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:32,610
here's another one.

32
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:34,190
Oh, but this is a weird one,
look at that.

33
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:39,120
It's got a hole in it and here are two,
those are probably two, right?

34
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,770
But it's one blob
connected by a thin thing.

35
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:44,980
So you'd really like to be able to
take this image and then fix it up.

36
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:49,740
You know, because, in this particular
image, there was 63 separate

37
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:54,040
objects detected and a normal blood
cell has an area of about a 50.

38
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:57,310
But you'll notice there are some things
here, where obviously there were

39
00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:00,600
things that were touching each other
that were counted as single cells,

40
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,320
when actually, they were gobs.

41
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:06,110
And then there were things
that were really small, right?

42
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:09,364
And so here, they were just using
the number to determine which kinds of

43
00:02:09,364 --> 00:02:10,490
things are cells.

44
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:14,063
And what you'd like to do is you'd like
to be able to separate out each one of

45
00:02:14,063 --> 00:02:15,540
those cells.

46
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:19,470
So, we're going to do some binary
image operations to do that.

47
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:21,910
And what kind of operations are there?

48
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:25,470
Well, first one we're going to talk
just a little bit about is thresholding.

49
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:29,132
because in some sense, in order to get
a binary image, you have to go from

50
00:02:29,132 --> 00:02:32,477
a color or a gray-scale image
that has continuous values or,

51
00:02:32,477 --> 00:02:36,340
lots of values to something that
just has two zero and ones.

52
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:39,240
So determining a threshold
is always a challenge.

53
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:42,200
Then, what you'd like to do is you'd
like to find all the pixels that

54
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,420
are connected.

55
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:46,780
And that's called connected
components analysis, and we'll,

56
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:50,500
we'll talk about that, that one's used
a lot also to find independent blobs.

57
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:53,070
And then you want to sometimes
improve those blobs, and

58
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:57,287
that's referred to as morphology, and
we're going to talk about a variety of

59
00:02:57,287 --> 00:03:00,540
morphological operators, including
some of the more important ones.

60
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:03,790
Then once you've done all that,
then you may compute some features

61
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:06,600
on those blobs,
like I was talking about before.

62
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,830
Moments, areas, these kinds of things.
