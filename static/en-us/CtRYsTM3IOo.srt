00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,370
When we looked at
Firebase notifications,

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:04,370
we talked about how well
they work with analytics.

3
00:00:05,679 --> 00:00:08,869
One of the benefits of analytics is
that you can see how users respond

4
00:00:08,869 --> 00:00:09,719
to changes in your app.

5
00:00:10,759 --> 00:00:15,050
In most cases, large changes to apps
are published as part of an app update.

6
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:19,020
But this means that only users who
download the update will see that

7
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:19,280
change.

8
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:22,759
And if the update is
offered to all users,

9
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:25,030
you can't try multiple
configurations with the app at once.

10
00:00:26,059 --> 00:00:28,799
And what if the change doesn't
increase user engagement?

11
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:33,509
You have to present another update
to try another configuration.

12
00:00:33,509 --> 00:00:35,899
But don't worry, there's a better way,
Firebase Remote Config.

13
00:00:35,899 --> 00:00:40,509
With Firebase remote config,
you can change parameters of

14
00:00:40,509 --> 00:00:44,259
your app from the Firebase console
without pushing all new updates.

15
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:48,140
Maybe you want to find the optimal
text size for your app.

16
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:52,329
Would be helpful to try multiple
configurations of the app

17
00:00:52,329 --> 00:00:54,109
with different text sizes.

18
00:00:54,109 --> 00:00:57,848
And then compare with what text size
users spend the most time using your

19
00:00:57,848 --> 00:00:58,168
app.

20
00:00:58,168 --> 00:00:59,001

21
00:00:59,002 --> 00:01:02,669
The point is, there are plenty of
cases where you might want to try out

22
00:01:02,668 --> 00:01:06,799
small changes to improve your app, and
see if they change user engagements.

23
00:01:07,959 --> 00:01:10,229
For these cases, use Remote Config.
