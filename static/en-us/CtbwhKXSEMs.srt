00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:07,162
Well, since this value is one standard deviation above the mean, 13 plus 4.8 is

2
00:00:07,162 --> 00:00:14,657
17.8. If we add another 4.8, we get 22.6. And similarly, if we subtract 4.8 from

3
00:00:14,657 --> 00:00:21,928
13, we get 8.2. And then subtract another 4.8 to get 3.4. So here's our normal,

00:00:21,928 --> 00:00:24,933
unstandardized distribution.
