00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,380
Okay, take a look at this image as an example.

2
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:05,590
See how the appearance of this wall,

3
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:10,500
which we can assume to have constant color, varies gradually due to lighting.

4
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:14,220
But look at the features in this image,

5
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:18,170
these are created due to reflectance of color variations.

6
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:23,120
So we can expect reflectance to change more frequently with respect to

7
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:27,130
the location compared with irradiant light.

8
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:30,160
There are of course other elements to consider.

9
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,730
For instance, object boundaries and shadows.

10
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:37,260
Sharp edges can also affect observed lightness.

11
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:42,320
These factors definitely complicate things, but realizing that they change

12
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:47,630
more or less frequently or in different ways, forms the basis of identifying and

13
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:51,510
ultimately separating these factors while observing an image.
