00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,953
Remember that slope is the change in y over the change in x. So, we just

2
00:00:03,965 --> 00:00:08,297
subtract one of our y-coordinates from the other and one of our x-coordinates

3
00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:12,779
from the other, making sure to use the same point first in each case. I'm going

4
00:00:12,791 --> 00:00:17,060
to have this point give us our second coordinates and this point give us our

5
00:00:17,072 --> 00:00:20,044
first coordinates. This gives us a final answer of 5.
