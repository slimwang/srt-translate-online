1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,710
So for 60 percent I want to do per cent, or divided by 100. I know dividing by

2
00:00:04,721 --> 00:00:10,086
100 moves the decimal place 2 places left. So I get point 6, or 6 10ths. For all

3
00:00:10,098 --> 00:00:15,543
these percents I'm going to need to move thee decimal two places left and divide

4
00:00:15,555 --> 00:00:20,536
by 100. So I get 5 10,000ths. Here again I'm going to move the decimal two

5
00:00:20,548 --> 00:00:25,651
places left. And I get .5302, here when I move the decimal 2 places left I get 2

6
00:00:25,663 --> 00:00:30,410
extra 0's and my decimal point ends up here. So I get this number. Again I move

7
00:00:30,422 --> 00:00:34,754
the decimal 2 places left and I wind up with 30. It's probably easier to

8
00:00:34,766 --> 00:00:39,395
remember how to go from a percent to a decimal. You just think about what the

9
00:00:39,407 --> 00:00:44,448
word percent means. It means per 100, or divided by 100. So, to go from a

10
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:50,171
decimal to a percent, we need to undo that dividing by 100. So we multiply it by

11
00:00:50,183 --> 00:00:56,395
100. So 52 times 100 is 5200%. Multiplying four thousandths by 100 gives me 4%,.

12
00:00:56,672 --> 00:01:02,268
and multiplying 1.35 by 100 gives me 135%. Notice that each time I convert a

13
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:08,153
decimal to a percent, the decimal place moved two places to the right. Now that

14
00:01:08,165 --> 00:01:12,606
we can work with decimals and percents, let's go back to our shoe problem.
