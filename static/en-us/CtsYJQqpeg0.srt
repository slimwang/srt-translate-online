00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,636
Assuming nothing has changed about this parabola, compared to y equals x squared,

2
00:00:04,636 --> 00:00:08,913
aside from the entire thing shifting. We know that the whole thing needs to

3
00:00:08,913 --> 00:00:13,265
shift by h coordinates in the horizontal direction, and k coordinates in the

4
00:00:13,265 --> 00:00:17,926
vertical direction. So the vertex will move to (h,k). If we replace x, with the

5
00:00:17,926 --> 00:00:22,306
quantity x minus h, and y with the quantity y minus k, this gives us a final

6
00:00:22,306 --> 00:00:26,956
equation of y minus k equals the quantity x minus h squared. So anytime we see

7
00:00:26,956 --> 00:00:31,855
an equation written in this form, we can automatically tell where its vertex is.

8
00:00:31,855 --> 00:00:36,314
This is going to be super useful as you move forward, doing more and more with

9
00:00:36,314 --> 00:00:37,056
parabolas.
