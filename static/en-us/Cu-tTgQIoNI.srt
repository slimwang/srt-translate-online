1
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:03,609
So we've made it to the table
where the messages will appear.

2
00:00:03,609 --> 00:00:07,519
Not bad, but we still got a bit of work
to do before we're actually sending and

3
00:00:07,519 --> 00:00:08,939
receiving messages.

4
00:00:08,939 --> 00:00:11,699
So let's dive into the starter code and
see what needs to be done.

5
00:00:11,699 --> 00:00:16,089
In the top level folder for the project,
you'll see three different Swift files.

6
00:00:16,089 --> 00:00:21,039
The AppDelegate,
FCViewController, and Constants.

7
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:22,820
The AppDelegate doesn't
have much going on.

8
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:27,000
However, it does have a comment here
in the didFinishLaunchingWithOptions

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,460
function telling us that we need to
configure our Firebase application.

10
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:34,500
It also has a functional stub for
opening a URL.

11
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,609
There's already some code written here
that will handle Google Sign in for

12
00:00:37,609 --> 00:00:39,789
us, but there will more on that later.

13
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,730
Moving on, the next swift file
is the FC view controller.

14
00:00:44,729 --> 00:00:47,519
This is where most of our work
this weekend will be focused.

15
00:00:48,649 --> 00:00:51,920
Some of the View Controller is already
implemented but much of the file is

16
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,640
littered with to dos to help guide
us towards finishing the app.

17
00:00:55,829 --> 00:00:58,429
You can quickly see the to
dos by clicking here in

18
00:00:58,429 --> 00:00:59,890
the navigation bar at the top.

19
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:04,390
Or you can just browse through
them as we scroll down the file.

20
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:09,350
Here we can see to dos for handling what
the user sees, when the view loads or

21
00:01:09,349 --> 00:01:12,159
configuring fire based
authentication amongst others.

22
00:01:13,219 --> 00:01:16,560
There are also some to dos for
sending messages, both text and photo,

23
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,140
and here they are in code.

24
00:01:20,299 --> 00:01:23,000
If we scroll down far enough we'll
find some to dos for the table view.

25
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:24,469
Here we go.

26
00:01:24,469 --> 00:01:27,929
And if we go a little bit further
we can see some to dos for

27
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:32,070
selecting images with an image picker
and uploading them for photo messages.

28
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:36,780
The remaining code all the way at
the bottom that I have highlighted here

29
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:38,480
is already implemented and used for

30
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,750
adjusting the view when
a keyboard is shown on screen.

31
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,140
All right that's it for
the FCViewController.

32
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:48,140
The final file is called constants.

33
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:51,420
In constants, we have a struct of
static values that are used in our app.

34
00:01:52,549 --> 00:01:54,429
Now that we've had a brief
look at the starter code,

35
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:57,300
we're going to shift gears
to talk about databases.

36
00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:00,429
We'll look at what makes fire-based
database so powerful, and

37
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:02,780
explore some ideas of how
to organize our data,

38
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:04,760
depending on the type of app
that you're trying to build.
