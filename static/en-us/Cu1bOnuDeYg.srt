We often refer to the relationship between two variables as the correlation. If

2
00:00:05,662 --> 00:00:10,200
two variables have a strong relationship, then they have a high correlation. We

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:14,873
can also say strong correlation. But you're going to start getting used to the

4
00:00:14,873 --> 00:00:18,947
word correlation. Now, match each of these plots with the appropriate

5
00:00:18,947 --> 00:00:24,350
description. Which of these has a strong positive correlation? Or strong in

6
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:29,012
negative which shows a weak and positive correlation and finally which is a

7
00:00:29,012 --> 00:00:35,501
weak but negative correlation. Put the appropriate letter in the boxes here on

8
00:00:35,501 --> 00:00:36,760
the left.
