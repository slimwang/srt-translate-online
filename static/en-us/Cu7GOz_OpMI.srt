1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:05,840
The answers are 8, 4 and 16. Nice work if you got those three correct. Now, we

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:08,765
haven't seen something like this third one before, so don't worry if they gave

3
00:00:08,765 --> 00:00:13,470
you trouble. For the first one, I'm going to have power divided by root. So, 64

4
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:19,340
to the 1 for my power, and I take a square root since the denominator is a 2.

5
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:23,780
So here, I really have the square root of 64, which we know is 8. And if I

6
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:26,705
think about rewriting this, I can see all the intermediate steps we can take to

7
00:00:26,705 --> 00:00:31,982
get there. We rewrite 64 as 8 squared and now, since we have a square root in a

8
00:00:31,982 --> 00:00:38,440
square, we can use power divided by root. We have 8 to the 2 divided by 2,

9
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:43,216
which is really just 8 to the 1 or 8. Now, these steps here are not necessary

10
00:00:43,216 --> 00:00:47,825
in order to get to our final answer. If we understand that the square of 64 is

11
00:00:47,825 --> 00:00:52,436
8, that's great. I just want to reinforce that we can use our same ideal of

12
00:00:52,436 --> 00:00:57,614
power divided by root to simplify. We use similar reasoning for the second

13
00:00:57,614 --> 00:01:01,965
problem. We know that we have power divided by root, so 64 to the 1 for our

14
00:01:01,965 --> 00:01:07,524
power, and 3 for our root, a cube root. We know the cube root of 64 is 4, and

15
00:01:07,524 --> 00:01:13,518
we can rewrite 64 as 4 cubed and use power divided by root to simplify. Again,

16
00:01:13,518 --> 00:01:18,810
this part isn't necessary if we know the cube root of 64 is 4. This is one of

17
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:23,950
the ones on our list of perfect cubes. For this third one, we're going to have

18
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:30,540
the cube root of 64 squared. This is our power of 2, and this is our root of 3.

19
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:36,420
We know the cube root of 64 is simply 4. So we're going to have 4 squared. This

20
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:39,605
gives us a final result of 16. Now, you might have done this problem

21
00:01:39,605 --> 00:01:43,775
differently. You might of squared the 64 first. We could have also written our

22
00:01:43,775 --> 00:01:48,630
power inside of the radical first, and then taken the cube root. If we square

23
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:56,118
64, we'll get 4,096. And it turns out that the cube root of 4,096 is still 16.

24
00:01:56,118 --> 00:02:00,908
So, in terms of doing a root first or an exponent first, it doesn't matter.

25
00:02:00,908 --> 00:02:04,684
Usually, it's easiest to take the root first since we can get a smaller number

26
00:02:04,684 --> 00:02:09,316
here, and then square it. This is much harder since I wouldn't really know the

27
00:02:09,316 --> 00:02:15,573
cube root of 4,096 off the top of my head. And, in fact, I definitely don't.
