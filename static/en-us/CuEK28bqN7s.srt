00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,580
Congratulations on completing Stage six.

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:07,960
What we're going to do now is actually use some of the existing code

3
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:14,660
in the official Apache Storm, Storm Starter to implement a RollingCountBolt.

4
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:19,660
This exercise builds on your completed Stage six code, so we'll start here.

5
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:21,410
Again, if you did not complete Stage six.

6
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:24,590
You can always copy the Tweet Topology file from lesson

7
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:26,860
three stage one to begin.

8
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:30,150
Remember as well, to enter you Twitter OAuth credentials.

9
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,160
In this new exercise, we're going to use an existing rolling count

10
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:38,020
bolt from the storm-starter code to visualize rolling tweet counts.

11
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:40,320
In step one, find and

12
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,140
review the rolling count bolt from the standard storm-starter code.

13
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:45,140
From the link provided.

14
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:50,862
And simply copy and pasting the address or searching for

15
00:00:50,862 --> 00:00:56,490
Apache.storm storm-starter, we'll be able to find the RollingCountBolt.

16
00:00:57,770 --> 00:01:00,550
This is an exercise of using.

17
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:02,810
Bolts that we didn't create.

18
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:05,500
But we can use their functionality.

19
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:06,620
So in step two,

20
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:12,014
copy the RollingCountBolt.java, so you can simply copy and paste this.

21
00:01:12,014 --> 00:01:18,990
Add a file, Roling CountBolt.java, and there we go.

22
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:24,300
Next in your text editor, add a new folder under the Storm folder, and

23
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:25,750
label this Tools.

24
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:29,590
So we now have the structure udacity storm tools.

25
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:32,160
Next following along in the written instructions.

26
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:35,540
In Step 4 determine which files from the Storm Starter code is

27
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:38,080
required to run the RollingCountBolt.

28
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:41,770
Copy these dependencies into our tools folder.

29
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:43,520
Where are these files located?

30
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,020
Hint. Take a look at the import statements.

31
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:47,030
In step five.

32
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:51,690
Add the import statement to your copy of the RollingCountBolt And in step six.

33
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:53,520
Without connecting the RollingCountBolt.

34
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,510
Run maven package to check your import process.

35
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:58,360
Next in step seven.

36
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:01,520
Update your topology to ignore the CountBolt and

37
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,040
use instead the RollingCountBolt.

38
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,150
Connect this to your report bolt.

39
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:10,320
Finally, in step eight of the written instructions, build and run your topology.

40
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:14,690
And finally, when you run your topology you'll see a rolling count

41
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:16,250
of real tweets.

42
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:20,910
And once you see your visualization running you'll see that your topology is

43
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:26,970
taking in an outside bolt, can a useful part of your development process.

44
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:27,470
Good luck.
