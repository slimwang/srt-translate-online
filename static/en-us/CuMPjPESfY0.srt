1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,850
We're on our way to plotting the conditional means for

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:06,770
a to months. Remember we're trying to generate this plot again

3
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:10,260
but only for smaller bin widths. We'll have more data points

4
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:13,790
since age will be measured in months rather than in years.

5
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:15,850
Now that we've got our age with months variable from

6
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:18,440
before we can go ahead and use the d apply r

7
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:21,890
functions. To get a new data frame with an average friend

8
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:25,580
count. And the median friend count for each age with months.

9
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,750
So here comes your second programming task. Create a new

10
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:33,350
data frame called PF.FC by age months that contains the mean

11
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:36,050
friend count, the median friend count, and the number of

12
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:38,920
users in each group of age with months. There will be

13
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:41,290
detailed instructions on this on the next page. And an

14
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:44,220
example of what your output should look like. Now this is

15
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:47,100
one of the more challenging programming exercises. So if you get

16
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:50,940
stuck, check out the instructor notes for two hints. This exercise

17
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:54,420
will also be automatically graded and will check the output of your data frame.
