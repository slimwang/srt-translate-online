1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:02,860
Okay, so that proof didn't work.

2
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:04,660
Is there one that does?

3
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:05,650
Well no.

4
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:09,070
As it turns out,
the set of languages is uncountable.

5
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:10,950
We'll prove this by contradiction.

6
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:12,730
So, suppose not.

7
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:19,100
That is to say, we'll let L1, L2 be the
set of languages over an alphabet sigma.

8
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:21,160
Here, I'm giving them an enumeration.

9
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:26,600
And we'll also let X1,
X2 etc be the strings in sigma star,

10
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,550
we know that has an enumeration.

11
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:33,100
We are then going to build a table where
the columns correspond to the strings

12
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:38,095
in sigma star, and
the rows correspond to the languages.

13
00:00:38,095 --> 00:00:40,910
In each element in
the table will put a one.

14
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:45,010
If the string is in the language and
we'll put a 0 if it is not.

15
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:48,990
Now we're going to consider a very
sneaky langauge defined as follows.

16
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:55,100
It consists of those strings Xi for
which Xi is not in the language Li.

17
00:00:56,590 --> 00:01:02,200
In effect, we've taken this diagonal
here in the table and just reversed it.

18
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:05,140
Since we're assuming that the set
of languages is countable,

19
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:09,230
this language must be Lk for some k.

20
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:11,530
But is Xk in Lk or not?

21
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:16,730
You see from the table here
we've defined the row Lk such

22
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:20,920
that in every column the entry is just
the opposite of what is on the diagonal.

23
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:25,510
But this diagonal entry can't
be the opposite of itself.

24
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:30,650
If Xk is Lk, then according to the rules
for Lk, it should not be an Lk.

25
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:36,450
On the other hand, if Xk is not an Lk,
then it should be an Lk.

26
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,330
Another way to think
about this argument,

27
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:44,220
is to say that this language here must
be different from every row on the table

28
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:47,270
because it is different
on the diagonal element.

29
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:52,030
In any case we have a contradiction and
can conclude that this enumeration of

30
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:56,580
the languages was invalid since
the rest of our reasoning was sound.

31
00:01:56,580 --> 00:02:00,090
This argument here is known as
the diagonalization trick and

32
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:03,280
we'll see it come up again later,
when we discuss undecidability.
