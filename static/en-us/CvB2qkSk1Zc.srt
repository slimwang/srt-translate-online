1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,810
In the last quiz, you figured out
which select clauses you'd need to

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:05,800
do some particular queries.

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:08,700
Now let's do one of
those queries in SQL.

4
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:11,180
It's time to take attendance at the zoo.

5
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:14,250
We need to know how many of
each species we have, and

6
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:18,500
it would be a big help if we had
the most popular species listed first.

7
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:22,200
Because, they'll take the most time for
the zookeepers to count.

8
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:25,120
We've put a cheat sheet of all
the select clauses we've seen so

9
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:28,822
far, in the instructor notes below
the editor on the next page.

10
00:00:28,822 --> 00:00:30,540
But, you have to put
them together correctly,

11
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:32,619
into a query that makes sense.

12
00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:35,120
Feel free to take a few tries,
using the test round button.

13
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,270
You'll see the result table down below.

14
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:39,420
When you've got it, press Submit,

15
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:41,909
and your query will be tested
against a larger database.

16
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:44,520
So here's the problem.

17
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:49,040
Write a query that returns all the
species in the zoo, and how many animals

18
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:53,880
of each species there are, sorted with
the most populous species at the top.

19
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:58,516
And here's an example,
if the zoo had 4 gorillas, 2 alpaca,

20
00:00:58,516 --> 00:01:02,050
1 brown bear and no other animals,
then we'd get a result like this.
