All the information you need is in the Course wiki,

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:06,190
which you can get to by clicking this icon, found

3
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:09,080
at the top of this screen. In the wiki, hopefully

4
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:12,890
you'll find some information that you find useful. For example,

5
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:16,219
here's a Course Index. If you forget what a construct

6
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:19,090
is, you can click here to review the definition of

7
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:22,730
constructs. You'll also see a Course Schedule if you're taking

8
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:27,168
the class for credit with San Jose State University. If

9
00:00:27,168 --> 00:00:29,220
you're not taking the class for credit, then

10
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:31,100
you don't need to worry about adhering to any

11
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:34,130
deadlines. But if you are, it's better to

12
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:36,120
click on it and see when everything is due.

13
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:42,450
The class officially ends August 9th. You'll also

14
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:45,970
see an Exam Resources page. This tells you the

15
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:48,460
dates of the exams. And again, this is only

16
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:51,400
for students taking the course for credit with San

17
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:54,630
Jose State University. This also gives you resources for

18
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:56,950
the exam, such as a study guide and practice

19
00:00:56,950 --> 00:01:00,450
exam. And importantly, it tells you how to register

20
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:03,530
for the proctored exams. So feel free to read

21
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:08,580
ahead, if you have time. So now if you'd like, click the wiki and explore.

22
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:11,890
You're done with this orientation lesson. And we

23
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:13,940
hope you're really excited to take the class.
