1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,700
If fact, they're all correct.

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:07,250
PCPs do directly care for
their patients like any other physician.

3
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:10,060
They refer their patients
to specialists as needed.

4
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:11,900
We said that.

5
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:14,070
They coordinate all of the care for
their patients,

6
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:15,410
no matter who provides it.

7
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:17,270
We also said that.

8
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:19,220
And they promote patient-centered care.
