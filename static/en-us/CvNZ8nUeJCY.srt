1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,170
We're going to stop here for
a little bit, let you catch your breath.

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:08,130
Go back, review, have a beverage of your
choice, make sure you understand this or

3
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:10,880
just complain that gee,
this seems redundant with what we did

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,100
right before the Kalman filter,
because yes, the math is quite similar.

5
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:16,630
In fact, underneath it's identical.

6
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:20,605
But what we're doing is we're moving
to get to this notion of a normalized

7
00:00:20,605 --> 00:00:24,060
Bayes' rule application as
opposed to the straight Kalman.

8
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:26,210
And then what we're going to do is
we're going to use that particle

9
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:31,230
representation that I showed
you before to, to do this and

10
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:33,710
it'll all become much clearer I hope.
