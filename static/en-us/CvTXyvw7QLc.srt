00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:02,840
Okay, so I bet you know what I'm going to ask you now.

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:05,130
I'm going to ask you to code it up yourself.

3
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:07,110
If you guessed that, you'd be correct.

4
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:09,730
so, let me show you what I did,

5
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:13,600
and then you're going to be able to make a SVM, just like I did.

6
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:17,220
So, what I would suggest, is you head back to Google, just like I did,

7
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:23,330
find this page on the Support Vector Machines' documentation from scikit-learn.

8
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:25,380
Remember, that if you scroll down just a little bit,

9
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:29,350
you'll find this Classification section.

10
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:35,480
And, down here, is the example code that I used to get to get my code running.

11
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:38,800
Now, there's one little hiccup, one little catch.

12
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:43,740
In exactly how we created the classifier, right here.

13
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:47,060
So, what I'm going to do is actually get you started with this

14
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:49,340
line and this line.

15
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:51,680
And, you'll see that there's a little difference in the way

16
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:52,300
that I wrote my code.

17
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:55,827
We're going to be talking about this a lot in the next few videos.

18
00:00:55,827 --> 00:01:01,468
But now it's your job to fit, and make predictions using your classifier.

19
00:01:01,468 --> 00:01:05,319
And then, the last thing that I want you to do is to print out the accuracy of

20
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:08,430
your classifier, the way that we did in Naive Bayes.

21
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:12,532
remember, Naive Bayes the number to beat was about 88.4%.

22
00:01:12,532 --> 00:01:15,594
So, there's, there's an interesting question.

23
00:01:15,594 --> 00:01:16,353
Is an SVM, or

24
00:01:16,353 --> 00:01:20,770
Naive Bayes doing a better job of classifying your terrain in this example?
