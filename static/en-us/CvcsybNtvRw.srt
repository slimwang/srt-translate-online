1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:04,220
Now it's time to launch a settings
activity from the menu item.

2
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:07,555
We need to launch it from two places,
the Main Activity and

3
00:00:07,555 --> 00:00:08,860
the Detail Activity.

4
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:12,280
Afterwards, compile and
run the app to make sure that it works.

5
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:14,180
This is what it should
look like from the.

6
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:16,898
Main Activity,
if you tap on Settings menu,

7
00:00:16,898 --> 00:00:19,840
it should be bring you to
the Settings Activity.

8
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,920
It is expected for it to be blank,
because we haven't populated it yet.

9
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,100
Now let's try the Detail Activity.

10
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:29,842
If you tap on a Forecast,
you can go into the Detail Activity and

11
00:00:29,842 --> 00:00:32,460
then you can go into
the Settings Activity.

12
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:36,460
Complete the task and then verify
that your app behavior is like this.

13
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:38,791
In the directions that
I just provided and

14
00:00:38,791 --> 00:00:42,922
in the following videos of this course,
you'll notice that the settings

15
00:00:42,922 --> 00:00:45,800
activity had an action bar
at the top of the screen.

16
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:49,207
When building your app with the latest
version of the Support library,

17
00:00:49,207 --> 00:00:52,519
the action bar doesn't show up by
default in the Settings Activity.

18
00:00:52,519 --> 00:00:54,463
As a result, it's expected and

19
00:00:54,463 --> 00:00:58,140
correct that your device looks
like this with no action bar.

20
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:01,785
Don't worry, we'll add the action
bar back when we change the theme of

21
00:01:01,785 --> 00:01:03,800
the Settings Activity in lesson five.

22
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,840
