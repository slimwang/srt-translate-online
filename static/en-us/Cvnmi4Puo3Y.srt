1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:02,960
So, Product Hunt has been blowing up.

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,140
What do you think made them so
successful?

3
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:09,210
>> So, Product Hunt is an interesting
story because my contributing author

4
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:11,630
on the book is a guy by
the name of Ryan Hoover,

5
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:14,740
who was working a job at
a startup that he was okay with.

6
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:15,892
He wasn't super happy about.

7
00:00:15,892 --> 00:00:20,486
But Ryan emailed me one day and said,
hey, I've been reading your articles on

8
00:00:20,486 --> 00:00:23,910
TechCrunch, and
I like this consumer psychology stuff.

9
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:25,240
How can I help you?

10
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:27,720
So we got together for
lunch one day, and I said, look,

11
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:28,720
I've got all these articles.

12
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:31,310
I've been thinking about putting
them together in a book.

13
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:34,930
Do you think you could kind of help
me make them into this cohesive book,

14
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:37,070
as opposed to a bunch
disparate articles?

15
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:39,150
And he did.
We worked on it for several months, and

16
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:40,160
he did a fantastic job.

17
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,700
I really enjoyed working with him.

18
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:44,330
Well, there's nobody who understand
the hook model second to me

19
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:45,880
better than Ryan.

20
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:49,610
And the next thing that Ryan did
after we worked on this book

21
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:51,090
was to start Product Hunt.

22
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:55,060
And he designed Product Hunt from
the get-go with the hook model in mind.

23
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:57,080
Now the company is doing
phenomenally well.

24
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,400
I'm lucky enough to be an investor.

25
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:01,580
So full disclosure, I happen to
be a fan for a number of reasons.

26
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:05,670
But, yeah, the app is doing incredibly
well because it was designed with this

27
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:08,050
hook at the early days
of the product design.

28
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:12,940
And of course, Ryan and his team
get 110% of the credit for this.

29
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:15,810
I have the easy part of just
talking about the theory,

30
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:18,110
but they had to actually implement it.

31
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:21,560
But I think they saved
themselves a lot of time and

32
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:24,910
found the right thing
sooner by using the model.

33
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:28,162
>> And now I as a new
entrepreneur can do the same?

34
00:01:28,162 --> 00:01:30,755
>> Right, so again,
I am a little biased here.

35
00:01:30,755 --> 00:01:34,220
But I think it starts by taking
some time to figure out your hook.

36
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:38,320
Before you've laid down any code,
before you've done any wire frames, just

37
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,740
to think about what the core experience
is that you want to turn into a habit.

38
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:46,950
And then ask yourself, do you have the
fundamental characteristics of a habit

39
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:51,530
forming technology, by number one, have
you identified the internal trigger?

40
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:53,330
Do you know your users' itch?

41
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:55,900
Number two,
what's the external trigger that

42
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:59,700
gives the user some piece of
information to do the intended action?

43
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,567
Number three,
what's the intended behavior, and

44
00:02:02,567 --> 00:02:04,791
how can it be made as
simple as possible?

45
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:08,815
Number four, the variable reward is how
are you giving the user what they want,

46
00:02:08,815 --> 00:02:12,330
scratching their itch, and yet
leaving them wanting more.

47
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:15,400
And then finally, the investment phase,
the fifth question,

48
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:19,560
is what's the bit of work that the user
does to prompt the next action,

49
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,310
to load the next trigger, and
to store value in the product.

50
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:24,922
And if you can answer
those five questions, and

51
00:02:24,922 --> 00:02:28,591
you have this core hook in your mind,
you can design accordingly.

52
00:02:28,591 --> 00:02:32,190
And it becomes much easier to
build the right thing sooner.

53
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:35,560
>> Can I use the same model
on existing products?

54
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,720
>> Sure.
So,

55
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,690
it's a little bit more
difficult because as you know,

56
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:41,800
once you've built a product,
it's kind of hard to change it, right?

57
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,220
You've done all the architecting.

58
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:46,130
People have worked
hundreds of hours on it.

59
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:50,130
It's harder to change and so,
what oftentimes I see people doing is

60
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:53,810
I'll get emails from an entrepreneur or
a product manager.

61
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:56,865
And they'll say to me look, we've been
struggling with this product, and

62
00:02:56,865 --> 00:03:00,080
until we read your book, we couldn't
figure out why people weren't using it.

63
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,304
Right, we put so
much effort into building it, and

64
00:03:02,304 --> 00:03:04,050
we didn't know what was going on.

65
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:06,450
A few customers were telling
us they really liked it,

66
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:08,180
but even they weren't using it.

67
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:11,720
So then the book can become a diagnostic
tool where you can figure out oh,

68
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14,040
this is why people aren't coming back.

69
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,870
We haven't identified
the right internal trigger.

70
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:17,440
The external trigger isn't effective.

71
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,240
The action is too difficult.

72
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,880
The reward isn't very rewarding.

73
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:25,170
Or we're not asking people for
the investment at the right time.

74
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:26,570
So then it becomes a diagnostic tool,
and

75
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:29,410
then you can of course
correct from there.

76
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:31,753
>> So what hooks does Product Hunt have?

77
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:36,150
>> Sure, so
I think Product Hunt has a great hook.

78
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:38,070
It's something that people
use on a daily basis.

79
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:41,200
I think their hook is very reliant
on this external trigger of

80
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,180
getting an email.

81
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:46,760
So you get this daily email from
Product Hunt that says hey,

82
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:50,260
here's the latest and
greatest in technology products.

83
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:54,770
The action then is to open the email and
to reveal the variable reward.

84
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:58,380
Now, the variable reward is this
uncertainty about, well what is it?

85
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:00,040
What is the latest and greatest, right?

86
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,610
You're looking through all these various
products to see one that might be

87
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:03,680
interesting to you.

88
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,957
You click on one of those products.

89
00:04:04,957 --> 00:04:08,421
If you go to the Product Hunt discussion
page, there's all these discussions

90
00:04:08,421 --> 00:04:11,530
happening about people talking with
the founders of these products.

91
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:14,040
There's this great community
formed around these products.

92
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:17,430
And the more you interact with
that community by commenting,

93
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:21,779
by sharing things to that community,
by creating collections,

94
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:25,810
all of these things load
the next trigger and store value.

95
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:28,378
So the next time it won't be
your daily digest anymore.

96
00:04:28,378 --> 00:04:32,188
Now it'll be an email from oh, this is
your friend who you trust, who just

97
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:36,130
posted something to Product Hunt
prompting you to come back again, right?

98
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:38,930
That's a piece of information
that you've given the company

99
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:42,390
that can now send you through that
four steps of the hook once again.

100
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:45,797
The more you use the product, and
this is where I think investors think

101
00:04:45,797 --> 00:04:48,224
the company can grow
outside of just technology,

102
00:04:48,224 --> 00:04:49,750
is that it learns your tastes.

103
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,051
It learns what you're into.

104
00:04:51,051 --> 00:04:55,691
And so hopefully over time that hook
expands into all different kinds

105
00:04:55,691 --> 00:04:57,934
of interesting industry areas.

106
00:04:57,934 --> 00:05:01,330
>> So understanding me and
giving me more relevant results.

107
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:02,010
>> Right, exactly.

108
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,820
That's part of this investment phase.
