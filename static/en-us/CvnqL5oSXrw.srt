00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Here's another challenge--this time you are a golfer.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:10,000
You hit the ball really hard, it goes flying and it lands with some uncertainty that's Gaussian

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
where the distance in expectation is a 100 m and your variance is 30 m².

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
And now you do exactly the same thing again--you hit the ball really hard,

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
it goes flying and has a final position.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Again, you expect it to fly a 100 m with a variance of 40 m².

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Without diving into the mathematics, I'd like you to answer the question first.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 99:59:59,999
For the combined stroke, what do you expect the distance to be?
