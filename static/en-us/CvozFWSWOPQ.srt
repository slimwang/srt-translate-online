1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,054
Well, we know Janet's time is equal to Rohan's time.

2
00:00:04,054 --> 00:00:07,753
So we just set these two expressions equal 
to each other.

3
00:00:07,753 --> 00:00:10,158
Now this is a really powerful concept.

4
00:00:10,158 --> 00:00:13,015
We were able to use a variable for Janet's speed,

5
00:00:13,015 --> 00:00:14,923
relate all this other information,

6
00:00:14,923 --> 00:00:19,513
to come up with an equation relating the time 
for both Janet and Rohan.

7
00:00:19,513 --> 00:00:22,532
This is why it's so important when you tackle 
motion problems,

8
00:00:22,532 --> 00:00:25,273
it's best to organize your information in a chart.

9
00:00:25,273 --> 00:00:28,471
See if you can find relationships between 
the variables

10
00:00:28,471 --> 00:00:30,448
and any numbers that you are given.

11
00:00:30,448 --> 00:00:34,190
In our case, we knew that Janet and Rohan took the same amount of time

12
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:35,719
to get to LAx.

13
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:39,685
So we can set this time equal to this time.
