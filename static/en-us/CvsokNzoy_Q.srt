1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The answer is 0.67.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
The caveat here was that the variance is the square of the standard deviation.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
So, you have to divide 75.36 by the square of 10.6,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 99:59:59,999
which is just a little over 100 and gives us 0.67.
