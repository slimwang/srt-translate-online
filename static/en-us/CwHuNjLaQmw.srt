00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,770
Suppose I give you a set of nine weights
arranged in a three-by-three grid.

2
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:09,160
Again, each of these weights is attached
to a stick of infinite length, and

3
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:11,370
they're connected to their neighbors,
in this case,

4
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:14,320
the north, south, east,
west neighbors, by springs.

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,030
Now, suppose I number
the weights as follows.

6
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:19,269
So, I'm going from zero to eight,
row wise.

7
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:23,860
My question is, what is the graph
Laplacian for this system?

8
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:26,350
Fill in the entries of
the Laplacian here.

9
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:28,550
As usual,
if you think an entry should be zero,

10
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:30,510
you can just leave it blank
to save you some typing.
