1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The answer is "yes."

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
In this part of the state space, we are obviously entering values that are too small,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
but the heuristic is admissible if h(x) is lower than the cost-to-goal.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
It would have been inadmissible if the values over here were much larger

5
00:00:16,000 --> 99:59:59,999
than the values we want them to be.
