This pie chart here, shows whether you and

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:06,430
many of your fellow classmates think you look like

3
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:10,050
your mom, your dad, both parents or you're not

4
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:13,310
sure. In my mind, I would imagine that there

5
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:15,510
would be roughly equal number of students who

6
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:17,330
think they look like either their mom of their

7
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:19,750
dad. But based on that and looking at the

8
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:22,000
results here Do these results surprise you at all?
