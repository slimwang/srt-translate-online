00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:05,490
Now lets compare the MESI,
MOSI, and MOESI protocols.

2
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:06,950
We have three cores and

3
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:11,840
we start off with block A being in
the invalid state in all three caches.

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,930
Suppose that we have sequence of axises.

5
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:16,520
Core one reads A.

6
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:18,500
Core one, then writes A.

7
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:21,660
Core two reads A then writes A.

8
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:24,330
Core three then reads A.

9
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:26,770
Core one, then reads A.

10
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:29,080
And core two also reads A.

11
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:31,323
Assuming that A's the only
thing we access so

12
00:00:31,323 --> 00:00:33,507
we don't have to worry
about replacing A for

13
00:00:33,507 --> 00:00:37,750
these caches unless it needs to
be replaced because of coherence.

14
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:40,030
How many memory reads and

15
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:45,290
Bus requests do we have in
this sequence of events for

16
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:51,090
MESI, MOSI, MOESI protocols?
