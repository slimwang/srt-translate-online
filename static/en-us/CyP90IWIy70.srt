1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:05,010
So, here we are in the text
editor working on forum.py.

2
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:11,630
We've got some HTML down here, and we've
got some web server code down here,

3
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:14,560
and back up at the top it looks like
there's actually another module,

4
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:16,659
forumdb, for the database code.

5
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:20,510
So if we look over at forumDB.py,

6
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:23,670
we'll actually see rather
a lack of database code.

7
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:28,590
It looks like we're currently using
just a Python list to store the posts.

8
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:30,590
No wonder they went away when
we restarted the server.

9
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:38,230
So this AddPost function,
inserts a topple into our database list.

10
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:44,290
And the GetAllPosts function, transforms
the list into a list of dictionaries.

11
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:46,700
Where the content key
points to the post content.

12
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:51,140
And the time key points to
the time it was posted.

13
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:54,931
Over in forum.py,
if we look in the view function,

14
00:00:54,931 --> 00:00:58,730
we'll see where
forumdb.GetAllPosts is called.

15
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:03,470
And then down in the post function,
we'll see where AddPost is called.

16
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:06,740
We don't need to edit any
of the forum.py code,

17
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:10,190
because everything that talks about
the database is over in forum.db.

18
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:13,870
So what we need to do is change
this database code up here,

19
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:16,210
to actually use a real database.

20
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:18,180
So on the next page,
you're going to do exactly that.
