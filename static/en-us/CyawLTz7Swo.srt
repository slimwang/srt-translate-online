00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:04,059
For either the Super Duper Shopping App,
or your own idea, go out and

2
00:00:04,059 --> 00:00:05,240
conduct user research.

3
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:09,190
Once you've done that, I want you to
create a discussion post in the thread,

4
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:12,930
Conducting User Research,
that addresses these two questions.

5
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:15,480
First, what did you
learn about your idea?

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,920
And second, what did you learn
about conducting user research?

7
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:21,540
Remember that keeping users
close to your product

8
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:24,180
is important throughout the process.

9
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:26,380
So be sure to take the time to do this.

00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:28,330
