00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:04,190
Thanks Fredo for telling us about the importance of proper dessert selection.

2
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:06,290
So let's choose our desserts now.

3
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:09,830
The earliest platform version that our Apple support is Gingerbread.

4
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:12,860
At the current time, choosing Gingerbread means we can cover over 99%

5
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:16,070
of the devices active on Google Play Store.

6
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:19,690
It's also the cutoff for using Google Play Services for things like maps and

7
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:22,540
location, and the Android support library.

8
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:26,400
The support library package offers an implementation of UI features that were

9
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,025
added in later releases of Android,

10
00:00:28,025 --> 00:00:32,040
but now can be used on older versions of the platform, so it's really useful.

11
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,480
Notice that we picked the latest version of Gingerbread with API level 10,

12
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:39,220
because it contains additional bug fixes that API level 9 doesn't have.

13
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:40,567
Then we can go ahead and click Next.

14
00:00:44,746 --> 00:00:47,980
We're going to choose the template Blank Activity with Fragment.

15
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:51,430
For background context, an activity serves as a presentation layer for our UI.

16
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:54,937
And the fragment represents a behavior or portion of the screen.

17
00:01:14,224 --> 00:01:17,431
And now we have an option to modify the names of the files that will be

18
00:01:17,431 --> 00:01:19,360
autogenerated from the wizard.

19
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,790
The name of our activity is MainActivity, and

20
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:26,310
the layout will come from activity_main, which is an XML file.

21
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:27,630
In a similar fashion,

22
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:32,260
the fragments layout will come from fragment_main, which is also an XML file.

23
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:33,550
I'm going to do a small change for

24
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:37,210
the name of the menu file to be called main.xml.

25
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:40,810
Because on an older version of Android Studio that was the default name.

26
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:42,220
Then we go ahead and hit Finish.

27
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:44,890
And now you should have a newly created Sunshine app

28
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:46,640
with the files on the left here.

29
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,130
By default you may see the Android view of the files,

30
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:51,410
which is a flattened version of the project structure, and

31
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:54,480
it highlights the key Android source files that you'll need to edit.

32
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:57,610
In this course, though, we're going to be using the project view because that's

33
00:01:57,610 --> 00:01:59,710
what we had on the older version of Android Studio.

34
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:01,990
You can choose any view that you prefer, though.

35
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:04,470
Make sure you wait for the gradle build to finish.

36
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:07,480
If you have any errors, you can check the guide in instructor notes below.

37
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:10,169
As a tip, you can check the build.gradle file,

38
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:12,390
which is located under the app folder.

39
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:15,340
You want to make sure that the compile sdk version and the target

40
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:19,950
sdk version are both pointing at the latest stable version of the platform.

41
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:24,110
In this case, it's 21 for the Android 5.0 Lollipop release.

42
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:25,060
Once it's done building,

43
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:28,270
we can add a custom app icon that's more fitting for our weather app.

44
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:31,900
Right click on the app folder and click New Image Asset.

45
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:35,280
You can choose from any of the clip art options, or

46
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,560
you can use the one that we provide in the download below.

47
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,120
Then use a placeholder icon we provide in a download below.

48
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,600
And this will show up in the All Apps screen, so

49
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,380
that clicking on this App icon will launch our app.

50
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:50,870
It will also show up in the Overview space if Sunshine is one of

51
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,540
your most recent tasks.

52
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:56,970
The other ways you might see this app icon, is in the Action bar of our app.

53
00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:00,060
In certain videos of this course that were filmed earlier,

54
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:05,165
on KitKat by default the Action bar shows the App icon.

55
00:03:05,165 --> 00:03:07,270
With material design on Lollipop and

56
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:10,170
later, the app icon doesn't show up a default anymore.

57
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:12,090
So don't worry if you don't see it.

58
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:15,920
It's fine, and we're going to be styling Action bar later in lesson five anyways
