00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,302
So here's a simple question.

2
00:00:01,302 --> 00:00:06,331
Edges seem to occur at "change boundaries" that are related to the shape or

3
00:00:06,331 --> 00:00:07,675
the illumination.

4
00:00:07,675 --> 00:00:10,244
Which is not such a boundary?

5
00:00:10,244 --> 00:00:12,046
An occlusion between two people.

6
00:00:12,046 --> 00:00:15,683
So I'm here and somebody else is there, there's an occlusion between me.

7
00:00:15,683 --> 00:00:18,552
A cast shadow on the sidewalk.

8
00:00:18,552 --> 00:00:22,020
A crease in a piece of paper or a stripe on a sign.
