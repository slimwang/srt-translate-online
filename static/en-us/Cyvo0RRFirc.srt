1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The answer is the third choice, and it's really only necessary to provide the nonce,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
but it's helpful to provide the k value as well.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
What B needs to check--once this nonce is provided

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
B can check that the incription using A's public key of the output, which is the y2 value,

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
with the nonce added--that was the part that Alice removed.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
What Bob needs to do is check that that output is equal to x of k.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
And that value was provided directly to B, because all of the inputs from two links ago,

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
went into this mix as well as the outputs from A.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
This proves to B that for that particular output that B asked for,

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
that that corresponds to one of the inputs to A.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
We can do the same thing all the way down the chain.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
That means that A will provide its outputs both to B and C.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
C will be able to verify that B did the mix correctly by picking some random ones,

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
and having B prove that they're correct.

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
And at the final stage, B will provide its outputs to C as well as some validator

16
00:01:05,000 --> 99:59:59,999
who can validate that C did the correct thing.
