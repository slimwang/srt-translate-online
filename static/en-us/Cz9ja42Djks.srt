1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:02,120
In the previous lesson,

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:05,970
you saw how you can control the flow of
the program with conditional statements.

3
00:00:05,969 --> 00:00:10,059
Basically, if a certain condition is
true, execute this block of code.

4
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:13,130
Otherwise, execute this
other block of code.

5
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:16,730
>> But there are often times when
you want to execute a block of code,

6
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:19,769
not once, but
maybe a hundred times, or more.

7
00:00:19,769 --> 00:00:22,640
Maybe you're a teacher who needs
to calculate the grades for

8
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,289
all of your students.

9
00:00:24,289 --> 00:00:28,762
You might have 170 of them, or
maybe you have 300 Facebook friends,

10
00:00:28,763 --> 00:00:33,026
and you want to calculate the number
of mutual friends for each friend.

11
00:00:33,026 --> 00:00:36,581
Or maybe you just want to
count to a million because who

12
00:00:36,581 --> 00:00:39,368
wouldn't want to count to a million?

13
00:00:39,368 --> 00:00:42,849
>> Writing code to do these kinds
of tasks could result in hundreds,

14
00:00:42,848 --> 00:00:47,039
thousands or millions of lines of code,
all doing pretty much the same thing.

15
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:51,140
In this lesson, you will learn how to
use JavaScript loops to repeatedly

16
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:52,380
execute a block of code.
