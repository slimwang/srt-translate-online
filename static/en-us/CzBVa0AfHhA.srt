00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,800
Just to check your understanding so
far, take a few moments to work out

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:06,760
the solution to the following
system of equations.

3
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:14,343
The system consists of -x+y+z=-2,

4
00:00:14,343 --> 00:00:18,976
x-4y+4z = 21, and

5
00:00:18,976 --> 00:00:23,404
7x-5y-11z=0.

6
00:00:23,404 --> 00:00:27,598
Please enter the solution by entering
the x coordinate, y coordinate, and

7
00:00:27,598 --> 00:00:29,510
z coordinate in the answer boxes.
