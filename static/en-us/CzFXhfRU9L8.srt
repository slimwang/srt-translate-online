1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:02,610
We're getting near the end of
lesson one in this course.

2
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:05,939
And in a normal course, after finishing
lesson one, you would go on and

3
00:00:05,939 --> 00:00:07,560
watch lesson two.

4
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:08,740
But we don't have a lesson two.

5
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:11,420
In fact,
this is the only lesson in the course.

6
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:15,370
Where you would usually find lessons
you'll instead find a curated library of

7
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:16,400
research publications,

8
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,340
media articles, original interviews,
and things to help you

9
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:22,870
develop your understanding of whatever
topics you're most interested in.

10
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:25,970
In this course, instead of watching
a series of lessons in some sequential

11
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:29,880
order, you'll instead find your way
through this library however you want.

12
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,670
Choose the topics that are most
interesting to you and

13
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:32,790
really delve into them.

14
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:33,500
Read about them.

15
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,010
See if you can find your own sources for
them.

16
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:37,180
If you have any questions on
what you should go into or

17
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:38,420
what you should read about.

18
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:40,190
Ask your mentor,
ask your classmates, ask me, and

19
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:42,810
we'll help you guide you
through the course library.

20
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:46,270
But the goal is that your trajectory in
this course is really determined by you.
