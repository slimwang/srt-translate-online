1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,520
So in TCSEC we know that
D was the basic one.

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:04,900
Really had to do nothing.

3
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:09,330
For C you had to implement some security
functions, including discretionary

4
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:13,170
access control, but you didn't have
to do mandatory access control.

5
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:16,900
For mandatory access control,
if you did, you could go to B.

6
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:21,970
If you don't implement mandatory access
control, you can't be higher than C.

7
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:23,430
The best you can do is C.

8
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:29,210
So if you don't support MAC, you cannot
be in a TCSEC division higher than C.

9
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:30,830
This is the answer.

10
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:34,110
Automatically also means you can't
be higher than D, so this is

11
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:38,270
somewhat poorly formulated question, but
you could be higher than D actually.

12
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:42,950
You could be in C, even if you don't
implement MAC, which is higher than D.

13
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:46,640
So the only option that you should
be checking here is the second one,

14
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,290
which is C.
