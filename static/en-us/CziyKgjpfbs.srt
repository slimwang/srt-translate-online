1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:04,350
So libraries,
what exactly do we mean by a library?

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:07,470
I love books but that's not the kind
of library we're talking about.

3
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:11,490
Instead, a library is a packaged
collection of reusable code which

4
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:14,950
you include in your app rather
than starting from scratch.

5
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:17,710
We've already used a few
libraries with Sunshine.

6
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:20,250
We used AppCompat in
Android Fundamentals One

7
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:23,840
to build a consistent look and
feel across all API levels.

8
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,620
And the Support Library Annotations,

9
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:29,310
just recently, to add a little
bit more type safety to our code.

10
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:33,520
We certainly could have done all that
ourselves, or skipped it entirely, but

11
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,530
libraries can often help you
achieve the best user experience

12
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:41,030
without you writing and
maintaining a ton of extra code.

13
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:45,940
Even better, Popular libraries often
have a strong community following and

14
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:49,120
a large number of people who can
help you answer your questions.

15
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,334
Not usually the case with your own code.
