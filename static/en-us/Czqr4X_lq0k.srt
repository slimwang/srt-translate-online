1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:02,400
Looks like we're getting
a call from Mike.

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:04,090
I was wondering when he'd appear next.

3
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:06,050
Mike, what can I do you for sir?

4
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:08,700
>> Well, you've explain the cache and
the install event.

5
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:11,120
Sounds like something for
the student to put together.

6
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,010
>> Couldn't agree more.

7
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:13,130
Take it away.

8
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:13,910
>> To begin,

9
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:17,360
you'll probably want to get your copy of
Witter into the same state as Jake's.

10
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:20,280
To do that, open a command
prompt to the project folder and

11
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:24,080
run git reset --hard to remove
any local changes you have.

12
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,210
Then git checkout task-install.

13
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:28,078
Let's take a look at the code.

14
00:00:28,078 --> 00:00:35,210
In public/js/sw/index.js there's
an array of URLs to cache there.

15
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:40,610
Your task is to cache those URLs
in a cache named wittr-static-v1.

16
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:43,760
Remember to have dev tools open and
use force update on reload, so

17
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,430
you only need to refresh
once to see changes.

18
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:49,430
You can also verify the state
of the cache in dev tools.

19
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:52,430
Click on the resources
panel then cache storage.

20
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:54,950
Hopefully you'll see
your cache in there.

21
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:57,640
Once you've got it working,
head over to the settings page and

22
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:00,870
type install cached into
the test field and press enter.

23
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:02,330
This will confirm its all working.
