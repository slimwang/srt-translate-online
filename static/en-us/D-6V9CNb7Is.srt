00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:02,560
Let's go over the solution together.

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:07,070
First, at the top of the screen, we have
this blue envelope with a check box.

3
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:11,724
This is an image, so
this is what we call an ImageView.

4
00:00:11,724 --> 00:00:14,572
Next, we have these three
pieces of text, and

5
00:00:14,572 --> 00:00:19,321
they're three different text views,
because they each have different font

6
00:00:19,321 --> 00:00:22,043
styles in terms of font size and
font color.

7
00:00:22,043 --> 00:00:26,259
And they're also positioned in three
different places on the screen,

8
00:00:26,259 --> 00:00:28,120
so we mark these as TextViews.

9
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:31,940
The last one here is a button that
the user can tap to sign in, so

10
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:32,479
we choose Button.

11
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:36,260
Good job if you got
those answers correct.

12
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:38,580
But if not, no worries,
we're going to practice some more.
