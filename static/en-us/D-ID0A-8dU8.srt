00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,070
So let's first dive into Novel Illumination.

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:06,260
What I'm going to do is, I'm going to introduce this concept very simply first.

3
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:09,790
and then we're going to look at that example in much more detail and, and

4
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:12,800
those examples some of these details will be repeated again.

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,290
So we just have a 3D scene.

6
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:16,440
What I can do is, I can put a photo cell,

7
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:20,340
to be able to capture all the rays of light that are going into this photocell.

8
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:22,750
And of course that is going to generate an image.

9
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:25,540
Of course what I could do to illuminate this scene,

10
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:27,470
now of course it's already naturally illuminated.

11
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:29,650
But I could actually do something different.

12
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:31,440
That is I can put a projector, and

13
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:36,010
what this projector is doing is, basically illuminating the scene, and

14
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:40,550
what we can do is of course this can be considered a controllable light source,

15
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:45,790
but what we can also do in front of it, is create some sort of a modulator.

16
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:48,120
Which is in essence a controllable aperture.

17
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:52,190
Which basically would mean is, it would open different regions of this

18
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:57,060
modulated region, depending on what kind of computer code we will send it.

19
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:00,860
So, in essence what I can do is, I can basically illuminate just this part and

20
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:03,960
close all of it, and therefore the light would come from here, and

21
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,370
through here and hit the scene, just that ray of light, as shown here.

22
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:10,860
So, only this ray of light from this projector is illuminating the scene.

23
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:15,290
Of course I can computer control and move this light source within this region.

24
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:18,790
This is in essence what it means by an aperture, is I'm basically opening only

25
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:21,730
the regions and I know exactly which region I'm opening.

26
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:25,710
And I can of course move this in a predefined manner depending on

27
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:26,830
what I want to do.

28
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:29,470
We'll see this again in a bit, but I just want to setup the situation.

29
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:31,640
So this is what novel illumination means.
