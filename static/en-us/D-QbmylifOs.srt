Did you predict ln of 3 minus ln of 7? If so, you were right. Let's check out

2
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:10,825
the values of each of these and see what we get. First, let's find natural log

3
00:00:10,825 --> 00:00:16,105
of 3 over 7. So we press the ln button on the calculator, and then 3 divided by

4
00:00:16,105 --> 00:00:23,330
7. Interesting. We get negative 0.8472, and so on and so forth. Let's write

5
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:27,790
that down. So, now we've got one side of our equation into number form. Let's

6
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:32,995
check out the other side now on the calculator. Okay, so we want ln of 3 minus

7
00:00:32,995 --> 00:00:38,708
ln of 7. I've got it plugged in right, so let's press equals. And sure enough,

8
00:00:38,708 --> 00:00:42,748
we get exactly the same decimals we have over here. So, our calculator has

9
00:00:42,748 --> 00:00:48,044
helped us confirm this prediction. ln of 3 over 7 is equal to ln of 3 minus ln

10
00:00:48,044 --> 00:00:49,783
of 7.
