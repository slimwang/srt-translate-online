1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
For this quiz, I just want to make sure that you understand

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
the definition of the clustering coefficient.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
So I'd like you to compute the clustering coefficient for a node in this graph.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Now, this graph is inspired by the flight graph for a major imaginary airline in the United States.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:28,000
And it has flights that go between Seattle, Los Angeles, Dallas, Chicago, Pittsburgh, Atlanta,

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Raleigh-Durham, Philadelphia, and Providence.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
This is just kind of a random selection of big cities in the US, but with emphasis on places I've lived.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
As usual, I've drawn edges between cities. In this case, if there is a flight between them.

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
And what we'd like you to compute for this example

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
is the clustering coefficient for Chicago with the airport code ORD.

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
So compute that quantity and write it in the box.
