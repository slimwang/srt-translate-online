00:00:03,048 --> 00:00:07,424
perceived organizational support. Perceived organizational support is an

employees belief that their organization appreciates them and supports them in

4
00:00:10,892 --> 00:00:15,948
their contributions and their well being. Employees that feel that their

00:00:15,948 --> 00:00:19,020
employer actually cares about them and supports them feel less stressed and

6
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:23,150
enjoy their jobs more. Than those, who feel that their employer doesn't care

00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:23,980
about them.
