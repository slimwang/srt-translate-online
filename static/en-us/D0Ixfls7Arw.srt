1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,210
Consider now the results
of this thought experiment.

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:08,530
Our casino enabled us to allocate
our 1,000 tokens to 1,000 tables.

3
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:11,320
We looked at two extreme cases.

4
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:15,190
One where we put a small bet
on all 1,000 tables, and

5
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:18,620
another where we put all
our money on one table.

6
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:22,970
We saw that the expected return was
the same in both cases, about $20, but

7
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:28,060
the risk was substantially higher for
the single bet case.

8
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:32,509
This was true for both type of risk that
we looked at, risk to lose everything,

9
00:00:32,509 --> 00:00:34,120
and risk as standard deviation.

10
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:36,510
When we consider risk and

11
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:40,090
reward together,
we come away with three lessons.

12
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:43,830
One, higher alpha generates
a higher sharpe ratio.

13
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:48,580
Two, more execution opportunities
provides a higher sharpe ratio.

14
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:52,980
And three, sharpe ratio grows
as the square root of breadth.
