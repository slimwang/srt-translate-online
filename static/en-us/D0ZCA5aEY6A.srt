00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,700
So far, you've shown the following lower
bound on the running time of matrix

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:06,455
multiplied with respect
to communication.

3
00:00:06,455 --> 00:00:08,200
It assumes square matrices and,
furthermore,

4
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:11,970
that every node holds an equal
part of a matrix operation.

5
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:15,040
Given this information,
can you figure out what goes here?

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:19,300
Put another way, can you determine
a lower bound on the number of messages

7
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:20,790
that a node must send?

8
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:24,200
I want you type your
answer symbolically.

9
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:27,290
You can use our usual shortcuts
like square root of x for

10
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:30,950
root x, or x carat y for x to the y.
