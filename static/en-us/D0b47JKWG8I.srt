1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,080
I'm here with My Friend Michael who has night terrors. So Michael, when did you

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:04,625
figure out you had night terrors?

3
00:00:04,625 --> 00:00:09,971
>> When I was about 13 in my teen years and found out I was experiencing them a

4
00:00:09,971 --> 00:00:15,074
few times a week, even sometimes, like three times in a night, and my parents

5
00:00:15,074 --> 00:00:20,795
just took me to the pediatrician.

6
00:00:20,795 --> 00:00:23,205
>> So what's it like to to live with night terrors?

7
00:00:23,205 --> 00:00:31,004
>> It's exhausting. It's exhausting for me, it's exhausting for my wife. And like

8
00:00:31,004 --> 00:00:35,096
when I was living with my parents, like family members just because they're

9
00:00:35,096 --> 00:00:40,615
really intense. And at one point, I was having them every night, like sometimes

10
00:00:40,615 --> 00:00:44,899
three times a night, but pretty much on a regular basis and that's, you know,

11
00:00:44,899 --> 00:00:51,782
waking everybody up having to deal with the situation. And then, for myself,

12
00:00:51,782 --> 00:00:56,198
feeling like I was asleep the whole time, but really, I'm up sprinting around

13
00:00:56,198 --> 00:01:00,545
screaming my lungs off at whatever was going on and, and not, not knowing the

14
00:01:00,545 --> 00:01:05,640
next morning like why I was exhausted.

15
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,665
>> And what's it like to have a night terror episode?

16
00:01:07,665 --> 00:01:12,182
>> Sometimes, they are totally fuzzy. I don't know what I did at all, until

17
00:01:12,182 --> 00:01:17,127
somebody wakes me up and tells me. Other times, you would remember everything

18
00:01:17,127 --> 00:01:20,909
and, and the one that was the most terrifying for me, because, I was the only

19
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:24,813
one that would wake myself up from them was when somebody was coming after me,

20
00:01:24,813 --> 00:01:31,832
whether it was maybe it was like a giant spider. It was like a person like

21
00:01:31,832 --> 00:01:35,602
lurking in the room and you just be totally still, eyes wide open really

22
00:01:35,602 --> 00:01:40,832
sweating. And, I was afraid for my life that if I budged or moved at all that

23
00:01:40,832 --> 00:01:44,924
this, this spider or this person or whatever it was would come after me and,

24
00:01:44,924 --> 00:01:52,124
and kill me or whatever. And, those were terrifying because you're just, you're

25
00:01:52,124 --> 00:01:58,743
frozen and you're seeing everything. Nobody's waking me up, nothing. I'm just

26
00:01:58,743 --> 00:02:05,558
still. All by myself and having to wake up from that on my own. The consistent

27
00:02:05,558 --> 00:02:10,045
thing no matter if somebody wakes me up or if waking up myself from those ones

28
00:02:10,045 --> 00:02:16,535
that are still, you're just always the next day, bags under the eyes. You're

29
00:02:16,535 --> 00:02:20,751
just tired all the time, because you're, you're, you're running around in your

30
00:02:20,751 --> 00:02:25,239
sleep, like you're, you're, you're exerting energy in a time when you should be

31
00:02:25,239 --> 00:02:29,659
relaxed and your body should be refreshing itself, like you should be getting

32
00:02:29,659 --> 00:02:37,151
energy back. Another thing that I, I've discovered is I get, I get really mad.

33
00:02:37,151 --> 00:02:41,506
I'm like very aggressive when, I'm like, coming back out of that, that dream or

34
00:02:41,506 --> 00:02:48,440
whatever's going on. That I'm very I'm just very pissed off. I'm yelling at my

35
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:54,578
wife, like, stop it, no, I'm not, just leave me alone. And then the next thing

36
00:02:54,578 --> 00:02:59,600
that comes into that phase is just total shame. I'm just very embarrassed, kind

37
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:04,297
of curl up, just I, I don't, I, because I, whatever you see, I swear it's

38
00:03:04,297 --> 00:03:10,511
there, I know it's there. It's just like looking at you right now, I swear that

39
00:03:10,511 --> 00:03:14,159
you're there, but then, somebody wakes me up and goes, no you're, you're just

40
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:17,693
having a night terror, like and, and I don't know if that's where it kicks in

41
00:03:17,693 --> 00:03:24,570
that you get mad and, and that I'm aggressive in that way. I, I don't know why,

42
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:29,778
why that feeling comes over me. But it definitely scares me to the fact that I,

43
00:03:29,778 --> 00:03:34,260
I don't want to hurt anybody. Definitely don't want to hurt my wife and I hope

44
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:38,582
it never comes to that. I mean, I even have a little one now, and that's

45
00:03:38,582 --> 00:03:43,188
definitely one thing that terrifies me. If I was to go running out of the room

46
00:03:43,188 --> 00:03:48,534
or something, and God forbid, I, I had something happen to her. And that's one

47
00:03:48,534 --> 00:03:52,502
thing that's always in the back of my mind is you know, I'm kind of, I'm, I'm

48
00:03:52,502 --> 00:03:56,995
bigger guy and what would happen if that happened.

49
00:03:56,995 --> 00:03:59,875
>> Now, is there anything that you want people to know about night terrors?

50
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:02,668
>> The worst thing you can do and, and people that have been around me and

51
00:04:02,668 --> 00:04:05,608
experienced it, the worst thing you can do is to go along with the person,

52
00:04:05,608 --> 00:04:11,430
talking to them, and trying to figure out what's going on. the person will seem

53
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:15,462
coherent, like their eyes will be open, I'll have a full-blown conversation

54
00:04:15,462 --> 00:04:19,116
with somebody, but I'm, I'm sleeping and I don't know what I'm going to do

55
00:04:19,116 --> 00:04:25,214
next, I have no idea. I have no control of this situation. That, what has

56
00:04:25,214 --> 00:04:29,368
control over me is whatever I'm picturing, whether it's spiders, snakes,

57
00:04:29,368 --> 00:04:35,745
whatever that, that's what has control. Not me, the, the situation. If you know

58
00:04:35,745 --> 00:04:38,400
somebody that has it, if it's a family member, somebody that's going to be

59
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,235
around all the time, try to keep the door open, maybe have like a little night

60
00:04:41,235 --> 00:04:45,826
light out in the hallway or something. I know it sounds kind of silly if you

61
00:04:45,826 --> 00:04:48,751
have like like for me, I was a teenager, you know, put a night light, what are

62
00:04:48,751 --> 00:04:53,161
you talking about? But looking back on it, it would have probably been the best

63
00:04:53,161 --> 00:04:56,137
thing for my, my dad and, and people trying to help me out because they could

64
00:04:56,137 --> 00:04:59,065
see me, it was so dark all the time, I'd go sprinting out of the room and they

65
00:04:59,065 --> 00:05:05,658
don't know where I'm at, like you can't see anything. So it's little things

66
00:05:05,658 --> 00:05:10,522
like that, that could help me out. And I don't know, as far as releasing my

67
00:05:10,522 --> 00:05:16,211
stress somehow, kind of kept to myself. I don't know if I, I talked enough to

68
00:05:16,211 --> 00:05:21,480
people to learn how to cope with stress differently. And I think that's what

69
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:25,597
ended happening is I got into the habit of not telling anybody anything. And

70
00:05:25,597 --> 00:05:30,815
that was my way of coping, was going to sleep and thinking about it. So I don't

71
00:05:30,815 --> 00:05:35,129
know if there's other avenues that way, I just haven't figured it out yet.
