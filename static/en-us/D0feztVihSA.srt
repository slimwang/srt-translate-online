00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:05,480
Hello and welcome back to the next module of the operating systems course. And

2
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:09,800
this module is on system recovery. System

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:12,920
crashes can happen due to power failure,

4
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:15,740
hardware, and software failures. As operating system

5
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:19,070
designers, it is essential to understand how

6
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:21,580
to build systems that can survive crashes.

7
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:25,890
In this module, we will discuss technologies

8
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:30,260
that will help us deal with system failures and recover from them. In this

9
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:38,210
module, we will cover three systems. The first one, LRVM suggests providing a

10
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:41,260
persistent virtual memory layer in support

11
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:44,860
of system services. The second one RioVista,

12
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:47,910
suggests how such a persistent layer can

13
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:51,990
be implemented in a performance conscious way,

14
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:54,840
with some ingenuity. The third one,

15
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,490
Quicksilver, suggests a more radical approach.

16
00:00:57,490 --> 00:01:02,130
Making recovery a first class citizen in the design of operating systems.
