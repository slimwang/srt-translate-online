1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,770
So, sometimes it feels like
users are from Earth and

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:05,910
monetization is from Mars.

3
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:07,250
What do we know about users?

4
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:11,220
>> We know that most of
them favor free apps.

5
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:16,180
In 2014, over 90% of the apps that
were downloaded were free apps.

6
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:19,930
Users wish to avoid paying upfront,
but they don't mind paying

7
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:23,730
in the right moment when they see
the value in front of their eyes.

8
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:27,560
This is the reason most apps
are using in app payments.

9
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:28,200
>> Okay.

10
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,600
So users prefer free apps, but

11
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:34,490
they don't mind paying once
the app proves its value.

12
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:38,050
So besides in app purchases,
what other models do we have?

13
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:40,250
>> We have many monetization options.

14
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:43,360
In-app billing,
you can sell digital goods and

15
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:47,050
real goods to your users
from the free app.

16
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:50,720
In app payments,
you let your user purchase item, level,

17
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:54,810
points, special tools from your app.

18
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:58,920
Ads, we got lots of options
with different types like

19
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:03,440
display advertising, in text links,
videos, and many more.

20
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:07,330
The important thing to note here
is that you wish to blend the ad

21
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:09,800
into your experience and
not to interrupt it.

22
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,830
Another opportunity is with affiliate.

23
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:18,810
You could make money by
referring to other services.

24
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:21,640
Ahh, and there's lots of other models

25
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:25,000
if you want to check if they
are appropriate to your case.

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,840
Email campaigns, selling data,
auction, flash sales,

27
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:32,410
merchandising, premium support and
many more.

28
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:34,360
>> That's a lot of models.

29
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:37,080
I mean, how do you know that
you're choosing the right one?

30
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,760
>> It's a real challenge.

31
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:42,400
We will provide more information
that will help you get

32
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,990
to those answers in the next lessons.

33
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:49,470
One thing to take from this lesson is
that your goal is to deliver direct

34
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:51,800
monetization to the right
user at the right time.
