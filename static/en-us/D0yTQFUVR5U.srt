1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:03,740
In this lesson, you learned that
images aren't always necessary.

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:05,490
Which is actually kind of
a funny thing to learn for

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:07,180
a class called responsive images.

4
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:08,119
>> Right.
I mean,

5
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:12,920
mark up alternatives like CSS and icon
fonts provide performant options for

6
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:16,370
design techniques normally
implemented with images.

7
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:20,530
>> And so far, you've simply exlpored
ways to deliver images more effectively.

8
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:23,760
But in the next lesson, you'll explore
a concept called art direction,

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,840
which pushes developers to match image
content to different devices as well.

10
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:28,740
>> Yeah, see you then.
