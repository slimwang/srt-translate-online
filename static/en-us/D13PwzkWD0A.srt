1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,910
So let's take a look at the channel economics.

2
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:06,960
In other words, how are we going to make money?

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:12,160
So let's take a look at a direct sales example.

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:16,950
You have a sales force and you're selling directly to the end consumer.

5
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:23,420
So let's assume that the list price of your product is $100.

6
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:29,320
So one of the first questions in thinking about how to come up with this $100 list price

7
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:35,280
is to understand how much did it actually cost me to manufacture a product.

8
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,100
Now, in the web, it might be the cost my engineers.

9
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:45,870
But in a physical product, it might be the costed bill of materials coming out of my factory.

10
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:53,090
And so let's assume for the sake of discussion that that was $33, $33 to build my product.

11
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:59,590
Next, let's take a look at the cost of my R&D, that is my engineering;

12
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:05,600
the cost of my direct sales people, maybe commissions or direct sales compensation;

13
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:10,950
and then general and administration costs, what it cost me to have leases and lunches

14
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:16,120
and free snacks, and that might be another $20.

15
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:21,780
And so right now it's $53 just to keep the lights on in my building.

16
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:26,660
Now something we should consider is that no end-user pays was priced.

17
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:33,390
So let's assume that this area represents a discount from the list price, let's say 10%.

18
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:39,280
That means your revenue to your company would not be $100 but $90.

19
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:46,710
So wait a minute, you're getting $90 but you spent a total of $53 building the product

20
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:52,920
and keeping the lights on and that leaves right in the middle how much profit you have.

21
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,960
In this case, it would be $37.

22
00:01:55,960 --> 00:02:02,100
So, you're selling costs were embedded here, this was the commission or direct sales costs

23
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:10,310
or whatever you were paying your direct sales people and you made $37 selling directly.
