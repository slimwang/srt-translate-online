1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:08,461
The expression I used is 5 by 698
times 6 by 699 times 7 by 700.

2
00:00:08,461 --> 00:00:13,123
In the first iteration we might
choose any one of the 7 groups among

3
00:00:13,123 --> 00:00:15,130
the 700 possibilities.

4
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,661
Given that we chose a root in
the first iteration, however,

5
00:00:20,661 --> 00:00:25,162
that leaves only 6 roots left to choose
from in the second iteration, and

6
00:00:25,162 --> 00:00:28,810
there are only 699 numbers to
choose from in S, as well.

7
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:31,549
Remember that we are sampling
without replacement.

8
00:00:31,549 --> 00:00:35,578
We don't put back the sample we
chose in the first iteration, so

9
00:00:35,578 --> 00:00:37,528
that we might choose it again.

10
00:00:37,528 --> 00:00:41,130
And the logic for
the last term is the same.

11
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:44,880
We've used up two numbers already,
both of which are roots.

12
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,360
In terms of the probability
theory that we've established,

13
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,130
we can formalize this
argument as follows.

14
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:55,150
Let Ei be the event that the ith
element chosen from S is a root.

15
00:00:55,150 --> 00:01:00,600
The probability that all three samples
are roots is the probability of E1 and

16
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,630
E2 and E3.

17
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:06,000
Which we break up into this
product using the definition

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,250
of conditional probability.

19
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:13,705
We play the same trick with the second
term here to get this expression,

20
00:01:13,705 --> 00:01:19,430
replacing it with the probability of E2
given E1 times the probability of E1.

21
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:25,528
Now, we have the probability of each
event conditioned on the previous ones.

22
00:01:25,528 --> 00:01:27,850
Given that 2 routes have
been chosen already,

23
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:33,530
the probability of picking
another is is 7-2, by 700-2,

24
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:37,210
and we end up with the same argument,
and the same expression as before.
