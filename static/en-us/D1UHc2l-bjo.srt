1
00:00:00,311 --> 00:00:02,100
So now we can take all these five things

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:03,747
and plug them into the formula for b

3
00:00:04,016 --> 00:00:05,015
please do so,

4
00:00:05,067 --> 00:00:06,620
use the formula as shown over here

5
00:00:06,743 --> 00:00:10,000
and calculate for me what b would be.
