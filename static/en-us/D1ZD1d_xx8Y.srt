00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:03,190
So, now that we know where turtle exists within Python, I

2
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:05,810
want to return back to our code. By the way, I

3
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:07,750
had to reduce the font size of the code a little

4
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:10,760
bit, so we could see all of it in the same frame.

5
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:13,160
Now, what we have done thus far is, created an instance

6
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:17,100
of a class called turtle, we called it brad and brad draws

7
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,960
a square. If we can do that, we can make another

8
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:25,506
example or instance of the class turtle. And we can call it,

9
00:00:25,506 --> 00:00:33,170
let's say, angie. There it is. Now, I want angie to draw a circle.

10
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:38,960
A circle of radius, let's say, 100. I also want angie's shape to be in

11
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:44,730
the form of an arrow and I want angie's color to be blue. There

12
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:48,040
it is. So, let me save and run this thing and see how it looks.

13
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:53,710
Aha, it seems we have brad making a yellow square and

14
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:56,770
angie making a blue circle. It seems like we are getting somewhere.
