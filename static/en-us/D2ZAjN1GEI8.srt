1
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:04,160
Engaging with your customer,
isn't always as easy, as it may seem.

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:07,240
Some companies have gotten themselves
into some pretty sticky situations,

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:11,110
because of the lack of thought, they put
into responding to customer feedback.

4
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:15,140
One example, is when Lululemon,
a popular yoga clothes company,

5
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:18,580
blamed their customers for
the flaw in their yoga pants.

6
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:21,800
Their response was not consistent
with the tone or the voice,

7
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,070
the company typically
displays to their customers.

8
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:28,720
When your responding, their goal should
be to attempt to make things right for

9
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:33,210
your customer, or sincerely
offer what ever support you can.

10
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:37,170
You're going to want to keep track of
complaints, suggestions or feedback and

11
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:39,790
use this opinions as options
to improve your product.

12
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,190
Now, when you want to respond
to customers keep in mind

13
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:44,610
the following things.

14
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:49,860
Don't wait too long to respond, but make
sure you're not being overly reactive.

15
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:52,960
When you can,
try to avoid templated responses.

16
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,570
Well, it may be easier for
your team, to just send them out.

17
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:59,200
You want to show each customer
that you appreciate the feedback,

18
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,400
because after all they're only trying
to help you improve your product.

19
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:05,740
And because of this, you should
thank the user for their feedback.

20
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:06,580
If there's a problem,

21
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:10,810
take ownership over that problem,
it is your product, after all.

22
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:13,155
If it's something the customer
could do to improve the problem,

23
00:01:13,155 --> 00:01:15,680
try something like, hey,
your feedback was helpful, or

24
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,940
sorry you're having trouble with,
[INAUDIBLE] Viewing the settings.

25
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:22,620
We may not have been clear enough as to
where you can find it, so try clicking

26
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:26,020
in the lower left hand corner to see
your settings, if it doesn't work,

27
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:31,240
go ahead and reach out to support@ .com
and we'll try to fix it right away.

28
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:34,570
And finally, like I said before,
monitor the situation.

29
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:36,280
Make sure you're tracking
all of the feedback and

30
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:39,270
you want to make sure whatever
problem customers are having,

31
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:40,570
end up being solved.

32
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:42,010
Make sure you're listening
to the feedback and

33
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:44,310
getting the full story
of what's going on.

34
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:47,650
If somebody gives you feedback like,
I like that you offer vet service for

35
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:50,420
my dog but it could be better,
this is really vague and

36
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:52,660
it doesn't really help you build off of.

37
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:55,130
So we,
at Should attempt to reach out and

38
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:59,190
get a better understanding of how we
can improve their customer experience,

39
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:01,820
which could help us in the long run and
make more customers happy.
