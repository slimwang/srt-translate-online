00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:04,698
For this quadratic equation, it's best to factor. We know we can factor since

2
00:00:04,698 --> 00:00:10,215
there are two factors that multiply to negative 12 and sum to negative 1. Those

3
00:00:10,215 --> 00:00:14,490
factors are negative 4 and positive 3. So we can use these as coefficients to

4
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:17,590
rewrite the middle term, and then use factoring by grouping to continue to

5
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:23,676
solve. We set each factor equal to 0, so x could equal negative 1 or x could

6
00:00:23,676 --> 00:00:29,340
equal positive 4 3rds. Amazing work if you found these two solutions.
