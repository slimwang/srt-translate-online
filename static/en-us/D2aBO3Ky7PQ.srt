1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:02,950
Let's do a web search on
how to define behavior for

2
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:05,180
when a list view item gets clicked on.

3
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:12,921
So I'm just going to search up
handle list view item click Android.

4
00:00:12,921 --> 00:00:15,160
Search that.

5
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:17,240
Now this first result
here looks good and

6
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:19,280
notice that it's also
a stack overflow post,

7
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:22,770
so that means it's probably a common
question amongst other developers too.

8
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:24,470
So let's click into that.

9
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:27,620
So the phrasing of the question,
how to handle the click event

10
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:29,890
in list view in Android sounds
exactly like what we need.

11
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:34,030
Now I won't bore you with the details
of reading through the question here.

12
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:36,490
So you can take some time
to read that on your own.

13
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:39,790
But jumping down to the answer here,
it looks like it's very promising.

14
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:44,140
So we have the green checkmark,
as well as quite a number of up votes.

15
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:46,387
Now in this answer code sample,
it says here.

16
00:00:46,387 --> 00:00:51,270
L.V., which stands for the variable name
list view, .set on item click listener.

17
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:54,580
And then it passes in an on
item click listener object.

18
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:57,830
And then following that, it says that
when an item in the list view is clicked

19
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:01,230
on, a new intent is created and
then we started a new activity.

20
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:04,180
So that method sounds
like it could work.

21
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:06,940
But to double check that it's
the recommended way to define click

22
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:10,440
behavior, let's double check in
the official documentation for ListView.

23
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,910
So here I am in the Android developer
documentation in the Develop and

24
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:18,080
Reference section, looking at
the information about ListViews.

25
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,440
So from here I want to search up
explicitly the set on item click

26
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,270
listener method.

27
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:25,870
So this is the first one here.

28
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:29,010
So the description for this method
says that it registers a callback

29
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:32,240
to be invoked when an item in this
adopter view has been clicked.

30
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,310
That sounds correct.

31
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:37,290
So when an item is clicked on,
the listener, what's in here,

32
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:40,860
contains a callback method that will
be called by the Android system.

33
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,970
Now let's click on this
OnItemClickListener

34
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:45,550
to learn more about it.

35
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:48,430
So similar to
the OnClickListener interface,

36
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:52,220
this OnItemClickListener
is also an interface.

37
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:55,800
Recall that in lesson one we learn
that an interface contains one or

38
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:59,520
more abstract methods that we can
use to interact with an object, but

39
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,350
we'll need to define and
implement those methods ourselves.

40
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:06,680
So in this case, we see down here that
the onItemClick listener interface has

41
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:11,050
one abstract method and
that method is called onItemClick.

42
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:14,360
So we need to define what
code goes inside this method.

43
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:18,180
Then the system will then call us back
and execute these instructions that

44
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:21,930
we've put in when a specific item
in our list view has been touched.

45
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:24,340
Let's go back to our
stack overflow example.

46
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:27,600
So here you can see that an on item
click listener object is created when

47
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:31,290
the developer provided their own logic
within the on item click method.

48
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:35,950
So the answer to the first question
is that we call the ListView

49
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:38,220
setOnItemClickListener method.

50
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:40,320
In that method, we'll take in one input,

51
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:44,116
which is a listener with the data
type OnItemClickListener.

52
00:02:44,116 --> 00:02:45,670
Now here's some extra information, but

53
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:49,530
in the documentation you may have
noticed references to an AdapterView.

54
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:52,930
So why does it keep mentioning
AdapterView when we're clearly looking

55
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:53,802
at ListView logic?

56
00:02:53,802 --> 00:02:57,140
Remember in lesson two we
learned that a list view

57
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:59,260
is just one type of adapter view.

58
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:02,720
Other types of adaptor we've looked
at are GridView and spinners.
