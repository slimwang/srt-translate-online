1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:03,340
That's why we have talked about
some of the uses of metacognition.

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:07,190
We can use it to fix errors in
knowledge or reasoning or learning.

3
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:11,600
We can use it to fix gaps in knowledge,
reasoning, or learning.

4
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:13,572
We can use it for strategy integration.

5
00:00:13,572 --> 00:00:15,434
One that we have not yet

6
00:00:15,434 --> 00:00:19,540
talked about is what is the processes
that metacognition uses?

7
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:21,350
What is it's strategy?

8
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:25,700
Well, metacognition can use these
same kinds of reasoning processes

9
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:27,310
that is the surface reasoning goal.

10
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:31,010
That is, case-based reasoning is
a potential strategy for metacognition.

11
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:35,140
Constraint propagation is a potential
strategy for metacognition, and so on.

12
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:39,020
Let us take an example, supposedly if
metacognition comes across a problem and

13
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:41,600
it must select among these strategies.

14
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,260
Metacognition might ask itself,

15
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:47,570
what strategy did I pick the last
time I came across a similar problem?

16
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:49,630
This is case-based
reasoning at a meta level.

17
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:54,690
To complete this example, metacognition
might say the last time I used

18
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:57,550
constraint propagation as a technique
with this particular problem,

19
00:00:57,550 --> 00:00:59,610
this time I'll use constraint
propagation again.

20
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:03,390
As another example,
given a second problem,

21
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:08,570
metacognition may use planning to set up
a plan for using the various strategies,

22
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:11,080
thinking of each of
the strategies as an operator.

23
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,190
>> As a third example, metacognition
might get a new problem and decide to

24
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:18,798
use every single method at it's disposal
to generate a possible solution.

25
00:01:18,798 --> 00:01:21,940
It then might have some heuristics
to test each one of those possible

26
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:23,790
solutions and
figure out which one is best.

27
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:28,650
So then it's using Generate & Test to
select between it's multiple strategies.

28
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:32,510
>> To summarize this part then,
metacognition can use the same reasoning

29
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:35,943
strategies that we have been
studying at the deliberative level.
