There's a key technique in my solution that's very useful in computer graphics.

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:07,278
You could compute both the top and bottom locations in the loop for capsules.

3
00:00:07,278 --> 00:00:10,978
However, a better method is to initially compute the bottom location, and then

4
00:00:10,978 --> 00:00:14,454
on each iteration compute only the top position. At the end of the loop, you

5
00:00:14,454 --> 00:00:18,395
then set this top position into the bottom. Now, bottom is set for the next loop

6
00:00:18,395 --> 00:00:22,188
iteration. The only other clever bit of code here is the realization that the

7
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:25,960
bottom sphere needs to be on for only the first capsule in a string. After that,

8
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:29,718
I set open bottom to true, so that it's never output again for this helix. If

9
00:00:29,718 --> 00:00:33,338
you want to take this exercise to the next level. Rewrite the code so that the

10
00:00:33,338 --> 00:00:36,962
cylinder and sphere geometry is reused throughout the helix. Right now, no

11
00:00:36,962 --> 00:00:40,420
instancing is done, so it's a memory hog. Every capsule creates its own

12
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:44,472
geometry. Another extension is to allow the art parameter to be a floating point

13
00:00:44,472 --> 00:00:47,920
number so you can generate just part of the arc. If you really want to play

14
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,760
around try factors to have the helix become a larger and larger spiral or have

15
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,465
the radius vary with height as a sign curve. Me, I find once I start playing

16
00:00:55,465 --> 00:00:59,139
with procedural modeling that it's hard to stop. If you make something great

17
00:00:59,139 --> 00:01:02,737
consider submitting it into the 3JS library itself for inclusion as a demo. You

18
00:01:02,737 --> 00:01:06,385
can use get hub to make submissions, see the additional course materials for

19
00:01:06,385 --> 00:01:07,373
more information.
