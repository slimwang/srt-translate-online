00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:02,410
So what we're going to to talk about today,

2
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:05,670
is essentially the surface appearance of objects.

3
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:08,600
And, what we mean by that is, you know the question is,

4
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,770
if I've got some surface element, and

5
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:15,280
it's being illuminated by a source, what is it the sensor's going to see.

6
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,700
And the idea is that the image intensity is going to be a function of

7
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:21,760
a couple of things, one is the local shape, and

8
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,680
we can think of the shape as just being the surface normal of a little patch.

9
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,590
Then there is the, surface reflectance, that is,

10
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:32,659
what, what are the properties of the surface that affect the light.

11
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:36,830
And then there is the illumination, that is both the direction and

12
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:38,820
the type of light that's coming in,

13
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:42,700
sort of its intensity, maybe its wavelengths, and those kinds of things.

14
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:47,400
And, the amount of reflection that'll be observed is a function of both,

15
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:51,570
sort of the incoming direction, and the outgoing direction and

16
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:53,540
its relationship to the surface, and

17
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:56,690
we're going to make that a little bit more formal going forward.

18
00:00:56,690 --> 00:01:00,810
So now we're going to do just a tiny bit of, nomenclature with respect to

19
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:04,550
the physics, it's a little bit confusing and later we'll drop some of it, but

20
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:07,230
it's, but it's important to get just a little bit of a basis.
