1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Let's start with door 3, and here the answer is 0.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
You already saw when the curtain was lifted that there is no car.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
How about door 1, and that is a really tricky question.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
For reasons that I'll explain in a minute,

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
it's actually 2/3 or 0.667. It's entirely non-intuitive.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Given that this is the case, what do you think is the number for door 2?

7
00:00:20,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Of course, this is 1 - 2.3, which gives me 1/3 or 0.333.
