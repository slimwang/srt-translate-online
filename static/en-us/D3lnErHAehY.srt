1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Here is the answer.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Let me just re-transform this as is done over here--

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
x1 minus x2 is now +4, and x2 minus x1 is -4.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I have to add +1 over here, -1 over there,

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
+1 in this diagonal element over here, and -1 over here.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Let me just do this.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
These numbers added in transform the first number over here to 2.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
We get a -1 for the off-diagonal elements, and then 1 over here.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Now we add 4 to the 5, which gives us a 9, and a -4 to the 0 gives -4.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 99:59:59,999
This is where we are now.
