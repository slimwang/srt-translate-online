If you got 64 minus 9 y squared, excellent work. This problem was a little bit

2
00:00:04,692 --> 00:00:09,347
tricky, because I switched the signs on the parentheses. But remember with

3
00:00:09,347 --> 00:00:14,198
multiplication, we can switch the order of our parentheses, 2 times 3 is the

4
00:00:14,198 --> 00:00:18,920
same as 3 times 2. The same is true for more complicated expressions, so the 8

5
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:23,830
is my a, and the 3y is my b. A Squared would be 64, we just square 8. Then we

6
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:29,375
have a subtraction sign and then we have b squared, which is 9y squared. Good

00:00:29,375 --> 00:00:31,049
thinking if you got it.
