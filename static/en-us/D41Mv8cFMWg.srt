00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,560
Now that we have a single log equal to a constant, we can finally find j over

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:09,520
c. This will tell us how many times greater the intensity of the earthquake in

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:14,260
Japan was, than the one in California. So please solve for j over c. Round to

4
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:18,555
one decimal place.
