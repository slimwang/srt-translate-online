00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,540
When I need to build something using
materials I shouldn't be breathing in,

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:05,939
I naturally put on a dust mask and
safety goggles.

00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:11,370

By utilizing your build and
editor tools,

11
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:32,299
you can quite heavily improve
the quality output of your coding.

12
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:34,090
Let's talk about the numerous
ways to get there.
