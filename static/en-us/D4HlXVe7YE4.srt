00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:02,090
As show in the previous demo,

2
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:05,310
there are three main steps to
implement inside the for loop.

3
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:08,970
The first one is to read in
the data from the symbol.

4
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:12,050
Make sure you specify
all the parameters.

5
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:16,090
Also notice how I have used
symbol_to_path function

6
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:18,890
to get the path to the CSV file.

7
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:24,030
The next step is to rename the adjacent
close column to the symbol name.

8
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:28,950
And the last step is to join this
new data with the new data frame.

9
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:32,000
Now, we have to take care
of one important thing.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,740
That is,
dropping off the lines from the SPY.

11
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,830
Subset is equal to SPY will ensure that

12
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:42,520
only those rows will be
dropped where SPY is none.

13
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:46,910
Also the statement ensures that
SPY is used as a reference.

14
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:51,230
And that we do not have any
non-values in the SPY column.

15
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:52,860
Let's run it.

16
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:55,080
So here's the output, same as before.
