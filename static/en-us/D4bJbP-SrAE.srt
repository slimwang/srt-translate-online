1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,200
First let's talk a little bit
about camera calibration.

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:04,400
There are two different
types of camera calibration.

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,930
First is a geometric calibration,

4
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:10,890
where we basically are interested when
we look at a 3D scene is how each and

5
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:15,230
every pixel in the real world
is relating to directions,

6
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:20,350
angles, shapes, you know, any kind of
geometric information in the real world.

7
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:23,640
So that requires us to now
calibrate the camera and

8
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,270
the location of the camera with respect
to the scenes and objects in a scene, so

9
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:29,830
we can actually get more 3D information.

10
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:31,130
That's geometric.

11
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:34,420
Of course, we're also interested,
remember from our earlier lectures,

12
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:38,217
to be able to capture radiometric,
photometric, information from

13
00:00:38,217 --> 00:00:43,150
a scene you know, like reflectances and
scattering of light information.

14
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:44,650
Here, basically,
we're interested in each and

15
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:48,930
every pixel related to the radiance
amounts in the real world.

16
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:50,220
You know, what's happening in a scene?

17
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:53,580
What's the exact radiance
value at any point in a scene?

18
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:56,670
How can we capture it
onto a pixel in an image?

19
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:58,960
Again, this is the whole
pipeline we just saw,

20
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:03,130
where we basically want to be able
to go from l all the way to i.

21
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:06,175
Now, we study this a little
bit when we did panaromas.

22
00:01:06,175 --> 00:01:11,370
Sometimes, we might not have ability
to capture everything in a 3D world

23
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:13,750
directly from the sensors so

24
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:17,130
what we want to do now is take a little
bit of a data-driven approach.

25
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:20,230
Basically, that suggests
is let's actually do this

26
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:24,710
by looking at a bunch of images, not
just one image, and use that information

27
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:27,650
as to how things change when I
take a bunch of different images.

28
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:30,080
So, for example, here,
I may have a color pattern,

29
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:32,800
which tells me everything else about
it but I could take a color pattern,

30
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:36,690
a checkered pattern, and
move it around and as I move it around,

31
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:40,390
if knowing a little bit more about the
information in that scene, in this case,

32
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:44,200
of course, the exact nature of the
structure pattern associated here and

33
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,370
if I look at it from the same camera,

34
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:50,030
I should be able to kind of now get
different data, at different points.

35
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:55,140
That basically suggests is that
now I can get how pixel relates to

36
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:59,270
the geometry in a scene by just looking
at a whole lot of other images.

37
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:01,780
Well, the same thing is true
in the case of photometric.

38
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:04,900
This was relevant when we looked
at the whole case of paranomas.

39
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:08,710
This is more relevant in the kind of
world of HDR, where basically now we're

40
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:13,800
trying to relate is how the radiance of
any point on the scene is accounting for

41
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,450
a specific pixel intensity and we do
this by calibrating a camera by getting

42
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:23,380
a lot of data by the same scene
by having different images.

43
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:26,950
Remember, again, these were both issues
that help us when we start thinking

44
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:28,860
about concepts like epsilon photography.
