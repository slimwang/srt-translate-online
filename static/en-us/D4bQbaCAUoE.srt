00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,898
Well, what happens when we roll two dice at least 100 times, and then we took

2
00:00:04,898 --> 00:00:09,227
the average of the two rolls? This is similar to what we did with the

3
00:00:09,227 --> 00:00:15,100
tetrahedral die. So if we calculate at least 100 averages from rolling two dice,

4
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:19,323
what's going to be the distribution of these averages?
