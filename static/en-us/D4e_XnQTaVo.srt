00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
[Norvig] So now I'd like you to fill in the rest of the definition for hand_rank.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
We have the values for 8 and 7.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Go ahead and fill in the remaining tests and return tuples for the values from 6 down to 0.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
That will be the hardest assignment you've had yet.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
It might take you a little while to work on it.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Make sure you use the test cases, run the tests

7
00:00:21,000 --> 99:59:59,999
to make sure you have your hand_rank function working properly.
