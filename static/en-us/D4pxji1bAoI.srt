00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:04,975
So, here is this pesky loop that didn't quite work out for us. We want to keep

2
00:00:04,975 --> 00:00:08,455
asking the user to enter a value less than 100 and we want to keep doing it

3
00:00:08,455 --> 00:00:14,040
while they enter a value greater or equal to 100. But really, what we want to

4
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:18,864
do is we want to go through the loop once. And then, do the check, and then if

5
00:00:18,864 --> 00:00:23,871
the check fails go through the loop again and so on. The key is we want to go

6
00:00:23,871 --> 00:00:27,706
through this at least once, the way to do that in Java is to move the while

7
00:00:27,706 --> 00:00:34,350
statement, the while condition to the bottom and to add the word do to the top.

8
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:39,000
If there were two on the top, the Y condition on the bottom and this is called

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,645
a do loop. Let's look at a program that uses it. So, here's our program. It has

10
00:00:45,645 --> 00:00:49,906
the do loop that you've just seen. So, we keep asking the user, please enter an

11
00:00:49,906 --> 00:00:54,648
integer, less than 100, until they do. In other words, we stay in the loop

12
00:00:54,648 --> 00:00:58,120
while the input is greater or equal to 100, and then this program doesn't do

13
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:03,720
anything with it. It just says thank you for entering a value less than 100.

14
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:06,864
Let's, let's run this program so you can see it in action. The program has

15
00:01:06,864 --> 00:01:11,107
started, it asks for an integer less than 100. We'll be annoying and put in

16
00:01:11,107 --> 00:01:15,608
200, we get another prompt and we'll be annoying again. And we could do this

17
00:01:15,608 --> 00:01:22,880
forever, or not. And now, the program simply says thank you for entering 90.

18
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,511
That's the most common reason really to use the do loop for input validation.

19
00:01:26,511 --> 00:01:30,831
And the reason you need the do loop is simply you've got to get at least one

20
00:01:30,831 --> 00:01:37,326
input from the user before you know whether to complain or not. So, this is the

21
00:01:37,326 --> 00:01:40,771
situation where you've got to enter the loop at least once before you know what

22
00:01:40,771 --> 00:01:45,569
to do, that's exactly the point of the do loop. The do loop enters the loop at

23
00:01:45,569 --> 00:01:49,169
least once, whereas the while loop might never enter the loop.
