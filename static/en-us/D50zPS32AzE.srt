I have several tips for working with
business partners and co-founders.

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:07,270
And one of those,
probably the most important one,

3
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:12,760
is establish a set of rules around
discussing difficult things.

4
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:16,210
When stress levels get high,

5
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:21,290
people maybe have not slept in days and
problems arise.

6
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:25,410
Figuring out a framework of conversation
is essential to working through these

7
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:29,860
problems and without it businesses
can fall apart due to infighting,

8
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:31,950
or just miscommunication.
