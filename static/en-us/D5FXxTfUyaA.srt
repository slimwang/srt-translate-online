00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,543
Let's continue solving the system and see what happens. If I add the x terms

2
00:00:05,543 --> 00:00:10,971
together I get 0, if I add the y terms together I also get 0, and then 6 and 5

3
00:00:10,971 --> 00:00:16,297
make 11. Hm, this is weird, 0 equals 11. This can't be a true statement, we know

4
00:00:16,297 --> 00:00:20,636
this isn't right. So something else is going on with these 2 equations. If we

5
00:00:20,636 --> 00:00:25,124
remember that the solution to a system of equations is a point of intersection,

6
00:00:25,124 --> 00:00:29,601
then we know that this doesn't make sense. There's actually no point that works

7
00:00:29,601 --> 00:00:34,142
as the intersection for both of these 2 lines. If I solve each equation for y, I

8
00:00:34,142 --> 00:00:38,838
would wind up with these 2 equations. These parallel lines will never intersect.

9
00:00:38,838 --> 00:00:42,984
So whenever we connect this math to the graph, we can tell that there's no

10
00:00:42,984 --> 00:00:47,368
solution here. There's no ordered pair, x and y, that will make both of these

11
00:00:47,368 --> 00:00:52,090
equations true. And that makes sense, because there's no point of intersection.
