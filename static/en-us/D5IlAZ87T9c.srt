1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,570
Okay, so our program is lacking just one more

2
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:05,440
thing. Let's say that we want to take a break

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:08,280
after every two hours of work on the computer.

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:11,200
I can increase the duration of delay from ten seconds

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,770
to two hours. Now remember, the sleep function takes

6
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:19,310
in seconds, so this number to the computer is two

7
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:22,690
seconds and not two hours. To fix this, I

8
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:25,530
can find out the number of seconds in two hours.

9
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:29,320
And use that instead. Since I'm still testing my program,

10
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:32,850
I will keep the wait time to a manageable ten seconds.

11
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:35,450
Okay, so now that we have written our first program,

12
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:37,238
let's understand where functions like

13
00:00:37,238 --> 00:00:41,120
webbrowser.open and time.sleep are coming from.
