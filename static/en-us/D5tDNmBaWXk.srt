00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:02,773
Now here's the really really way to think about. Are you more likely to use

2
00:00:02,773 --> 00:00:05,926
situational attributions, or dispositional attributions? That is, are you more

3
00:00:05,926 --> 00:00:09,348
likely to think that the person is responsible for what happens, or the

4
00:00:09,348 --> 00:00:14,444
situation? Well, as it turns out, different situations call for different types

5
00:00:14,444 --> 00:00:18,650
of attribution. For example, when evaluating our own behaviour, whether we

6
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:23,597
succeed or fail might influence what kind of attributions we use. For example,

7
00:00:23,597 --> 00:00:26,370
say we did really poorly on a biology test, we might blame the fact that a

8
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:29,190
professor was horrible or we didn't know what was going to be on the test, or

9
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:34,246
that the test was poorly written. On the other hand, say we got an A on a

10
00:00:34,246 --> 00:00:36,930
statistic exam, we might attribute this good grade to the fact that we're

11
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:42,018
really smart or we're really good at statistics. So the attributions we use may

12
00:00:42,018 --> 00:00:44,240
depend on the situation.
