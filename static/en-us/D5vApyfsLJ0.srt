1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,650
Now, before we continue, I would like to make one important point,

2
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:05,080
and I don't know if this already occurred to you,

3
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:10,000
but at least you might be inclined to think that it's rather obvious that

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,110
the problem that Alice, Bob, and Carol are working on is intractable for one simple reason.

5
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:19,310
Each of their problems has to look at an exponential number of solutions.

6
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:25,410
For vertex cover, we have O(2^n) potential solutions that we have to look at

7
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:30,100
because there are 2^n 0-1 assignments to the vertices

8
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:33,840
for putting the vertices of a graph into a vertex cover.

9
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,650
And the same thing is true for independent set and clique as we have seen in the last unit.

10
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:42,100
Now, the question is does the fact that there is an exponential number of solutions

11
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:45,440
already mean that the problem must be intractable.

12
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:51,610
You could basically think this because having to consider an exponential number of solutions

13
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:54,620
might mean that you have to look at each one of the solutions

14
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:57,220
and that obviously is going to take exponential time.

15
00:00:57,220 --> 00:01:02,810
What I now want to show you is that this is not the correct intuition to have.

16
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:06,920
Having many solutions does not mean that the problem is intractable.

17
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:09,200
It can mean this, but it does not have to.

18
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,110
To show you this, I'm going to give you one example

19
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:16,110
where we have an exponential number of solutions

20
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:19,310
but actually there is a polynomial time algorithm for our problem.

21
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:23,880
What I would like you to tell me--in this graph here,

22
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:28,190
how many different paths or how many different ways there are

23
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:33,080
of getting from A to B if you cannot go backwards?

24
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:38,150
You start out at A and once you've traveled across an edge you cannot go backwards.

25
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:41,180
You always have to go forward, so how many ways are there to get from A to B?

26
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:44,240
Of course this is a very simple warm up example.

27
00:01:44,240 --> 99:59:59,999
I'm going to draw a little arrows here just to make clear that we cannot go backwards.
