1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,760
What if I was not human and
still behaved the way I did?

2
00:00:03,759 --> 00:00:06,629
Would you still consider me intelligent?

3
00:00:06,629 --> 00:00:09,839
>> You know actually you're right, I
wouldn't be able to tell the difference.

4
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:12,565
>> Then perhaps there are certain
qualities of systems,

5
00:00:12,566 --> 00:00:16,519
both artificial and biological that we
ascribe the notion of intelligence to

6
00:00:16,519 --> 00:00:18,160
>> You know in my career,

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,969
teaching artificial intelligence, I find
something kind of interesting emerges.

8
00:00:21,969 --> 00:00:24,839
We often tend to use the word
intelligence to describe things that we

9
00:00:24,839 --> 00:00:26,679
don't know how to explain.

10
00:00:26,679 --> 00:00:30,980
Once we can explain them, we just say
that they're algorithms or formulas.

11
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:33,929
They're only intelligent
if we can't explain them.

12
00:00:33,929 --> 00:00:36,240
But I think that
definition is problematic.

13
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:40,010
First it implies that anything we
design can never be intelligent

14
00:00:40,009 --> 00:00:42,189
because we would know how it works.

15
00:00:42,189 --> 00:00:43,509
It throws AI right out the window.

16
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:47,980
Also, we consider ourselves
intelligent because right now

17
00:00:47,979 --> 00:00:50,303
we don't fully understand
how our brains work.

18
00:00:50,304 --> 00:00:54,870
One day thou if we do will we not
consider ourselves intelligent anymore?

19
00:00:54,869 --> 00:00:57,699
And for philosophy that's
a fine definition to have.

20
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:00,160
But for AI to be productive

21
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:03,689
our notion of intelligence must not be
contingent on how we perceive something.

22
00:01:03,689 --> 00:01:08,250
Rather it should be a property that
emerges out of the system itself.

23
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:09,489
>> Good point.

24
00:01:09,489 --> 00:01:13,209
We often think of intelligence as
the ability to accomplish a variety of

25
00:01:13,209 --> 00:01:16,449
intellectual tasks just like humans do.

26
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:20,000
A subfield of AI called
artificial general intelligence

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,969
deals with this specific goal.

28
00:01:21,969 --> 00:01:26,109
But we are far from replicating
the complex nature of human thinking.

29
00:01:26,109 --> 00:01:29,319
Equating intelligence with human
behavior will pretty much rule out

30
00:01:29,319 --> 00:01:31,289
all artificial systems.

31
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:35,590
Besides, even humans are not
great at all kinds of tasks.

32
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:39,590
>> Yes, intelligence should be
defined within the context of a task.

33
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:43,180
For example,
if my goal is to solve Sudoku puzzles,

34
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:45,830
and I'm able to do it with
a decent rate of success.

35
00:01:45,829 --> 00:01:49,510
Then I can say I am intelligent
at solving Sudoku puzzles.

36
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:52,150
It just turns out that
humans are intelligent

37
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:53,780
at doing a lot of different things.
