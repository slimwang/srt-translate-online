00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:03,610
Offline first means we
try offline first and

2
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:06,850
we also try to get stuff
from the network just after.

3
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:11,038
So which of the following employs
some kind of offline first approach?

4
00:00:11,038 --> 00:00:15,180
Deliver the page's header and
content from a cache on the device,

5
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:18,538
then attempt to fetch updated
content from the network.

6
00:00:18,538 --> 00:00:20,665
Deliver the page's header from a cache,

7
00:00:20,665 --> 00:00:23,347
then attempt to fetch
the content from the network.

8
00:00:23,347 --> 00:00:26,698
Attempt to fetch the page from
the network, and if that fails,

9
00:00:26,698 --> 00:00:27,909
show cached content.

10
00:00:27,909 --> 00:00:31,301
Attempt to fetch the page from
the network, and if that fails,

11
00:00:31,301 --> 00:00:33,038
show an error page from a cache.
