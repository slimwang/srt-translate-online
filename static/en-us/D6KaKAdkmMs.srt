1
00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:03,690
Now it's your turn to set up a goal for
your app.

2
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:05,580
You do that in the admin dashboard.

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:09,890
Go to Goals and
then you create a new goal.

4
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:14,010
Make sure your app is sending
the hits Analytics needs.

5
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:16,850
To figure out if the goal is being met.

6
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,490
And use it in a way that you know that
the goal is going to be satisfied.

7
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:30,430
And you shouldn't need to re-deploy
the app after you set up the goal.

8
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:33,870
So I found in the real time
screen of Analytics Dashboard,

9
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:36,730
I did not see the goals being converted.

10
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:41,360
So you're just going to have to be
patient, and check back in your

11
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,690
Analytics Dashboard after some amount of
time, to see that the goals were met.

12
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:48,820
And what kind of goal did you create?

13
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:51,050
Did you create a destination goal?

14
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:51,920
Duration goal?

15
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,890
A screens per session goal?

16
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:55,400
For an event goal.

17
00:00:56,650 --> 00:00:59,590
So, I want you to carry on going
on through this course, and

18
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:02,370
checking back periodically
in your dashboard

19
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:04,720
to see your goal conversion
data when it comes in.

20
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:07,450
I recommend that you don't wait for it.
