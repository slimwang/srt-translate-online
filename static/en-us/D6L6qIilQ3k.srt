00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Here's the command barchart, Height and Weight, and as I scroll down, I will find my bar chart

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:16,000
that shows pretty much how larger sizes was that in larger weights.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Now this chart would question whether it's exactly linear.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
You can see the distance over here to be significantly smaller than the distance over here

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:32,000
but it's all approximate, and in reality, I can tell you the ratio between height and weight is not linear.

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
But for the sake of the exercise, that's a better statement

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
than any of the other statements that I've given you.
