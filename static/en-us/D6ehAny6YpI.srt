00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,310
There's one more useful thing we can add to our polygon creator, changing the

2
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:08,288
radius of the polygon. By default, the distance of all the points from the

3
00:00:08,288 --> 00:00:12,386
polygon center is 1. Now, modify the program to use a radius to make the polygon

4
00:00:12,386 --> 00:00:16,350
generated larger or smaller. Here's your new interface. Notice that we've

5
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:20,605
changed the order of arguments here. In the previous problem, the location was

6
00:00:20,605 --> 00:00:24,497
the second argument. Now it's the third. This is usually not a great idea,

7
00:00:24,497 --> 00:00:28,523
especially in JavaScript, as this language does not really check if the number

8
00:00:28,523 --> 00:00:32,566
of arguments passed in matches the number of arguments expected. We did it this

9
00:00:32,566 --> 00:00:36,150
way because we felt the location change is a bit easier than the radius change

10
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:40,262
and wanted to save the trickier problem for later. When your work is complete,

11
00:00:40,262 --> 00:00:42,113
this is what you should see on the screen.
