1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:02,980
Now we're actually going to use these templates. First thing

2
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:06,870
we're going to learn is, variable substitution. The syntax for in,

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:10,620
substituting a variable in Jinja is just double curly braces,

4
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:13,150
and then you include your variable name, and then you

5
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:17,234
close your curly braces. Pretty simple, right? Basically these curly

6
00:00:17,234 --> 00:00:19,880
braces, it just means print. It's as if you typed

7
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:22,780
the print statement. In the middle of your HTML code.

8
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:26,030
So let's see what that looks like in practice. Okay,

9
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:30,380
I'm going to go into my shopping list HTML file. And add,

10
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:32,070
I'm just going to add a string right to the bottom of

11
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:35,070
the file. Okay. So I just said hello, and then I

12
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:39,120
added in a curly, curly name. Now, where is name defined? It

13
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,940
does not define anywhere yet. Let's see what happens when I

14
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:45,540
reload this page with just this. Here I am in a

15
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:48,270
browser. Let's reload this page. And it says hello, and there's

16
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:51,080
nothing there. Actually we can get rid of this egg. That's a

17
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:53,958
little leftover. So Jinja, if the variable's not

18
00:00:53,958 --> 00:00:57,690
defined, just quietly doesn't include it. Now let's

19
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:59,970
go ahead and include name. Lets just kind of

20
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:04,800
hacked this in real quick. Name equals Steve. Okay,

21
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,770
so, remember before I was talking about this

22
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:09,960
star, star syntax. Name equals Steve basically gets

23
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:13,060
passed in as star, star kw, which gets

24
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:16,262
passed along here. Which gets received by render string

25
00:01:16,262 --> 00:01:19,320
as star, star params. Just different variable names, to

26
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:22,700
be deliberately confusing for some reason, and which gets passed

27
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:26,860
into the render function from Jinja, which expects keyword parameters.

28
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:30,350
So, it's going to define name equals Steve, and if we

29
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:32,992
go to our browser and reload this. We see, it

30
00:01:32,992 --> 00:01:35,470
says hello Steve. Let's see if we can make this

31
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:38,005
a little bit fancier. What is instead of name equals

32
00:01:38,005 --> 00:01:41,710
Steve all the time, we said name equals self.request.get name.

33
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:43,390
So we can put name as a, as a parameter.

34
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:46,660
Let's see if that works. Okay, if I reload this

35
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:49,525
page, I get nothing, because there is no parameter. But

36
00:01:49,525 --> 00:01:52,670
if I add name equals udacity, we can see that

37
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:57,320
udacity appears in our template. Okay, so, right now we

38
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:01,040
basically have this very elaborate way of doing string substitution

39
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,470
via these files, but we can, we can always see

40
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:06,240
we're somewhat on the right direction of having cleaner code.

41
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,660
And, time for our quick quiz, okay, so what I want you to do, is use

42
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:14,290
variable substitution, the syntax I just showed you,

43
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:17,210
to make this string. The quick brown and

44
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:20,130
then the variable, animal1, jumped over the lazy,

45
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:22,820
and then the variable, animal2. Go ahead and

46
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:25,390
type this complete string with the correct variable

47
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:27,730
substitutions for these variables, in the box here.
