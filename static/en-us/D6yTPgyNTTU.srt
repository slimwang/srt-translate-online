1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,817
The greatest common factor for 15, 20 and -35 is just 5. That's going to start

2
00:00:04,817 --> 00:00:09,645
the product for my GCF. Now I want to lowest factor for f that is common between

3
00:00:09,645 --> 00:00:14,589
all the terms. Well, just 1 x is common between all the terms. The lowest power

4
00:00:14,589 --> 00:00:19,364
of Y that is common is 2. So y squared would also appear in my GCF. An finally,

5
00:00:19,364 --> 00:00:23,696
I look at the lowest power of Z between all of the terms, but I have to be

6
00:00:23,696 --> 00:00:28,716
careful. There's no z over here. So z won't be included in my GCF. So a factor

7
00:00:28,716 --> 00:00:33,487
of 5x y squared from each of these terms. I need 3x y squared z cubed for the

8
00:00:33,487 --> 00:00:38,505
first term. 4z to the fifth of the second term and negative x squared y for the

9
00:00:38,505 --> 00:00:43,444
last term. I can do this pretty quickly if just check the multiplication as I

10
00:00:43,444 --> 00:00:48,342
go. 5 times 3 is 15. X times x is x squared, and y squared times y squared is y

11
00:00:48,342 --> 00:00:53,050
to the 4th. Of course, I also have this z cubed on the end. So this is my first

12
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:57,589
term. When I multiply these two terms together, I get 20xy squared z to the

13
00:00:57,589 --> 00:01:02,443
fifth. The variables are just listed are multiplied together. And 5 times 4 is

14
00:01:02,443 --> 00:01:07,484
20. Finally, I know this last term must be correct. 5 times negative 7 is

15
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:12,692
negative 35, and x times x squared is x cubed. The last variable is y cubed,

16
00:01:12,692 --> 00:01:17,957
which comes from y squared times y. So yeah, this is definitely my factored

17
00:01:17,957 --> 00:01:18,387
form.
