1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,588
So here's the basic idea, all right?

2
00:00:02,588 --> 00:00:04,702
Two slightly different images.

3
00:00:04,702 --> 00:00:09,630
These are two stereo animations taken from this website listed here

4
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:14,501
where we just alternate showing you the left image and the right image.

5
00:00:14,501 --> 00:00:18,576
Already, if you just take a look at the fence post here,

6
00:00:18,576 --> 00:00:22,652
you can see that these pictures were lined up in such a way

7
00:00:22,652 --> 00:00:28,061
that the fence post was sort of right at the same point in the two pictures.

8
00:00:28,061 --> 00:00:33,107
And you can see that the stuff that's in front seems to be going that way,

9
00:00:33,107 --> 00:00:36,685
stuff in the back goes that way and then back again.

10
00:00:36,685 --> 00:00:37,440
All right.

11
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,922
Or you can switch them, but the idea is that stuff in front of

12
00:00:40,922 --> 00:00:46,160
what you're verged at moves in one direction and the stuff behind it goes back.

13
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:50,750
We'll actually see that when we talk about the ordering constraint two

14
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:52,193
lessons from now.

15
00:00:52,193 --> 00:00:56,886
Here's a cool one that was done of somebody diving into a pool.

16
00:00:56,886 --> 00:00:59,616
And you can see he adjusted the images, so

17
00:00:59,616 --> 00:01:04,617
that at the depth of where the swimmer is the two images are exactly lined up.

18
00:01:04,617 --> 00:01:07,864
So the bubbles, the splash moves in one direction and

19
00:01:07,864 --> 00:01:12,500
I love that the shadows on the bottom of the pool move in the other direction.

20
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:17,299
So the basic idea is that from two different views from how they move,

21
00:01:17,299 --> 00:01:19,960
you get a sense of what their depth is.
