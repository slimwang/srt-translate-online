1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,984
Just like we did in the example, we're
going to start by rearranging the order of

2
00:00:03,984 --> 00:00:07,599
the terms in this expression, so the terms
with the same variable are next to one

3
00:00:07,599 --> 00:00:14,281
another. Great, now, we have 7x-10x+5y+3y.
The next step is to add together the

4
00:00:14,281 --> 00:00:20,337
coefficients of the like terms. Great, so
now we have -3x, since 7-10 is negative

5
00:00:20,337 --> 00:00:26,152
three and the variable there was x, plus
8y, since 5+3 is eight. If we wanted to

6
00:00:26,152 --> 00:00:29,329
make this a little bit prettier, since we
have a negative sign at the front, we

7
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:33,609
could because of the commutative property,
rearrange the order of the terms one more

8
00:00:33,621 --> 00:00:39,439
time. So, I personally prefer to write it
this way, 8y-3x. So this is our new

9
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:43,165
version of the expression on the left.
It's almost hard to tell from looking at

10
00:00:43,165 --> 00:00:45,792
these two expressions that they're
actually equal to each other, but that

11
00:00:45,804 --> 00:00:49,483
just shows you how powerful combining like
terms is. We end up with an expression

12
00:00:49,483 --> 00:00:52,378
that's much nicer to look at and much
easier to use.
