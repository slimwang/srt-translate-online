1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,220
Now to ask these questions, I want to introduce you to someone.

2
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:06,330
This is Oliver.

3
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:09,140
He's the Director of Mobile here at Udacity.

4
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:11,960
Oliver has an illustrious background.

5
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:15,780
He built an app, that was number one in the App Store in 2009.

6
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:19,770
Here, we've caught him in the middle of an interview with a job candidate.

7
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:21,100
Let's see what he asks.

8
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:23,900
>> I'd love to hear about any apps you've built using Swift.

9
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:26,600
If you got any demos or examples of any apps, or

10
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:29,280
if you've even got any code to show me, that would be fantastic.

11
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:35,100
>> So at this point, you probably haven't built a complete app using Swift.

12
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,840
That's okay, because that's what we are here to learn.

13
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,650
By the end of this course, however.

14
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:42,020
You will have a really impressive first app,

15
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:44,680
that will be great to showcase in an interview.

16
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:47,920
We will hear from Oliver several times during this course.

17
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,130
For now, let's start making our app by downloading Xcode.
