00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,420
The general idea is that if we have observations

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:07,430
over time, we can facet by the primary unit, case,

3
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:10,540
or individual in the data set. For our yogurt data

4
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:13,750
it was the households we were faceting over. This faceted

5
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:16,350
time series plot is something we can't generate with

6
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:19,070
our pseudo Facebook data set. Since we don't have data

7
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:21,780
on our sample of users over time. Let's get back

8
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:25,310
to that plot to see that limitation. The Facebook data

9
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:29,140
isn't great for examining the process of friending over time.

10
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:31,750
The data set is just a cross section, it's just

11
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:34,390
one snapshot at a fixed point that tells us the

12
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:38,810
characteristics of individuals. Not the individuals over, say, a year.

13
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:41,700
But if we had a dataset like the yogurt one,

14
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:44,810
we would be able to track friendships initiated over time

15
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:47,520
and compare that with tenure. This would give us better

16
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,630
evidence to explain the difference or the drop in friendships

17
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:52,840
initiated over time as tenure increases.
