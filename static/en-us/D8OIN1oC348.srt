00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:04,500
The course has essentially two components. In

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,970
the lectures you will learn about cutting edge

3
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:10,820
research problems in computer networking and you'll also

4
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:13,740
gain the ability to come up with your

5
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:17,560
own problems. We'll pick up the basics along

6
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:20,540
the way as necessary. In addition to the

7
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:22,750
lectures there are also a number of problem

8
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:26,000
sets or assignments that you will work through.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,890
As you work your way through the course. The

10
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:31,790
problem sets and assignments in the course will give

11
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:35,120
you proficiency with the tools and technologies that are

12
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,970
state of the art in the research community. That will

13
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:41,820
allow you to follow through on the research ideas

14
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:44,180
that you may come up with as we work

15
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:47,730
through various topics in the course. There are tons

16
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:51,000
of exciting tools to use, and the problem sets and

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,270
assignments will help you gain proficiency with them.
