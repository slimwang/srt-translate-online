1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:01,740
>> Hey Charles, how you doing?

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:03,740
>> I'm doing just fine Michael, how are you doing?

3
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:05,678
>> I'm doing pretty well, thanks. I'm happy to

4
00:00:05,678 --> 00:00:07,610
get a chance to tell you about something today.

5
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:10,490
>> Excellent, and what is it you're going to tell me about?

6
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:12,530
>> We're going to talk about regression.

7
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:14,520
>> Like, progression? [LAUGH].

8
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:16,290
>> No, regression. So, let me tell you

9
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:19,660
about regression. So we are, in this section of

10
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:23,240
the class, talking about supervised learning. And Supervised

11
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,970
learning, in supervised learning we can take examples of

12
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:29,280
inputs and outputs and based on that we are going to be

13
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:33,690
able to take a new input and predict the corresponding output for

14
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:36,400
that input, right. So this, this covers all of this, this the

15
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:39,965
things we are talking about in the context of supervised learning, right.

16
00:00:39,965 --> 00:00:40,270
>> Right.

17
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:43,780
>> Now, what makes regression special subtopic.

18
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:45,250
We are going to be talking about mapping

19
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:49,030
continuous inputs to outputs. As opposed to, what

20
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:50,920
was the other thing that we were mapping,

21
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,910
what other kinds of outputs did we think about?

22
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:57,450
>> Well, we had discrete outputs and continuous outputs.

23
00:00:57,450 --> 00:00:58,590
>> Right, and so this is going to

24
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:02,130
be the focus on continuous. So regression seems

25
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:05,780
like sort of an odd word. It doesn't really kind of fit for this. So often

26
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:10,750
I think about regression as. So this is, this is me being all sad and sort

27
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:13,970
of reverting back to a childhood state. And

28
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:15,990
that's, you know, that's in the psychological sense,

29
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:19,480
that's what regression refers to. But it turns out that, that's not

30
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,920
what it means in this setting. But the story by which those

31
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,630
things became linked, I think, is kind of interesting. So let me

32
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:27,800
tell you about that. Okay. So, this is a picture of you Charles.

33
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,230
>> [LAUGH] Okay. I'll accept that.

34
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:32,000
>> You can tell it's you because he's really tall.

35
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,090
And you're, you're a fairly tall man. I know you

36
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:35,670
don't think of yourself that way, but you think of

37
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:37,720
everyone else as being short which is really the same thing.

38
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:38,640
>> Fair enough.

39
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,800
>> Alright, so let's say that this is Charles. Let's

40
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:45,940
say that this is someone of average height. Just someone at random.

41
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:47,330
>> Mm-hmm.

42
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:49,790
>> So now, let's pretend, Charles, that you have children.

43
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:51,370
>> I do have children.

44
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:56,200
>> All right. So let's, that's okay but we can just pretend, and

45
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,030
we want to ask the question what would you expect the average height

46
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:02,180
of your children to be? Would you expect it to be sort of,

47
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:05,100
you know, sort of Charles' height? Or

48
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,220
average height or may be somewhere between.

49
00:02:08,258 --> 00:02:10,430
So let's let's actually ask this as a quiz.
