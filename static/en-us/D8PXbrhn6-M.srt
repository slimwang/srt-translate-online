Great work if you found negative 2 3rds and positive 5. You've really got your

2
00:00:05,082 --> 00:00:09,665
factoring down. We begin factoring this by finding the factors of negative 30

3
00:00:09,665 --> 00:00:14,940
that sum to negative 13. We use these two factors to rewrite the middle term,

4
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:20,996
negative 13m. Then, we use factoring by grouping to get 3m plus 2 times m minus

5
00:00:20,996 --> 00:00:27,700
5 equals 0. Then, we set each factor equal to 0 and solve for the values of m.

6
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:32,262
So m could equal negative 2 3rds or m could equal positive 5.
