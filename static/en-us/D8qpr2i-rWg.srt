00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:01,160
Nice work.

2
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:05,470
Knowing the latest inventory and prices
for an e-commerce site is vital and

3
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:06,930
to be done in real time.

4
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:09,130
So, it's network only,

5
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:14,640
we need the images required by the first
render to appear as quickly as possible.

6
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:17,300
So they should be cash only.

7
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:22,100
Social media timeline data doesn't
have to be fresh immediately, but

8
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:23,320
should be quick.

9
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:27,020
So for that, we want to use cache,
then network.

10
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:32,229
And finally, for game leader boards,
it's okay if blah, blah, blah, then use

11
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:36,670
network first, then cache, since it's
not really critical to the experience.
