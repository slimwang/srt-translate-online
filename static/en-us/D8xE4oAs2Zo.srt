00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,230
Here I have my set of counting numbers from 1 to 7 and my even numbers between 1

2
00:00:04,242 --> 00:00:08,230
and 9. We're going to write these sets inside of circles so you can better

3
00:00:08,242 --> 00:00:12,185
visualize them. Here I have my set C of numbers, and here I have my set E of

4
00:00:12,197 --> 00:00:16,425
numbers. I've drawn my two sets in overlapping circles, or a Venn Diagram. All

5
00:00:16,437 --> 00:00:20,665
the elements of C have been placed inside this circle and all the elements of E

6
00:00:20,677 --> 00:00:25,809
have been placed inside this circle. What's neat about each of these sets is we

7
00:00:25,821 --> 00:00:31,047
can actually make one giant set, called the union. To find the union, we want

8
00:00:31,059 --> 00:00:36,031
any element that's in set C or in set E, in any of the circles. The union is

9
00:00:36,043 --> 00:00:40,940
represented by this upward U symbol, so what set do you think is C union E?
