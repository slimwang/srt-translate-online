00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:05,800
The intent in this lesson is to give you a feel for how some enduring

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:12,150
concepts stand the test of time. The ideas in Quicksilver, namely,

3
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:15,770
using transactions as a fundamental operating

4
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:19,330
system mechanism to bundle and stage recovery

5
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:25,550
of operating system services. Found resurgence in the nineties, in the LRVM work

6
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:31,650
that we discussed earlier for providing persistence. Again, in 2010, it found

7
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:34,800
resurgence in the form of providing

8
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,990
safeguard against system vulnerability and malicious

9
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:44,000
attacks on the system. And another research operating systems called Texas. We

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,270
will mention Texas when we cover a later lesson module on system security.

11
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:53,280
What about the computer industry and the commercial

12
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,030
operating systems? Well, they always focused on performance.

13
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:01,460
Reliability always takes the back seat. You will

14
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:04,700
be amazed, what goes on under the covers

15
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:08,020
of an operating system to gain performance. Just

16
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:10,100
as an example, you write to a file,

17
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:16,150
and you think it is on the hard disk. Well, think again. It is a while before

18
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:21,160
your file write actually gets persisted on the disk. What if the system

19
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:26,510
crashes in the meanwhile? Well, too bad. Well things may change in the future.

20
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:31,670
There are new kinds of memories called Storage class memories, that have

21
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:37,150
latency properties that are similar to a DRAM and are yet non-volatile.

22
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:41,800
Will this new technology result in a resurgence of

23
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:47,200
exploring transactions once more in operating systems? Only time will tell.
