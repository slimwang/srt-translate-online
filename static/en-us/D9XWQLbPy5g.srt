00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:01,030
The question is,

2
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:05,830
should the policy address personal
use of university resources?

3
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:08,850
Remember, this is sort of dos and
don'ts, so in some sense,

4
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:11,250
you should say, well, yeah, it should.

5
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:14,460
And if it addresses it,
does it say blanket,

6
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:18,760
no personal use of university resources
or are there some exceptions?
