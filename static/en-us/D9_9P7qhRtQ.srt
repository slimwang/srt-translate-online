1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,030
In this course,
you'll be using Google Chrome and

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:06,939
Chrome's developer tools,
which we call Devtools for short.

3
00:00:06,939 --> 00:00:09,010
If you haven't used
Chrome Devtools before,

4
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:11,930
check out the link in the instructor
notes for some information and

5
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:13,750
instructions for getting started.

6
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:17,090
You can use Devtools to quickly get
an idea of how your site performs on

7
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:19,210
a rage of different devices.

8
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:23,280
However, emulators and simulators can
never really replace the experience of

9
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:25,160
using a real phone or tablet.

10
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,270
To test your work on a phone or

11
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:29,830
tablet, you'll need to make sure
you're set up to use remote debugging.

12
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:30,850
For the remainder of this lesson,

13
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:34,490
you will be getting some instructions
from Peter Lubbers on how to get started

14
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:37,810
with mobile DevTools and
debugging on your mobile devices.

15
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:39,840
If you're already familiar
with mobile debugging,

16
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,670
feel free to skip ahead to
the video called Lesson One Wrapup.
