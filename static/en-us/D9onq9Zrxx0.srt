00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:04,738
Network-only tries to handle
the requests by fetching the URL from

2
00:00:04,738 --> 00:00:05,735
the network.

3
00:00:05,735 --> 00:00:09,025
If the fetch fails, the request fails.

4
00:00:09,025 --> 00:00:13,814
Network-only is ideal for things that
don't have an offline equivalent, for

5
00:00:13,814 --> 00:00:17,252
example, analytics pings,
non-get requests, etc.
