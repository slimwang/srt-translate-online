1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,860
Remembering that there's an invisible 1 here, as the exponent in this

2
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:07,890
expression, all of these exponents stand for the number of years that have

3
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:12,810
passed. Or another way to look at this is that it's the number of times that

4
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:19,038
interest has been added. After four years, then, we'll have 10,000 times 1.03

5
00:00:19,038 --> 00:00:25,055
to the 4th power. After 10 years, we'll have 10,000 times 1 plus 0.03 to the

6
00:00:25,055 --> 00:00:29,985
10th power and after 100 years, we'll have the same thing except to the

7
00:00:29,985 --> 00:00:36,596
hundredth power. Well, if you got all these number right, congratulations. You

8
00:00:36,596 --> 00:00:40,850
obviously spotted the pattern and then you extended it. That is some great

9
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:42,550
detective work using math.
