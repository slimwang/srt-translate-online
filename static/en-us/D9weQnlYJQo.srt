00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,158
This means that this is graphing an even function. Let's think about y. If we

2
00:00:04,158 --> 00:00:07,938
pick a y coordinate on any one of these graphs, let's say 10, [inaudible]

3
00:00:07,938 --> 00:00:11,907
distance we need to move to the right, in order to hit our curve, is the same as

4
00:00:11,907 --> 00:00:15,750
the distance we would need to move, to the left to hit the curve, just in the

5
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:20,228
opposite direction of course. So that means the x coordinate, of the point whose

6
00:00:20,228 --> 00:00:24,648
y coordinate is 10, on the right side, is just the opposite of the x coordinate,

7
00:00:24,648 --> 00:00:28,884
of the point whose y coordinate is 10 to the left side of the y axis. This makes

8
00:00:28,884 --> 00:00:32,278
sense mathematically as well. Let's take a look at y equals x squared to see

9
00:00:32,278 --> 00:00:37,470
how. Let's say we have an x coordinate of 3, well then y is going to equal 3

10
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:42,857
squared, which is just 9. However we also know that if we had negative 3 instead

11
00:00:42,857 --> 00:00:48,116
Well, negative three squared is also nine. Negative numbers and positive numbers

12
00:00:48,116 --> 00:00:51,290
that the same absolute value, have the same squares.
