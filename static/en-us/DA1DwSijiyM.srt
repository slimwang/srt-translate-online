1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:04,310
So now we know about the when,
what, and how of adaptive design.

2
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:07,330
Let's look back at those
suboptimal tablet UIs, and

3
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:09,650
see what we can do to improve them.

4
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:14,070
So this Gmailesque example previously
let's uncomfortable reading experiences

5
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:16,270
on wider screens.

6
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:21,120
We can use the divide pattern to show
message details on larger devices,

7
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:23,320
to make better use of the space, and

8
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:28,310
contain either column from becoming
too wide, and uncomfortable to read.

9
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:31,460
Here we're capping the list
at a maximum width, and

10
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:35,270
then filling the remaining
space with the message details.

11
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:40,110
Notice that we are also using the expand
pattern within the message details.

12
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:43,510
Where it also caps the body
at a maximum width,

13
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:48,420
to ensure a comfortable reading, by
introducing margins beyond that point.

14
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,540
This adaptation could
also help with context.

15
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:55,080
We can read a message within
the larger context of other emails.

16
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,150
For example,
seeing if a new message comes in.

17
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:00,270
If we don't have more
content that we can reveal,

18
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:02,650
then we can restrict
the width of the surface.

19
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:06,050
And use generous margins to stop
it from becoming unbalanced.

20
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:08,800
Before this example felt
unbalanced on larger devices,

21
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,600
leaving large areas of white space.

22
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:16,310
We can apply the extend pattern,
and introduce this new surface,

23
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:19,110
to contain the form on larger screens.

24
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:20,750
We center this surface, and

25
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:24,680
apply generous margins within it,
to maintain balance.

26
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:28,710
In our last example, we previously had a
number of issues with unbalanced layout,

27
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:31,790
overly wide buttons, and
poor use of imagery.

28
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:37,370
When adapting to wider devices, we can
set a maximum width on the buttons.

29
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:40,270
And here, we reflow them to the right,

30
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:42,530
preventing them from
reaching awkward sizes.

31
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:44,810
We can also use the expand
pattern on the content,

32
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:48,450
to center on its own surface,
beyond a certain width.

33
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:52,690
And lastly, we switch to a more
immersive image position,

34
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:55,900
with the content overlapping it,
to prevent the issues we saw before.
