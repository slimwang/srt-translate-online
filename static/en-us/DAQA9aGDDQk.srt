00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:04,340
Here's a website that you'll be
improving at the end of this lesson.

2
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:07,370
And like before, there's a slight
chance that what you'll see

3
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:09,840
may look slightly different than this,
and

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,160
that's only because we might tweak it
between now and when you take the class.

5
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:17,110
Anyway, you can find a link to a live
version of this in the instructor notes.

6
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:20,030
What I really want you to do
though is play around with it.

7
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:23,120
Start clicking through,
start giving it a shot, and

8
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:26,490
start thinking about what you
would want to do to improve it.

9
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:30,610
This is another quiz where
you'll just be brainstorming.

10
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:32,250
I want you to think about what areas for

11
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:34,294
improvement that you
can find in this form.

12
00:00:34,294 --> 00:00:36,442
How would you make it faster?

13
00:00:36,442 --> 00:00:38,420
How would you make it simpler?

14
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:41,140
And once you've thought about it,
check this box to continue.
