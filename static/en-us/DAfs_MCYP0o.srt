00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:04,480
Now that we have some sense of what things are slightly different and

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,730
more complicated and we need to be concerned with geographic data,

3
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:11,840
even with something as fundamental as the file type,

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:16,290
we're going to start building our map step by step in D3.

5
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:17,770
As you can see here,

6
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:20,836
the familiar skeleton of code that we've always started with.

7
00:00:20,836 --> 00:00:28,230
Here is our function named draw that takes a single argument geo_data, named, so

8
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:32,560
because this function's actually going to get passed our GeoJSON at the bottom.

9
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:36,980
Notice, rather than loading our TSV of World Cup data,

10
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:40,970
we're simply loading world_countries.json,

11
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:45,930
a GeoJSON file that contains the outlines of all the countries.

12
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:48,480
Since we are displaying a map of the entire world,

13
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,470
there are ready GeoJSON data files for many common geographies.

14
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:56,890
The most common being the entire world and the US.

15
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:02,368
So I was able to find a GeoJSON of all the world countries online.

16
00:01:02,368 --> 00:01:06,020
If a GeoJSON file does not already exist of the region you would like to

17
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:09,990
visualize you can use a few different utilities to convert

18
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:12,300
shape files into GeoJSON.

19
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:13,570
There's a few resources and

20
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:17,670
tutorials in the instructor notes of this video, which can show you how.
