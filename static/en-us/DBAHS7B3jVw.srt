1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:03,937
So, the next thing we'll look at as
far as the constructing the diagram is

2
00:00:03,937 --> 00:00:04,714
the operations.

3
00:00:04,714 --> 00:00:08,777
In the analysis model, operations
comprise those actions that the users

4
00:00:08,777 --> 00:00:11,537
can undertake to interact
with the text browser.

5
00:00:11,537 --> 00:00:16,344
The call that we're concerned
here with an analysis model and

6
00:00:16,344 --> 00:00:18,320
not a design, okay?

7
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,320
So, we are not trying to fill in

8
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:24,210
the implementation methods
that are involved.

9
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:28,140
But rather,
we're using the class model diagram to

10
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:31,320
describe at a high level
what the user can do.

11
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,750
You can use the identified use
cases to answer the questions,

12
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:39,450
what internally visible operations
does the text browser respond to?

13
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:41,270
And, you recall what those were?

14
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:43,760
>> So
the first was just viewing the text.

15
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:48,500
That doesn't seem to really elicit
any kind of behavior though.

16
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:52,750
>> So you're right, there's no event
that the application has to respond to,

17
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:53,340
to do that.

18
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,620
Assuming that we started it up okay.

19
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:58,310
>> Okay, and then moving the handle.

20
00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:00,560
>> Okay, so that's certainly going
to be an operation the system

21
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,620
has to respond to.

22
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:04,280
>> And lastly, re-sizing the view port.

23
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:10,243
>> And, we could also specify parameters
for those particular operations like,

24
00:01:10,243 --> 00:01:15,050
what's the size of the view port
that the user would like to see?

25
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:18,318
Or, what's the position of
the handle in the tray,

26
00:01:18,318 --> 00:01:20,710
when the user is using the scroll bar?
