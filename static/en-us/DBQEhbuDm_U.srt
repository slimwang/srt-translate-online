1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:04,120
So of course yes, we could reload the page 10,000 times. That

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:06,660
might take a while and that would make this a very boring

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:10,470
quiz. Send the link to 10,000 friends. Well that's not going to really

4
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:13,130
work, right? Because if we send the link to 10,000 friends they're

5
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:15,460
going to be in 10,000 different browsers. And they're all going to have their

6
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:19,120
own Now, their own cookie with their own counts. So, that's no

7
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:22,490
good. Or we can just edit the cookie in our browser. Which

8
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:25,210
is the answer that I'd like to talk about. So, let's go

9
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:26,580
ahead and see if we can do that.
