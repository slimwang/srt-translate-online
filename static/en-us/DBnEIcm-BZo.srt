1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Now let's complete the generalization.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I'm going to define missionaries and cannibals problem,

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
and we'll give it a 2 just so we can tell the two versions apart.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
It takes the same arguments as before. You may need some initialization code to get going.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Then I want the body of the function, the main part,

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
to just be a call to shortest<u>path</u>search with the appropriate arguments inserted.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 99:59:59,999
If you need to you can define other functions outside of here if that's necessary.
