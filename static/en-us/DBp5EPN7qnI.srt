00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:05,340
Suppose that we are given one machine
M1 that recognizes a language L and

2
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:09,170
another machine M2 that
recognizes L's compliment.

3
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:11,940
If we were to ask your average
programmer to use these machines to

4
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:16,340
decide the language, his first
guess might go something like this.

5
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:20,290
Run M1 on x, and accept if it accepts.

6
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:24,520
Otherwise, run M2 on x,
and reject if it accepts.

7
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:28,050
One of these two has to
produce an accept after all.

8
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:32,080
This program will not decided L,
however.

9
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:33,880
And I want you to tell me why.

10
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,970
So look at these, and
check the best answer.
