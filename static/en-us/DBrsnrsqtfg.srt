1
00:00:00,367 --> 00:00:06,188
For the, for the collector, when you admit, so you admit object, but then when

2
00:00:06,188 --> 00:00:11,598
you get them you have to cast them to the appropriate objects that you want.

3
00:00:11,598 --> 00:00:12,864
[CROSSTALK] If you use, if you use-

4
00:00:12,864 --> 00:00:14,396
>> Yes, that's right. >> Use the value method.

5
00:00:14,396 --> 00:00:16,102
>> Mm-hm, mm-hm. >> So then, and so-

6
00:00:16,102 --> 00:00:16,880
>> And I think like.

7
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,385
>> Does that method actually just returns a based Java object?

8
00:00:20,385 --> 00:00:21,191
And what's the-

9
00:00:21,191 --> 00:00:23,846
>> There is some method, there are some methods that for

10
00:00:23,846 --> 00:00:27,543
example if you know it is a that some is something >> Yeah sure.

11
00:00:27,543 --> 00:00:31,752
>> Those things are there, but you, you are doing your own objects then you

12
00:00:31,752 --> 00:00:34,247
should know what you should cast it out as.

13
00:00:34,247 --> 00:00:36,205
>> But if you just use get value it just like.

14
00:00:36,205 --> 00:00:37,288
>> Mm-hm. Then you would just cast it.

15
00:00:37,288 --> 00:00:38,354
>> Okay.

16
00:00:38,354 --> 00:00:42,371
>> Because and that could be anything.

17
00:00:42,371 --> 00:00:43,949
>> Okay.

18
00:00:43,949 --> 00:00:46,595
>> Makes it more than a life form so he can pass any objects.

19
00:00:46,595 --> 00:00:47,154
>> Mm-hm.

20
00:00:47,154 --> 00:00:51,629
>> So if anybody do that.
