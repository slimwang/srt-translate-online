1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,770
HIEs can vary substantially in scope.

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:08,480
An HIE can serve a single health
enterprise that may consist of

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:12,990
more than one hospital,
many physician practices, and

4
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:17,490
other entities such as nursing homes or
rehabilitation facilities.

5
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:21,020
These entities may have electronic
medical records from different vendors

6
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:25,590
so interoperability can be an issue
even within a single health system or

7
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:27,200
enterprise.

8
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:32,610
Some health systems extend their HIE to
practices that refer patients to them

9
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:37,920
in an effort to make that easier and
thereby attract more referrals.

10
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,750
This is often called a Service Area HIE.

11
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:45,360
In an effort to better position
the health system to contract under

12
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,440
arrangements like an ACO,
it is increasingly common for

13
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,020
them to actually acquire these
outlying medical practices,

14
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:57,660
in which case they would definitely want
them included in the enterprise HIE.
