00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,390
The code first computes the altitude. It then uses this position to figure out

2
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:07,510
how much length is left to share among the other two coordinates, x and z.

3
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:11,136
Their positions are computed and multiplied by this length. Since cosine

4
00:00:11,136 --> 00:00:14,831
squared plus sine squared equals 1. We know that all this length will be used

5
00:00:14,831 --> 00:00:16,879
up between the x and z components.
