00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,230
Throughout this course,

2
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:04,480
you're going to need to test
your site on different devices.

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:06,470
So, pull out your credit card and

4
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:09,735
get ready to order all of these
devices that you see behind you.

5
00:00:09,735 --> 00:00:14,305
>> [LAUGH] Pete, I, I don't think
we can ask everybody to do that.

6
00:00:14,305 --> 00:00:15,145
>> Fair enough.

7
00:00:15,145 --> 00:00:18,865
Instead, you could just use
a simulator or emulators.

8
00:00:18,865 --> 00:00:21,425
Simulators and
emulators are great tools.

9
00:00:21,425 --> 00:00:25,035
While they're not always 100% accurate,
because they're on different hardware

10
00:00:25,035 --> 00:00:28,745
and sometimes have a different code
path, they'll often get the job done.

11
00:00:28,745 --> 00:00:30,445
And for this course, we'll be just fine.

12
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:35,930
In this course, Cam and I are going to
use an emulator built into Chrome, but

13
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:39,530
be sure to check out some of the other
ones including the iOS simulator, and

14
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:42,640
some of the cloud based services
in the instructor notes.

15
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,280
>> Nice, I like that a lot more,

16
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,170
emulation is definitely
the much cheaper solution.

17
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:49,340
>> It is,
here lemme show you how it works.
