1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:03,100
Okay, let's take a look at the code.

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:05,130
It's all in main activity.

3
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:09,130
Here the imports that we need for
the DataLayer, the TagManager, and

4
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:12,800
here's the updated version of
the showDailySpecial method.

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,750
We get the pop-up menu, we use the
food_prefs_menu, that's already defined,

6
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:19,650
to Show the menu of food preferences.

7
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:22,470
We set the on click action for
the pop up menu

8
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:26,540
to call the new method that puts
the food preference in the data layer,

9
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:31,017
and then it calls a method to start
the ShowDailySpecial activity.

10
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:34,670
And then we show the pop up menu.

11
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:38,190
And then here's the method to
get the food preference and

12
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:39,380
save it in the data layer.

13
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:43,350
We'll get the Tag Manager instance,
we get the data layer, and

14
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:46,140
then, depending on which
menu item was selected,

15
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:52,230
we push the appropriate value into
the data layer, keyed by food_pref.

16
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:54,530
There's vegan, vegetarian,
fish, and so on.

17
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:59,280
And then here's a method that simply
starts the ShowDailySpecial activity.

18
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,540
Notice that we don't pass
the food preference here,

19
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:05,129
because the activity's actually
going to get it out of the data layer.
