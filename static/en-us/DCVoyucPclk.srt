1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:01,670
Okay, Charles.
I'm going to see if I can get you to

2
00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:05,310
derive a piece of the temporal
difference equation

3
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:08,000
just by working through this example
again in a slightly different way.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,100
So from the last thing we talked about,
we said that the value estimate for

5
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:16,920
S1 after three episodes was 5.

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:21,620
And then we ran an episode, and
the return of that episode,

7
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:25,590
sort of the total discounted reward for
that episode, episode number 4,

8
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:28,624
starting from that state S1, was +2.

9
00:00:28,624 --> 00:00:32,610
Could we just from this information

10
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:34,720
figure out what the new
estimate's going to be?

11
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:37,010
>> Sure.

12
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:38,030
>> So let's see if we can do that.

13
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:39,530
Let's work through that, step by step.

14
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:40,210
>> Oh, okay.

15
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:43,750
Well I can cheat right, by just, I mean
you have everything indexed by time so

16
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:49,310
I know that five is an estimate
of the last three, and

17
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:52,160
four is an estimate of the fourth one.

18
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:52,700
>> Right.

19
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:55,010
>> So, I should be able to, you know,

20
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:59,790
weight the first one with three,
and the other with one, or

21
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:02,360
something like that, and
that'll give me the right answer.

22
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:04,560
>> All right, so
what do you mean by weight?

23
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:09,100
So what you mean is since five is
the average of the first three episodes

24
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:11,830
then 15 is the total from
the first three episodes, right?

25
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:13,490
>> That's right.
I've seen it three times.

26
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:16,310
>> Good as if we had
seen five three times.

27
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:19,180
You know the details actually
varied from that but

28
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:21,220
that's okay because
averages work out nicely.

29
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:22,280
>> That's right doesn't matter.

30
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:26,420
>> Then we got an additional
reward of two and

31
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,729
now we want to know the average
over four steps right.

32
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:34,715
So that gives us 15 + 2 / 4 is 17/4
which is just the answer we had in

33
00:01:34,715 --> 00:01:35,380
the quiz.

34
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:36,920
>> In fact that's exactly how I did it.

35
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:41,060
I just took the 15 over 3
that you had written down and

36
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:44,030
just said, oh so that would be 17/4.

37
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:44,630
>> Good.
So

38
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:46,270
let's generalize this a little bit and

39
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:48,460
put in some letters
because you know math.

40
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:53,340
So let's say instead that we're
talking about the previous estimate,

41
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:55,470
which was from time T minus 1.

42
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:59,250
Then we get a return on step T of T, and

43
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:03,490
now we want to compute the new estimate,
VT of S1.

44
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:06,260
So we should be able to do that
same kind of calculation with these

45
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:08,139
quantities just symbolically.

46
00:02:08,139 --> 00:02:09,990
Okay so you want to try that again?

47
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:10,699
>> Sure.

48
00:02:10,699 --> 00:02:16,011
So I think I know what
the VT of S1 is equal to.

49
00:02:16,011 --> 00:02:24,370
(T-1) times V sub T-1 of S1 +
R sub T of S1 divided by T.

50
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:27,210
>> Good.
Which was four before, but

51
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:28,880
now in general it's T.

52
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:29,400
Excellent.

53
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,160
All right, so let's now do
a little bit of algebra on this.

54
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:32,970
>> Oh, sure.

55
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:36,320
>> So first I'm just going to divide
through by this capital T, and

56
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,700
split it into two pieces of the sum.

57
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,030
>> Okay.
>> All right, so

58
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:42,860
then we can regroup things as follows.

59
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:47,400
Let's see, so I guess, mainly the idea
is that we split this T-1 over T

60
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,400
into a T over T, and a -1 over T.

61
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,205
So that gets us (VT-1(S1)) + (1 over

62
00:02:55,205 --> 00:03:00,014
T (RT(S1))- (VT-1(S1)).

63
00:03:00,014 --> 00:03:02,480
So I wrote it kind of funky.

64
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,170
I introduced this additional learning
rate parameter, alpha sub T,

65
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:10,050
the learning rate at times step T, but

66
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:12,760
it's really just playing the role
of one over T here, the averaging.

67
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:15,310
But there's an interesting thing that
popped out of this particular way of

68
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:16,440
rewriting it.

69
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:22,010
In that we are looking at kind of
a temporal difference that our update

70
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:26,610
to the value is going to equal the
difference between the reward that we

71
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:30,100
got at this step and the estimate
that we had at the previous step.

72
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:32,420
And so this difference is actually
going to drive the learning.

73
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:35,730
So if the difference is zero
then things don't change.

74
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:38,740
If the difference is big positive

75
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:41,910
then it goes up then if it's
big negative then it goes down.

76
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:47,450
And as we get more and
more episodes this learning parameter

77
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:50,840
is getting smaller and smaller so we're
making smaller and smaller changes.

78
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:53,480
We're kind of honing in on
the actual true values.

79
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:58,930
>> So this actually looks just like
the update rule for perceptrons.

80
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:02,800
Yes, yes, and in fact that was I believe
that what Sutton was trying to do.

81
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,370
He wanted to make
temporal predictions and

82
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:08,950
he wanted to put it into the same kind
of algebraic framework that people were

83
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:12,790
familiar with from perceptron learning
and from neural net learning.

84
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:17,988
>> Right, so if we did it that way
then RT minus V sub T is the error.

85
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:20,040
>> Very good.

86
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,130
Yeah, that's a great way to look at it.

87
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:23,990
That we're making our update
based on moving a little bit in

88
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:25,410
the direction of there.

89
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:27,320
>> Right, moving less and
less and less as time goes on,

90
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,730
which is just what you're supposed
to do at the learning rate.

91
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:31,220
>> Exactly.

92
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:33,970
>> So, let me asks a question
along those lines then.

93
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:38,450
So if alpha sub T was not 1 over T but

94
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:42,140
something else, like I don't know, 1
over the square root of T or something.

95
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:44,415
Some other way of doing a learning rate.

96
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:46,360
>> Uh-huh
>> You would get a slightly different

97
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,480
answer at any given time.

98
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:53,020
But would you expect to kind of
converge to the same answer ultimately?

99
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:54,360
>> That is a really good question.

100
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,830
In fact that is the next
question I was going to ask.

101
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:57,900
>> Oh wow.

102
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:58,655
I feel better now.

103
00:04:58,655 --> 00:05:00,760
>> [LAUGH] So here it comes.
