Going through this lesson, there will be some opportunities for quizzes. And

2
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:08,390
what I'd like to do is have you consider a simple application that I'm, then,

3
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:13,370
going to be asking you questions about. The application involves users and

4
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:16,400
a web browser, visiting some kind of website and

5
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:22,620
being asked to vote on certain questions. The votes are then submitted and

6
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:27,950
the system responds back after registering the vote with some count of how

7
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:34,170
other people voted on the same, same question. So the application is web-based,

8
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:37,940
users are polled on a variety of questions, their choices are recorded,

9
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:41,220
and there's a display of how others voted. And, in this particular

10
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:46,470
situation the actual users remain anonymous as far as the database is concerned.
