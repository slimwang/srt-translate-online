1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,380
>> This time, I'm going to be talking
with our startups about design sprints.

2
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:05,216
I'm back here again with Pete and Pete,

3
00:00:05,216 --> 00:00:08,250
could you tell me a little bit
about design sprints at Optimizely?

4
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:11,750
And so first, I guess does
Optimizely use design sprints?

5
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:16,422
>> So we're an agile shop, which means
we use sprints for not only design, but

6
00:00:16,422 --> 00:00:18,905
also product and engineering as well and

7
00:00:18,905 --> 00:00:22,130
that means that we all get
together every two weeks.

8
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:24,500
And we talk about what we
did in the past two weeks.

9
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,697
We plan what we're going to do
the following two weeks and

10
00:00:27,697 --> 00:00:31,160
do a bit of a retrospective and
that goes for our design teams,

11
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:33,840
we have sort of two big
parts of our design team.

12
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,420
We have our product design team and
they focus on our user experience.

13
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:41,325
They actually design the products we
build and we have our communication

14
00:00:41,325 --> 00:00:45,679
design team and they design our sales
collateral, our marketing collateral and

15
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:49,920
sort of all of the branding and imagery
that we use to convey Optimizely brand.

16
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,420
They both use agile, as well.

17
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:53,000
>> Great.

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,670
How does Optimizely actually
do user testing for its users?

19
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:58,340
>> Good question.

20
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:03,210
So as you might expect, we do run
a lot of AB tests on our own website.

21
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:05,250
We use our product to use that,
of course.

22
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:07,861
>> [LAUGH]
>> But that's not the whole picture,

23
00:01:07,861 --> 00:01:09,800
it never is the whole picture.

24
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:14,156
It's one aspect of understanding your
customers, but it's not the end all be

25
00:01:14,156 --> 00:01:17,330
all and so we try to spend a lot
of time with our customers.

26
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:22,670
We have a program we call OPS,
Optimizely Promoter System.

27
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:27,083
Where we try to measure how likely
our customers are to recommend our

28
00:01:27,083 --> 00:01:31,730
product to their colleagues and then
we allow them to give us a bit of text

29
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:35,525
feedback on why they would or
why they wouldn't and we then

30
00:01:35,525 --> 00:01:40,500
follow up with the detractors and
try to understand what's going on there.

31
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,920
That's another venue for
customer feedback.

32
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:46,412
We also have a great user research
team who will bring in customers, so

33
00:01:46,412 --> 00:01:48,200
we can watch them use our products.

34
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,840
Ask them questions,
put prototypes in front of them.

35
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:55,550
So I'm really proud of the way we've
tried to integrate the customer into our

36
00:01:55,550 --> 00:02:00,042
development process and I think it
comes from our early days when we were,

37
00:02:00,042 --> 00:02:01,870
Dan and I were the engineers.

38
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:03,989
We were the designers,
we were the sales people and

39
00:02:03,989 --> 00:02:05,330
we were sort of doing all of that.

40
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:07,229
And that's really hard to do, but

41
00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:11,170
the beauty of it is that your customer
engineer feedback cycle is zero.

42
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:11,670
>> Yeah.

43
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:12,727
>> And that's I think,

44
00:02:12,727 --> 00:02:16,086
a really powerful thing about
an engineering founder of a company.

45
00:02:16,086 --> 00:02:18,926
>> You can be so close to the source and
iterate so quickly.

46
00:02:18,926 --> 00:02:21,086
>> That's right,
you can iterate instantaneously.

47
00:02:21,086 --> 00:02:22,102
>> Yeah, sounds good.
