1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,880
Let's construct the route for
our new menu item.

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:07,590
Now when i visit slash restaurant and
pass in an integer and then slash new.

3
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:10,970
This integer will get passed in as
the restaurant ID for the new menu item

4
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:14,960
function and successfully return
that task one is complete.

5
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,520
The edit menu item takes
in two parameters, so

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,460
we need to make sure that our
route also has two parameters.

7
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:23,110
The restaurant ID and the menu ID.

8
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:24,710
And then slash at it.

9
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:27,210
Now we'll see that this page also works.

10
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:31,060
Similarly to the edit route the delete
route looks just about the same.

11
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:33,080
Except that it has slash delete.

12
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:35,340
Now our final route is also working.

13
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:38,130
The solutions for this challenge
are available in the instructor notes.
