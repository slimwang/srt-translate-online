[Male narrator] Here's one more example of reasoning in propositional logic.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
In a particular model of the world, we know the following 3 sentences are true.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,000
E or B implies A,

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:23,000
A implies J and M,

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and B.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
We know those 3 senetences to be true, and that's all we know.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Now, I want you to tell me for each of the 5 propositional symbols,

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:45,000
is that symbol true or false, or unknown in this model,

9
00:00:45,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and tell me for the symbols E, B, A, J, and M.
