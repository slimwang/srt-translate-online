00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,060
While creating this course, I visited

2
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:04,380
Facebook with Dean Warren Solomon and spoke

3
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:08,310
with many data scientists. I learned a lot about EDA, and I'm excited

4
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:11,680
to share those stories with you throughout the course. First, you'll hear from

5
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:15,780
Aude to talk about what she finds most interesting about being a data scientist.

6
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:21,408
>> So what I really like is, being able to go from Rita wrote that, we have

7
00:00:21,408 --> 00:00:26,400
like billions and trillions of rows of data. You don't know what's interesting.

8
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,024
It's like gigantic thing and you need

9
00:00:29,024 --> 00:00:32,058
to, must investigate and have some ideas on

10
00:00:32,058 --> 00:00:35,174
what might be interesting, and then try

11
00:00:35,174 --> 00:00:39,372
investigating it, like, in different ways. Sometimes you

12
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:42,063
use, charts, sometimes you use maps and

13
00:00:42,063 --> 00:00:46,065
sometimes you come across something that's, interesting and

14
00:00:46,065 --> 00:00:51,480
that you want to, dig a little bit more into. And then eventually, once we have

15
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,970
figured out something interesting that we've developed the

16
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:58,340
corresponding algorithms, then the goal is to have an

17
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:03,000
impact on, either understanding the world or changing

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,070
the Facebook product. And being able to go from.

19
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:09,730
We have all this data, we don't know what to do with it. So like, we're going to

20
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:13,290
make a significant impact on like, understanding mobility

21
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:17,010
or improving Facebook. That's like a, a real awesome

22
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:18,010
flow of work.
