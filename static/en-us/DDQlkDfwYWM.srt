1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,565
So now, let's consider division. I know division is the inverse of

2
00:00:03,577 --> 00:00:07,585
multiplication. So it should also take higher priority over addition and

3
00:00:07,596 --> 00:00:11,270
subtraction. So we know in our hierarchy of the order of operations,

4
00:00:11,367 --> 00:00:15,590
multiplication and division should come first. Let's consider this problem:

5
00:00:15,602 --> 00:00:19,985
negative 3 plus 24, divided by 4 times 3. Here are the two expressions that I

6
00:00:19,997 --> 00:00:24,260
could write. This first expression has the parentheses around the 24 and the 4.

7
00:00:24,357 --> 00:00:28,405
The second one has parentheses around the 4 and the 3. In this problem it's

8
00:00:28,417 --> 00:00:32,575
unclear whether or not we're dividing just by 4, or dividing by 4 times 3. We

9
00:00:32,587 --> 00:00:36,295
assume that this is true whenever we see the division symbol without

10
00:00:36,307 --> 00:00:40,520
parentheses. The number immediately after it is included or divided into the

11
00:00:40,532 --> 00:00:44,662
number before it. So, there's no need to solve this problem. Here's one other

12
00:00:44,674 --> 00:00:48,563
word of caution. Whenever we think about simplifying this expression, we don't

13
00:00:48,575 --> 00:00:52,171
actually want to use PEMDAS. If you've heard of PEMDAS, then you probably

14
00:00:52,183 --> 00:00:56,206
remember that multiplication comes before division. But, this is not necessarily

15
00:00:56,218 --> 00:00:59,923
true. Multiplication and division have the same priority whenever we do the

16
00:00:59,935 --> 00:01:03,774
order of operations. Students who learn that multiplication comes first using

17
00:01:03,786 --> 00:01:08,133
PEMDAS would be incorrect. We know we should carry out this division before we

18
00:01:08,145 --> 00:01:11,650
do the multiplication. In general, we should think about doing our

19
00:01:11,662 --> 00:01:15,883
simplification from left to right, because multiplication and division have the

20
00:01:15,895 --> 00:01:20,077
same priority in the order of operations. So these parentheses are assumed to be

21
00:01:20,089 --> 00:01:24,056
the case, so let's evaluate this expression. I have -3 plus 6 times 3. And

22
00:01:24,068 --> 00:01:27,673
negative 3 plus 18. Negative 3 plus 18 makes 15. In doing our order of

23
00:01:27,685 --> 00:01:31,849
operations, it's important to remember the hierarchy. That multiplication and

24
00:01:31,861 --> 00:01:35,758
division have the same priority and should be done from left to right in the

25
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:36,745
order of operation.
