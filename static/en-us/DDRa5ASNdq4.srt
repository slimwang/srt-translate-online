00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:04,000
Imagine that you have a 28 by 28 image.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,370
You run a 3 by 3 convolution on
it with an input depth of 3 and

3
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:10,290
an output depth of 8.

4
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:13,980
What are the dimensions of
your output feature maps?

5
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:19,070
When you're using same
padding with a stride of 1,

6
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:22,350
when you're using valid padding
with a stride of 1, and

7
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:24,975
when you're using valid
padding with a stride of 2.
