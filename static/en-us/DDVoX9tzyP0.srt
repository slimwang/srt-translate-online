1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,840
To produce a production ready version
of our site, we can skip the whole live

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,650
editing and watching, and include
the scripts distribution task instead.

3
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:09,160
Nothing easier than that.

4
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:13,390
Let's call the new task dist and include
the following tasks in that order.

5
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:14,470
Copy html.

6
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:15,730
Copy images.

7
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:16,780
Styles.

8
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:17,670
Lint.

9
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:19,820
And finally scripts-dist.

10
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:22,144
Try running the tasks
via gulp scripts-dist.

11
00:00:22,144 --> 00:00:26,040
If gulp takes slightly longer, and
exists without opening the browser,

12
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:29,600
you're all set, and have a production
ready distribution in your dist folder.

13
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:33,420
Before we continue, one word of
advice regarding minification.

14
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:37,290
Minification on its own is great,
but GZIP is even more affective.

15
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:39,890
GZIP compresses the file before it
gets in, and out to the browser,

16
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:42,140
and the browser deflates it.

17
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:44,300
All of this happens transparently
in the background and

18
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:47,670
usually only requires a small
server configuration change.

19
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:49,350
