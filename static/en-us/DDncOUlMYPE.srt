Here we have two pretty simple exponential functions. Two to the power of X and three to the power of X.

2
00:00:07,033 --> 00:00:15,366
Two to the power of zero is one; three to the power of zero is one; two to the power of one is two.

3
00:00:15,367 --> 00:00:23,766
Two to the power of two is four. Two to the power of minus one equals one over two, one half, and so on.

4
00:00:23,767 --> 00:00:30,766
Three to the power of one equals three. Three to the power of two gets pretty big--nine.

5
00:00:30,767 --> 00:00:37,199
Three to the power of minus one, one over three, one-third, and so on, and so on.

6
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:43,066
Here comes a quiz for you: What's the slope of the tangent line at X equals zero?

7
00:00:43,067 --> 00:00:50,466
Is the slope larger than one? Is it equal to one, or is it smaller than one?

8
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:54,967
In both cases, look at the tangent lines--what would you say?
