1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:01,509
I'm back again.

2
00:00:01,509 --> 00:00:05,210
This time with a really small segment.

3
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:07,620
We need to plug two histograms.

4
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:11,330
So first we need the values for
two stocks.

5
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:16,570
We get data for two stocks,
which is SPY and XOM.

6
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:20,300
We also go ahead and compute daily
returns for each of the stock.

7
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:25,980
Note that our daily return data frame
will have daily return values for

8
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:27,960
each of the stock prices.

9
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:32,990
Now like before, we just call histogram
function on the daily return data frame,

10
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:35,270
and let's see what happens.

11
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:37,390
We keep the bins count to be 20.

12
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:39,645
Now let's run this.

13
00:00:39,645 --> 00:00:42,230
Okay, so we got two subplots.

14
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:46,140
But we go ahead one step and
plot them on the same x and

15
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:50,720
y axis so that we can compare
the histogram of SPY and XOM.

16
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:56,740
To get two histograms on the same x and
y axis, we call the histogram

17
00:00:56,740 --> 00:01:01,510
functions separately on each of
the stocks daily return values.

18
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:04,290
We also add the label parameter so

19
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:09,570
that we can differentiate between
the histogram of the SPY and XOM.

20
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,420
Now, let's run this.

21
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:12,390
Here we go.

22
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:18,140
We get two histogram of SPY and
XOM on the same X and Y axis.

23
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:20,390
Now you can compare the histogram and

24
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:24,990
see that the teams of XOM is
thin as compared to the SPY.

25
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,895
That's it for this coding segment.

26
00:01:27,895 --> 00:01:29,800
I'll be back soon.

27
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:30,790
Over to you professor.
