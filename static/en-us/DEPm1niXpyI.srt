00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,500
The solution here is pretty straightforward. First, we add a currSpriteName to

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:07,822
our EntityClass. If this is defined, we actually use this sprite name to call

3
00:00:07,822 --> 00:00:12,330
the drawSprite function that we defined previously. This will take the sprite

4
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:13,760
name looked up the proper values in the

5
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:15,150
[INAUDIBLE].

6
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:18,268
And then draw to the map. What we provide here is actually a position for where

7
00:00:18,268 --> 00:00:22,425
this sprite should be drawn in the universe. Again, recall that we actually use

8
00:00:22,425 --> 00:00:25,505
an offset of half size of the entity in order to center it around it's

9
00:00:25,505 --> 00:00:30,560
location, rather than having the origin be the top left hand corner.
