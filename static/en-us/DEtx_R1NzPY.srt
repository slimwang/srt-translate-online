1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:03,969
So we said one of the biggest problems
with K means is that it was really

2
00:00:03,969 --> 00:00:08,710
sensitive to, sort of needing to
know how many clusters there were,

3
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:13,285
what K was, and also possibly to the
initial conditions, that you gave it.

4
00:00:13,285 --> 00:00:17,666
So the assumption of K means is that
there are essentially these spherical

5
00:00:17,666 --> 00:00:19,515
clumps within feature space.

6
00:00:19,515 --> 00:00:23,695
So if you're thinking of these
as a probability distribution,

7
00:00:23,695 --> 00:00:28,685
it is that there would be a couple of
modes, peaks, in our features space

8
00:00:28,685 --> 00:00:32,685
that, and sort of falling, nearby
those peaks is a sort of fall off, and

9
00:00:32,685 --> 00:00:37,460
that our pixel intensities are
distributed according to a probability

10
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:39,780
density function that has these modes.

11
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:42,760
So if you could find the modes,

12
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:46,360
you might be able to
segment the image that way.

13
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:49,580
So, the approach that we
are going to talk about for

14
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:52,160
doing that is called the mean
shift algorithm, and

15
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,730
we actually introduced this when
we were talking about tracking.

16
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:59,250
It's a little bit easier to talk about
that when we do it as a cluster.

17
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:04,599
So the mean shift algorithm was designed
as a way of finding these modes,

18
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:08,010
or these local maxima of density,
in some feature spaces.

19
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:12,400
So here, by the way, this,
this is a beautiful, pastel image of,

20
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,350
these houses, as the input image, and

21
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:20,800
what we have here on the right is
the plotting of each of these pixels

22
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:25,640
in the L u v color space.

23
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,060
You remember L u v color?

24
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:29,920
This is why we're doing this
whole conversation after,

25
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:30,820
we talked about color.

26
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:32,920
Because if I told you L u v and

27
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:36,620
you hadn't heard it and think I was
doing RGB, no it's L u v, right?

28
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:38,020
And you can imagine right away,

29
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:42,950
that looking at a picture like this,
the color, the chroma, is what matters,

30
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:45,540
and the absolute intensity
might matter less, right?

31
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:48,590
Because the, so let's see,
using this yellow here.

32
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:51,270
So this is a brighter yellow,
and this is a darker yellow,

33
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:55,380
but I would like to have them both
be in the same color segment.

34
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,640
So L u v makes that easier.
