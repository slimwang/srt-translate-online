00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:02,890
This lesson and the following ones are designed to

2
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:05,500
give you the tools that build designs that scale across

3
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:09,280
multiple devices. And one of the first challenges with developing

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,580
for the mobile web, is the display screen. The typically

5
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:15,690
small display screen compared to your desktop or laptop

6
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:18,835
device really forces you to focus on what's critical for

7
00:00:18,835 --> 00:00:21,330
your users, in fact this is what's led to the

8
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:26,070
recent adoption of the mantra mobile first. Now, mobile first

9
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:28,110
isn't about designing for the mobile web

10
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:31,080
before you even think about the desktop experience.

11
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,480
It's really a design philosophy of stripping down

12
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,130
to your core user experience and then layering

13
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:37,820
additional gravy on top if you have

14
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:40,910
the appropriate space. For example you might put

15
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:43,420
your company info links inside a menu rather

16
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:45,020
then cluttering up your home screen with them.
