00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,573
Here is another equation. 3 over x minus 1 over the quantity 5x is equal to 7.

2
00:00:04,573 --> 00:00:09,090
Again, we have choices about what to do first. I'm going to say that I'd like

3
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:13,482
our first step this time to be to combine the two fractions over here on the

4
00:00:13,482 --> 00:00:18,009
left hand side. We can see that x is involved in both these fractions, so it

5
00:00:18,009 --> 00:00:22,169
seems like a pretty logical first step to take to me. So if we decide to do

6
00:00:22,169 --> 00:00:26,390
that, what should we make the denominator of the single fraction we'll have here

7
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:30,051
on the left side? Make sure that this is the least common denominator we could

8
00:00:30,051 --> 00:00:30,359
have.
