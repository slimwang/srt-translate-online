1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:04,530
Okay, so for the first one, learn
to fly.com, it can be a bit tricky.

2
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:07,060
We need to think about
our overall traffic, but

3
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:09,920
we also want to look at
overall conversions.

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:11,590
Now if we increase
the amount of traffic,

5
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:15,930
by people who are serious about taking
flying lessons and who actually can.

6
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:19,600
We're going to see a greater number of
people of actually buying those lessons

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,700
than if it was just random traffic.

8
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:25,120
So we're going to look
at C Conversions and

9
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:29,820
A traffic, but
the most important here is Conversions.

10
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:34,340
And for the second one, movie man.com,
we're going to want to look at retention

11
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:37,530
rate for
the first month after people sign up.

12
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:40,760
If your retention rate increases,
you know that you've achieved your goal.
