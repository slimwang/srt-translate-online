1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:03,900
[LAUGH] Okay, let's pick one
more Boolean function to do.

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:05,689
What function am I thinking of?

3
00:00:05,689 --> 00:00:07,496
>> XOR is always good.

4
00:00:07,496 --> 00:00:08,170
>> Let's do XOR.

5
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:11,550
So what does XOR mean?

6
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:12,100
Remind me.

7
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:14,350
>> Okay.
XOR is exclusive or,

8
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:18,720
which means it's true if A is true or
B is true, but not if they're both true,

9
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,350
so it has elements of both or
and and in it.

10
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:22,120
>> Right.

11
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,690
>> And I think of XOR usually when I'm,

12
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:26,110
when I'm, like,
playing with light switches in my house.

13
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:28,920
If I have a, a light that's activated
by two different light switches,

14
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,140
it's usually an XOR function.

15
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:32,470
If one is up, the light's on,
if the other one's up,

16
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:34,430
the lights on, but if they're both up,
the light goes back off.

17
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,850
>> Right.
The other thing when I think of XOR is

18
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:41,230
when people say or most of the time when
people say or, when they're talking,

19
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:42,280
they mean xor.

20
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,620
>> Really?

21
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:45,830
>> Yeah.
So a lot of times when people say or

22
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:47,500
in English, they really mean xor.

23
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:53,390
They say, well do you want to go to the
movies or do you want to go swimming?

24
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:55,180
Do want to eat chicken or
do you want to eat fish?

25
00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:58,600
And really, they're saying either or.

26
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,580
>> I see, you want one or

27
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:03,170
the other, but you can't have chicken
and fish or go swimming and the movies.

28
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:04,989
>> No, those things are not
possible to do together.

29
00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:05,590
>> Got it.

30
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:08,650
Okay.
>> All right, so how would you do XOR?

31
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:09,560
We got, we still have our-

32
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:10,522
>> Well, I would start with the-

33
00:01:10,522 --> 00:01:13,010
>> Or, because it's a lot like or.

34
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:14,960
>> So, what would you want to do?

35
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,930
>> Okay, so to do XOR,
we can split on A.

36
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:17,430
>> Okay.

37
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:21,420
>> And there's a true branch and
a false branch.

38
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:25,180
And what happened with and
and or at this point is,

39
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:27,350
there is at least one branch where
we actually knew the answer,

40
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:29,316
at this point, but
I don't think that's true here.

41
00:01:29,316 --> 00:01:31,850
>> That's right.

42
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:34,060
>> So, so if A is true,
the output might be true or false.

43
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:35,490
It depends on B.

44
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:38,310
And if A is false,
the output might be False or True.

45
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:38,910
It depends on B.

46
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:40,960
So I-
>> This is exactly right.

47
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:46,120
So I guess in both cases we
still have to split on B.

48
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:46,850
>> Okay.
All right.

49
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:49,810
So, now it should be relatively easy in

50
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:55,120
the sense that there's a separate
leaf for all possible inputs.

51
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,320
And so we can just write
the XOR function on the bottom.

52
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:01,270
So if A and B are both true, then the
output is false because it's exclusive.

53
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:06,600
If A is true and B is false, then it
should be true, because A is true.

54
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:10,650
If A is false and B is true, then it
should be true because B is true.

55
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:15,090
And if A and B are both false
then it should be false.

56
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,220
>> That's right.

57
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,790
And by the way,
if you were to think about it for

58
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:21,480
a little while, it would probably
occur to you that's this tree is

59
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,919
just a another representation
of the full truth table.

60
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:25,700
>> Very nice.

61
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,032
>> And in fact, if we wanted to do or
again, we could say,

62
00:02:31,032 --> 00:02:36,403
well I was very smart last time, but
I could actually write or like this.

63
00:02:42,377 --> 00:02:44,570
And then just fill out
the values at the bottom.

64
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:47,420
If A is true and B is true, then yes.

65
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:49,790
If A is true and B is false, then yes.

66
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:52,290
If A is false and B is true, then yes.

67
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:54,870
If A is false and B is false, then no.

68
00:02:54,870 --> 00:03:00,020
And this is a perfectly legitimate a
decision tree to represent or because it

69
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:04,070
basically is just another simple
representation of the truth table,

70
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:06,650
but as we pointed out
when did last time,

71
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:08,680
it's more of a decision
tree than we actually need.

72
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:12,500
>> I can see that.

73
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:15,449
>> Because in particular,
we don't actually need this.

74
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:17,690
All right.

75
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:21,440
So this little difference here between
writing out the entire truth table on

76
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,930
the left, as we did for XOR, and not
having to write out the entire decision

77
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:28,690
tree on the right for o,r actually isn't
going to turn out to matter when we

78
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:33,880
try to do things either more complicated
or with more attributes that we did for

79
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,340
the simple and, or, and XOR.

80
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,610
Would you like to see?

81
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:38,880
>> Yeah, that sounds really cool.

82
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,380
>> Beautiful.
