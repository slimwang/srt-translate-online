1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
[Norvig] But we don't just have 1 property class; we have 5 property classes.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
We've got the nationalities and the pets and so on.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
And so if we want to make all the different ways of making assignments

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
of all 5 properties to all 5 houses

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
so each house will have a color, a nationality, a pet and so on

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
in each of the possible ways of making that assignment,

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
how many is that?

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Is it 5 times 5 factorial;

9
00:00:26,000 --> 99:59:59,999
5 factorial squared; 5 factorial to the 5th; or 5 factorial factorial?
