1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,940
Now that you have Vagrant and Virtual Blocks set up on your local machine,

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:10,210
either Windows, Mac OS X, or Ubuntu, or another version or distro of Linux,

3
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:13,830
we now are going to clone the gate hub repository for the course.

4
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:17,350
So in step one on your local machine at the command prompt,

5
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:20,610
navigate to the directory you want to create the course.

6
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:24,158
I've created a directory called Real-Time$.

7
00:00:24,158 --> 00:00:27,968
Next type in the command git clone with

8
00:00:27,968 --> 00:00:33,934
address https://github.com/Udacity/ud381.

9
00:00:33,934 --> 00:00:36,303
You can also simply copy and paste.

10
00:00:36,303 --> 00:00:41,690
So I'll copy this, go back to my directory, type this in and hit Enter.

11
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:45,740
Once you see your repository cloned, you can do an ls which stands for list.

12
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,350
You see ud381.

13
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:52,420
Do cd into ud381 and now we do an ls again and

14
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:55,980
we see that we are in the ud381 directory.

15
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:59,170
Going back to the directions in Step 2, I'll scroll down a bit.

16
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:00,640
Depending your download speed,

17
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,750
the following command will take about 20 to 30 minutes.

18
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:06,430
You can continue on with the course once you hit Enter and

19
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:07,990
the process can take place in the background.

20
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:13,090
So, go back, make sure you're in ud381, and type the command vagrant up.

21
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:17,920
So type in, make sure you're ud381, vagrant up.

22
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,960
So that's two words, vagrant up, hit Enter.

23
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:25,360
Just wait a few seconds and make sure you see the download process begin.

24
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,880
It shows that the box can't be found and what's happening is your computer is

25
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:34,770
connecting to the Vagrant cloud to download the box udacity/ud381.

26
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:38,960
So notice the progress here may take 20 or 30 minutes.

27
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,550
And we can just continue on with the course.

28
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:43,120
Great. And hit Next to continue.
