1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:05,100
It is fairly common practice
to take this set of data and

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,880
fit a line to it using
linear regression.

3
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:10,880
Let's say we got a line
something like that.

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,340
And to look at the statistics
of that linear fit.

5
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:16,820
One property is the slope.

6
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:20,380
When we fit a line,
what's the slope of that line?

7
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:22,350
Let's assume it turns out to be 1 for

8
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:26,760
this particular stock and
its relationship to the S&P 500.

9
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,349
This slope, in financial terminology,

10
00:00:30,349 --> 00:00:37,220
is usually referred to as beta with
this symbol, or just the word beta.

11
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:41,830
And what beta means is how reactive
is the stock to the market.

12
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:47,140
So if beta is 1, and
we have a slope here of 1, it means,

13
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:53,340
on average, when the market goes up 1%,
that particular stock also goes up 1%.

14
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:58,255
If we have, say, a higher number, say,

15
00:00:58,255 --> 00:01:02,450
2, that would mean that if
the market were to go up 1%,

16
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:06,310
we'd expect on average for
that stock to go up 2%.

17
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:10,000
There's another factor you can see here

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,340
when you look at where that line
intercepts the vertical axis.

19
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,910
That is called alpha.

20
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:22,428
And you've probably heard about
alpha in investing circles, and

21
00:01:22,428 --> 00:01:28,734
what that means is that this stock is
actually on average performing a little

22
00:01:28,734 --> 00:01:35,610
bit better than the S&P 500 every day
if that number, alpha, is positive.

23
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:36,290
If it's negative,

24
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:40,590
it means on average it's returning a
little bit less than the market overall.

25
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,290
That's how you can plot the data,
fit a line to it, and

26
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:51,325
measure a couple aspects of this
performance with regard to the market or

27
00:01:51,325 --> 00:01:52,750
with regard to some other stock.
