00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:04,180
Suppose you have a set of stocks that
you've determined are good investments.

2
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:07,430
How much of your portfolio
should you invest in each?

3
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:11,400
There are many potential
answers to that question.

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,440
In this lesson we take a look at
the approach called mean variance

5
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:17,870
optimization, or portfolio optimization.

6
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:21,120
The specific question we're
looking to answer is this.

7
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:23,710
Given a set of equities and

8
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:28,830
a target return, find an allocation
to each equity that minimizes risk.
