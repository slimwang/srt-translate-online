00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,510
In this lesson we're going to learn how to use

2
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:05,930
memcache in App Engine applications. One good thing about using

3
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:08,880
Objectify is that you can configure it to automatically use

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,040
Memcahce to cache your entity data. All you have to

5
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:16,850
do is add @cache annotation to your entity class. Then

6
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:19,350
Objectify is going to do its best to use Memcache

7
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:22,120
whenever possible when you try to get entity data, to

8
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:25,400
reduce hits to the data store. It's really easy to use

9
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,970
Objectify with Memcache, but there's a few things

10
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:30,590
that you should know about how Objectify uses

11
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:33,580
Memcache. For one thing, it only uses Memcache

12
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:36,170
when you get an entity by key, you save

13
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:39,840
it or you delete it. And query results

14
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,900
are not cached. Objectify puts the property values into

15
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:47,460
memcache. It doesn't put the entire entity into

16
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:50,450
memcache. Another thing that is really helpful to be

17
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:53,190
aware of is that objectify has its own session

18
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:55,920
cache. So often when you do a get by key,

19
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,390
objectify is going to get the results from the session cache

20
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:00,950
without even going to memcache, let along going to the

21
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:04,360
data store. So here's what the profile class looks

22
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:08,405
like with the @Cache annotation. All I did was add

23
00:01:08,405 --> 00:01:12,660
@Cache to the entity class definition and now objectify is

24
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:16,550
going to use memcache to cache property values whenever possible.

25
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:18,550
I don't even have to write a single line of

26
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:22,060
code to do it. So when you're applications been deployed

27
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:24,840
to app spot, you can use the memcache viewer to

28
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:29,090
view the memcache entries. I'm going to flush Memcache, to make

29
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:33,650
sure, that I have no Memcache entries to start with.

30
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:36,080
So now I have no entries in Memcache, I'm going to

31
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,450
go and do some things in my application, to see

32
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:41,700
if I can get some Memcache entries. When you go

33
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:44,490
to the profile page, it gets your profile entity out

34
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:47,270
of the data store if you already have a profile.

35
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:49,550
That's how it knows what your display name and tee

36
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:52,220
shirt size are. Here on the profile page, I'm going to

37
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:55,840
make a change. Change my tee shirt size, and update

38
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,770
my profile. I'm also going to go to the Show Conferences

39
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:03,250
page and show all the conferences. The list of conferences

40
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:06,320
is retrieved as a Query and as I already mentioned,

41
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,520
objectify doesn't use Memcache for Query results. However, we do

42
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:13,100
actually get the profile entity by key so we can

43
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:15,830
figure out the display name of the organizer. I can

44
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:19,900
also drill down into conference details. Which does a get by

45
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:22,300
key. So now I've done a few things that involve

46
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:25,020
getting entities by key from the data store. Let's see

47
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:28,040
if any of the results got cached in Memcache. So

48
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:31,340
you need to be sure to refresh the Memcache viewer to

49
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:33,670
get the latest data. And here you see there are

50
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:37,560
some Memcache entries. I've actually only got one item. And I

51
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,560
thought maybe I would've had a few more than that. The

52
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,200
reason there might not be as many items in Memcache as

53
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,470
you expect, is because Objectify has its own session cache. So

54
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:51,230
it's going to save data in the session cache, which will reduce

55
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:54,200
the use not only of Memcache, but of the data store.

56
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,510
So anyway, you end up seeing less items that you mark

57
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:59,780
with the Memcache viewer, because of the session cache. So

58
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:03,470
go ahead and update the conference and profile empty classes to

59
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:07,110
use Memcache. It's a good practice to always check any changes

60
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:10,060
to your app on localhost first. So feel free to do

61
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:13,300
that. And you're going to need to deploy to appspot, because

62
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:16,190
we want to use Memcache viewer. And for that, your app

63
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:19,130
has to be running on appspot. After you've deployed your app

64
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:21,710
to appspot, go to the Memcache viewer, and if you have

65
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:24,220
any items in Memcache, you might or you might not.

66
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:27,550
But if you do, go ahead and flush Memcache. Then

67
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:30,300
in your application, go ahead and do some things to

68
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:34,120
put some data into Memcache, so create some conferences, show

69
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:38,660
conferences, view details, maybe create or change a profile. And

70
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:41,550
then go back to the Memcache viewer and see if

71
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:44,540
you've got any entries in Memcache. You might need to

72
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:46,940
do a few things in your application to get some entries

73
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:50,390
to show up. And you'll probably less items in the Memcache.

74
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:54,350
Fewer than you might expect because Objectify uses it's own session cache.
