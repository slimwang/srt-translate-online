1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:01,830
We've seen a few examples, and

2
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:04,730
you've practiced writing reductions
on your own at this point.

3
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:07,370
Now I want you to test your
understanding by telling me which of

4
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:10,200
the following statements about
these two languages are true.

5
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:14,090
This one is the familiar
halting problem.

6
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:16,160
This one we'll call the empty problem.

7
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,620
The set of descriptions
of Turing machines,

8
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:21,080
where the Turing machine
accepts nothing.

9
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:23,930
Think very carefully,
and write out on pen and

10
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:25,650
paper, any reductions that you find.
