1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,380
Now that we have an extra column, our variable and

2
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:05,520
our data frame, we can create a histogram of it.

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,070
This histogram reveals that most households buy one or two

4
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:11,930
yogurts at a time. To dive deeper into our yogurt

5
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:15,800
prices and household behavior. Let's investigate the price over time

6
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:18,680
in more detail. This is where our Facebook data was

7
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:21,840
deficient. In this data set, we can examine changes in

8
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,730
prices because we have data on the same households over time.

9
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:27,440
So, now I want you to use your

10
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:30,260
knowledge of scatter plots and over-plotting to create

11
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:33,592
an appropriate visualization. Your visualization should be a

12
00:00:33,592 --> 00:00:37,310
scatter plot of price versus time. Now, there's no

13
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:39,280
right answer here, so just create a plot

14
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,200
that's sensible and that allows you to see the

15
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,450
data. You can assess your code and your

16
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:45,820
plot with what we did in the solution video.
