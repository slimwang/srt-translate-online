Try solving this quadratic equation for the values of r that make it true.

2
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:07,669
Remember, you'll need to set this equation equal to 0 before you can use this

3
00:00:07,669 --> 00:00:12,196
quadratic formula. Notice too, that instead of having the variable x, we have

4
00:00:12,196 --> 00:00:16,088
the variable r. That's okay though, because it isn't the variable that makes

5
00:00:16,088 --> 00:00:20,630
something quadratic. It's the square on the variable. So try rearranging this

6
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:24,670
equation, and then, write your final solutions here. Good luck.
