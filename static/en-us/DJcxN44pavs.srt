00:00:21,705 --> 00:00:27,560
>> Okay, so there's and association between the counter and the leaves, okay.

2
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:31,349
And we indicate that by a line, and we can come up with a label on it that says.

3
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:37,900
Count the, count the leaves in or just counts there. When we have,

4
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:40,615
when we have done that, when we have added that line, when we now have our,

5
00:00:40,615 --> 00:00:45,340
our, our class model diagram relatively complete and it's gotten a little bit

6
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:48,470
more complicated than we might have thought. If we have four classes,

7
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:52,060
there's one generalization relationship. There's a couple of aggregations.

8
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:56,110
There's general association. And then there are some, attributes and operations.
