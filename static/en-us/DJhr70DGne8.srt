1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:03,179
Now that we know what Firebase can do,

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:06,070
you might be eager to
see how it really works.

3
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:10,179
So you're going to start by downloading
an unfinished copy of the FriendlyChat

4
00:00:10,179 --> 00:00:11,219
app.

5
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:13,810
Then you'll set up a Firebase project.

6
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:16,640
You can use a Google account
if you already have one, or

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,130
you can just create one
easily if you don't.

8
00:00:19,129 --> 00:00:19,649
So don't worry.

9
00:00:19,649 --> 00:00:22,969
Next you'll create a Firebase
project in the Firebase console.

10
00:00:22,969 --> 00:00:27,179
This project is the home base for the
Firebase features that you'll use for

11
00:00:27,179 --> 00:00:30,929
Android, IOS, and
web versions of your app.

12
00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:35,179
Then we'll link the Firebase project and
dependencies to this app, so

13
00:00:35,179 --> 00:00:38,719
that we can use the Firebase
features in the app itself.

14
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:42,030
Finally, we'll run the app just to
see what it looks like right now.
