1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:04,480
So up until now, we've pretty much
assumed that whatever we measured is

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,490
associated to the thing that we're going
to, that we want to keep track of.

3
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:11,020
But in reality,
there are a couple things happen.

4
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:13,070
First of all,
there can be multiple objects.

5
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:16,320
That's what this cute little airplane
thing is supposed to look like.

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,700
And in fact radar,

7
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:20,800
which is where the birthplace of
multi hypothesis tracking came from.

8
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,180
Had this problem, right?

9
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:25,070
I get a while bunch of pings back,
there's a bunch of airplanes,

10
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:28,500
I gotta know which pings go with
which airplanes in order to track,

11
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,000
all the different airplanes.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,698
Or there can be what's known as clutter.

13
00:00:32,698 --> 00:00:35,870
Clutter means there's a lot of stuff
in the environment that has nothing

14
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:36,390
to do with me.

15
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:39,320
By the way,
clutter is the basis of camouflage, so

16
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:43,870
when you take a look at this rattlesnake
whose contour you can just barely see

17
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:49,330
here, there's all this other stuff that
has nothing to do with it being a snake.

18
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:51,030
So it confuses your visual system.

19
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:54,590
Fortunately when
the snake starts to move

20
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:59,160
if the brush is not moving also then
you can do the association differently.

21
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:04,090
But in general clutter means that there
are a bunch of measurements that are not

22
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:06,940
from the thing I'm really
interested in tracking.

23
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:10,220
The problem is referred to as
the data association problem and

24
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:14,250
the trick is to determine which
measurements go with which tracks and

25
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:15,980
which measurements should be ignored.

26
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:18,580
Which measurements cause
you to start a new track.

27
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:21,070
These are all things that you
have to do when you do tracking.

28
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:25,120
So there is a simple strategy and that's
what's indicated here I've got a point

29
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:28,630
and I've got state now I take some
measurements I might just associate,

30
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:33,140
I dunno the closest
measurement to my prediction.

31
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:35,370
So you remember when we were
tracking the contours for

32
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:38,245
the condensation as our Blake algorithm?

33
00:01:38,245 --> 00:01:41,080
Right?
They took the distance to the nearest

34
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:45,950
strong contour as if they new somehow
that that was the right contour.

35
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:48,100
They just made that assumption.

36
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:50,120
Unfortunately, that doesn't always work.

37
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,460
That clutter problem.

38
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:54,300
In fact,
one of the points of clutter is for

39
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:58,040
it to confuse something that's
trying to do that association.

40
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,900
So those of you who watch Tom Clancy
movies or read Tom Clancy books,

41
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:06,850
like I've done, etcetera,
you know that submarines will jettison

42
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:09,740
these things that spin around and
make noise and bubbles.

43
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:10,460
At least I assume they do.

44
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:12,430
They did in the movies,
they did in the books.

45
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:16,660
Now the torpedoes have a data
association problem, right?

46
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:19,160
Which thing that's making noise or

47
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:23,000
making a signal should it
decide is the real state.

48
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,310
Personally I would think seeing some.

49
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:26,650
You know, many thousand ton

50
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:29,970
submarine compared to this
little thing spinning around.

51
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:33,230
Wouldnt been that hard but
obviously the torpedos arent that smart.

52
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:37,260
But so it doesnt always work
in the presence of clutter.

53
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:40,980
There is a most sophisticated
approach to doing this, and

54
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:43,980
that is You do what's
called multiple hypothesis.

55
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:49,010
So multiple hypothesis is, well,
okay, I've seen two things now, and

56
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:53,920
maybe it's one thing, and
I should associate the real

57
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,600
object with the left measurement,
and the right one is clutter.

58
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:01,600
Maybe it's one thing, and I should
associate the object with the right-hand

59
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,280
one and the left one is clutter.

60
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,800
Or maybe it's two things,
that is a new thing should get created.

61
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,970
Well like I said, there's this
whole area called multi-hypothesis

62
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:13,600
tracking where you track
all these different things.

63
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,520
You actually can do this using a,
a particles.

64
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,220
Allright?
You can do particle filtering in

65
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:20,270
a not so obvious way, right?

66
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:26,180
Each particle Is a hypothesis
about the current state.

67
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:32,150
So, for example,
a particle can say oh, there are two

68
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:36,780
such objects, and here's where they are,
or a particle could say,

69
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:40,430
there is one such object, and this
one is not the right one, et cetera.

70
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:42,140
So you can do that using
particle filtering.

71
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:45,372
And in fact I one time told Michael
Eishart I, I said Meaning I said,

72
00:03:45,372 --> 00:03:48,094
you know, for a lot of situations,
I've found that

73
00:03:48,094 --> 00:03:52,440
particle filtering was just a convenient
way of doing multi-hypothesis tracking.

74
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,630
And he said absolutely.

75
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:56,160
So Michael, if you're out there,
I remember that conversation.

76
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,740
I think he's on the West Coast
having a great time.

77
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:58,290
So.

78
00:03:58,290 --> 00:03:58,810
So good for him.
