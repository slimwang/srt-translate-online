1
00:00:03,465 --> 00:00:07,239
Segues are used to transition from
one view controller to another in

2
00:00:07,239 --> 00:00:08,710
the story board.

3
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:12,660
There are many types, for now we're
going to use the show segue to display

4
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:17,460
a new view controller and its view on
top of the existing view controller.

5
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:20,040
We've got a couple more steps
until Pitch Perfect is ready for

6
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:21,170
the app store.

7
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:23,230
We have to set up the playback view,
and for

8
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:26,420
that I'm going to show you an amazing
new tool called stack views,

9
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:30,460
that will make your life with other
layout constraints a lot easier.

10
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:34,190
In addition, we have to actually record
the audio in the first view controller,

11
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:36,630
and pass that along to the second one.

12
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:38,110
Luckily, in iOS, that's but

13
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:41,550
a few lines of code to use with
the segue you just created.

14
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:44,710
It may seem like a lot of steps, but so

15
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:47,610
far, you've created the foundation
of your first iOS app.

16
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:50,200
You built the beginning of two screens,
and you're ready to

17
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:55,130
add in audio with the help of another
iOS framework called AV Foundation.

18
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:58,453
Take a breather, and when you're ready
I'll be there in the next section.
