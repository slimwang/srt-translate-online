1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:05,882
This is the equation in vertex form, and the vertex is at 2, 1. Good thinking

2
00:00:05,882 --> 00:00:10,484
if you found these two. Now, this one was pretty tough, especially since we had

3
00:00:10,484 --> 00:00:15,448
a negative 3 here. Let's work through it together. Our goal is to get a perfect

4
00:00:15,448 --> 00:00:21,136
square so that way we can put this equation in vertex form. So we're going to

5
00:00:21,136 --> 00:00:25,662
try and complete the square by adding some amount to our polynomial. I can't

6
00:00:25,662 --> 00:00:29,568
quite complete the square yet, since I have a factor of negative 3 in front of

7
00:00:29,568 --> 00:00:35,850
the x squared. We want this coefficient to be a one. This means that we can

8
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:40,810
factor a negative 3 from these two terms, leaving us with negative 3 times x

9
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:46,180
squared minus 4x. We can quickly check to make sure that if we distribute, we

10
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:51,190
would get back with what we started with. We'd have a negative 3x squared here

11
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:56,845
and negative 3 times negative 4x which is positive 12x. Now we're ready to

12
00:00:56,845 --> 00:01:01,349
complete the square. The b term is negative 4, so b divided by 2 equals

13
00:01:01,349 --> 00:01:09,480
negative 2. And b divided by 2 squared equals 4. We simply square this number.

14
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:15,070
So, we need to add 4 in order to complete the square for this trinomial. But we

15
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:22,338
didn't just add 4 here, we really added negative 12, 4 times negative 3. Again,

16
00:01:22,338 --> 00:01:25,314
think about the, shooting this negative 3 to each of the three terms, and we

17
00:01:25,314 --> 00:01:29,967
would wind up with this expression. Now we can't just go adding numbers to

18
00:01:29,967 --> 00:01:35,860
equations and changing them at random. Instead we need to keep things balanced.

19
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:38,869
If we subtract 12 from an equation then that means we need to add 12 to the

20
00:01:38,869 --> 00:01:44,686
equation as well. This makes the equation balance. It makes it so that way it's

21
00:01:44,686 --> 00:01:50,560
not changed. We know this since that negative 12 and positive 12 sum to 0. So

22
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,340
we're just changing what this equation looks like, but it's really the same

23
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:59,350
exact equation. Now that we're here we're ready to write our perfect square.

24
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:05,332
The perfect square for this trinomial is x negative 2. If we square this

25
00:02:05,332 --> 00:02:09,351
amount, we'll get this expression. Our negative 3 stays in front as the

26
00:02:09,351 --> 00:02:14,918
coefficient, and then we have negative 11 plus 12 on the end. If we combine the

27
00:02:14,918 --> 00:02:19,226
like terms on the end, we get a positive 1 here. This gives us our equation in

28
00:02:19,226 --> 00:02:25,384
vertex form. And finally, for the vertex, we have an h value of positive 2. And

29
00:02:25,384 --> 00:02:30,052
a k value of positive 1. Setting the binomial equal to 0 gives us the x

30
00:02:30,052 --> 00:02:35,451
coordinate of our vertex. And the k value, or the y coordinate of our vertex,

31
00:02:35,451 --> 00:02:37,723
is just positive 1.
