00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
[Thrun] Now, at this point I would love to go deeper into structure from motion

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
and tell you more about how to solve it.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
But, unfortunately, this is the Introduction to Artificial Intelligence class,

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
so I really want to leave it at a level that covers the typical material I cover at Stanford.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
If you're interested, take a computer vision class.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
It's a fascinating subject area.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
This finishes my survey of computer vision.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Congratulations. You made it through the computer vision classes.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I think you now understand the very basics of computer vision,

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
you understand how images are being formed,

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
how features are being extracted,

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
and how we can do some very basic 3D inference about the world.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
This is just a teaser.

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The field of computer vision is of course much richer.

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I used to teach the class at Stanford,

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
and I hope to be able to invite you in the near future

17
00:00:48,000 --> 99:59:59,999
to an actual online 3D computer vision class.
