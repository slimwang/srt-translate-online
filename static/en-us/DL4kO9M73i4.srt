1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,512
Open up the first exercise
in the second lesson,

2
00:00:03,512 --> 00:00:07,339
T2.1-exercise-createlayout in
Android Studio.

3
00:00:07,339 --> 00:00:10,539
Just as before, you want to do this
instead of continuing with the project

4
00:00:10,539 --> 00:00:11,382
you just created.

5
00:00:11,382 --> 00:00:14,509
You may wonder why we have you create
a project and then immediately ditch it.

6
00:00:14,509 --> 00:00:17,679
We thought it was very valuable to at
least have you walk through the creation

7
00:00:17,679 --> 00:00:19,169
process a couple of times.

8
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:21,790
>From here on out, we'll be starting
with projects where we'll have

9
00:00:21,789 --> 00:00:23,820
already done a little work for you.

10
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:26,800
We're going to create the layout for
a Get Help query application.

11
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,160
There are lots of steps here, but

12
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,289
of course, there are also plenty
of to do's to help you out.

13
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:32,780
You've done some of this before.

14
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:36,166
We're going to start by replacing the
constraint layout with a vertical linear

15
00:00:36,165 --> 00:00:39,412
layout which, as we've mentioned before,
is useful for stacking views.

16
00:00:39,412 --> 00:00:43,086
[BLANK_AUDIO]

17
00:00:43,087 --> 00:00:45,908
We're also going to remove the text
view, add some padding, and

18
00:00:45,908 --> 00:00:46,893
clean things up a bit.

19
00:00:46,893 --> 00:00:57,802
[BLANK_AUDIO]

20
00:00:57,802 --> 00:01:00,989
Then we'll add an EditText
to our LinearLayout.

21
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:05,260
We'll give it an ID, set the text size,
tell it to wrap its content, and

22
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:06,410
give it a hint.

23
00:01:06,409 --> 00:01:09,390
A hint is some text that displays
when the EditText is empty.

24
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:12,204
It indicates they should use this
box to type their Get Help query.

25
00:01:12,204 --> 00:01:16,096
[BLANK_AUDIO]

26
00:01:16,096 --> 00:01:19,183
Now, let's add a text view to display
the URL that we're going to enter.

27
00:01:19,183 --> 00:01:22,852
[BLANK_AUDIO]

28
00:01:22,852 --> 00:01:26,150
Since we need to access this text
view from Java, we'll give it an ID.

29
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:28,838
[BLANK_AUDIO]

30
00:01:28,838 --> 00:01:31,417
We'll also set the text size to
help it wrap its content, and

31
00:01:31,418 --> 00:01:33,200
give it a margin to
make things prettier.

32
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:43,284
[BLANK_AUDIO]

33
00:01:43,284 --> 00:01:46,330
Next, we'll reuse something we
learned from the previous lesson,

34
00:01:46,329 --> 00:01:48,099
how to make text scroll.

35
00:01:48,099 --> 00:01:50,608
In this case, we're going to just
make part of the layout scroll.

36
00:01:50,608 --> 00:01:52,717
[BLANK_AUDIO]

37
00:01:52,718 --> 00:01:56,040
To do this, we'll add a ScrollView
to our linear layout and

38
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,771
place a TextView inside of it.

39
00:01:57,772 --> 00:02:08,342
[BLANK_AUDIO]

40
00:02:08,342 --> 00:02:11,097
We'll set the text size of that
TextView and give it an ID, so

41
00:02:11,097 --> 00:02:12,403
that we can get to it in Java.

42
00:02:12,402 --> 00:02:18,394
[BLANK_AUDIO]

43
00:02:18,394 --> 00:02:22,093
Speaking of getting to the views from
Java, let's go to main activity and

44
00:02:22,093 --> 00:02:26,212
add member variables for our search box
EditText, our URL display TextView, and

45
00:02:26,212 --> 00:02:27,781
our search results TextView.

46
00:02:27,781 --> 00:02:36,867
[BLANK_AUDIO]

47
00:02:36,866 --> 00:02:40,193
One thing to note, if you get red
squiggly lines under TextVew and

48
00:02:40,193 --> 00:02:44,125
EditText, simply hover over them and
click Option and Return on Mac, or Ctrl

49
00:02:44,126 --> 00:02:48,890
and Enter on Windows to have Android
Studio add import statements for you.

50
00:02:48,889 --> 00:02:52,269
After we've declared our variables,
we find each one of these views by ID

51
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:55,600
in our onCreate and
set them to the member variables.

52
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:58,409
Notice that Android Studio is once
again warning us with those red

53
00:02:58,409 --> 00:02:59,680
squiggly lines.

54
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,030
To fix this we need to cast the generic
view return by findviewById to

55
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:05,990
the type of view that we expect.

56
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:08,189
In this case either EditText or
TextView.

57
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:13,480
Finally let's remove the unneeded
reference to the constraint layout

58
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:15,369
library from build.gradle.

59
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:16,701
Once you remove the reference,

60
00:03:16,701 --> 00:03:20,000
Android Studio will warn you
to sync the project again.

61
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,650
Go ahead and do that.

62
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:22,990
So, now it's your turn.

63
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:26,780
Create the get hub query layout and
attach it to your Java code, have fun.
