Since we're on a roll with rational inequalities, let's do one more. We have 1

2
00:00:04,705 --> 00:00:09,305
over x plus 2 is greater than 3 over 2x minus 4. You know that in order to find

3
00:00:09,305 --> 00:00:13,966
critical values, we need 0 on one side of the equation. So, that means we need

4
00:00:13,966 --> 00:00:18,602
to pick one side of the inequality to get all of our terms on. It doesn't matter

5
00:00:18,602 --> 00:00:22,442
which one we pick, right and left are both totally fine, and we'll get the same

6
00:00:22,442 --> 00:00:26,276
answer. But I'm kind of leaning to the left today, so for the first part of the

7
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:30,119
problem, I'd like you to rewrite this equation so that all of the terms are on

8
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:33,156
the left-hand side, making the right-hand side equal to 0.
