00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:05,580
Once we have the use cases, we can use them to determine the radios percepts.

00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:11,170
Recall that a percept is an externally, sensible, by that I mean visual,

00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:15,250
audible, tactile aspect of a device. That is you

4
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:19,850
can walk through a use case to determine what percepts the user interacts with.

5
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:24,249
Typically a device's output and some of its input comprise its percepts.
