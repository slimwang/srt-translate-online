00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:04,246
Thinking about the conclusions we drew about these graphs in terms of which ones

2
00:00:04,246 --> 00:00:08,404
are functions and which one isn't, let's make a generalization about how we can

3
00:00:08,404 --> 00:00:12,461
tell graphically what is a function. So in other words, how can we test

4
00:00:12,461 --> 00:00:17,014
graphically that a given curve only has 1 y value for every x value? I'd like

5
00:00:17,014 --> 00:00:21,460
you to complete this sentence to create this guideline for us. So if we draw

6
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:25,540
what kind of line on the same coordinate plane as any given function, the

7
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:30,005
functions curve should intersect that line some number or fewer times. Now this

8
00:00:30,005 --> 00:00:33,888
is definitely a really tricky question, seriously. So if you have trouble with

9
00:00:33,888 --> 00:00:37,571
this that is 100% fine. This is going to give us a really useful tool. So take a

10
00:00:37,571 --> 00:00:39,353
second to consider the question.
