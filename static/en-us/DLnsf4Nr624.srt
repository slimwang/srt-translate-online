00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:04,240
There are also vmin and vmax units, which let

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:07,210
you size things based on the smallest or largest units

3
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:09,960
of width and height. This helps make layouts that

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:14,940
stay consistent across portrait and landscape mode. Using this feature,

5
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:17,430
it's pretty easy to create a button that takes

6
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:20,078
up 1 3rd of the biggest square that will fit

7
00:00:20,078 --> 00:00:23,730
in the screen. Now using these units, the button

8
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:25,990
stays as large as it can be and still fit

9
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:27,220
in a third of the space.
