1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,014
No, just like you learn in lesson one where if you have a population and you

2
00:00:05,014 --> 00:00:10,262
take a sample, the sample statistic won't be exactly equal to the population

3
00:00:10,262 --> 00:00:15,810
parameter, most likely. There's a range of values for the mean that any samples

4
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:20,778
could have. So same with this, if we had some kind of intervention on the

5
00:00:20,778 --> 00:00:25,386
population, so in this case, the Bieber tweeter, and everyone started using

6
00:00:25,386 --> 00:00:30,876
that. Then our best guess is that the mean would be about 40, but it could be

7
00:00:30,876 --> 00:00:37,176
anything around 40. So in other words, there's a range around 40. That the true

8
00:00:37,176 --> 00:00:43,482
population mean would be, if everyone were to use the Bieber Tweeter. Now how

9
00:00:43,482 --> 00:00:48,237
big is this interval? We're going to decide actual numbers that should be

10
00:00:48,237 --> 00:00:53,750
bounding this interval. In order to do that let's think back about this sampling

11
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:54,893
distribution.
