1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,939
After bringing in the fuzzy data two
file, we attach a summarized tool,

2
00:00:04,939 --> 00:00:09,450
select Contact, go to Add,
and choose Group by.

3
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:10,478
Then we go back to Add,

4
00:00:10,478 --> 00:00:15,910
generate a count of the records
by contact, by selecting Count.

5
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:19,110
To find the records with the highest
value in the count field,

6
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:24,310
we bring in the sort tool and sort on
the count field in descending order.

7
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:28,290
There are a high number of records with
a null value in the contact field.

8
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:29,380
But since we asked for

9
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:34,580
the name of the contact, the next record
with the most duplicates is Tim Coyle.

10
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:36,175
So the right answer is Tim Coyle.
