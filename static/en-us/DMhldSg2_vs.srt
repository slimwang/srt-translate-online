00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,190
In the last exercise, we used alpha and jitter to reduce

2
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:06,080
over plotting, but it turns out that there's more that we can

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,210
do. Let's hear from Mora about how she used her domain

4
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:13,520
knowledge and a transformation to make an adjustment to her scatter plot.

5
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:16,500
>> The next thing that I did, was

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,590
to take again, the perceived audience size, and their

7
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:22,610
actual audience size, but this time I transformed

8
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:26,010
the axes. So this time, it's as a percentage

9
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:28,540
of their friend count. Some people in this study had

10
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:32,270
50 friends, some had 100, some had 2,000, and so,

11
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:34,668
it actually makes more sense to think about your audience

12
00:00:34,668 --> 00:00:38,680
size as a percentage of the possible audience. All of

13
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:41,530
the people in the study had shared their post with

14
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:44,140
friends only privacy, so you'd expect that it would be

15
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:47,390
bounded by their friend count. So, what we found when

16
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:51,640
we plotted it this way was that all of the points

17
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:56,240
are below this line of perfect accuracy, this diagonal line, really

18
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,860
well below. And one other thing I should note about this

19
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:02,320
plot, we actually ran two different surveys. We ran one survey

20
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,870
where we asked people in a single post, how many people

21
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:07,840
do you think saw, saw your post? But we also asked

22
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,350
a different set of people, in general, how many people do

23
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:14,310
you think see the content that you share on Facebook? So

24
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:16,920
that's what this plot is showing. This is the in general

25
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,940
question, and their guesses are a little bit

26
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:22,265
higher. But still, people typically think people that maybe

27
00:01:22,265 --> 00:01:25,070
10% of their friends see their content when in

28
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:27,860
reality it's more like 40% or 50%, even 60%

29
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:29,770
of their friends will see their content in

30
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:31,530
a given month. So that's what this plot is

31
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:34,490
showing, is the percentage of friends who actually saw

32
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:38,050
their content in the last month, again, they're underestimating.
