00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,590
To show that equivalence is undecidable, we should first start out with a program

2
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:08,140
for which we want to decide the halting problem, and that should be P.

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:13,660
We start out with the step here, and then we add a second program and that program is called P‘

4
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:15,710
and it goes into an infinite loop.

5
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:20,060
No matter what input, this program is just programmed to always go into an infinite loop.

6
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:24,310
Once we have those two programs P and P‘, we run them through the algorithm

7
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:28,000
that decides equivalence and what that will do is it will basically ask--

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,090
does the program P for which we want to decide the halting problem do the same thing

9
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:35,630
as the program that always goes into an infinite loop.

10
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:39,860
And then, of course, that means if the two programs are indeed equivalent,

11
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:45,770
then P will also go into an infinite loop because all that P‘ is doing is it always goes into an infinite loop

12
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:49,080
and we don't even need the other two building blocks because we have now shown

13
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:52,120
that you can use equivalence to solve the halting problem.

14
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:57,080
You just compare any program for which you want to decide the halting problem to a program

15
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:01,990
that always goes into an infinite loop and if they do the same thing, then they are equivalent.

16
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:07,280
So you know that P will not halt, and if they are equivalent, well then P halts.

17
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:12,250
Now, this was certainly one of the tougher quizzes in this course so congratulations for figuring it out,

18
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:16,490
but of course I also trust that by now you have learned the ropes of theoretical computer science.

19
00:01:16,490 --> 99:59:59,999
You revert here is that I will give you a third proof of undecidability for free.
