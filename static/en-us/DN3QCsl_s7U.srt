1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,070
Of course,
one interesting way of visualizing these

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:06,650
stereo pairs has been something
referred to as an Anaglyph.

3
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:09,420
Where you take two images of a stereo
pair, and I'm basically showing you

4
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:14,690
a very classic image here and it encode
parallax just in a single picture.

5
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:18,220
What it does, it take two slightly
different perspectives of the same

6
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:23,450
subject and superimposes them on top
of each other in contrasting colors.

7
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:26,680
It basically produces
a three-dimensional affect which in mut,

8
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:31,480
mutual, corresponding set of color
filters gives you a perception of depth.

9
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:36,810
So for example, these two merged images
here can be now viewed through a red

10
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:41,750
cyan glass set like this one, and
it will allow you to capture or

11
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:45,360
at least perceive from this
stereo pair a depth image.

12
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,760
Of course, you've seen enough of
these types of green cyan glasses.

13
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:51,770
Here is one simple one, and if you just,

14
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:55,490
were able to look at the scene from
this, you would actually see depth.

15
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:58,830
Let's look at a little bit more of
these Anaglyph types of images.

16
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:00,890
Here is one that you
may have seen you know,

17
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:05,200
there is a lot of these types of
images came up after the Mars Mission

18
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:09,420
where basically they generated a lot
of these nice Anaglyph images.

19
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:13,990
Another one again a very well known
classic example of Anaglyph images.
