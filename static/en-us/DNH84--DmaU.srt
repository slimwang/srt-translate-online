00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,003
Let's make another prediction. This time, how may batches of brownies can you

2
00:00:04,016 --> 00:00:08,481
bake if your recipe requires 3/4 of a cup of sugar and you have 2 cups of sugar

3
00:00:08,493 --> 00:00:12,568
at home. Again, before we solve this problem let's guess about how many batches

4
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:16,614
we'll make. Will we make less than one batch of brownie, exactly one batch, more

5
00:00:16,626 --> 00:00:20,486
than one batch, but less than 2, exactly 2 batches, or more than 2 batches. Go

6
00:00:20,498 --> 00:00:21,804
ahead, choose your answer.
