1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:02,490
So the reward or the return is the same.

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:06,740
But remember the standard deviation
of the risk was very much smaller.

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:11,870
So we end up with a much larger
ratio in the multi bet case.

4
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:14,560
So the take home message here is.

5
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:19,280
Even though we have the same expected
return, we can have much lower risk and

6
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:25,010
thus a much higher risk adjusted
reward if we have many, many, bets.

7
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:27,350
You know a thousand bets
instead of just a single bet.
