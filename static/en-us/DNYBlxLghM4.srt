00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,806
When we solve this radical equation, p should equal positive 8. Nice thinking

2
00:00:04,806 --> 00:00:08,466
if you got this one correct. When raising this left hand side to the 2nd power,

3
00:00:08,466 --> 00:00:13,280
we'll be left with the expression underneath the radical. So we'll just get p

4
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:17,970
plus 1. On the right hand side, we'll square 3 to get a value of positive 9. We

5
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:23,550
subtract 1 from both sides to isolate p, so 1p equals positive 8. One thing we

6
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:27,541
want to do with radical equations is always check our answer. Sometimes this

7
00:00:27,541 --> 00:00:32,424
answer won't work in the original radical. Because sometimes it makes this

8
00:00:32,424 --> 00:00:36,448
radicand negative. We don't want that to be the case, so we can take the square

9
00:00:36,448 --> 00:00:41,474
root. So let's check for 8. We'll replace p with the value of 8, take the

10
00:00:41,474 --> 00:00:46,612
square root of 8 plus 1, which is 9, and that equals 3. We come out with a true

11
00:00:46,612 --> 00:00:50,800
statement on the end of 3 equals 3. So yes, this is the correct answer.
