00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,740
Okay, so thus far, we've seen how inheritance

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:07,030
can help us with reusing instance variables. Now I

3
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:09,420
want to show you an example of how inheritance

4
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:12,790
can help with reusing methods. So here we are

5
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:14,710
back at the code, where we have a class

6
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:17,650
called Parent and a class called Child. And if

7
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:21,610
you recall, class Child inherits from class Parent. Now,

8
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:25,220
I'll begin by defining a simple instance method inside

9
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:29,160
class Parent. And I will call it show_info.

10
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,000
The first argument of this method is self, and

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,020
all this method does is it prints out the last name and eye color of the parent.

12
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,380
All right, there are the two print statements.

13
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:44,970
Now to test to see if this method actually

14
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:47,910
works, I'm going to call this method show_info

15
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:51,190
using the parent's instance billy_cyrus. So let me do

16
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:57,135
that next. So there is that method. Now all I've done thus far is created a new

17
00:00:57,135 --> 00:01:01,060
method called show_info inside class Parent. And then

18
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:05,050
used an instance of class Parent, instance called billy_cyrus

19
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:10,130
to call that method. Now to be able to focus on this statement's output, I am

20
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:16,100
going to comment out the other instance statement for now. There. Let

21
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:20,570
me go ahead and save and run this program. Alright. So the program prints

22
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:25,660
out the correct values of billy_cyrus' last name and eye color. So far so good.
