1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,000
So I approach adding new features in

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,260
a way that I try to be very
specific about what I'm adding.

3
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:05,840
Because, of course,

4
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:09,220
you could have a redesign of an
application that has a number of things.

5
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:12,230
But, I think it's important to
focus on one item at a time.

6
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:16,900
So if you're adding an image to a view
or you're adding several buttons or

7
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:21,220
a layout, it's good to accomplish those
individual pieces first and then,

8
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:24,880
kind of, just get something that
works and then evolve that over time.

9
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,710
The general thing I'm trying to avoid
is you can get into a rabbit hole of

10
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:30,590
everything needs to be refactored.

11
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:32,040
And you refactor one thing and

12
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,160
you start to pull other threads because
you start to change something else, and

13
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,170
then at the of the day you
don't have anything done.

14
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:42,300
So it's important to stay very focused
on improving one area of the code base

15
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:43,740
and then just finishing that.

16
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:47,200
Even if there's things that you kind of
use as scaffolding, like you know it's

17
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,890
going to tear down later as you improve
other features, that's okay, it's okay

18
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:55,595
to tear that out later, but it's
good to just focus on that one item.

19
00:00:55,595 --> 00:00:58,165
When I plan out
implementing new features,

20
00:00:58,165 --> 00:01:00,435
it depends on how large that feature is.

21
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:02,995
If it's a large feature then
I'll generally do some amount of

22
00:01:02,995 --> 00:01:03,725
project planning.

23
00:01:03,725 --> 00:01:07,415
Like you'll say, okay, well this might
take me weeks so I'll schedule it into

24
00:01:07,415 --> 00:01:11,635
sprints, and start to get an idea of
what I'll tackle for those weeks.

25
00:01:11,635 --> 00:01:13,385
If it's a smaller item,
I kind of do that in my head.

26
00:01:13,385 --> 00:01:15,706
I'll say, I know,
I need to do this one activity first and

27
00:01:15,706 --> 00:01:18,435
then transition to the other one and
kind of build those over time.
