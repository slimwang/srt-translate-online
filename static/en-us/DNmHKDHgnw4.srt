00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
When I look at an existing market, it's clear that if you've match those market needs,

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
you could be achieving profitability the soonest.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
If you're doing a clone market--that is copying a US business model in a foreign country,

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:20,000
that probably is the second closest to immediate profitability because you know the market exist

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
that you just need to implement it in your local country.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Resegmented market--well, that's probably somewhere in between existing in clone and new

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
because you not only have to understand the market you have to understand

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
the customer's specific needs or low-cost needs.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
But the longest time to profitability is a new market.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
You have a vision that you understand what the future might look like, but the market

11
00:00:45,000 --> 99:59:59,999
just hasn't adapted yet and that might take years.
