00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,064
>> This says that the distance between x and 4 is less than 5. Of course, we

2
00:00:04,064 --> 00:00:08,736
know that you also could have the distance between 4 and x is less than 5, since

3
00:00:08,736 --> 00:00:12,824
the absolute value of x minus 4 and the absolute value of 4 minus x are

4
00:00:12,824 --> 00:00:17,531
equivalent to one another. They both measure the distance between these two

5
00:00:17,531 --> 00:00:18,081
points.
