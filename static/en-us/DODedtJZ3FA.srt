1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
[Thrun] And the answer is that while K-means will go all the way to the extreme, A,

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
which is this one over here, EM will not.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
And this has to do with the soft versus hard nature of the correspondence.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
In K-means the correspondence is hard.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
So after the first situation, only these 2 data points over here

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
correspond to cluster center 1,

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
and they will find themselves straight in the middle where A is located.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
In EM, however, we find that there will still be a soft correspondence

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
to these further away points which will then lead to a small shift of the cluster center

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
to the right side, as indicated by B.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 99:59:59,999
That means K-means and EM will converge at different models of the data.
