1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:04,842
So, one of the things for me going into programming and even engineering, was

2
00:00:04,842 --> 00:00:08,811
that it was an area that I never thought was actually like important to me as a

3
00:00:08,811 --> 00:00:15,201
person. growing up with a very strong art background. I went to an arts high

4
00:00:15,201 --> 00:00:18,680
school, like, my mother is an artist, my grandmother is an artist. Like, I

5
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:23,213
just, I never really realized like off the bat, like how applicable it is. Like

6
00:00:23,213 --> 00:00:27,955
nowadays, I'm, so I tie the two together. I I make large paintings that have

7
00:00:27,955 --> 00:00:32,150
circuits embedded into the canvas. And I use an adreno which I program, so that

8
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:36,656
I can do sequence of like, different light displays at the time. Or, like I'll

9
00:00:36,656 --> 00:00:39,856
use like capasitive sensors which I can like program like, and tweak like how

10
00:00:39,856 --> 00:00:44,317
the can work and what distances. These are things like me, a couple years ago,

11
00:00:44,317 --> 00:00:48,674
would have been like, oh, wait, I, I didn't even know I could do this. This is

12
00:00:48,674 --> 00:00:52,008
like a whole new form of art. And I think that's one of the things that people

13
00:00:52,008 --> 00:00:55,672
don't initially think like, oh, you know, someone's programming. They're just

14
00:00:55,672 --> 00:00:59,070
sitting at a computer, but like even the way that you program is an art. Like

15
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:02,535
you can be so meticulous about it, like the same work ethic that I use towards

16
00:01:02,535 --> 00:01:07,573
making like a painting is the same one I use towards programming. And it's

17
00:01:07,573 --> 00:01:11,349
something that like, the two are so entwined for me that I can't see how, like,

18
00:01:11,349 --> 00:01:16,557
it wouldn't be for other areas. Like, I have friends that are writers and it's,

19
00:01:16,557 --> 00:01:20,091
it's also the same kind of, they have the same kind of feelings towards it as

20
00:01:20,091 --> 00:01:24,759
well. And it's like, it's something that where even now if I'm doing like an

21
00:01:24,759 --> 00:01:28,675
interactive art piece. I want to do a simulation, like that's an art in itself,

22
00:01:28,675 --> 00:01:33,298
and like to sit down and like program with open frameworks or something. And

23
00:01:33,298 --> 00:01:36,796
like that's just something like for me is like how could you not want to think

24
00:01:36,796 --> 00:01:40,680
that these two go together. Like they totally go together.
