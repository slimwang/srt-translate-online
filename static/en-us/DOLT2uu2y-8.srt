>> If you took a break, welcome back. We've been talking a lot about lines and

2
00:00:04,062 --> 00:00:08,212
slopes and intercepts. And well, who cares? What good are these lines and

3
00:00:08,212 --> 00:00:12,489
equations anyway? It turns out we can use them. For example, let's say we're

4
00:00:12,489 --> 00:00:16,732
moving and we need to rent a truck to haul all of our stuff. I looked up prices

5
00:00:16,732 --> 00:00:21,345
to do this. And I found that doing this requires us to pay an initial fee of

6
00:00:21,345 --> 00:00:25,940
$20, plus $2 per mile. So, if I don't drive the truck at all, I still have to

7
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:30,649
pay $20 just to get the keys. I'm going to list the dollar sign here, instead of

8
00:00:30,649 --> 00:00:35,238
the table for each value. So, if we rented this truck and drove it one mile, it

9
00:00:35,238 --> 00:00:39,985
would have cost $20 plus $2 for the extra mile. So that's $22 in total. Based on

10
00:00:39,985 --> 00:00:44,725
this price structure, how much would it cost to drive the truck 2 miles, 3

11
00:00:44,725 --> 00:00:49,351
miles, and 4 miles? Put your answers in each of these boxes.
