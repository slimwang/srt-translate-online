1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:01,070
From these options,

2
00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:05,250
the only correct option is the file on
the remote server has been removed.

3
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:10,230
The file is outdated really implies that
the file has been written by somebody

4
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:14,420
else potentially, since a particular
client acquired the file handle.

5
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:17,470
So that may be a consistency
related problem, but

6
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:20,420
it really doesn't return a stale handle.

7
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:23,490
The fact that the remote
server is not responding,

8
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:26,270
that's really more of
an RPC layer error.

9
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:29,560
If the server is not responding
that has nothing to do

10
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:33,720
with our ability to access a file at
some point or another on that machine.

11
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:35,790
It may simply be a network error.

12
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:40,760
And the final option is also wrong, the
file handle will not become stale just

13
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:43,130
because a file was open for too long.

14
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:48,080
There may be some distributed file
systems which provide only time places

15
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:51,150
where a client is only allowed
to keep a file open for

16
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:54,580
a period of time, but
NFS is not one of them.

17
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:56,610
So for
that reason this answer is not correct.
