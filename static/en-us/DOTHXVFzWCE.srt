1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:03,250
All right, let's find out the size and class.

2
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:06,430
Octave prints out the height of the image first, and

3
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:10,800
then the width, height is 320 and width is 500.

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,770
On the next line we see that the class of the image is uint8.

5
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:18,480
If you type these values in correctly good job.

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,520
So the height and width turned out to be 320 and 500 respectively and

7
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,740
the class was uint8.

8
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:27,670
Now what does uint8 mean?

9
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:30,910
Some of you may know this already, u stands for

10
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:35,859
unsigned, which means this data type cannot represent negative numbers.

11
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:43,300
Int stands for integer and eight refers to eight bits or one byte.

12
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:46,170
This is sometimes known as the bit depth.

13
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:51,000
It indicates the number of bits allocated to store each intensity value.
