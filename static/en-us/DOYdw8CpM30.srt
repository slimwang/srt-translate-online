>> Once you get this setup going, now we can move on to the next part, actually

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:08,238
drawing the tile. To do this, requires a couple of steps. First, we need to

3
00:00:08,238 --> 00:00:12,531
calculate the position in our game world that we want to draw the tile at. To do

4
00:00:12,531 --> 00:00:16,557
this we need to use a little bit of math magic based upon the tile ID within a

5
00:00:16,557 --> 00:00:20,781
tileset and the number of tiles across that the entire map is, as long as the xy

6
00:00:20,781 --> 00:00:24,690
size of each tile. By combining these things, we actually get a nice little

7
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:28,348
setup that tells us the number of pixels x and y offset from the origin of the

8
00:00:28,348 --> 00:00:30,986
canvas to draw this tile. Now, you make that happen.
