1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:03,480
So let's take a look at how he
created the custom Word class.

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:06,560
A Word object should represent
a single vocabulary word

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,300
that we want the user to learn.

4
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:12,200
It should contain both the English and
Miwok translations for the same word.

5
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:16,379
Now each of these translations can
be stored as a string variable in

6
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:17,420
the class.

7
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:21,190
So to summarize the answer to the
question what state should a Word object

8
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:25,000
contain and
what is the data type of each variable?

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Well the Word object should contain two
string variables, one for the English

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,410
translation of the word, and one for
the Miwok translation of the same word.

11
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:35,730
Now this is what it
looks like in a diagram.

12
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:36,960
For the word object,

13
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,420
we have an English translation and
a Miwok text translation.

14
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:44,020
Since we know that this course
is being utilized by students

15
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:47,160
who don't necessarily speak
English as a primary language.

16
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,490
We don't want to call
the variable English translation.

17
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:53,650
So instead we chose
the term defaultTranslation

18
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:57,310
to represent the translation
that is your primary language.

19
00:00:57,310 --> 00:01:00,120
So to answer the question,
what methods should we have?

20
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:03,110
We should have a method to get
the English translation and

21
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:05,640
a method to get the Miwok translation.

22
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,050
And here's what that
looks like visually.

23
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:10,590
So for the methods,
this might have been a tricky one.

24
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:14,260
Our Word class is the container
that holds two variables.

25
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:17,950
There's no complex logic to
abstract away in the Word class.

26
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:22,840
We're just going to expose two methods
in which some outside color can retrieve

27
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:25,390
the English and Miwok translations.

28
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:28,760
And again, instead of calling
the methods getEnglishTranslation,

29
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:31,180
we decided here to use
getDefaultTranslation.
