00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:05,484
This side lenght is 3 times the square root of 39. Great problem solving for

2
00:00:05,484 --> 00:00:10,444
getting that one right. Now 7, 24, 25 is a special right triangle that we could

3
00:00:10,444 --> 00:00:17,300
use. But since this hypotenuse isn't 25, we won't use that. Instead, we'll just

4
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:22,570
need to use the Pythagorean Theorem. A squared plus b squared equals c squared.

5
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:26,962
In this case, 7 is the leg, 20 is the hypotenuse, since it's across from the

6
00:00:26,962 --> 00:00:33,446
right angle, and x is the unknown leg we're trying to find. So, we'll have 7

7
00:00:33,446 --> 00:00:39,764
squared plus x squared equals 20 squared. Squaring 7, we get 49 and squaring

8
00:00:39,764 --> 00:00:46,283
20, we'll get 400. Next, we'll subtract 49 from both sides to get 1x squared

9
00:00:46,283 --> 00:00:50,962
equals 351. We take the square root of both sides keeping only the positive

10
00:00:50,962 --> 00:00:57,564
root. So, x is equal to the square root of 351. We can simplify this square

11
00:00:57,564 --> 00:01:03,104
root by breaking it into 3 times 117. Then, we break it down one more time, to

12
00:01:03,104 --> 00:01:09,269
get 3 times 3 times 39. We have a repeated factor of 3. So, a 3 comes outside

13
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:15,296
of our square root, and 39 stays inside. This gives us our final answer of 3

14
00:01:15,296 --> 00:01:18,283
times the square root of 39.
