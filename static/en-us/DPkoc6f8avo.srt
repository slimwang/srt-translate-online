1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,360
So we tell you that persona is really important in designing applications. So

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,100
let's now talk about the mobile persona. Now, when you think about your

3
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:11,090
applications persona, no matter how different they are. No matter what they are

4
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:13,670
exactly they have to inherit from this

5
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:16,770
superclass which is the mobile user persona.

6
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:20,280
>> So that means that you need to take the attributes of the mobile user persona

7
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:22,230
into account as well as the attributes of

8
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:25,520
your apps persona. So Izabel, what are the attributes

9
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,110
of this mobile user persona?

10
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:29,290
>> Well, the first attribute would be that they have

11
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:32,710
a finite data plan and finite amount of battery they also

12
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:35,760
have divided attention. Yeah, exactly when I'm using my phone I'm

13
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,120
always doing like five or six things at the same time.

14
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:40,360
>> There's also something called handedness, which has to do

15
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:42,149
with how the user holds the phone in their hands.

16
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:46,730
>> And then, of course the mobile user has a very small screen.

17
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:48,190
>> And also, because the user's moving

18
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:50,330
around, they usually have very sketchy network

19
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:52,890
access. Yeah. This is a really important one and we

20
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:54,930
will dive into this much more deeply in lesson four.

21
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:58,350
>> I think it's really interesting that with these

22
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:01,170
mobile persona attributes that some of them are actually

23
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:03,130
a result of the form factor of the phone,

24
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:05,590
like having a small screen. Yeah. Yeah, others are

25
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:08,960
actually a result of human form factors our hands

26
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,000
only move in certain ways. Our brains actually work

27
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,090
in certain ways which is why we have divided

28
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:15,530
attention when were moving around doing six things at once.

29
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:17,240
>> And also some of them have to do with what it

30
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:20,910
means to be mobile like when your interacting within a physical environment.

31
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:24,980
>> You have things like your network can be sketchy because if you go

32
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:26,260
inside of a building or inside of

33
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:28,275
an elevator and things like that. Yeah, exactly.

34
00:01:28,275 --> 00:01:30,566
>> So, I think that these attributes are

35
00:01:30,566 --> 00:01:33,870
so important and they're so concrete that they're-

36
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:35,385
>> we think of them more as constraints

37
00:01:35,385 --> 00:01:37,655
and not just attributes, meaning you can't violate

38
00:01:37,655 --> 00:01:40,930
them at all or your users is going to have a really bad time. Yeah that's

39
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:43,340
true and don't think that because we're using the word

40
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:46,920
"constraint" that you're limited in some way. Innovation is spurred

41
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,260
as a result of constraints. So it's our challenge to

42
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:52,250
actually leverage these constraints and

43
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:54,700
create really compelling experiences given that

44
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:58,260
this users going to have finite data and battery divided attention

45
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:01,190
and all those other limitations. And we should also, since

46
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:03,250
we're in the subject of constraints let's not forget about

47
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:06,165
the power that you have on mobile. You can create amazing

48
00:02:06,165 --> 00:02:08,500
real-time location based experiences that are

49
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,091
simply not possible on web and desktop.
