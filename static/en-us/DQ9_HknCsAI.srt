1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:06,300
Using D3.js you can add, remove and
change DOM nodes programmatically.

2
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:10,580
I'll show you how to change the
background color of this navigation bar.

3
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:14,160
First I'll right-click on
the element and click Inspect.

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,590
Now, sometimes you might not
get the element you intended,

5
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:19,910
because the element you click on is
a child of the element that you want.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,900
You can check this by looking
at the highlighted element and

7
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:25,902
the HTML tag in this HTML panel.

8
00:00:25,902 --> 00:00:28,950
You want to be sure you
have the right element.

9
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:29,910
Now, looking at this,

10
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:33,520
it looks like I have a child
element of one of the parent ones.

11
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:38,040
So I have this navbar header which
doesn't quite grab the entire navbar.

12
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:41,000
And I can see this by hovering
over the DOM element.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,620
Here's a nav container, and then here
it looks like I have the entire navbar.

14
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:51,000
So let's use one of the classes
here to select the navbar element.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,570
So I'll select this navbar by using the
.navbar class in my select statement.

16
00:00:56,570 --> 00:01:00,490
I noticed a D3 arrays is returned
which contains our DOM node.

17
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:03,000
And hovering over the DOM node
highlights the element in

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,260
the View window.

19
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,680
Now if we want to change
the background color,

20
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:11,650
we'll need some sort of D3 method to
adjust the style or the CSS properties.

21
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:13,730
Let's go to the documentation.

22
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:15,760
So in Selections,
we're going to look for

23
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,540
something that can
adjust CSS properties.

24
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:23,460
And it's looks like this one, style,
will do it, get or set style properties.

25
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:27,060
The style method allows you to change
the styling of a particular element on

26
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:32,660
the page, by passing in a CSS
property and a corresponding value.

27
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:37,500
Also, notice that the style property
operates or acts on a selection.

28
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,570
This is important for
the chainable nature of D3,

29
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:42,100
which you'll see in just a minute.

30
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:45,590
Also, notice that we can set
more than one property at once.

31
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:47,620
We can pass in an object literal,

32
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:50,655
which is just the notation
of a JavaScript object.

33
00:01:50,655 --> 00:01:54,535
And we pass in the properties
that we want as the keys

34
00:01:54,535 --> 00:01:57,265
in the corresponding values.

35
00:01:57,265 --> 00:01:59,455
Let's try this out on a console.

36
00:01:59,455 --> 00:02:03,702
So with my selection I'm going to
pass in a key of background color.

37
00:02:03,702 --> 00:02:06,622
And recall if I don't pass in any value,

38
00:02:06,622 --> 00:02:10,012
then I'll just get what's currently
set as the background color.

39
00:02:10,012 --> 00:02:12,082
And now if I'd like to
change the background color,

40
00:02:12,082 --> 00:02:16,212
I want to pass in a corresponding
value as the second argument.

41
00:02:16,212 --> 00:02:18,932
Now, there's two important
things to notice here.

42
00:02:18,932 --> 00:02:22,612
First, the background color on the nav
bar did actually change, I mean,

43
00:02:22,612 --> 00:02:24,462
that's what we wanted to do.

44
00:02:24,462 --> 00:02:28,250
And second,
the code returned another array, and

45
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:29,370
let's look at what was returned.

46
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:32,120
It looks like a selection.

47
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:36,370
It turns out it's the same
selection we had before.

48
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:39,710
And this is why many of
D3's methods are chainable,

49
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:44,200
most methods defined in D3 return
whatever object they were called on.

50
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:48,040
So in this case, D3 finds and
returns a selection and

51
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:51,400
then passes that selection
to the next function.

52
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:55,240
So, before we were saving our selection
into our variable called elem, but

53
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,529
we actually don't even
need this variable.

54
00:02:57,529 --> 00:03:00,369
We can just use our first selection and

55
00:03:00,369 --> 00:03:05,073
then chain on the style function
to work on that for selection,

56
00:03:05,073 --> 00:03:09,627
and this is what I mean by
the chainable nature of D3's API.

57
00:03:09,627 --> 00:03:13,261
You can use multiple functions to
operate on different selections,

58
00:03:13,261 --> 00:03:15,838
or in different objects,
that are D3 objects.

59
00:03:15,838 --> 00:03:19,172
So again if I would like to
change the nav bar, all I need to

60
00:03:19,172 --> 00:03:24,080
do is select the nav bar first and
then style the background as I'd like.

61
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,110
This second method operates on
the first selection that we created.

62
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:33,972
And this entire function, or this second
method, returns a new selection for us.

63
00:03:33,972 --> 00:03:35,479
