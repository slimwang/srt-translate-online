What do you think, David?

2
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:04,640
>> So personally I said that
D is the most similar case.

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:06,430
There are a couple of cases
that are closer to the origin,

4
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:09,640
like A and B, but they both go in a very
different direction than we're trying

5
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:10,730
to go with Q.

6
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:14,780
Similarly, E ends even closer to Q,
but E starts much further away.

7
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:18,810
D looks like it's the one that
both starts closest to Q and

8
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:20,530
ends closest to Q.

9
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:22,215
>> D here is the right answer.

10
00:00:22,215 --> 00:00:25,710
Let us think how we can program an air
agent to come up with this answer.
