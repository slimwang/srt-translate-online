1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,250
Up to now you've built your
first mapping applications

2
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:06,610
where you saw how to set up
the Google Maps API and integrate and

3
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:09,090
authenticated map into your application.

4
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:11,540
You saw the map fragment and
user interface.

5
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:14,370
And you saw how to use that
to get a Google Map object

6
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:16,690
that you could then manipulate and code.

7
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:19,660
In the last lesson we modified
a lot of properties of the map.

8
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:23,850
And it's often helpful to think of
them as being properties of a camera

9
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:25,690
floating over the landscape.

10
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:29,510
You could look at it as the cameras on
an aircraft that's flying over the map.

11
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:30,930
So as well as setting latitude and

12
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:33,390
longitude of the location
you want to look at.

13
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:36,930
There's also cool stuff like setting the
direction of the cameras looking in and

14
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:38,890
the angle at which it looks at the map.

15
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:41,350
The camera doesn't always
have to point straight down

16
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:44,670
as well as having the ability to
animate the movement of the camera

17
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:48,000
giving the impression of
flying over a landscape.

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,470
In this last end,
we'll do a lot of work with the camera.

19
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:54,510
And we'll see how it can be used
to build better maps for your apps
