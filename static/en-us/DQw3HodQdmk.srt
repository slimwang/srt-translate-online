1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,129
So as noted previously, there are two types of primary sensors we would be

2
00:00:04,129 --> 00:00:06,741
interested in looking at, film versus digital.

3
00:00:06,741 --> 00:00:11,451
There's a long-term debate that has been going on between film versus digital,

4
00:00:11,451 --> 00:00:13,848
use of either film or digital in cameras.

5
00:00:13,848 --> 00:00:18,528
I'm not going to get into that religious debate, to me that debate has,

6
00:00:18,528 --> 00:00:24,370
similar feeling, as a debate between digital music or through vinyl recordings.

7
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:25,880
We will look at both of them.

8
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:28,450
Film usually comes in canisters like this.

9
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:30,840
You've seen different formats of this.

10
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:34,240
For digital, basically what we need is some sort of a storage media.

11
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,860
Here I'm just showing you some generic forms of,

12
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:41,680
flash disk that are not commonly used in, cameras.

13
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,860
I'm going to make a claim that film and

14
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:47,130
digital cameras are practically the same.

15
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:52,600
For example, if I showed you this camera, this large camera here, again,

16
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,230
a digit, this is an SLR camera.

17
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:56,990
Or, I showed you this camera.

18
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:01,520
Both of them look exactly the same.

19
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,298
Both of them have you know, the shutter.

20
00:01:04,298 --> 00:01:05,699
They have lenses.

21
00:01:05,699 --> 00:01:10,924
And this is a single lens reflex camera, which basically means if

22
00:01:10,924 --> 00:01:16,814
I was to open this up, and put this right here, you can see it has a mirror,

23
00:01:16,814 --> 00:01:22,100
and if the mirror pops up, there should be a sensor behind it.

24
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:26,180
And, of course, the shutter controls how the shutter would open.

25
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:27,420
And the mirror is moved up and,

26
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:31,320
of course, the optics of the lens here are also the same.

27
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,900
So in essence, hopefully you'll agree with me,

28
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:38,340
that both cameras have pretty much the same form factor.

29
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:43,838
Of course, you may be arguing with me that, oh, things are really different now.

30
00:01:43,838 --> 00:01:45,288
For example let's say,

31
00:01:45,288 --> 00:01:48,609
you know, I bring in a cell phone which has a camera here.

32
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:52,208
This is a complete change in thinking about how photography's done, or

33
00:01:52,208 --> 00:01:55,516
let's look at, for example, an instamatic kind of camera here.

34
00:01:55,516 --> 00:01:56,917
This, of course, is a digital one.

35
00:01:56,917 --> 00:01:59,628
But if you look at all instamatic cameras,

36
00:01:59,628 --> 00:02:04,821
they pretty much have the same form factor lens sensor, which could be film,

37
00:02:04,821 --> 00:02:09,294
and in this case, of course, if you look at it, the film is not there.

38
00:02:09,294 --> 00:02:12,650
And, of course, we have is a small disc.

39
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:19,350
So this whole thing basically suggests that cameras are still alike, in their,

40
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:24,070
you know, kind of the whole form factor that we've seen them for a long time.

41
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:26,300
They've just gotten smaller and

42
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:28,550
also have a lot more different types of functionalities.

43
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:32,370
I will admit that with the innovations there have been

44
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:35,700
significant improvements in actuators and lenses.

45
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:39,760
Lens quality, of course, in the old days, was very good and is still very good.

46
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,450
But the actuators, the motors that are come in,

47
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:45,100
are actually much better than they ever used to be.

48
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:48,440
Furthermore, the sensors and stuff that we use in cameras now may not

49
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:51,320
have the same kinds of fidelity as film.

50
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,440
But of course, instant gratification.

51
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,190
We get pictures the moment we take 'em, and we see them right away.

52
00:02:57,190 --> 00:03:02,500
The bottom line with all cameras, in general, is there is no difference in how

53
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:09,750
light is transported through the lens, but it's how it's trapped and preserved.

54
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:13,510
So the whole process of how it's sensed, trapped, and

55
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:19,400
preserved, either in film or in digital form, is what's changed.

56
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,920
For film, basically, there's a chemical process.

57
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:28,150
For digital, basically, it's the electronic process of how light energy is

58
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:33,360
converted to electronic signals, which are then saved as digital signals and

59
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,090
then are converted into pixels.

60
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:39,900
In case of film, it's a chemical process that converts light energy and

61
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:44,010
preserves it in a format that basically can be saved on film.

62
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:47,220
I, I had earlier already shown you this camera that I have popped open.

63
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:49,420
And it had a film in it, like right here.

64
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:54,560
Basically I navel, I know it's an exposed film.

65
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,740
But basically, that's what we have in old traditional cameras,

66
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:00,860
a thin frame here.

67
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:03,080
I'm not going to take it out right now.

68
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,850
So here you basically just see the film.

69
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:06,670
I've, of course, exposed it.

70
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:08,350
But that's basically in a canister and,

71
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:12,140
of course, basically it goes through as soon as I take a shot.

72
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:15,320
I forward the film, and I expose the next one.

73
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,940
This is, of course, the film taken out of the camera.

74
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:21,380
This is exposed but not developed film.

75
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:25,030
After a film is exposed in the camera, you take it to a darkroom, and

76
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:28,340
then other chemical processes are added to develop to be able to

77
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:34,190
get the images out in the negative format that we have seen before.

78
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:36,634
I'm sure all of you have played around with negatives and

79
00:04:36,634 --> 00:04:37,670
have seen them in person.

80
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:39,590
So the bottom line is,

81
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:44,500
we have a canister, we have digital format in form of a disk, right now.
