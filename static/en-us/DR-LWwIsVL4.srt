1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,760
I need to also spend a few minutes to kind of tell you a little bit more about

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:08,290
how this field of computational photography relates to other disciplines.

3
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:09,010
So, in essence,

4
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:13,398
what we're interested in generating, traditionally images which are 2D.

5
00:00:13,398 --> 00:00:17,920
And of course, the world has got a lot more detail.

6
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,700
Which has 3D geometry and shapes and, of course, photometry like how

7
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:25,580
the colors and the appearances of different things are different for the scene.

8
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:33,470
So computer vision is really about trying to take imagery of the real world and

9
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:38,230
infer things like what's the geometry of it and also the appearance and

10
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:39,960
photometric inferences of this thing.

11
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:44,410
So basically from 2D world we're trying to infer more things about the 3D scene.

12
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:49,460
Computer graphics on the other hand is about taking this kind of stuff and

13
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:52,780
generating nice 3, 2D images.

14
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:54,390
kind of the inverse of this.

15
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:57,850
Both of them are essential in our understanding of computational photography.

16
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:00,470
Because we want to leverage both processes, because we're interested in

17
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:05,019
analyzing, but we're also interested in capturing information in the real world.

18
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:08,940
Image processing and optics also play a role in all of this.

19
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:11,700
So for example, we want to do things like image processing to

20
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,640
enhance the quality of images that are available to us for

21
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,670
both knowing what, the kind of camera we're using or how we want to display it.

22
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:22,950
But, on the other hand, optics and sensors help us design better sensors and

23
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:26,920
displays and the kind of stuff we want to to do capture the environment.

24
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,992
All of these four, computer vision, computer graphics, image processing, and

25
00:01:30,992 --> 00:01:34,073
optics and sensors are widely used fields and computer vis-,

26
00:01:34,073 --> 00:01:36,990
computational photography leverages all of them.

27
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:39,940
It also now has begun to leverage other disciplines like machine

28
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:41,010
learning and robotics.
