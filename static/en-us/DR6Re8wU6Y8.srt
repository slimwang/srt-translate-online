00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The next term I want to define is an event.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
You might think of landing on the edge or landing on tails being an event.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
We can define an event a bit more broadly that it's a subset of outcomes from the distribution.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
So an example of an event would be landing on heads,

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
and landing on heads as an event is just a set of the outcome {H}.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
We could define then valid for a valid coin toss,

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
and that's the set of outcomes {H, T}.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The probability of an event is just the sum of the probabilities of all of the outcomes

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
in that subset.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
So the probabililty of an event A is the sum of all the outcomes in A

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
of the probability of that outcome.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
So that should be enough to figure out, what is the probability of a valid toss?

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'll remind you that we defined the probability of heads as 0.49999,

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:01,000
and the probability of tails as 0.49999.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So what's the probability of a valid coin toss?
