Now I just wanted to add a quick note about hypotheses and theories. The

2
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:09,240
hypothesis is a testable question. It's like an if then statement. For example,

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:14,910
if someone drinks caffeine, then their reaction time will decrease. A theory,

4
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:19,720
on the other hand, is a well substantiated and unifying explanation for a set

5
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:24,420
of proven hypotheses. So if you take all of the research in one area, you put

6
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:28,560
it together, you come up with a theory. Now theories can change with developing

7
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,999
research. But in general, a theory is our current view of a topic.
