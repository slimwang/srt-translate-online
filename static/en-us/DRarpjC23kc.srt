1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:06,495
So now, we have this confidence interval and that ranges from about 38 to 42.

2
00:00:06,495 --> 00:00:12,260
So, it's a lot smaller than the one we had calculated when we were basing it off

3
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:17,240
of a sample of size 35. Bigger samples give us more precise estimates by giving

4
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:22,070
us smaller intervals because they shrink the standard deviation of this sampling

5
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:28,535
distribution. So, they shrink the interval in which a sample mean might feasibly

6
00:00:28,535 --> 00:00:34,050
lie. Now, notice that this confidence interval doesn't even contain the original

7
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:40,311
population mean 37.72. Therefore, it's very unlikely that a random sample of

8
00:00:40,311 --> 00:00:46,886
size 250 with a mean of 40 could have been selected by chance. This is evidence

9
00:00:46,886 --> 00:00:52,204
for treatment effect. So, with a bigger sample size, we have a smaller interval

10
00:00:52,204 --> 00:00:57,573
for which we're pretty sure the true population lies. So, with a 95% confidence

11
00:00:57,573 --> 00:01:04,159
interval with the sample sizes being 35, we had a pretty big interval. But with

12
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:10,270
a 95% confidence interval with sample sizes being 250, we had a much smaller

13
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:15,272
confidence interval. The greater our sample size, the smaller our confidence

14
00:01:15,272 --> 00:01:20,064
interval for the true population perameter after the intervention. And the

15
00:01:20,064 --> 00:01:23,953
better we are able to estimate our population parameters.
