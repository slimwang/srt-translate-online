00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,980
Growth hacking is a major buzz word
in the marketing industry right now.

2
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:06,220
It's all about growing
your business quickly.

3
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:09,370
Last lesson,
we spoke about a few examples.

4
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:11,150
Do things that don't scale.

5
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:13,740
In the beginning,
you may want to test out postcards or

6
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:16,810
door hangers, but that's not something
you're going to want to do when you

7
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:18,560
have a million users.

8
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,100
Referral bonuses have helped
many companies achieve success.

9
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:25,090
People, give ten bucks
to new customers and

10
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:26,620
ten bucks to the people
who referred them.

11
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:29,180
Suggesting followers or

12
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:32,759
people who share the app with
is another way to gain users.

13
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:37,040
With Twitter, they suggested people to
follow their members because they knew

14
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,460
if people were following and

15
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:41,510
being followed,
they were more likely to be active.

16
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:44,300
But let's take a moment
to explore a few more.

17
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:45,220
>> Take YouTube for example.

18
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:48,410
When they were first starting out,
they utilized giveaways and

19
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:52,420
contests to attract new users to
create accounts and upload videos.

20
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:54,560
They were giving away
an iPod Nano a day.

21
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,670
Remember those?

22
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:57,280
As we talked about
previously in the course,

23
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,960
they also use partnerships to
help accelerate their business.

24
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,920
Like the one that they did with Myspace.

25
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:07,060
Now Uber, on the other hand,
did some in person growth hacking.

26
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:10,590
They teamed up with Google Ventures and
drove around entrepreneurs and

27
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:11,450
investors for

28
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:16,840
free, giving entrepreneurs 15 minutes to
pitch investors an idea during the ride.

29
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:21,180
This was a great way to get future
influencers talking about their service

30
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,670
and caring about it.

31
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:27,200
Now imagine if Mark Zuckerberg, in every
interview he did, told people that he

32
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,450
got his start in the back seat of his
Uber, rather than in a dorm room.

33
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:34,640
Uber also teamed up with a northern
California blow dry bar.

34
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,690
Where you get your hair shampooed and
a blow dry.

35
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:41,880
They offer free rides to all of their
clients that booked a blow out.

36
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:47,040
This allows them to one, get press,
and two, access another niche market.

37
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,920
And finally, FourSquare lets
you leverage other platforms.

38
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,370
For example, you can post check-ins
to your Facebook timeline for

39
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:54,630
other potential users to see.

40
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:57,190
>> Because growth hacking is so

41
00:01:57,190 --> 00:02:00,440
popular these days, we can't
cover everything in this course.

42
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:04,720
However, we've posted links to articles,
if you're interested in learning more

43
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,580
and reading more examples
of growth hacking.

44
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,220
>> Thinking about a small brand or
a small start up,

45
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:12,850
it's really important to
embrace grassroots tactics.

46
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:15,580
Think constant engagement,
think things like giveaways and

47
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:18,630
contests, anything that can move
the needle in the right direction and

48
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:21,240
help build your social
media follower base.

49
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:24,050
It's also important to consider
things like user generated content,

50
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:28,380
getting great content from your users,
quotes, anything tactical like that can

51
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:31,090
really pay of and
help engage with your customer base.
