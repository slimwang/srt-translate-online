1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,520
The correct answer is the first one.

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:06,160
Information flow is the reason
why we have this requirement.

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,070
Let's say your label can change,
then let's say you were,

4
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:14,020
some full example is that you are top
secret, so you were reading top secret

5
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:17,380
information, and then your label
changes to secret light set.

6
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:18,200
You are the user.

7
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,530
Well, now you can write
at the secret level,

8
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:23,740
so top secret information that
you could read previously

9
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:28,000
can now be written to documents that
only have secret classification level.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,729
Then the user, later on, who's
cleared at secret level, can come and

11
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:35,650
read this document into
which information might

12
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:37,920
flow from top secret
to the secret level,

13
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,770
as a result of the change that happened
in the label during your session.

14
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:43,500
So, if you do that and

15
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,730
sort of do a couple of other examples,
labels change during a session.

16
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:51,660
Then, where you were reading,
where you can write, all that changes.

17
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:55,165
And because of that, we could have
information flow from a pierce object

18
00:00:55,165 --> 00:00:59,820
02 that we have in the example to a
secret object 01 and we don't want that.

19
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,550
So, information flow is the problem.

20
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:04,660
To reduce overhead associated with
change of classification level,

21
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:07,820
you do not change the labels,
and the reason for

22
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:11,140
that is nothing to do with overhead
associated with changing them.

23
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:14,010
It really has to do with
information flow, and

24
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:17,418
the information flow that may
violate the model that we have.
