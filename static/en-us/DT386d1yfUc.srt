00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,820
To understand the goals of IPSec,

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:05,830
let's take a look at a critical
weakness of our IPv4.

3
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:11,050
In IPv4, there's no authentication
of the source IP address.

4
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:15,571
That is, if Alice receives a packet
with Bob's social IP address,

5
00:00:15,571 --> 00:00:20,580
Alice cannot be sure that
the packet is really from Bob.

6
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:25,850
As a result, IP spoofing or
forging the source IP address

7
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:29,001
is a commonly used
technique in cyber attacks.

8
00:00:29,001 --> 00:00:33,360
For example,
bots in the botnet can send a DNS query

9
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:38,160
to DNS servers asking the full
TXT record of a domain.

10
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:43,210
By spoofing, the source IP
address of a victim website.

11
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:46,780
As a result,
the response from the DNS servers

12
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:52,090
which can amount to a very large volume
of data is sent to the victim website.

13
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:56,550
And this would result in a
denial-of-service of the victim website.

14
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:59,795
IPSec provides security
measures at the IP layer.

15
00:00:59,795 --> 00:01:04,250
This include authentication
of source IP addresses,

16
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:08,220
confidentiality and
integrity protection of packet data.

17
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:14,020
And authenticity of packet data, in
particular preventing replay of packets.

18
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:17,820
Of course,
a network application or protocol

19
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:22,910
can implement its own specific security
mechanisms to achieve these goals.

20
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:27,950
By having IPSec, that is implementing
security at the IP layer,

21
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:31,948
we can ensure secure networking
not only for applications to have

22
00:01:31,948 --> 00:01:36,360
a security mechanisms, but also for
many applications that are ignorant

23
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:40,890
about security because all application
run on top of the IP layer.
