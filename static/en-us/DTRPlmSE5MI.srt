00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,927
If you said 1/12, nice work. This time,
I'm going to use some blocks to help me

2
00:00:03,939 --> 00:00:07,684
out. This full block represents one candy
bar. I'm going to go ahead and section the

3
00:00:07,684 --> 00:00:12,287
candy bar into fourths. Okay, I have 1/4,
1/4, 1/4, and 1/4, all the fourths added

4
00:00:12,299 --> 00:00:16,563
together make up my whole candy bar. I
have 1/4 of my candy bar here, but now I

5
00:00:16,575 --> 00:00:21,318
need 1/3 of it. I'm going to split this
1/4 into 1/3. So, this piece right here

6
00:00:21,318 --> 00:00:25,847
represents 1/3 of 1/4 of my candy bar.
Let's see how it compares to the original

7
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:30,095
whole candy bar. I can see that the one
piece is one out of the 12 pieces of my

8
00:00:30,107 --> 00:00:34,690
candy bar, so 1/3 of 1/4 must be 1/12. And
you probably did it really easily. You

9
00:00:34,702 --> 00:00:38,782
probably just said 1/3 times 1/4.
Remember, when we multiply fractions, we

10
00:00:38,794 --> 00:00:41,930
multiply the numerators straight across,
and the denominators straight across. So,

11
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:49,220
I have 1 times 1 and 3 times 4, or 1/12. This piece is
1/12 of my original candy bar.
