00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Y = bx + a, the key holy grail in linear regression and in much of statistics is

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
how to use data to determine the value of b and the value of a.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
So if you can do this with data, then we solve the problem of fitting the best line

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
and that's once again called linear regression.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
So I won't give you the derivation but I'll give you the formula. Let's start with b.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Assuming your data comes in pairs for x and y as indicated here

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
and the formula for b might look really complex at first but I promise you it isn't.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Just in the calculations of the variance, we take the difference between x and the mean of x,

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:49,000
but rather than squaring this as in the variance case, we now do a product with the same term for the y's.

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:59,000
So important here, this notation x-bar is the mean of the Xi and x-bar is the mean of the Yi.

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Previously, we would have called x-bar µ

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
but now that we have two variables we're going to use the bar notation.

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Let's go back and look at this formula here.

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
When we computed the variance, we would have taken (Xi - X-bar)²

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:20,000
but here we're taking the product of Xi - X-bar multiplied by the y direction of the same thing.

16
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
So it's similar to computing a variance. The last thing we do is normalize this thing.

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Before we often normalize with n but now we're going to normalize with something else.

18
00:01:29,000 --> 99:59:59,999
We normalize with the term that very much reminds us of the variance.
