Hi kids. Welcome back. Here's what we're going to do. Step one, we're actually

2
00:00:03,648 --> 00:00:07,070
going to analyze the file name itself and determine what file type it is by

3
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:11,939
looking at the extension of the file name. This function is going to return an

4
00:00:11,939 --> 00:00:15,730
integer, which represents what type of file it is. For our purposes, we've

5
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:20,122
defined that 0 should be an image, and type 1 should be a JavaScript file. Now,

6
00:00:20,122 --> 00:00:23,840
as you can see, loading a JavaScript file is very similar to loading an image.

7
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,848
We actually create the object, we set a callback, and then we actually set its

8
00:00:26,848 --> 00:00:30,136
source. Now, there's a couple other things we have to do because we're

9
00:00:30,136 --> 00:00:32,716
injecting script into the DOM, like setting its attribute type and then

10
00:00:32,716 --> 00:00:36,824
actually appending it to the DOM. But other than those two things, it's pretty

11
00:00:36,824 --> 00:00:40,614
similar. The real magic comes down here at the bottom, when we actually analyze

12
00:00:40,614 --> 00:00:45,220
the file name to determine what type it is. So, for example, if it has a .jpg,

13
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:50,170
we assume it's an image, versus a .js, which we assume is then JavaScript.
