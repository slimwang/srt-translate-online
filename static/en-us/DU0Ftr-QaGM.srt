1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,560
>> Okay Michael, I've drawn a little teensy

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:04,320
tiny graph on the screen. Can you see it?

3
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:05,390
>> Yes.

4
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:07,340
>> Okay, and some points are positive, some

5
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:10,468
points are negative. And lets just imagine, for the

6
00:00:10,468 --> 00:00:13,060
sake of argument, that the green line that I've

7
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:16,040
drawn in between them is in fact the optimal

8
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:18,510
separator. It probably isn't, but let's just pretend that

9
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:20,780
I drew the right one. Now, I've just told

10
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:25,720
you that a lot of the alphas are going to be zero, and some of them are not.

11
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:28,420
So, thinking about everything that we've said, and

12
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:31,880
thinking about what it means to build, this, what

13
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:35,121
it means to build, an, an optimal decision

14
00:00:35,121 --> 00:00:38,340
boundary, maximizing a margin. I want you to, t,

15
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:41,810
point to one of the posit examples that

16
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:45,100
almost certainly is not going to have a non-zero

17
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:48,510
alpha, and one of the minus examples that almost

18
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:51,800
certainly is not going to have a non-zero alpha.

19
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,930
That is, are not a part of the support vectors.

20
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:57,110
>> You want something that does not not have a zero?

21
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:58,606
>> Don't confuse me.

22
00:00:58,606 --> 00:01:01,000
>> Do you want [LAUGH] something that's, that,

23
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,300
that has a zero alpha or a non-zero alpha?

24
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,630
>> I want something that has a zero alpha.

25
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:07,320
>> Got it.

26
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:11,130
>> That is, in some sense, doesn't matter. Okay, go.
