00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Here is an example.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
In your favorite sports club you get a list of the members,

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
and it might look as follows.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
You are given a name and an age in years.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
If you look at this, is it prudent--or should you--ignore data when,

6
00:00:13,000 --> 99:59:59,999
for example, computing the mean age?
