00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:04,700
Let's get back to our Mount Shasta example. In this case, remember our null

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:10,140
hypothesis would be based on the population. So knowing which null hypothesis

3
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:14,680
to use, it can be tricky. You'll continue to keep building up an intuitive

4
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:19,060
sense of what the null hypothesis should be, depending on the situation and the

5
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:24,355
question you're asking. In our example, we now know what kind of success to

6
00:00:24,355 --> 00:00:29,320
expect based on the null hypothesis. And we also know what kind of success the

7
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:34,370
guide company observed last year. And now we need to test how well these

8
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:40,960
obtained sample frequencies or proportions fit the population proportions or

9
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:46,700
our expected frequencies. This is called the kai squared goodness of fit test.

10
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:50,650
You might be wondering about the alternative hypothesis. The alternative

11
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:55,250
hypothesis is basically that the null hypothesis is not true. In this type of

12
00:00:55,250 --> 00:01:00,730
test we really only need to use numbers for the null hypothesis. As usual with

13
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:05,340
the tests you've learned about, there's a test statistic. And it's symbolized

14
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:10,550
by kai squared. Before we get into the details of this test statistic, think

15
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:16,320
about it yourself. How would you statistically show that the observed frequency

16
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:21,420
is greater or less than the expected frequency? Would you subtract one from the

17
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:28,250
other? Would you add things? Multiply or divide things? I'm being very vague.

18
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:33,600
But before you move on to the next video, maybe pause and think about how you

19
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,630
would construct a statistic such that if the observed frequencies are very

20
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:44,470
different from the expected frequencies. We'd get one number that's bigger than

21
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:47,310
if the observed and expected frequencies were similar.
