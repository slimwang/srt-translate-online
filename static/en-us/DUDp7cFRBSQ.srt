1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,969
Now thus far, we've talked about interdomain

2
00:00:02,969 --> 00:00:06,220
routing BGP, or the border gateway protocol,

3
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:10,280
as consisting of route advertisements solely between

4
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:14,140
border routers of adjacent autonomous systems. In fact,

5
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:20,170
this is a specific type of BGP called external BGP, or EBGP. But in

6
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:25,380
fact, as we know, each one of these autonomous systems has routers of its own,

7
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:31,720
inside. Those routers also need to learn, routes to external destinations.

8
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:37,640
The protocol that is used to transmit routes inside an autonomous system for

9
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:43,990
external destinations, it's called internal BGP or IBGP. Okay, so to review,

10
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:47,450
external BGP is responsible for transmitting

11
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:50,825
routing information between border routers of adjacent

12
00:00:50,825 --> 00:00:56,650
ASs about external destinations. And internal BGP is responsible for

13
00:00:56,650 --> 00:01:02,480
disseminating BGP route advertisements about external destinations to

14
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:08,676
routers inside any particular AS. Note that the distinction

15
00:01:08,676 --> 00:01:13,820
between IGP and an intra-domain routing protocol or an IGP.
