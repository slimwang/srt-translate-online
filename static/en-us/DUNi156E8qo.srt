1
00:00:00,003 --> 00:00:03,706
5. Cull the list, removing elements that'll already been visited.

2
00:00:03,706 --> 00:00:05,374
How do we know if they've been visited?

3
00:00:05,374 --> 00:00:07,782
Well we're going to look in the D array, the depth array for each element,

4
00:00:07,782 --> 00:00:12,146
and we can mark the vertex 0 as already visited, because it has a depth of 0.

5
00:00:12,146 --> 00:00:15,461
All the rest we're going to keep, because they have depth minus 1.

6
00:00:15,461 --> 00:00:21,000
So what we need is an operation where we take a vector of elements and a set of trues and falses

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,179
and omit only the elements who are associated with trues.

8
00:00:24,179 --> 00:00:26,453
What do we call this operation?
