00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:06,960
Welcome to your first day.

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,580
I'm Kelly and I'll be your
mentor as you get settled in.

4
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:11,460
&gt;&gt; Hi Kelly, nice to meet you.

5
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:13,770
So, what does a mentor do?

6
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:17,920
&gt;&gt; Basically it means I'll be assigning
you projects, giving feedback, and

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,300
connecting you to
the resources that you need.

8
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:22,980
I was in your shoes when I joined
the company a few years ago and

9
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,140
I know the first few weeks can be tough.

10
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:27,890
But don't worry,
I'll be with you every step of the way.

11
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:28,996
Come, I'll show you your desk.

13
00:00:33,203 --> 00:00:33,760
Hi.

14
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:34,990
&gt;&gt; Hey.
&gt;&gt; Thanks for joining me.

15
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:36,410
&gt;&gt; Glad to be here.

16
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:38,790
&gt;&gt; So, we've been pretty busy lately.

17
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:41,860
One of the reasons we've had so much
work is that we specialize in a certain

18
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:44,510
type of analytics called
predictive analytics.

19
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:46,564
&gt;&gt; What's predictive analytics?

20
00:00:46,564 --> 00:00:48,076
&gt;&gt; It's all about finding trends and

21
00:00:48,076 --> 00:00:51,159
patterns in existing data to help
make predictions about the future.

22
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:55,300
&gt;&gt; Tons of different companies
are using predictive analytics

23
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:58,300
to make better decisions
about their marketing,

24
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:01,170
finance, production,
really anything else.

25
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:06,590
&gt;&gt; Okay, so what you're saying is
you use data to predict the future?

26
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:08,490
What does that look like in practice?

27
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:09,750
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Good question.

28
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:12,010
Well, check out this
recent project we did.

29
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:14,660
Our client was a manufacturing firm, and

30
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:19,310
they were losing a bunch of money,
because of unexpected machine failures.

31
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:23,055
So we worked with them to predict
when their machines might fail, so

32
00:01:23,055 --> 00:01:25,102
they could the repairs beforehand.

33
00:01:25,102 --> 00:01:29,157
They ended up reducing the impact
of machine failure by over 40%.

34
00:01:29,157 --> 00:01:30,039
&gt;&gt; Wow.

35
00:01:30,039 --> 00:01:32,970
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and now they've hired
us to do a few more projects.

36
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,180
&gt;&gt; Well,
sounds like I have a lot to learn.

37
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:38,200
How do you suggest I get started?

38
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,340
&gt;&gt; Great, thank you.

39
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:43,660
Our manager thought this
would be a great project for

40
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:44,930
you to get started with.

41
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:46,930
I'm excited to see
what you'll do with it.

42
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:50,200
It'll give you a good sense of the
process we go through as we're working

43
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:50,780
on projects.

44
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,014
After you turn it in I'll
give you some feedback.

45
00:01:54,014 --> 00:01:58,103
And don't worry about it too much,
think of this project as a warmup.

46
00:01:58,103 --> 00:01:59,047
You ready to get started?

47
00:01:59,047 --> 00:01:59,856
&gt;&gt; Definitely.

48
00:01:59,856 --> 00:02:02,189
