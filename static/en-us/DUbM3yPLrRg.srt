1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:04,340
So believe it or not, that's the end of this first lesson.

2
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:07,330
why, well I want to cut you a break a little bit.

3
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:10,411
Actually the real reason is the next lesson's got, shall we say a,

4
00:00:10,411 --> 00:00:11,719
modicum of equations on it.

5
00:00:11,719 --> 00:00:15,320
And to do this and then all of that, boy that would be too much, so here we are.

6
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:18,810
But the idea is that we've motivated what it means to be a feature, and

7
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:19,650
a good feature.

8
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:22,550
Features are being used to match one to the next.

9
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:26,560
The two main properties that we talked about is repeated detectability.

10
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,230
That is, if I find them over here,

11
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:31,060
I'd like to make sure that I'm going to find them over in this image.

12
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:34,230
And they also should be good for recognition one to another.

13
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:36,660
That is, you can think of them as having a signature.

14
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:39,600
And that signature should be distinct, right?

15
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,430
Bob, Carol, Ted, and Alice.

16
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:41,930
Alright.

17
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:44,160
But robust.

18
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,200
Right? So Edward might become Ed but

19
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,550
nothing significantly different beyond that.

20
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:52,050
Turns out that this notion of being both distinctive and

21
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:56,010
robust sort of works against each other and, and we'll talk about that.

22
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:58,750
So going forward, we're going to introduce about what it means to

23
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:01,040
be a good feature, what it means to be a good interest point,

24
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:03,350
and we'll break that down into two parts.

25
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:05,269
Detecting of interest points, and

26
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:09,090
then characterizing the descriptor around those interest points.

27
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:10,740
So sharpen your lead pencil.

28
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:13,560
You guys even see lead pencils anymore?

29
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,190
Don't use a lead pencil on your iPad.

30
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:17,010
It's probably a bad idea.

31
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:21,270
Anyway and we'll do some interest point operators, and

32
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:22,480
how those function mathematically.
