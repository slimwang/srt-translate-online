00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Let's now dive in and understand how to use this cryptic name maximum likelihood estimator.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:14,000
The reason is because the estimation problem is given data, find the probability p

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
which now a simple example was the probability of heads.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Given a fixed p we started in probability, what's the probability of the data.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
So let's begin with the second and find a good solution for the first problem--

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
the estimation problem, and again I'm going to ask you a quiz.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Supposed my data looks like this--I want you now for the different values

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
of p to calculate for me what's the probability of the data.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Remember this is exactly the problem we discussed earlier when

10
00:00:47,000 --> 99:59:59,999
we introduced probabilities of multiple independent events.
