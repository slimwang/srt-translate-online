00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:08,890
joke is CS with a social life. It's computer science with philosophy,

00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:13,080
psychology, linguistics, and communications. I came into school thinking that I

00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:17,400

had a realization that, why do I have to do that with politics when I could do

00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:24,360
it with technology? But I still needed that push. my brother, who's a

00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:27,930
developer, told me he would disown me if I didn't take and enter the computer

00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:30,880
science class. And so, I took it and I was immediately hooked.
