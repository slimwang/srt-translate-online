00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,091
We have 2 fractions on the right hand side of the equation right now. So Id like

2
00:00:04,091 --> 00:00:08,108
us to combine them. Think about the least common multiple of 4a squared and a

3
00:00:08,108 --> 00:00:12,201
is. And that will be the denominator. And then think about what the enumerator

4
00:00:12,201 --> 00:00:13,598
will become based on that.
