1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,650
All right, creating a new directory and

2
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:04,410
moving a file into it
will take two commands.

3
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:06,920
The first command will
make the directory.

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:13,150
We can verify we have the new
directory with ls again.

5
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:16,149
Our new directory is up here.

6
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,030
Now we can move the file
into that directory.

7
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:21,590
There are two ways we could do this.

8
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:27,581
We could say mv beach.jpg
to Photos/ beach.jpg, but

9
00:00:27,581 --> 00:00:33,280
the shorter way is just to say,
mv beach.jpg Photos.

10
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,710
We can verify that we
really did move the file

11
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:38,720
with ls photos to look
inside the photos directory.
