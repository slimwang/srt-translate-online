1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,090
Let's see a multi tape
turning machine in action.

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:05,420
Input always comes in
on the first tape and

3
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:08,660
all the heads start at
the left end of the tapes.

4
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:12,990
Our task will be to duplicate
the input separated by a hash mark.

5
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:17,190
So for example,
if the input string is 1, 0, 1, 1.

6
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:22,731
We would want to turn that into
that same input followed by a hash,

7
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:26,647
followed by a copy of that same input,
1, 0, 1, 1.

8
00:00:26,647 --> 00:00:29,979
Of course we need to start
in some fixed initial state.

9
00:00:29,979 --> 00:00:33,499
And the first thing we need to do, is to
mark the beginning of this second tape

10
00:00:33,499 --> 00:00:36,740
since we're going to have
to rewind it at some point.

11
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:39,870
So, regardless of what symbol
we read on the first tape,

12
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:43,472
we're going to write a blank symbol
to the first slot on the second.

13
00:00:43,472 --> 00:00:45,999
By the way, I'm not going to write
out every transition as I draw

14
00:00:45,999 --> 00:00:47,540
the state diagram here.

15
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:51,020
Instead I'll just include
a description of the key transitions.

16
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:53,910
Next, we walk forward on both tapes,

17
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:56,800
copying the contents of
the first tape to the second.

18
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:01,470
Once we hit a blank symbol
on the first tape, we stop.

19
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:04,530
Then we write the separating
hash to the first tape.

20
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:06,720
And next we want to
rewind the second one,

21
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,190
keeping the head of the first tape
over the hash the whole time.

22
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:13,100
We stop rewinding once
we hit that blank symbol

23
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:15,760
we wrote to the second
state in the first step.

24
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,020
And now we're ready to start copying.

25
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:22,540
And we keep doing so until this
head here hits the blank symbol.

26
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:24,850
Once that happens we're ready to halt.

27
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:28,870
We've taken this string here, put
a hash mark and then copied it past it.
