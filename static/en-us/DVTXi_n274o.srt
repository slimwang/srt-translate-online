00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:01,800
Here's an example tree.

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:06,010
Suppose you wish to compute the depth or
the level of every node in the tree.

3
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:09,360
The level of any tree node is
the minimum distance to that node

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,700
from the root.

5
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:14,410
For example, here are the levels
of the nodes of this tree.

6
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:17,530
The root is a distance
0 away from itself.

7
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:19,450
Its children are all one away.

8
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:23,380
Its grandchildren are all two away and
so on.

9
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:26,530
Now suppose to compute the levels,

10
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:29,480
you decide to apply
the Euler tour technique.

11
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:32,985
Recall that the first step is
to compute an Euler circuit.

12
00:00:32,985 --> 00:00:36,635
That gives you a list, which is
effectively a traversal of the tree.

13
00:00:36,635 --> 00:00:38,225
Here's what I want you to do.

14
00:00:38,225 --> 00:00:40,525
I want you to initialize
the nodes of the list.

15
00:00:40,525 --> 00:00:44,145
So that a listed scan computes
the level for each node.

16
00:00:44,145 --> 00:00:47,015
You'll put your initial
values in these boxes, and

17
00:00:47,015 --> 00:00:49,880
I filled in a 0 for
you to help you get started.

18
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:54,380
Now I want you to choose the values,
so that when you do a list scan.

19
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:58,530
The level of every node ends
up in the starred boxes.

20
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:03,700
The starred boxes are exactly the source
nodes for child to parent edges.
