1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:05,126
So the highest port number is 65,535.

2
00:00:05,126 --> 00:00:07,320
That's not an arbitrary
limit by the way.

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:09,675
But there were a few more things
we should talk about before

4
00:00:09,675 --> 00:00:11,160
getting into that.

5
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,870
We'll talk about it in more
detail in the next lesson.

6
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:19,441
On most systems the lowest 1,024 ports
from 0 up to 1,023, are reserved for

7
00:00:19,441 --> 00:00:24,270
programs that are started by the system
superuser account or root on Unix.

8
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:28,110
It's like those ports
are reserved parking spots.

9
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:31,450
That's why when you start up a web
server which runs on port 80 you

10
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:34,430
have to do it as root or
with the sudo command.

11
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:38,250
For security a web server gets rid of
its root privileges once it starts up.

12
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:40,970
But it needs to start with them so
it can listen on port 80.

13
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:45,197
So if you use sudo to run nc as root,
it can listen on port 1,000 just fine.

14
00:00:45,197 --> 00:00:49,203
But what happens if you tell it to
listen on a port where your SSH server's

15
00:00:49,203 --> 00:00:50,386
already listening or

16
00:00:50,386 --> 00:00:54,540
if you tell two different ncs to
listen on port 2,000 for that matter?

17
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:58,720
Mark whichever of these you
think is a reasonable outcome.

18
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:01,272
Is it that the program that
was previously listening for

19
00:01:01,272 --> 00:01:03,660
instance the SSH daemon will exit?

20
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:05,960
Is it that netcat will
give you an error message?

21
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:09,770
Is it that both can
listen at the same time?

22
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:14,970
Is it that your computer crashes, or
is it that the internet explodes?

23
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:18,200
By the way, the result you get may
be different if you run netcat

24
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,240
on an OS other than Linux.

25
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,000
Try this out on your Linux system
to see the intended result here.
