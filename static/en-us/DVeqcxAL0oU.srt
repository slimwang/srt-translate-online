1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,210
You've done all this research and
competitor analysis, so now what?

2
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:05,670
Well, use it.

3
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:09,280
You can get sharp on your original idea
or alter the idea based on what you

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:13,010
learned from user research and
other early idea validation.

5
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:16,230
We have four activities that can help
you get more clarity on your idea.

6
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:19,330
The first is a Twitter description,

7
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:23,170
how would you announce your product
in a 140 characters, or less?

8
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:26,720
This activity helps you get laser
focus on the key user value and

9
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,420
your product market fit.

10
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:30,750
The second is you could write
a future press release.

11
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:33,250
How would your product
first appear in the news?

12
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:36,910
You can use this structure to
focus yourself and your team.

13
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:39,190
The structure ensures that you
capture your future vision.

14
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:43,240
The third is a one
page executive summary.

15
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:46,070
This is the shortest and
clearest way to define your product.

16
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:51,010
And finally, the fourth is
an experienced strategy template.

17
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:53,990
This template is appropriate for
defining new product categories.

18
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:58,560
And in the instructor notes, you'll find
templates for each of these activities.

19
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,150
Take a minute to read over them, and

20
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:02,660
think about which one would help
you get more clarity on your idea.
