00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,870
Now that we've explored
the value of a cover letter,

2
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:04,910
let's detail the integral
components in one.

3
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:08,919
A cover letter has one page, and
addressed to a hiring manager.

4
00:00:08,919 --> 00:00:13,400
It should be succinct, captivating, and
made up of a few memorable paragraphs.

5
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:16,730
To begin writing your letter,
you first need a job to target it to.

6
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:19,929
Then you write an introduction,
two or three body paragraphs and

7
00:00:19,929 --> 00:00:21,250
the conclusion.

8
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:23,420
Find a job that interests you.

9
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:25,929
You can pick a job you're
already well qualified for, but

10
00:00:25,929 --> 00:00:28,350
we recommend picking your ideal job.

11
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:32,189
Even if you need to develop more skills
before you can effectively pursue it.

12
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:35,420
Going with this later option allows
you to pinpoint areas you still need

13
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:37,000
to practice for or learn.

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,490
It will also teach you to
make a case for yourself.

15
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:43,030
To show that even if you don't meet all
the job requirements you're a capable

16
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:47,310
and fast learner who can pick up new
skills quickly and deserve a chance.

17
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:50,050
Look at the job description and
take note of the skills you have,

18
00:00:50,049 --> 00:00:53,089
the skills you are exceptionally good
at, and the skills you may not have.
