1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,170
Okay.
So hopefully you picked some colors from

2
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:04,580
the Material Design Color Palette.

3
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:08,550
I like this purple 500 color, so
I'm going to go ahead and copy it.

4
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:10,900
And I'll go over to the code and

5
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:16,750
then change the background color
to be # and then the hex code.

6
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:19,610
Then the background of the textview
updates to the purple color.

7
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:20,992
Cool.

8
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:22,550
Now let's change the text color and

9
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:27,620
I write android:textColor with
a capital C and then put double quotes.

10
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:30,528
Okay so, then I'll go back
to the color guidelines and

11
00:00:30,528 --> 00:00:33,260
pick something like maybe
this yellow looks good.

12
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:37,410
Over here and
then paste it in between the quotes.

13
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:43,100
Oops, I forgot the pound sign, and
it says this color is not supported.

14
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:47,390
So, I need to put
the hashtag symbol in first.

15
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:50,890
Cool, and then we got yellow
text on a purple background.

16
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:52,660
It looks pretty awesome to me.
