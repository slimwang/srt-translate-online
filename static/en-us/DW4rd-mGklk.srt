Hi Katherine.

2
00:00:01,630 --> 00:00:02,520
>> Hi Kunal.

3
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:03,920
>> How are you feeling?

4
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:05,200
>> I'm feeling a little tired.

5
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:05,960
How about you?

6
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:06,730
>> Me too, me too.

7
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:09,320
I suspect that some of our students
are perhaps feeling the same way.

8
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:10,240
>> Probably.
>> And that's okay.

9
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,910
It's a really long lesson too.

10
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:13,750
>> Yeah, it is.
>> And this is a great point for

11
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:17,060
them to, at the end of this video,
take a little break and

12
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:18,450
walk away from the computer.

13
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:21,080
>> Yeah, and while you're
doing that you could actually

14
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:23,170
also show someone the app you've made so
far.

15
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:26,130
>> Yeah, talk to your friend about
the new ideas that you have learned

16
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:28,730
in the Android world and come back and

17
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:30,900
share that conversation with
us on the discussion forum.

18
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:31,400
>> Yeah.
