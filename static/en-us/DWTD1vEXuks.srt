I mentioned a bit earlier that our pixel data is

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:07,920
stored in one large list without any real separation between pixels.

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:10,400
If we know how many components are in each pixel,

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,850
we can use that data to figure out the number of pixels stored in the array.

5
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:19,720
Once we have that number we can change the appropriate pixel component.

6
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:23,630
The tricky part is you can't just set the green element.

7
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:27,200
You also have to set the alpha channel to a non zero value as well.
