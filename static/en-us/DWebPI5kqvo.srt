00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:06,150
Here you'll see two pages with identical HTML, even though they look different.

2
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:08,950
If you take a look at the style section on the right,

3
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:12,670
you will be able to see the styling for each element on the page.

4
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:17,080
For example, if I want to check the font size for h1,

5
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:23,420
I can click on the h1 element and find the font size is 48 pixels.

6
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:28,600
And if I want to check the border width for the image, I can look in this

7
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:34,900
div element here, find the image, and see that the border is six pixels.

8
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:39,950
Now see if you can identify the same style elements for this page.

9
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:43,910
What's the font size for h1 and what is the border width for the image?
