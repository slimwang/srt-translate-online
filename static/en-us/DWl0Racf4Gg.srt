1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:02,960
Tell us about a time when you
were learning something new and

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:04,490
you had to struggle.

3
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:07,190
>> Okay, Katherine, if you're
going to ask our students to share

4
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:08,870
their vulnerable stories
on the Internet.

5
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:10,690
>> Yeah.
>> We have to lead by example.

6
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:12,280
>> Okay, fair enough.

7
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:13,230
You go first.

8
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:15,870
>> Okay.
[LAUGH] Well I've been

9
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:18,180
learning to play the piano for
about eight months.

10
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:18,890
>> Oh okay.

11
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:21,936
>> And the toughest bits for
me have been getting one hand right and

12
00:00:21,936 --> 00:00:25,747
then getting the right hand right and
then putting those two things together.

13
00:00:25,747 --> 00:00:30,309
But, when it comes out just so
beautiful its like [SOUND].

14
00:00:30,309 --> 00:00:31,203
>> Oh, that sounds really good.

15
00:00:31,203 --> 00:00:34,082
>> I've been playing with my friends,
it's really fun.

16
00:00:34,082 --> 00:00:35,986
>> Wait, you haven't played for me.

17
00:00:35,986 --> 00:00:38,249
>> Well, we'll see if we stay
friends till the end of this course

18
00:00:38,249 --> 00:00:39,446
>> Okay, then.

19
00:00:39,446 --> 00:00:40,269
>> Your turn.

20
00:00:40,269 --> 00:00:43,672
>> I've struggled with learning
Chinese my whole life.

21
00:00:43,672 --> 00:00:45,390
>> Wait, you speak Chinese?

22
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:46,447
>> Yeah.

23
00:00:46,447 --> 00:00:50,696
[FOREIGN]
>> Wow.

24
00:00:50,696 --> 00:00:51,370
>> It's no big deal.

25
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:54,236
>> [LAUGH]
>> So, I think the hardest part of

26
00:00:54,236 --> 00:00:57,368
learning Chinese has been trying
to learn all the vocab words and

27
00:00:57,368 --> 00:01:01,380
trying to put them together in complete
sentences without tripping up.

28
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:04,060
>> You know this story of
yours is reminding me that

29
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:08,180
learning how to make an Android app
is like learning a new language.

30
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:08,790
Okay, I could see that.

31
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:11,380
>> So, you're learning a new vocabulary,
and you're putting those things

32
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:14,105
together, and programming sentences,
and creating an app.

33
00:01:14,105 --> 00:01:15,110
>> Mm-hm.

34
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:16,960
>> Okay, well those are our stories.

35
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,390
Now I want our students to
share their vulnerable stories.

36
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:23,190
Tell us about a time when you learned
something new and it was a struggle.
