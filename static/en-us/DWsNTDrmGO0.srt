1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,370
Just to help you practice for this, I'd like for you to try out

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:08,850
a simple quiz in the same, same kind of a setup as the previous one.

3
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:12,190
Remember what we were doing is, we were basically going down,

4
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:16,219
from one column to the other and finding another value of indifference it, be

5
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:20,270
able to then find what would be the first derivative by just simple differences.

6
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:22,640
In this case, we are going to just look at absolute values, so

7
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:23,930
we are going to drop the negatives, so

8
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:26,767
for example here, between those two, the value should be 0.

9
00:00:26,767 --> 00:00:31,680
Similarly, between 0 and 9, the value should be 9.

10
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:36,420
Just fill the rest of it out and then use this to kind of extract from it,

11
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:40,420
what you think are the most appropriate extrema points, I'm just also drawn here

12
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:45,610
the curve for the same thing here, right, 0, 0, goes to 9, comes to 9,

13
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:50,340
and then again 8, and of course this is approximate, comes down to here.

14
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:54,690
And this is just my 1-D profile, of what the signal looks like, and we're

15
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:58,560
just looking at this in one 1-D, also, check marks here as to where the extremas

16
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:03,420
would be, so that of course will the edges be for this image example.
