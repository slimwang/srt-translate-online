1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Now let's apply derivatives to physics --

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Newton's Second Law of Motion.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
We're looking at one-dimensional motion.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Think of the train we saw before.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Some force is exerted on object of mass m.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
What does happen? The velocity of this object changes.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
And Newton's Second Law describes that relationship.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
The mass times the acceleration is that force.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
If you keep the same object, the same mass

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
and double the force, we double the acceleration --

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
the change of velocity.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
If we want to accelerate an object of twice the mass,

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
we need twice the force.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Mass is measured in kilograms internationally.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity -- v dot --

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
the derivative of the velocity with respect to time,

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
or as velocity is the derivative of position with respect to time,

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
the derivative of the derivative of the position with respect to time.

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Velocity is meters per second internationally,

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
and the change would be meters per second --

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
per second by how many meters per second,

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
thus the velocity change per second --

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
that is m/s².

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Force is given in kg times m/s²,

25
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
and there's a short name for that -- Newtons --

26
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
because obviously, Newton was the one to find this.
