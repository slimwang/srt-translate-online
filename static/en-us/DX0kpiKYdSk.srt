00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,060
Here's a picture, a very famous picture, and the question is, what do you see?

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:06,640
All right, so most people probably first see a,

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:11,150
the kind of stylistic drawing of a naked woman, and then maybe if you

4
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:14,690
look you'll see down here there's a picture of Abraham Lincoln.

5
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:18,830
But if you take a look at the title of the picture, this is a painting by

6
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:23,040
Salvador Dali and its Gala Contemplating the Mediterranean Sea which at

7
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:27,070
30 meters becomes a portrait of Abraham Lincoln, now you don't actually have to

8
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:30,940
step back 30 meters we can just blur the picture and when, when, and when I

9
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:35,670
blur the picture, it looks like that, and uh-huh, there's Abraham Lincoln.

10
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:38,210
And so the question is, what's going on there?

11
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:38,830
All right.

12
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:44,062
And, loosely the, the answer is that at this image there's all this

13
00:00:44,062 --> 00:00:48,390
hig frequency information that's showing you all these squares and you see the,

14
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:52,020
the outline of the woman and you can see the, the, the, what she's looking at

15
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:55,240
something in the distance, and you can see that picture of Abraham Lincoln, but

16
00:00:55,240 --> 00:01:01,500
at the low frequency, it actually is a reasonable picture of Abraham Lincoln.

17
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,350
And the idea is that images can be decom,

18
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:09,300
actually any signal can be decomposed into a set of things that describe it.

19
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:11,320
And, we're going to get to frequency, but

20
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:14,680
really what we're talking about is what's referred to as a basis set.
