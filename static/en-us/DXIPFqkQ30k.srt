00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:05,100
In material design, we imagine UI's to
be composed of pieces of digital paper,

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:06,930
which we call surfaces.

3
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:10,220
Now these surfaces have tangible
attributes to imply real world

4
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:12,850
behaviors, but they aren't limited
like their real world equivalents.

5
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:17,630
Everything on the screen lives in one
of these surfaces, including all texts,

6
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:21,370
icons, photos, buttons,
any UI element, really.

7
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:24,570
Now, these surfaces have
a tiny amount of physicality,

8
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:27,980
just enough to show that one
thing is distinct from another.

9
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:30,150
And how they sit
relative to one another.

10
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:34,430
This taps into our instinctive
ability to quickly recognize objects.

11
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:38,510
There's no need to take the metaphor
too far, and use real world textures,

12
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:40,900
sheens, spectral highlights, and so on.

13
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:45,490
Just the smallest set of real world cues
are enough to express a lot of meaning.

14
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:49,820
Surfaces also exist in 3D space,
we have varying widths and heights, and

15
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:50,910
at different elevations.

16
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:55,440
These surfaces are arranged in front
of and behind one another, and

17
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,270
cast shadows on lower surfaces.

18
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:01,290
So here we can see as the fab
raises up in elevation,

19
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:03,310
it casts a more diffused shadow.

20
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:06,530
Let's take a small detour and
really focus in about how and

21
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:08,980
why shadows get cast by surfaces.

22
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:13,640
In general, objects that are closer to
us command more of our visual attention.

23
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,610
And we can tell which objects
are closer based on their size and

24
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:18,840
how they cover and cast shadows.

25
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,860
On the things that are behind them.

26
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:23,830
So we can use depth as a queue in our UI

27
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:27,210
to direct attention to
important elements.

28
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:30,480
So how do we use these
concepts on a 2D screen?

29
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:35,580
We use the shadows to convey a surface's
elevation relative to other surfaces.

30
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:38,750
Surfaces nearer to you
will cast a larger shadow.

31
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:41,720
There's a lot of complicated maths
behind how to draw these shadows

32
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:42,680
correctly.

33
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:46,150
But luckily, on Android,
we only have to edit a bit of code

34
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:48,490
to have the shadows drawn
dynamically for us.
