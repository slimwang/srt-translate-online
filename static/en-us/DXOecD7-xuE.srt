00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,510
In this lesson, we have seen that we should be able to get

00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:08,010
excellent performance even when the program has a lot of data dependencies.

00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:13,380
In the next several lessons, we will learn how a real processor can actually do

00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:17,850
this only with harder structures that have limited size and complexity.
