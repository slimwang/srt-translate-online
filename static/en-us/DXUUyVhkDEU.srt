>> We looked at solving linear equations graphically. We looked at the

2
00:00:03,583 --> 00:00:07,660
intersection of two lines. And we know that the values of the coordinates, of

3
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:11,881
those points of intersection, would satisfy, either equation passing through

4
00:00:11,881 --> 00:00:16,225
that point. So we're considering, the x intercepts, of our lovely parabola, that

5
00:00:16,225 --> 00:00:20,371
we now have two equivelent equations for. What lines do we need to think about

6
00:00:20,371 --> 00:00:24,574
intersecting, at either one of these points? I'll give you a hint, that it's the

7
00:00:24,574 --> 00:00:28,436
same two equations at each point. And if you decide that this parabola is one of

8
00:00:28,436 --> 00:00:32,206
the lines that you should use, then it doesn't matter if you write the equation

9
00:00:32,206 --> 00:00:35,833
in this form, or in this form. Fill in the rest of these two equations right

10
00:00:35,833 --> 00:00:37,414
here, that we are interested in.
