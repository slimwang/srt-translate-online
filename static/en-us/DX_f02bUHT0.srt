1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,870
The green data point is going to be the one that's going to have a greater

2
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:06,200
information loss, because the distance from the green point to the red line,

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:09,870
is greater than the distance from, the yellow point to the red line.

4
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:12,960
And, the amount of information that's lost is proportional to that distance
