The next few principles make use of a device called a dependency structure

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:09,140
matrix or DSM. This device was devised by Baldwin and

3
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:13,050
Clark, to deal in general with management of design changes.

00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:17,250
A DSM is a Boolean matrix in which the rows nad columns correspond to

5
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:21,830
components with a one in a cell indicating that the component in a given row

6
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:25,720
depends on the component in the given column. Note that the order of rows and

7
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:28,820
columns doesn't matter to the information conveyed. So

8
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:32,340
we can feel free to permute them, in order to produce more meaningful views.
