1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:04,010
This time, the answer is dead lock. We now have

2
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:06,380
the potential for all the threads could be waiting for

3
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:10,050
a condition that will not happen. Specifically, if the tracker

4
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:13,420
were to find that bufavail were equal to MAX, then the

5
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:16,230
thread would stage in this loop, waiting for bufavail to

6
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:19,060
change. But it wouldn't be able to change because the other

7
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:22,860
thread is waiting for it to give the lock back.

8
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:26,210
It might be stuck on this mutex lock call right here.
