00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,590
Now that we have applied pipelining to laundry, let's try

2
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:06,494
to apply it to instructions, again, in the form of a

3
00:00:06,494 --> 00:00:09,680
quiz. Let's say that we have a processor with a five

4
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:13,220
stage pipeline. And each stage takes one cycle to do. And

5
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:17,720
let's say we have a program with ten instructions. Assuming

6
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:20,855
that these ten instructions can just flow through the pipeline, so

7
00:00:20,855 --> 00:00:23,330
that we don't have to worry about whether they need to

8
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:26,040
talk to each other in sound they just kind of flow.

9
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:29,945
With no pipelining how many cycles does it take to finish these ten

10
00:00:29,945 --> 00:00:35,000
instructions in this pipeline, and with pipelining how many cycles does it take?
