1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,320
So, the general area of considering light is sometimes referred to as

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:07,250
radiometry, which is the idea of measurement of light.

3
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:10,180
And the first term that we talk about is the radiance.

4
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:11,000
Okay?

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,110
So the radiance is always some light that is being carried by a ray,

6
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:19,500
or sort of, you can think of coming off of something, or out of something.

7
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:20,850
In a minute we're going to talk about the irradiance,

8
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:23,620
which is the amount of light falling on something.

9
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:24,290
All right?

10
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:26,070
So the radiance is sort of energy.

11
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:28,820
As it says, it's energy carried by a ray.

12
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:32,100
And, and what I want you do think about is, assume this like this little

13
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:36,630
patch out here, that's of the sort of fixed angle, that's observed down here at

14
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:40,970
some point, and this angle, this little patch is we'll call d omega.

15
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:42,860
All right. So,

16
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:48,800
radiance is measured is as power the amount of energy per unit area.

17
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:54,810
But the area is measured perpendicular to the source.

18
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:59,900
So this is our little area here, okay, but our light source is over here,

19
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:03,800
I'll make a little sun there, okay, and this is a little patch of the sun.

20
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:09,280
What we actually have to think about is the area perpendicular to that ray.

21
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,620
And so because it's perpendicular, we measure,

22
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:17,830
this is going to be a little weird, we measure the amount of radiance in this

23
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:23,720
funny unit called watts per square meter, so that part's okay, right?

24
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:28,610
It's watts per, you can imagine watts per square meter of that little disc, but

25
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:31,490
it's per what's called steradian.

26
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:33,400
What's a ste, well you know what a radian is, right?

27
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,960
A radian is a measure of angle.

28
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:39,310
A steradian is a measure of solid angle, right?

29
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:44,030
So this is, this little cone, this is a cone, funneled out, right?

30
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:49,100
And the steradian is the amount of angular area of that cone, okay?

31
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:52,060
because if I had some big sort of extended source here,

32
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:55,020
you'd have to integrate over all of these, these different area.

33
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:58,090
But we're only going to use this little delta omega patch.

34
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:01,030
And like I said, in a minute we'll, we'll simplify this whole thing.

35
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:02,430
But just this idea is that,

36
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:06,086
the energy that's coming from that thing is a function of.

37
00:02:06,086 --> 00:02:10,286
So I have to think about how much light is falling on my area as

38
00:02:10,286 --> 00:02:15,500
a function of the amount of different area that I can see up there, right?

39
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:19,500
So one is the area down here, and the other is the amount of the source that I

40
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,440
can see, and that's measured in steradians because that's solid angle.
