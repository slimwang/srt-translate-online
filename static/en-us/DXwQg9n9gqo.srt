00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:04,547
When using matrices, the way we tell points from vectors is by putting a 1 or a

2
00:00:04,547 --> 00:00:08,690
0 for the last coordinate. This also works rather nicely as an operation check

3
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:13,366
when using point and vector math. For example, if we add 2 vectors, the fourth

4
00:00:13,366 --> 00:00:18,185
coordinates add up to be 0, which means a vector. If we subtract 1 vector from

5
00:00:18,185 --> 00:00:23,297
another, the same thing works out. The fourth coordinate is 0 so it's a vector.

6
00:00:23,298 --> 00:00:28,035
If we had a point and a vector, we get a point because the fourth coordinate is

7
00:00:28,035 --> 00:00:32,448
1. If we subtract 1 point from another we get a vector showing the movement

8
00:00:32,448 --> 00:00:36,494
needed to go from the second point to the first. This fourth coordinate also

9
00:00:36,494 --> 00:00:41,032
acts as a way to check against doing illegal things. If you add two points, this

10
00:00:41,032 --> 00:00:45,432
normally has no real meaning. The fourth coordinate is 2, which is a tip off

11
00:00:45,432 --> 00:00:50,077
that something is not right. Now that we have this fourth coordinate, we can

12
00:00:50,077 --> 00:00:52,893
multiply points and vectors by a 4 by 4 matrix.
