1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:03,630
In this project we've got
something a little bit silly.

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:09,180
We've got 100 classes,
each of which have 700 methods.

3
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,170
Well this is clearly
a contrived example.

4
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:14,370
In principle there is nothing stopping
a large project from getting this big

5
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:17,120
especially if you have
a lot of big dependencies.

6
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,440
So, let's try compiling this.

7
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,500
Oops, looks like we've got an error.

8
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:22,740
Trouble writing output.

9
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:24,144
Too many method references.

10
00:00:24,144 --> 00:00:27,004
70,000, max is 65,000.

11
00:00:27,004 --> 00:00:30,160
Let's unpack what's going on here.

12
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,160
The Android virtual machine doesn't
actually run Java byte code.

13
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:34,420
It runs Dalvik byte code.

14
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:37,150
And there's a build step
after java compilation,

15
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:39,940
where the Java byte code is
turned into Dalvik byte code.

16
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:42,130
The step is called dexing.

17
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:45,070
Part of this process is compiling
a table of every method

18
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:48,380
in the application,
which is then indexed with two bytes.

19
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:51,930
So, that means we're
limited to 65K methods.

20
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:55,500
Fortunately, we can ask gradleto simply
break up this table into multiple tables

21
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:58,852
by setting in our build.gradle
file under default config,

22
00:00:58,852 --> 00:01:01,370
multiDexEnabled true.

23
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:06,430
Now if we try and build again, looking
through our build log we see that

24
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:10,750
the dex process was run successfully,
so now we're building just fine,

25
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:13,080
even though our project is gigantic.

26
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:16,100
This is just something to be aware of so
you don't get bit by this in the future.
