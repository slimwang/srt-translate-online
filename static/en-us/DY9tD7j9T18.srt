1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,235
So I mean--that's an area we can probably use a lot more computation

2
00:00:03,235 --> 00:00:06,040
and use it profitably and actually see the difference,

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:09,037
so one of the questions I always ask my students when I'm teaching is,

4
00:00:09,037 --> 00:00:11,634
"What are you going to do with 100 times more compute power?"

5
00:00:11,634 --> 00:00:15,046
So how about in the more high performance computing area?

6
00:00:15,046 --> 00:00:17,437
What are people going to do with 100 times more flops?

7
00:00:17,437 --> 00:00:21,521
>> Well there are some problems which have limitless amounts of computational need--

8
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:24,119
things like understanding disease.

9
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:28,118
The work being done by folks like Vijay Pande at Stanford,

10
00:00:28,118 --> 00:00:33,114
where you're trying to simulate the actual progression of a cell

11
00:00:33,114 --> 00:00:35,246
as it gets attacked in the disease.

12
00:00:35,246 --> 00:00:37,495
He's got a project working on Alzheimer's

13
00:00:37,495 --> 00:00:43,693
where he's trying to actually witness a nerve cell and watch a nerve cell die at the atomic level,

14
00:00:43,693 --> 00:00:47,494
simulating every gene and protein and cell membrane

15
00:00:47,494 --> 00:00:51,912
as it gets infected and eventually deteriorates.

16
00:00:51,912 --> 00:00:55,869
Just think how many atoms are in a cell and simulating that in real time

17
00:00:55,869 --> 00:01:02,450
or at least in a timeline where you can actually understand disease down to the actual chemical level.

18
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:05,200
It's really going to provide a cool breakthrough for how we treat those things

19
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:08,578
and understand the very complicated pathways

20
00:01:08,578 --> 00:01:14,411
and then design the right kind of drug that can get in there and stop it at the right point and keep people healthy.

21
00:01:14,411 --> 00:01:18,217
I think that's one of the cooler things we are going to be doing in computers.
