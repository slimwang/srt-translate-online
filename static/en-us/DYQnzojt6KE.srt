00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,340
We've got one small issue
that I'd like you to solve.

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:07,160
Right now all the text is smushed up
in the corner of the phone screen,

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:10,150
both in the upper left corner and
the lower right corner.

4
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:13,380
In our end version we want to
give it a little bit more space.

5
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:17,180
In the same style as before, select the
attribute or attributes that you need to

6
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:21,250
change to make room between the side
of the phone screen and the text.

7
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:23,060
Once you've selected
the correct attribute or

8
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:26,440
attributes, make this
space 20 dp on all sides.
