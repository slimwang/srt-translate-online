1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:04,130
So let's take a look at
the implementation of the MyApplication

2
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:05,430
class.

3
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:10,410
So here's where I defined the mTracker
variable to hold the tracker.

4
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:13,220
Then I have the method startTracking.

5
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:14,740
Just going to initialize the tracker.

6
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:18,100
First of all,
check if it already exists.

7
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,920
Simple check for now.

8
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,580
If it doesn't then create
the Google Analytics

9
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:28,670
instance by calling getInstance
on the Google Analytics class.

10
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:32,189
And then we create the tracker,
newTracker,

11
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:36,120
passing in the tracker
configuration file right here.

12
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:41,920
And then we enable autotracking,
ga.enableAutoActivityReports.

13
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,380
So that's all there is
to start tracking, and

14
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:46,850
getTracker is actually even simpler.

15
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:51,440
ALl we have to do is call startTracking,
and the startTracking method takes

16
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,470
care of checking,
does the tracker already exist or not?

17
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:56,900
And then we return the tracker.

18
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:58,330
Okay, I hope you all got that.
