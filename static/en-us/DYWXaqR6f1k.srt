1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,212
To get x by itself, and come up with our solutions, we need to get rid of our

2
00:00:04,212 --> 00:00:08,701
exponent. So, we need to take the square root of both sides. Taking the square

3
00:00:08,701 --> 00:00:12,841
root of x squared just gives us x, and on the right side, we need to take the

4
00:00:12,841 --> 00:00:17,183
positive and negative versions of the square root of negative 9. Now, let's

5
00:00:17,183 --> 00:00:21,483
think about what to do with this radical and the number underneath it. We can

6
00:00:21,483 --> 00:00:25,761
rewrite negative 9 as negative 1 times 9 and as we learned before, if we have

7
00:00:25,761 --> 00:00:30,246
two factors both written under a radical sign, we can apply the radical to both

8
00:00:30,246 --> 00:00:34,833
of them individually, just like we can with exponents. So now, we have plus or

9
00:00:34,833 --> 00:00:39,285
minus the square root of negative 1 times the square root of 9. Now, the square

10
00:00:39,285 --> 00:00:43,622
root of negative 1 is just i, and the square root of 9 is just 3. So, our answer

11
00:00:43,622 --> 00:00:48,799
is plus or minus 3i. Remember, that this means that if we substitutes in either

12
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:53,020
3i or negative 3i in place of x, it will satisfy our equation.
