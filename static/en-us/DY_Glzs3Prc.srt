1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:02,990
As well as the number of
elements that are involved,

2
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:05,430
you have to factor in selector matching.

3
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:07,890
Selector matching is
the process of figuring out

4
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:11,680
whether some styles should actually
apply to any given DOM element.

5
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:17,320
It's possible to select this div,
either with its class, like this, or

6
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:20,180
with a more complex selector like this.

7
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:23,730
It's complex, because in order
to know if the style applies,

8
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:28,370
it has to figure out if this is
the third child, whereas with this,

9
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:30,610
it can simply use the class name.

10
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:33,255
Now you may be thinking
that this shouldn't matter.

11
00:00:33,255 --> 00:00:36,430
And actually for matching a single
element, it really doesn't.

12
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:39,510
And this is a pretty simple example.

13
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:42,930
It's only going to take a browser a
fraction of a millisecond to figure out

14
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:47,940
the match in both cases, but if you have
a large number of elements affected by

15
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:52,620
a style change, then the complexity of
the selected can really start to matter.

16
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:58,780
One approach that works very well is
BEM, or block, element, modifier.

17
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:00,230
And it's a way of writing your CSS.

18
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:04,590
It uses single class
names to style elements.

19
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:07,880
And not only does it provide
more modular, reusable, and

20
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:12,410
readable styles, it is advantageous
to performance, since class matching

21
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:15,050
is often the fastest selector
to match for modern browsers.

22
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:18,060
In the case of the example we just had,

23
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:20,660
you could probably use
a class like this.

24
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:22,840
It's a box which
would've been the block.

25
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:26,190
There isn't any element, but
the modifier would be, say three,

26
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:28,620
to show that it's the third box.

27
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:32,810
If you want to know more about BEM, take
a look in the instructor notes below.

28
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:36,630
You can use any number of methodologies
for keeping your CSS tidy.

29
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:39,890
So if BEM isn't your thing there
are plenty of others you can try.

30
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:43,930
The key thing is, where you can,
keep your selector matching simple.
