1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:02,360
The last method will
look at accounts for

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:05,590
all three components,
that can be found in the time series.

3
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:09,579
The Holt-Winter Seasonal Method
comprises of forecast equation with

4
00:00:09,579 --> 00:00:13,364
three smoothing equations, one for
the level, one for the trend,

5
00:00:13,364 --> 00:00:15,766
and now, one for the seasonal component.

6
00:00:15,766 --> 00:00:19,451
Again, we can use the two variations
of application in the method,

7
00:00:19,451 --> 00:00:21,464
both additive and multiplicative.

8
00:00:21,464 --> 00:00:24,152
To review, the additive
method is used when seasonal

9
00:00:24,152 --> 00:00:27,390
fluctuation does not change
in magnitude over time.

10
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:31,300
Whereas the multiplicative method is
used when seasonal fluctuation changes

11
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:32,840
in magnitude.

12
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:36,130
The Holt-Winters Seasonal Method can
also be used with a damped parameter,

13
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:40,160
and is one of the most widely regarded
methods for forecasting seasonal data.
