For this problem, suppose an eavesdropper, Eve, knows Alice is sending Bob a message m,

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:13,000
which is in the set {00, 01, 10, 11} using a one-time pad where the key, k,

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
is a perfectly random key unknown to Eve

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
and the distribution of the messages is uniform--each message is equally likely

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
What is the conditional probability that m = 01

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
given that Eve intercepts the ciphertext 01.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Give your answer to two decimal places.
