1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,250
Okay, let me handle this one.

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:03,540
Given apparent 32752411.

3
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:09,109
Which corresponds to a board
that looks like this.

4
00:00:09,109 --> 00:00:12,769
We've randomly selected the spot
between the third and fourth column.

5
00:00:12,769 --> 00:00:14,539
To be the crossover point.

6
00:00:14,539 --> 00:00:17,419
For the first child, we'll take
the first part of the first parent.

7
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:18,920
Which we'll mark in blue.

8
00:00:19,969 --> 00:00:21,609
Looking at the second parent.

9
00:00:21,609 --> 00:00:28,009
Which is 24748552,
we're going to take the last part of it.

10
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:29,800
Let's mark that in yellow.

11
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:32,990
And now we'll add them together,
to get a child that is 32748552.

12
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:40,070
That makes more sense to me now that I
see it done with the actual game boards.
