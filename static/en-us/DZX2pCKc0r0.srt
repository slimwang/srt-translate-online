00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So we've just seen how to integrate JavaScript and HTML in our interpreter

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
in our web browser.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Let me show you a more complicated example.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
We'll see how it plays out in real life.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
We often use this tag to begin a webpage.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
It's not strictly necessary, but it's very good practice.

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
We're going to use this tag to begin a paragraph.

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Just to remind us, it's possible to have comments in HTML.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
The lexer strips them out, so we're not going to see them at the interpreter level.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Here I've put in a list of word elements, This is a,

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
and then here's a tag element, and inside it, nested are 3 more word elements

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
and then the tag element ends.

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
This is an anchor tag, making a link to Google.

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Let's say I want to write a webpage about John Searle's famous

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Chinese Room thought experiment, in which he argues against

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
or at least puts forth positions that cause one to consider artificial intelligence.

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
It's fun stuff.

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
But I don't remember exactly when he made the experiment.

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I will in a totally contrived example.

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Super contrived. Use Javascript to compute this.

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
So let's say I can't remember exactly when he came out with the Chinese Room

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
thought experiment, but I do know that the date was equal to 1,260 + 6 factorial.

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
If only there were some way I could carryout this computation on my webpage.

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Whoa is me! So I've written some Javascript to do just that.

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I compute 6 factorial + 1,260 and write it out and then we finish out with the rest

26
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
of our webpage text.

27
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
So this whole bit here is an embedded JavaScript fragment.

28
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Over here, we see the final result. This is a link to Google.

29
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
John Searle's italicized Chinese Room thought experiment from 1980--

30
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
oh! that's when it was. How silly of me not to remember!--

31
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
argues against artificial intelligence.

32
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
And you may notice that since there's some space here at the end of the script,

33
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
this comma doesn't line up exactly with the 1980.

34
00:01:47,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Let's not worry about that for now.
