1
00:00:00,306 --> 00:00:02,029
>> And so now let's give the explanation for the quiz.

2
00:00:02,029 --> 00:00:05,390
>> Alright, so, let's see what happened here. So,

3
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:07,960
what you're saying is in some cases the inputs are

4
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:11,760
discrete or continuous or complicated. In other cases the outputs

5
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:14,290
could be discrete or continuous or complicated. But I think

6
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:16,046
what you were saying is, that what on, on,

7
00:00:16,046 --> 00:00:19,100
what matters to determine if something is classification or regression

8
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:22,620
is whether the output is from a discrete small set

9
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:25,540
or, or whether it's some continuous quantity. Is that right?

10
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:27,534
>> Right, that's exactly right. The difference between

11
00:00:27,534 --> 00:00:29,820
a classification task or a regression task is

12
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,080
not about the input, it's about the output.

13
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:36,380
If the output is continuous then it's regression

14
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:39,242
and if the output is small discrete set

15
00:00:39,242 --> 00:00:41,990
or discrete set, then it is a classification

16
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:46,470
task. So, with that in mind, what do you think is the answer to the first one?

17
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:48,540
>> So, lend money. If it was something like predicting

18
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:51,130
a credit score, that seems like a more continuous quantity.

19
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:52,850
But this is just a yes no, so that's

20
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:55,500
a discrete class, so I'm going to go with classification.

21
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:01,650
>> That is, correct. It is classification and the short answer is, because

22
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:07,060
it's a binary task. True, false. Yes, no. Lend money or don't lend money.

23
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:07,900
>> Got it.

24
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:09,980
>> So it's a simple classification test. Okay,

25
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:11,460
with that in mind, what about number two?

26
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:13,810
>> Alright, so number two. It's trying to judge

27
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:16,320
something about where they fall on a scale, high school,

28
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:21,120
college, or grad student. But all of, the system is being asked to do is put

29
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,400
them into one of those three categories, and

30
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,810
these categories are like classes, so it's classification.

31
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:30,290
>> That is also exactly right. Classification. We moved from binary

32
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:33,655
to trinary in this case, but the important thing is that it's

33
00:01:33,655 --> 00:01:37,480
discrete. So it doesn't matter if it's high school, college grad,

34
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:41,366
professor, elementary school, any number of other ways we might decide where

35
00:01:41,366 --> 00:01:44,092
your status of matriculation is is a small discrete

36
00:01:44,092 --> 00:01:47,305
set. So, with that in mind, what about number three?

37
00:01:47,305 --> 00:01:50,600
>> Alright, so the input is the same in this case. And the output is kind of

38
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,280
the same except there's, well there's certainly more

39
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,680
categories because there's more possible ages than just those

40
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,920
three. But when you gave the example you

41
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,980
did explicitly say that ages can be fractional like,

42
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:04,130
you know, 22.3. So that definitely makes me

43
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:06,540
think that it's continuous, so it should be regression.

44
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:07,980
>> Right, I think that is exactly the

45
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:09,650
right thing, you have a continuous output. Now,

46
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:11,200
I do want to point something out. That

47
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,260
while the right answer is regression, a lot of

48
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,690
people might have decided that the answer was

49
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:19,010
classification. So, what's an argument? If I told

50
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:20,690
you in fact the answer was classification, what

51
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:22,000
would be your argument for why that would be?

52
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,530
>> Well, I guess.

53
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:23,100
>> Can you think of one?

54
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,350
>> Yeah, I guess. I mean, you know,

55
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:26,320
if you think about ages as being discrete. You

56
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:31,570
just say, you know, you can one or two or three or, you know, whatever up to

57
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:34,010
130, say. But there, but there's just that, that

58
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:36,060
set. There isn't really, you know, usually we don't talk

59
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:38,655
about fractional ages. So, so it seems like you could

60
00:02:38,655 --> 00:02:40,780
think of it as, as, as a set of classes.

61
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:42,663
>> Right. So let's imagine. So, how

62
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:44,794
old are people? Let's imagine we only cared

63
00:02:44,794 --> 00:02:48,246
about years, so you're either one or two or three or four or five. Or maybe

64
00:02:48,246 --> 00:02:51,088
you can be one and a half, and two and a half, and three and a

65
00:02:51,088 --> 00:02:53,590
half. But, whatever, it's, it's not all possible

66
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:56,750
real number values. And we know that people

67
00:02:56,750 --> 00:03:03,350
don't live beyond, say, 250. Well, in that case, you've got a very large

68
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:09,110
discrete set but it's still discrete. Doesn't matter whether there's two things

69
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:15,370
in your set, three things in your set, or in this case 250 things in

70
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:21,670
your set, it's still discrete. So, whether it's regression, or classification,

71
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:24,520
depends upon exactly how you define your output and these things

72
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:28,470
become important. I'm going to argue that in practice, if you were

73
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:31,170
going to set up this problem, the easiest way to do it

74
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:33,700
would be to think about it as a real number and

75
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:37,890
you would predict something like 23.7. And so it's going to end

76
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:40,110
up being a regression task and we can might, maybe think

77
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:42,870
about that a little bit more as we move along. So

78
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:44,760
either answer would be acceptable depending

79
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,900
upon what your explanation of exactly

80
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:50,360
what the output was. Was. You buy that?

81
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:50,930
>> That makes sense.

82
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:54,718
>> Excellent. Okay. Alright, let's move beyond the

83
00:03:54,718 --> 00:03:56,846
quiz and start thinking about exactly what it

84
00:03:56,846 --> 00:03:59,420
means to define a classification problem. And then

85
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:01,360
later what it means to define a regression problem.
