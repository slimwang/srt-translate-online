00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,569
The last step of course would be to put all the

2
00:00:01,569 --> 00:00:06,110
pieces together. So, we would take our carrier and airport lists

3
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:08,790
and run a number of queries to download all of the

4
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:11,770
data. We then want to write a parser that will allow us

5
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:14,910
to extract this data, and put it into the tables we

6
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:18,840
would like to build for flight information, for all airline and

7
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:22,330
airport combinations. This is a somewhat larger process than it makes

8
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:25,420
sense to go through in this lesson, but you'll find some fun

9
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:28,180
work to do built around this example in the problem set.
