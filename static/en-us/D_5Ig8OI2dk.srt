1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,620
The first part of the process
is continuous integration,

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:07,920
an automated process of getting changes
into existing codebases and building and

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,132
running tests.

4
00:00:09,132 --> 00:00:12,140
The goal's not to create
a backlog when you go to deploy.

5
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:14,740
A boring deployment would
be deemed a success.

6
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:17,130
No surprises is a good thing.

7
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:18,490
When embarking on changing and

8
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:22,560
updating code, a developer takes a copy
of the current code base to work from.

9
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,160
As other developers make changes
to the source code repository,

10
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,150
the local copy gradually ceases
to reflect the repository code.

11
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:32,530
Not only can existing codebase change,
but

12
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:35,890
new code can be added as
well as new libraries and

13
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:39,750
other resources that create
dependencies and potential conflicts.

14
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:42,670
So, what's the best practices
to prevent this from happening?

15
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:46,670
You want to maintain a code repository.

16
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:47,930
Automate the build.

17
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:49,100
Test the build.

18
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:50,830
Commit your changes often.

19
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:52,260
Build each commit.

20
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:55,540
If it breaks, fix it right away,
while it's fresh in everyone's mind.

21
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:59,040
And when possible, test from a clone
of the production environment.

22
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,805
While most of these practices
are automatable by tools,

23
00:01:01,805 --> 00:01:04,450
committing code is
still a manual process.

24
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:07,410
Developers have to adopt this
approach for it to work.

25
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:09,870
If someone will commit their
changes only once a month,

26
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:12,200
it's going to create problems,
a human problem.
