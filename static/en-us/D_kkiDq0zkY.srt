00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,190
Here's the F table and we would need to use the degrees of freedom that you

2
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:07,080
found earlier. Since there were three groups, remember that there were two

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:12,710
degrees of freedom. And there were three cows per group who consumed the food.

4
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:16,070
There were nine total values and the degrees of freedom for within group

5
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:23,583
variability was six. They intersect here at 5.1433. Our F statistic 27 is much

6
00:00:23,583 --> 00:00:28,127
greater then our F-critical value. It's out here somewhere in the critical

7
00:00:28,127 --> 00:00:32,878
region. Probably way out there. Therefore, we would accept the alternative. At

8
00:00:32,878 --> 00:00:36,654
least one pair of significant differences exists between the amount of food

9
00:00:36,654 --> 00:00:42,144
that cows ate. We summarize our results in our ANOVA table. This is how the

10
00:00:42,144 --> 00:00:45,480
results are typically presented, even when we use software.
