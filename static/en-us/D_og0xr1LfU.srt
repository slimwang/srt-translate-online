1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:02,520
So we're done with lesson one, right?

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:06,680
So if this is our student, she is now
at IT and at the end of lesson one.

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:09,990
What I do is I just want to take
all of this thing together and

4
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:12,750
not focus too much on lesson
one anymore, if that's okay?

5
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:14,720
>> Yeah, we can move lesson two over.

6
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:15,400
>> Okay.

7
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:18,770
Let's say all of this is lesson two.

8
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:20,880
What should be some of
the big ideas in lesson two?

9
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,090
>> Well, I think we can
split it up into two parts.

10
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:24,050
>> Okay.

11
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:25,940
>> And what do you think we
should do for the first part?

12
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:29,340
>> Well, right here we should add
some interactivity to the app, right?

13
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:31,840
So, say there's a button on our app,
you press the button,

14
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,070
boom, something happens.

15
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:34,220
>> Yeah, that sounds good.

16
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:37,270
And then in the second part we can
go into details of what exactly is

17
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:40,390
happening and
also learn about variables and methods.

18
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:43,680
>> So all of the technical jargon
that sounds like magic right now, but

19
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,190
will not be magic at
the end of this lesson.

20
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:46,280
>> Exactly.

21
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,240
And we can do this by
building up the new app.

22
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:49,990
>> Wait, what?

23
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:51,220
We're making a new app in lesson two?

24
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:53,110
>> Yeah,
it's going to be a coffee ordering app.

25
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:55,390
>> Wait, can we call it just Java?

26
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:56,314
>> Okay, I get it.

27
00:00:56,314 --> 00:00:57,756
>> [LAUGH]
>> [LAUGH].

28
00:00:57,756 --> 00:00:59,282
Yes, let's get started.
