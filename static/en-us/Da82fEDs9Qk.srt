1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:02,640
All right, you're done.

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:04,660
Let's take a look at my solution.

3
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:08,900
First, we add the permission for
ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE to the manifest.

4
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:12,300
Then we add a no_network string
to the strings .xml file.

5
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:19,060
As I suggested, in the utility class
we add an isNetworkAvailable function.

6
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:23,970
That uses that connectivity service to
return the active network information.

7
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:28,020
Then, I added a function to
handle updating the empty view,

8
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:30,220
which we'll call from on load finish.

9
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:33,830
Finally, we call this function
from on load finished.

10
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:35,330
Let's test it.

11
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,180
Remember how we do this.

12
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:39,180
We go to our emulator.

13
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:40,290
We uninstall the app.

14
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:43,410
Then we set the emulator
into airplane mode.

15
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:46,740
At this point,
let's launch and run the app.

16
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:50,430
And now we get a far better message.

17
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:51,940
No weather information available,

18
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:54,190
the network is not available
to fetch weather data.

19
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:59,690
Once again, if we switch off of airplane
mode, it'll automatically go and

20
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:00,750
run our sync adapter.
