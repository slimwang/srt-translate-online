1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,930
The second option is what we call an experimental study. Hidden in this one

2
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:08,490
sentence are aspects that are universal to all experimental studies we do in

3
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:13,710
psychology. Let's start with caffeine in varying amounts. Every experiment we

4
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:18,400
do, we have to manipulate or change something or else we cannot make a causal

5
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:23,270
statement from our result. So whatever it is that we manipulate or change is

6
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:28,200
our independent variable. So in this case caffeine is our independent variable

7
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:34,610
or iv for short because we're changing the amount of caffeine each group gets.

8
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:39,832
An easy way to remember this is investigator starts with an i. An independent

9
00:00:39,832 --> 00:00:45,470
variable also tarts with an i and it's the investigator that manipulates the

10
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:50,460
independent variable. And we measure the effect of our independent variable on

11
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:54,910
the dependent variable. The dependent variable in our experiment is reaction

12
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:59,620
time because a dependent variable is what we measure. We need to measure how

13
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:05,700
the dependent variable responds or changes to the independent variable. So how

14
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:10,800
does reaction time change when we manipulate caffeine? In order to make a

15
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:16,120
causal statement, we need to make sure that the iv or the independent variable

16
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:21,810
is what causes the change in the dependent variable. So in our case, we need to

17
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:26,519
know that caffeine is what actually causes the change in reaction time.
