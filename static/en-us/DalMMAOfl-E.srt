1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,050
The answer to this
question actually is no.

2
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:08,050
Remember we did say that primary
key uniquely identifies a tuple.

3
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:11,060
Uniquely identifies means
that given primary key value,

4
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:13,120
there should only be one tuple.

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,900
If it's your social security number or

6
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:18,020
your employee ID, of course,
that has to be unique.
