>> Here's one that I'd like you to do on your own. We have the equation 3x

2
00:00:03,973 --> 00:00:08,404
squared plus 7x minus 10 equals 2x squared plus 5x plus 5. And I'd like you to

3
00:00:08,404 --> 00:00:13,015
solve for x. Now I know this probably looks really complicated right now because

4
00:00:13,015 --> 00:00:17,308
there are a lot of terms on both sides of the equation. But for your first few

5
00:00:17,308 --> 00:00:21,395
steps just start out by trying to get it in the general form for a quadratic

6
00:00:21,395 --> 00:00:25,419
equation. So with all the terms on one side and with like terms combined, and

7
00:00:25,419 --> 00:00:27,820
then just 0 on the other side of the equation.
