00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:04,680
In this video, we are going to learn how to select between different models.

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:09,480
Before we do that, let's do a quick recap from where we left off.

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:13,310
With selected features using distances sampled over time,

4
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:16,980
we investigated how many features we should select.

5
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:20,380
We made sure we had enough data for the chosen features.

6
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:25,600
We used the frequency of the data, to validate that we have enough data.

7
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:30,320
We also wanted to make sure the data is good enough to distinguish patterns.

8
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,240
We did this by visually inspecting the scatter plots and

9
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:39,490
making sure that our chosen features will have a discriminating power.

10
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:43,780
We have discussed how best to choose our features and

11
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:47,855
how that can affect the final validity of our models,

12
00:00:47,855 --> 00:00:51,760
through analysis of errors and model complexity.

13
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,410
Once we have a good idea of the features set and

14
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:59,980
a clear definition of the problem statement, we can build many different

15
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:05,470
types of model to identify different cars from our connected cars dataset.

16
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:08,760
We are now ready to make the statement of the model.

17
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:14,290
We want to use classification model to distinguish between B and F.

18
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:18,310
We can do so by using several different classifiers.

19
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:20,560
In this case, we have chosen three.

20
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,630
A LOGISTIC REGRESSION, a SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE based classifier, and

21
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:27,190
a RANDOM FOREST based classifiers.

22
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:32,110
Each of these learning algorithms are a topic unto itself.

23
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:37,280
And we will not attempt to cover the basics of these, assuming you have used or

24
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,130
seen most of these topics in the machine learning course.

25
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:43,530
If you would like to have a refresher,

26
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:46,840
please look at the material in the instructor's notes.

27
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:50,850
After we build the three models, we will look at ways to measure

28
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:56,150
the performance of each model and then be able to make a choice between models.
