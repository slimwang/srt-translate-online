00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,960
Let's practice. Open the Google spreadsheet that's linked in instructor

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:08,060
notes. I like to snowboard, [NOISE] and I want to know

3
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:10,620
how much it snowed over the last three seasons in

4
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:12,670
Tahoe so that I can get a feel for how much

5
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:15,970
it'll snow this season. Every time it snowed, I listed

6
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:18,880
the inches of snowfall and the date. So when you

7
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,850
open the spreadsheet you should see three columns of data.

8
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:25,320
One for each season. We want to know the total amount

9
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,180
of snowfall that occurred each season. When we're doing

10
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:32,000
any type of calculation in a spreadsheet, we start with

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,900
an equal sign. In this case, we want to sum

12
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:37,770
up all the numbers in each column. So I'll write

13
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:40,600
equals sum, and then the name of the start

14
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,260
cell, colon, and then the name of the end cell.

15
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:47,270
This colon means that we sum all the numbers in

16
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:50,780
between the start cell and the end cell. And remember,

17
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:55,540
you've already learned how we denote the names of each cell. So, if we want

18
00:00:55,540 --> 00:01:00,150
to know how much it snowed in season one, what should we put here, and here?
