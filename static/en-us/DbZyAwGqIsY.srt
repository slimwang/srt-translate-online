1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,800
For this quiz, your goal is to define a procedure.

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:06,000
We'll call it abbaize.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
This is very useful if you need to come up with names,

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and what it does is take 2 strings as its inputs and outputs a string

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
that is the first input, followed by 2 repetitions of the second input, followed by the first input.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,000
As an example, if we called abbaize, passing in the string 'a' and the string 'b'--

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
single character strings--

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
what we should get as a result is the string 'abba'.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:40,000
If we called abbaize, passing in the string 'dog' and the string 'cat',

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
what we should get is the string 'dogcatcatdog',

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
and there aren't any spaces between the strings.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
They're just all pasted together.
