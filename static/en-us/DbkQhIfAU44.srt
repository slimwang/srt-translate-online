00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,290
Let's have a closer look at constructing objects. This time we'll use a

2
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:09,350
different class. The class called rectangle. In BlueJ I right-click on the

3
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:14,680
class in order to construct objects. Now look closely here. Up here I have two

4
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:20,575
lines that start with the keyword new. Followed by the name of the class. The

5
00:00:20,575 --> 00:00:26,010
keyword new is an instruction to make a new object of the class that's written

6
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:31,180
after new. Inside the parenthesis, we put the construction arguments. Now

7
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:37,180
notice that the're actually two of these. Two so called constructors. The first

8
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:42,170
one wants four construction arguments. The second one doesn't want any. Let's

9
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:48,190
use the first one. Here we see the construction arguments described as x, y,

10
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:55,320
width and the height. I'm filling in some values, five, ten, 60 and 90 and when

11
00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:00,510
I click OK, the familiar object icon appears. Now as always in BlueJ, I can

12
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:07,840
right click on the object icon to find out what methods there are. For example,

13
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:13,220
the get width method gives me the width and that's the 60 that I just supplied.

14
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:17,740
You might be a little disappointed that the rectangle is not displayed but to

15
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:24,430
display, simply call it straw method. Right-click Draw and here it is in a

16
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:28,860
little window. Let's look at the second constructor, the one with no argument.

17
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:35,165
When I select it, I don't need to supply any argument values and the object is

18
00:01:35,165 --> 00:01:42,767
constructed. What rectangle might it be? I can draw it. But nothing seems to

19
00:01:42,767 --> 00:01:53,342
show up. Let's investigate. it has width zero. And height zero, not a very

20
00:01:53,342 --> 00:02:04,300
useful rectangle but of course I can always grow it. And there it is. At any

21
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:08,850
rate you have now seen that the rectangle class has two ways of constructing

22
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:14,570
objects. One constructure take four arguments, the other none. Let's have a

23
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:15,530
look at it's Javadoc.
