1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:05,310
Definitely this one. The trend is downward sloping. So it can't be any of these

2
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:09,810
positive slopes and it definitely doesn't look like the data go through this

3
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:16,340
value up here or here. And this one looks like it slopes downward too steeply.

4
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:21,000
We can see which one is better, but how do we determine mathematically which is

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,080
the best. For example, how do we know that this line, in blue, isn't slightly

6
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:31,200
better? There are a lot of lines that could look like they best approximate the

7
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:37,940
data. So we have to mathematically find the exact a and b, the y intercept and

8
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:42,560
slope that will get us the line of best fit. How do we find these regression

9
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:47,572
coefficients? Let's look at these examples again. Remember how we talked about

10
00:00:47,572 --> 00:00:51,350
observed and expected values? Let's say we're deciding whether this would be a

11
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:57,410
good regression line. For this x value. The expected value is way down here.

12
00:00:57,410 --> 00:01:03,520
For this x value, the expected value is also pretty far. This x value looks to

13
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:09,100
be pretty close to the expected value but these two are really far from their

14
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:15,660
expected values. The same with this. The expected value for this value of x. Is

15
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:21,250
way up here. So this residual actually isn't too bad. But the amount of the

16
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:26,430
residual gets worse and worse as we continue. Same with this one. If we

17
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:31,635
continued this line really far out, the residual for this data value would be

18
00:01:31,635 --> 00:01:37,740
huge. All of them would be pretty big. And these would be really big. But here,

19
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:43,190
the residuals are pretty small, especially compared to the other possibilities.

20
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:46,150
For these two points the residuals are about zero.
