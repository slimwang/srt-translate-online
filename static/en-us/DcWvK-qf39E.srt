1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,040
Now it's time for
you to update your weather app.

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:07,040
Using the cache then network strategy,

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:12,430
I want you first to modify the get
forecast method in your app.js file

4
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:17,360
to get data from the cache and
kick off a request to the weather API.

5
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:23,610
Then, update the service worker to
check the URL being requested, and

6
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:26,080
if it's a request to the weather API,

7
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,840
cache the response in the data
cache before returning it.

8
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:34,160
Make sure you use
progressive techniques here.

9
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:38,120
Using feature detection to
determine if the cache's object

10
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:40,810
is available in the global scope.

11
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:44,460
And makes sure that if the network
returns before the cache,

12
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:47,210
the cache doesn't clobber
the network data.

13
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:52,990
When you've completed this step,
your app should now work offline.

14
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:56,040
Try loading the app then
turn off your network and

15
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,460
your web server to see if it does.

16
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:02,690
You can compare your app to the link
in the instructor notes below

17
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:05,420
to make sure it works exactly the same.

18
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:09,190
And don't forget to try your
app in multiple browsers.

19
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:10,870
How does it work in Firefox?

20
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:11,520
Safari?

21
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,940
Etc.

22
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:16,780
If you try and load this in a browser
that doesn't support service workers,

23
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:20,970
it may not work offline, but
it should work just fine when online.
