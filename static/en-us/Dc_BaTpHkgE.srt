00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:04,400
When you're starting your company,
you have a tiny stash of cash.

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,810
You might be finding it yourself or
raising it from friends and

00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:12,450

00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,350

You need to promote your product,
acquire users, and then charge money.

00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:35,670
