1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,110
Now, this plot might have been a little bit tricky,

2
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:04,750
so let's walk through it together. I'll assign age to the

3
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:08,540
X parameter, and then I'll assign females divided by males, to

4
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:11,820
the Y parameter. This will give me my ratio. And then

5
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,320
I just need to make sure that I pass my

6
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,400
newest data frame to data. We'll add a geome line to

7
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,590
connect the points, and then we'll also add a horizontal line.

8
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:25,460
This geom_hline will take a couple parameters. We'll set the y-intercept

9
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:28,420
to one, the alpha equal to 0.3, and the

10
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:31,970
line type equal to two. Running this code, we get

11
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:34,890
out ratio plot. We can easily see that for very

12
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:38,110
young users, the median female user has over two and

13
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:40,510
a half times as many friends as the median male

14
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:44,100
user Clearly it was helpful to condition on age, and

15
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:48,100
understanding the relationship of gender with friend count. This helped

16
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:50,620
assure us this pattern is robust for users of many

17
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:53,100
different ages. And it also highlighted where this

18
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,910
difference is most striking. Now, there are many

19
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:58,970
processes that can produce this difference, including the

20
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:01,410
biased distribution from which this pseudo Facebook data

21
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:04,560
was generated. One idea which shows the complexity

22
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:07,000
of interpretation here, is that people from particular

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,200
countries who more recently joined Facebook are more

24
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,390
likely to be male with lower friend counts.
