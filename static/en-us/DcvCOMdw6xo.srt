1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,840
Well, here we are in my example of a

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:08,160
confusing signifier. It's this door plate thing. Well, actually, I'm

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,380
not sure what to call it because this is a

4
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:14,910
door handle and this, I thought, was something I could

5
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:17,070
push on to open the door, and I can't open

6
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:18,990
it. No matter how hard I push it, I can't,

7
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:22,210
well, it turns out, it's not a door. This is

8
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:25,620
a wall. A glass wall. And they put this plate

9
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:27,400
here and I thought I could push on

10
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:30,940
it and I can't, so that's a confusing signifier.

11
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:36,440
Now let's look at that for a second. Why is it so? Well, it seems that there's

12
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:40,770
a lock mechanism here and the lock mechanism,

13
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:44,900
see inside, is about this big. Well, I think

14
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:48,180
the designer wanted to have some symmetry so they

15
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,660
made these two plates the same size, but in

16
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:53,280
so doing so, they have kind of an aesthetic

17
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,210
form there, but they've created a function or a

18
00:00:56,210 --> 00:01:00,580
false signifier that is confusing. So, how might we

19
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:04,390
make this better? Well, let's see. Let's assume we

20
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:07,660
want to hide the lock. Maybe we just want

21
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:09,950
to make this smaller and keep the symmetry here.

22
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:13,260
So we might make a plate this big. That

23
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:15,730
would be really too small to put my whole hand

24
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:19,610
on it. I don't think I would confuse that for a plate. Or, if

25
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:23,190
I just wanted to hide the lock, maybe I could make something really small, like

26
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:28,040
that. Either way, it would be a little bit better, because I feel like if

27
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:31,900
I push this too hard, I might actually do some damage to this glass wall.
