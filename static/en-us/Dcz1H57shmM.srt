1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,550
As almost always with vertex cover, there is a number of possible solutions here,

2
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:07,480
but the minimum vertex cover will always be of size 4.

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:09,660
I'm going to give you the solution that I found.

4
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:16,250
I could for example put this vertex here into the vertex cover. This one, this one, and this one.

5
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:20,830
Then I have these edges covered by this vertex here.

6
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:27,310
I have these edges covered by that vertex, and this vertex here covers these 2.

7
00:00:27,310 --> 99:59:59,999
This vertex here covers the rest.
