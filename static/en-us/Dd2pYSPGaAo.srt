00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
We studied the special case of a fair coin, p=0.5,

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
and now I want to do the same thing for our arbitrary p.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
It turns out that the real challenge is not to compute the confidence interval.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
The real challenge is to compute the variance of a coin flip where the outcome is p.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:29,000
In particular, let's do a quick check. Suppose p=0, what do you think the variance should be?

6
00:00:29,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Do this by thinking principally not by trying to solve complex mathematical equations.
