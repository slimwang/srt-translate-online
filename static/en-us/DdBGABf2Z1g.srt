00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,166
Welcome back. Up to this point, we've really only been working with one

2
00:00:04,166 --> 00:00:08,910
variable. Analyzing the mean and the standard deviation, and seeing where a

3
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:13,786
sample mean falls on this distribution. And if that's typical, or not so

4
00:00:13,786 --> 00:00:19,379
typical. But now we're going to focus on two variables. With two variables, we

5
00:00:19,379 --> 00:00:23,615
have a different design. This means we need to change how we collect our data,

6
00:00:23,615 --> 00:00:28,953
how we visualize our data. However, our analysis is going to be pretty similar,

7
00:00:28,953 --> 00:00:33,454
and you'll see later. Now that we're starting to discuss two variables instead

8
00:00:33,454 --> 00:00:36,846
of just one, lets start by thinking about two variables that might be related

9
00:00:36,846 --> 00:00:42,660
to each other. For example height and weight. People who are taller usually

10
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:48,052
weigh more. Or maybe time spent studying and your grade. May be the more time

11
00:00:48,052 --> 00:00:52,231
you spent studying the better your grade will be. Heres the weird one. The

12
00:00:52,231 --> 00:00:56,889
outdoor temperature and angle injuries. I read this article the other day, that

13
00:00:56,889 --> 00:01:00,610
said that the warmer weather causes the people to wear more flip flops and

14
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:06,486
sandals that make your ankles more prone to injuries. Do you have any other

15
00:01:06,486 --> 00:01:10,620
ideas? Post about it in the forums, and maybe include some information that you

16
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:13,370
found that shows this relationship.
