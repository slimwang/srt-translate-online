00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:04,560
As we discussed earlier,
a string is a sequence of characters.

2
00:00:04,559 --> 00:00:08,199
By now, you seen a few strings and
other parts of this curriculum.

3
00:00:08,199 --> 00:00:11,509
You seen them passes arguments
to print statements and

4
00:00:11,509 --> 00:00:15,009
you seen them to find as variables and
also constants.

5
00:00:15,009 --> 00:00:17,530
Now, we're going to dive deeper into
how strings are implemented and

6
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:18,469
how they're used.

7
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:21,140
Let's start with initialization.

8
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:22,560
Click Next to continue forward.

9
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:27,100
We often initialize strings
using string literals,

10
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:31,020
which are a series of characters
between double quotation marks.

11
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:34,509
Here we've defined a string
constant by using the word let,

12
00:00:34,509 --> 00:00:39,509
and then the consonants name, which is
theTruth followed by a string literal.

13
00:00:40,509 --> 00:00:43,679
Now technically, a string doesn't
have to have any characters.

14
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:46,929
You can also initialize
an empty string like this.

15
00:00:46,929 --> 00:00:50,530
Or you could use string followed
by an empty set of parenthesis and

16
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:53,030
it'll also create an empty string.

17
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:54,899
Are you following along
in the playground?

18
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:56,513
It's time to click Next and move on.

19
00:00:56,514 --> 00:00:58,789
