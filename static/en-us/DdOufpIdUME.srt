00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,740
If you said addChildEventListener,
you'd be correct.

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:05,970
We've got a list of shopping lists.

3
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:10,310
Each of these single shopping lists
is a child of this root node here.

4
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:12,210
If we attach a listener here.

5
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:14,300
Using addChildEventListener,

6
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:17,730
we will get notified when
anything happens to the children.

7
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:19,590
And unlike the value of EventListeners,

8
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:22,060
instead of getting all of
this data returned to us,

9
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:27,050
we'll get data specific to the child
that was changed or removed or added.

10
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:29,240
Because of that,
addChildEventListener is the way to go.
