1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
What more do we know about K?

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Here's our Lorenz machine, and we have the K wheels.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
That's what produces K, and each of these wheels might be a different size.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
The first one has 41 positions that are all set to either 0s or 1s.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
The second one has 31.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,000
If we're looking at ΔZ for two channels--remember what we were producing here,

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:34,000
looking at the XOR of ΔZ from channel 0 XORed with ΔZ from channel 1.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Let's focus just on these two channels--the outputs.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
The question is how many different configurations are there

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
for the first two K wheels, the ones for channel 0 and channel 1.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 99:59:59,999
The numbers here are the size of those wheels.
