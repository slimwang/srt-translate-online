1
00:00:00,423 --> 00:00:03,107
So in the full dataset there were 23 launches

2
00:00:03,213 --> 00:00:05,098
and many of which had no failures.

3
00:00:05,575 --> 00:00:08,121
The sum of Xi was 1,600,

4
00:00:08,444 --> 00:00:10,928
sum of Yi is 9 as before.

5
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:15,043
The Xi square is 112,400

6
00:00:15,704 --> 00:00:17,912
and the crossover here is 574.

7
00:00:18,219 --> 00:00:20,042
Now this is all extracted from the data,

8
00:00:20,303 --> 00:00:21,649
we have done it before,

9
00:00:21,941 --> 00:00:23,823
and now please calculate for me b.

10
00:00:24,394 --> 00:00:25,970
So this is some work

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,208
but please calculate for me b again

12
00:00:28,255 --> 00:00:29,708
and here is the formula

13
00:00:29,923 --> 00:00:30,353
as before.
