1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:07,726
So I see that one layer is sort of computing the the individual.

2
00:00:07,726 --> 00:00:08,611
>> Tweet.

3
00:00:08,611 --> 00:00:10,800
>> Tweet value on a, on a particular dimension.

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,210
>> Mm-hm. >> Panic dimension or misinformation dimension.

5
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:14,920
>> I mean they, they may not be compared this way.

6
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:15,640
>> Yeah. >> I mean, I inc,

7
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:18,072
this kind of gives me a model design, that's all it is.

8
00:00:18,072 --> 00:00:20,478
[LAUGH] Yeah. >> In, in this, in this sample topology, and

9
00:00:20,478 --> 00:00:23,290
then the second one sort of aggregates them for each tweet.

10
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:26,100
>> Mm-hm. >> And then the third one computes some statistic.

11
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:28,090
>> Oral statistics, globally.

12
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:31,995
>> Is this a, a reasonable way to approach topography design or-

13
00:00:31,995 --> 00:00:33,812
>> Yeah, yeah this is a way to reasonable to,

14
00:00:33,812 --> 00:00:36,230
I mean this is a reasonable way to approach topography.

15
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:40,885
I mean typically people, the way you do is like, you kind of split the work.

16
00:00:40,885 --> 00:00:41,730
>> Mm-hm.

17
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:45,980
>> And do some local, what do you call simple first stage filtering,

18
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:49,935
like more local joining or whatever it is.

19
00:00:49,935 --> 00:00:50,550
>> Mm-hm.

20
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,503
>> Then finally, you can find like so

21
00:00:52,503 --> 00:00:55,281
that is typically, this is the final application, right?

22
00:00:55,281 --> 00:00:59,232
Like, that is, typically all the [INAUDIBLE] tend to do.

23
00:00:59,232 --> 00:01:04,123
Mostly like sometimes, like, [INAUDIBLE] happens at this stage, then followed by

24
00:01:04,123 --> 00:01:07,825
some kind of counting happens, partially counts happen this stage,

25
00:01:07,825 --> 00:01:11,929
then the global aggregations, analytics, happen at third stage, right?

26
00:01:11,929 --> 00:01:18,019
>> Right. >> So, yeah, so that is a typical, design of a [INAUDIBLE]
