00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,973
Now that we've sorted out the different definitions for each type of

2
00:00:02,973 --> 00:00:06,634
intelligence. I want you to try to match different professions that would

3
00:00:06,634 --> 00:00:10,980
really benefit from somebody who's highly intelligent in one of these areas.

4
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:15,772
Here's a list of professions. Athlete, dancer, mechanic carpenter, navigator,

5
00:00:15,772 --> 00:00:21,400
pilot, architect, sculptor, botanist, ecologist, biologist, psychologist,

6
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:27,988
politicians, writers. People who live contemplative lives such as rabbis,

7
00:00:27,988 --> 00:00:36,064
priest or monks or musicians, song writers and dancers. Scientists, engineers,

8
00:00:36,064 --> 00:00:42,388
accountants. Poets, writers, lawyers, politician and speech writers. Match each

9
00:00:42,388 --> 00:00:46,418
type of intelligence with a group of professions that you think would benefit

10
00:00:46,418 --> 00:00:52,262
most from being highly intelligent in this area. Now I know some of them come

11
00:00:52,262 --> 00:00:56,575
up twice so, for example dancer comes up twice here. But, look at the ones

12
00:00:56,575 --> 00:01:00,930
around it. And taken as a group, what type of intelligence do you think would

13
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:02,159
be best?
