00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:02,930
Here are two word clouds of traits that you and your fellow

2
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:06,760
students submitted as either better or worse. Now, I want you to

3
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:09,640
take a moment to look at both word clouds and see if

4
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:13,700
you find any traits that you disagree with being in that category.

5
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:17,039
>> The idea that some traits are good or bad

6
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,010
is really subjective and can be very sensitive for some

7
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:23,440
people if they have a trait that others consider bad.

8
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,340
So I want you to be respectful as we go through

9
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:28,440
our course and hear from different people with many different kinds of

10
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:32,000
traits and remember to show that same respect to your fellow classmates.
