The inverse of f of x equals log base 2 of x is f inverse of x equals 2 to the

00:00:04,808 --> 00:00:10,085
x. The base of the logarithmic function becomes the base of the exponential

00:00:10,085 --> 00:00:15,370
one. If we have f of x equals log based 10 of x, then that means that f inverse

00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:20,579
of x equals 10 to the x. Again, they have the same base.
