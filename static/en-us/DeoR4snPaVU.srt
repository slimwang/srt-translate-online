1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,310
Here we have an example.

2
00:00:01,310 --> 00:00:03,530
And, what the robot is
actually going to do,

3
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:05,939
is it's going to follow
this purple line.

4
00:00:05,939 --> 00:00:07,850
Okay?
So this is where it starts and

5
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:10,150
then it goes here, and
it moves that way.

6
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:12,890
What we're showing you to begin
with is a couple of things.

7
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:15,620
First of all,
you see all those red dots?

8
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:17,640
That's its current set of particles.

9
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:20,500
In other words,
it has no idea where it actually is.

10
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:26,310
The green is an example of
where it thinks it might be,

11
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:29,920
in fact,
this is the locally most likely.

12
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,020
Which is just some way of
the robot guessing where it is.

13
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:36,410
Now, what I'm not showing
on this map is the, for

14
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:38,760
each particle there's also a theta,
right?

15
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,890
Particles have to represent the state.

16
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:41,586
What do we say our state was?

17
00:00:41,586 --> 00:00:43,698
We said it was x, y, and theta.

18
00:00:43,698 --> 00:00:47,118
It's hard to show this in three, so
I'm only showing x and y, all right?

19
00:00:47,118 --> 00:00:49,982
But, for
any given theta that I think it is,

20
00:00:49,982 --> 00:00:54,090
then I would be sending out
a ray of sensor measurements.

21
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:57,920
And I think I know where
it should hit because why?

22
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,110
Because I have a complete map.

23
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:01,110
Okay?

24
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:04,239
So what happens is,
first, you're going to,

25
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:08,130
your eye's just going to
naturally go to the green thing.

26
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:10,930
What's going on there is
that's the set of sensor

27
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:12,670
measurements that it's getting.

28
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:15,130
Though, so wherever,
wherever it thinks it is,

29
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:17,230
it puts down the measurements
it actually got.

30
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:20,840
Now, if it's in the right place,
those measurements will actually,

31
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:24,180
most of the time,
hit the wall at the right distance.

32
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:26,908
Every now and then it'll go right
through the wall because it was a no

33
00:01:26,908 --> 00:01:28,860
return, all right?

34
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:29,990
So let me just put it in motion.

35
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:31,200
It's easier to, to understand.

36
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,360
All right, so here we go,
so it's a movie.

37
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,380
So each one of these changes,

38
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:39,630
is when it thinks it is when
it takes a measurement.

39
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:42,540
And you'll notice,
there's a clump of particles here, in

40
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:47,000
fact that's the most likely clump, and
there's also a clump of particles there.

41
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,500
That's a nice way of saying
the robot does not know

42
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:53,810
whether it's definitely here or
definitely there.

43
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:57,990
And the reason for that is
the hallway's kind of symmetric, right?

44
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:01,477
There are these doors, okay, but
there's doors on both sides.

45
00:02:01,477 --> 00:02:04,478
So it hasn't, yet
been able to disambiguate.

46
00:02:04,478 --> 00:02:08,094
If this is the center of my universe,
whether it's at this area or that area.

47
00:02:08,094 --> 00:02:10,530
But let me put it back in motion.

48
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:13,910
What's going to happen is the robot's
going to go inside, in the room.

49
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:16,490
And you'll notice in this room,
in the room it's about to go into,

50
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:20,100
there's a ottoman or whatever that is in
the middle that's not in the other room.

51
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,500
So when it, once it goes in, yep.

52
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:23,330
There it goes.

53
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:24,190
Okay?

54
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:27,470
You'll notice the particles
that are in the wrong place,

55
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:29,210
they're going to disappear.

56
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:29,840
Okay.

57
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,070
Now some of the rays are still going in
the wrong direction because, they're,

58
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:36,860
they're going through the walls,
but that's just the no return.

59
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:40,370
And you'll notice that, by the time
we get to the end of the run,

60
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:44,920
you'll notice that it has
localized itself very well.

61
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:47,860
Some of the measurements still
go through the walls because

62
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:49,780
I'm assuming those were no returns.

63
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:53,900
But, just by taking these simple
one-dimensional measurements,

64
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:56,590
several of them at a time,
and knowing the map and

65
00:02:56,590 --> 00:03:01,040
taking its movements, it's able
to localize exactly where it is.

66
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,410
And that's sort of a hallmark
of particle filtering.

67
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:06,830
You start off with a big unknown set,
and

68
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:10,130
eventually a whole bunch of
particles go away because

69
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:13,160
they're just totally inconsistent
with the measurements you get.

70
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:16,330
So when they get multiplied
by p of z given x,

71
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:21,680
the likelihood of that measurement is so
small that it diminishes that

72
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:26,030
particles weight a lot, and the next
time you sample, let me say this again,

73
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:29,450
remember very low weight particles
sometimes don't get sampled at all.

74
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:34,200
So what happens is only the samples
that are near the parts of the sensor

75
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:38,390
measurements that are consistent
survive and you ke, you keep iterating.

76
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:41,430
Also remember we had the two lumps for

77
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:44,190
awhile there because it wasn't sure
whether it was this one or that one.

78
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:46,990
Because it didn't have enough
information to know yet.

79
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:51,120
It wasn't until it went inside that
room that it had that information.

80
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,960
And this is sort of the inherent
advantage of particle filtering over

81
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:57,780
say, a Kalman filter that
has a single hypothesis.

82
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:00,900
For those of you who have maybe heard
of multi-hypothesis tracking where you,

83
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,200
where you end up having
multiple hypothesis.

84
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,460
One way of thinking
a particle filter is, is,

85
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:09,970
it gives me just a uniform and easy way
of doing multiple hypothesis tracking.
