1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,838
What does this mean? Depending on our criteria for what constitutes likely or

2
00:00:04,838 --> 00:00:09,311
unlikely if we get a sample mean in the critical region here for a one-tailed

3
00:00:09,311 --> 00:00:15,976
test or here or here for a two-tailed test. Then we decide that most likely we

4
00:00:15,976 --> 00:00:20,520
did not get this sample mean by chance. Note that in the case of a two-tailed

5
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:24,744
test. The z-critical values are the same used to calculate confidence

6
00:00:24,744 --> 00:00:30,410
intervals, Here, you're just applying the same ideals to different situations.

7
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:34,180
When we do statistical test, we'll set our own criteria for making a decision,

8
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:39,121
in other words, we'll choose an alpha level. And then we'll decide that if the

9
00:00:39,121 --> 00:00:42,593
probability of obtaining a particular sample mean is less than that alpha

10
00:00:42,593 --> 00:00:47,680
level, Then there's evidence of an effect. Usually we're going to stick with an

11
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:52,450
alpha level of point zero five. At an alpha level of point zero five we have

12
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:57,774
two possible outcomes in either situation, one tailed or two tailed. Either the

13
00:00:57,774 --> 00:01:03,500
sample mean will lie outside of the critical or inside the critical region. We

14
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:08,861
notate these two outcomes as the null hypothesis. Which we call h not or h sub

15
00:01:08,861 --> 00:01:15,780
zero and the alternative hypothesis h sub a. Other ways of notating this could

16
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:20,297
be h sub one but I'll just stick with h sub a for alternative. The null

17
00:01:20,297 --> 00:01:23,816
hypothesis assumes that there is not significant difference between the current

18
00:01:23,816 --> 00:01:28,446
population parameters. And what will be the new population parameters after

19
00:01:28,446 --> 00:01:33,500
some sort of intervention. So we'll notate it like current population parameter

20
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:38,120
mu is equal to the population parameters after the intervention, where when we

21
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:42,740
say equal, we don't mean exactly equal, we just mean they're not significantly

22
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:49,100
different. The alternative hypothesis guesses that there will be a significant

23
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:54,654
difference. Either the current population mean will be less than that after the

24
00:01:54,654 --> 00:02:00,290
intervention, or the current population mean will be greater. Or that it'll

25
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:04,310
just be different, and we don't predict a direction of the treatment. For the

26
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:08,270
null hypothesis, when we're guessing that there's no significant difference

27
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:12,110
between these two parameters Our sample mean will lie somewhere outside the

28
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:17,946
critical region, in this white space. Note, also, that for a 1-tailed test the

29
00:02:17,946 --> 00:02:22,756
critical region could be on the left tail, not just the right. And the

30
00:02:22,756 --> 00:02:26,620
alternative hypothesis guesses that there is a significant difference, and that

31
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:31,223
means that our sample mean will lie somewhere in the critical region.
