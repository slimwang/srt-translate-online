00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,480
First, let's look at conceptual integrity, which I mentioned earlier in today's

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:09,650
lesson. Let me give you two historical quotes that, that give an idea of what

3
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:14,190
conceptual integrity is all about. The first is from the philosopher Descartes.

4
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:19,350
He said of these thoughts on the very first that occurred to me was, that there

5
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:23,850
is seldom so much perfection in works composed of many separate parts,.

6
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:26,630
Upon which different hands had been employed,

7
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:32,820
as in those completed by a single master. More recently, Fred Brooks, in,

8
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:37,780
The Mythical Man-Month, has said much the same thing. I will contend that

9
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:42,550
conceptual integrity is the most important consideration in system design.

10
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:46,810
It is better to have a system omit. Certain anomalous features and

11
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:51,390
improvements, but to reflect one set of design ideas, then to have one that

12
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:56,930
contains many independent, and uncoordinated ideas. A couple of related concepts

13
00:00:56,930 --> 00:01:02,090
are coupling and cohesion. These originally came out of structure design, but

14
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:06,120
they also apply to object orientated design, and other design approaches.

15
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:10,100
Assuming you've carved your system into separate components, those components

16
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:15,630
may be coupled to each other. Coupling is the extent to which two components

17
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:20,110
depend on each other for successful execution. If you think about it for

18
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:26,020
a minute low coupling is good. After you've delivered your system,

19
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:30,330
and you have to maintain it. If you have a highly coupled system, and

20
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:33,890
you change one module, that means that you're likely to have to change other

21
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:38,450
modules. Whereas if there's low coupling, that likelihood goes down.

22
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:45,760
A related concept is cohesion. With cohesion we're talking about

23
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:50,340
a single module, and cohesion is the extent to which that module, or

24
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:54,760
component has a single purpose or function. High cohesion is good.

25
00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:00,150
For example highly cohesive modules are much more easy to reuse.

26
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:05,310
They have a single purpose. You need to reuse them to accomplish that purpose.
