1
00:00:00,302 --> 00:00:01,730
All right, so
let's start off by taking a look

2
00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:03,660
at the Gist I've provided for you.

3
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:07,980
So here we see it contains an XML for
the list item layout.

4
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:11,800
So inside it, there's a vertical in
your layout with two texts used.

5
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:15,440
So one for the pet name and
then one for the pet summary.

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,180
So in our case right now, the pet
summary will just include the pet breed.

7
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:19,800
But in the future,

8
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,160
you could always modify the summary
to include other pet attributes.

9
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,040
Now down below,
I also included some starter code for

10
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:27,790
the pet cursor adapter class.

11
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:31,990
So this class extends from the cursor
adapter class, and inside it,

12
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:33,240
contains a constructor.

13
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:38,410
And I also left some to do's for
the new view and bind view methods.

14
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:41,470
So let's start off by copying
over the list item xml layout.

15
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:51,633
So here in Android Studio, in my
RES folder inside my layout folder,

16
00:00:51,633 --> 00:00:53,926
I'm going to create a new RES file.

17
00:00:53,926 --> 00:00:55,879
I'm going to call it list_item.

18
00:00:55,879 --> 00:01:01,480
[BLANK_AUDIO]

19
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:05,250
So in this new file, I'm going to paste
over the code that I just copied.

20
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,250
So there we go.

21
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:11,770
Our list item layout is all set up.

22
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:14,600
And next, let's copy over the code for
our pet cursor adaptor.

23
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,788
So from the Gist, copy over this code.

24
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:24,684
[BLANK_AUDIO]

25
00:01:24,684 --> 00:01:26,000
Now back in our project.

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,701
Inside my Java folder,
inside my .Android.pets folder,

27
00:01:30,701 --> 00:01:35,416
I'm going to create a new Java
file called PetCursor adapter.

28
00:01:35,416 --> 00:01:42,764
[BLANK_AUDIO]

29
00:01:42,764 --> 00:01:45,000
And then inside that,
I will paste the code I just copied.

30
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:50,345
Now inside the cursor adapter class,

31
00:01:50,345 --> 00:01:54,310
I'll need to finish implementing
the new view and bind view methods.

32
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:59,030
So within new view, all I need to do
here is inflate the list item layout.

33
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:01,710
But normally I don't usually
remember the syntax for doing so

34
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:03,090
right off the top of my head.

35
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:06,170
So in any case I'll just copy over the
code from the tutorial that we looked at

36
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:07,750
earlier, so
let's go back to that tutorial.

37
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:14,620
So here in the tutorial in
the defining the adapter section,

38
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:18,730
I want the syntax for inflating
a layout, and that happens right here.

39
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:23,900
So let's copy this line, head back to
Android studio and paste it in here.

40
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:28,600
Now all we need to do
is modify the code, so

41
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,760
the reference is our list item
layout instead of this item to do.

42
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:34,030
Let's delete this.

43
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:36,912
[BLANK_AUDIO]

44
00:02:36,912 --> 00:02:40,828
Also if you get an error from Android
Studio about this layoutinflater class,

45
00:02:40,828 --> 00:02:43,480
it's because it hasn't
been imported yet.

46
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:47,850
So the shortcut to do it on the Mac
is Alt+Enter, and that's shown here.

47
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:50,370
So whatever it is on the device
you're working on, go ahead and

48
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:50,960
use that shortcut.

49
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:56,392
Now the next to do left in
here is the bindView method.

50
00:02:56,392 --> 00:02:58,540
So bindView is a little
bit more complicated but

51
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:01,620
it's using all the same methods that
I used to populate the text view.

52
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:03,530
So let me go ahead and
write out this text first and

53
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:06,470
then I'll walk you through
the code needed for bindView.

54
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:08,420
So bindView requires these four steps.

55
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:11,920
First, I'll get the two
textViews using their IDs.

56
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,730
And the IDs are the ones I got from
the list item view that I passed in.

57
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:18,699
Next, I need the pet data from
the current row in the cursor.

58
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:22,950
And I want to make sure that I
have the correct column index, so

59
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:28,000
I get the column index for the name
column and then for the breed column.

60
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,530
After that, I can read out the values
at those specific column indices.

61
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:35,320
And lastly using the text
views setText method.

62
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:38,476
I can update the text for
the pet name and the pet breed.

63
00:03:38,476 --> 00:03:41,860
So with those todo's complete,
the pet cursor adapter is complete.

64
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:46,030
Now we need to move on to the catalog
activity to hook everything up.

65
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:49,660
But first let me start out
by replacing the text view

66
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:51,140
in our catalog activity layout.

67
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:52,780
So this one here.

68
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:57,260
With a list view instead of a text view.

69
00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:00,530
So this list view will take up the full
width and height of the screen.

70
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:03,920
So here in the catalog activity,
I removed the text view and replaced

71
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,690
it with this list view here that has
the layout width of match parent and

72
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:09,010
a layout height of match parent.

73
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:10,820
So it fills up the whole screen.

74
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:13,560
Next we need to make some modifications
to the CatalogActivity class.

75
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:18,640
So in this class, I want to modify
the display database info method,

76
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:24,590
this method here, to use list view in
pet cursor adapter we just created.

77
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:27,690
So, that means I can delete anything
that references the text view or

78
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:30,640
anything related to formatting
the result from the cursor

79
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,210
into the text view.

80
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:35,150
But remember, we want to leave
the code that fetches the cursor

81
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:38,110
from the provider because
we'll need that cursor still.

82
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:39,820
So this information here.

83
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:41,177
So let me go ahead and set that up.

84
00:04:41,177 --> 00:04:51,177
[BLANK_AUDIO]

85
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:08,120
All right so there we go,

86
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:11,175
I stopped all the code from using
a text view to using a list view.

87
00:05:12,205 --> 00:05:16,059
In order to set up the list view,
I needed to get a reference to the list

88
00:05:16,059 --> 00:05:20,860
view using the ID that I've defined
in the CatalogActivity.xml file.

89
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:25,945
So, this id here refers to this list.

90
00:05:25,945 --> 00:05:30,914
And then, I created a new
PetCursorAdaptor instance as adaptor

91
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:35,983
here, passing in the context this and
the cursor of the pet data.

92
00:05:35,983 --> 00:05:38,872
And then finally I
associate the list view and

93
00:05:38,872 --> 00:05:42,072
the cursor adapter using
the set adapter method.

94
00:05:42,072 --> 00:05:44,110
So that completes all the changes for
this quiz.
