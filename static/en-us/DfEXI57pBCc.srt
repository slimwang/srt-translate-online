>> You might be wondering, why should we even learn elimination to begin with?

2
00:00:04,035 --> 00:00:08,170
Well, would substitution really work here? Would it be a good choice? Well, I

3
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:12,418
could take this first equation and try and solve it for either x or y. Remember,

4
00:00:12,418 --> 00:00:16,450
for substitution we're trying to get one of the variables alone on one side of

5
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:20,821
the equation. I'm going to solve this equation for x. I subtract 3y from both

6
00:00:20,821 --> 00:00:25,009
sides to get 2x is equal to negative 3y minus 15. I just list these terms,

7
00:00:25,009 --> 00:00:29,199
because they're not like. Then we divide both sides by 2, so x is equal to

8
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:33,493
negative 3 halves y minus 15 halves. Notice that this equation is a little

9
00:00:33,493 --> 00:00:38,020
complicated. We have two negative signs, and we also have fractions. So when

10
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:42,790
we're working with substitution, this could make our work more difficult. Keep

11
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:48,445
in mind though, that when we perform substitution, we don't have to just solve

12
00:00:48,445 --> 00:00:53,787
for x. We could have solved this equation for y. I could subtract 2x from both

13
00:00:53,787 --> 00:00:59,095
sides, to get 3y equals negative 2x plus 15. Then I would divide each term by 3.

14
00:00:59,095 --> 00:01:03,178
So, 1y would equal negative 2 3rds x plus 5. If I wanted to use this for

15
00:01:03,178 --> 00:01:07,538
substitution, it's still pretty complicated. We have a fraction and we have a

16
00:01:07,538 --> 00:01:12,049
negative sign. So let's try instead using elimination. When solving this system

17
00:01:12,049 --> 00:01:16,045
using elimination, I'm going to try and eliminate these x variables. I could

18
00:01:16,045 --> 00:01:20,279
choose to try and eliminate the y variables. It doesn't actually matter. I'm

19
00:01:20,279 --> 00:01:25,090
going to multiply this first equation by 5. So I get 5 times 2x, which is 10x, 5

20
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:30,039
times 3y, which is 15y, and 5 times negative 15, which is negative 75. I

21
00:01:30,039 --> 00:01:35,329
multiply this equation by 5, so that way I could get a 10x here. So what number

22
00:01:35,329 --> 00:01:40,226
should we multiply this 5x by, so that way we get a number here that would

23
00:01:40,226 --> 00:01:44,190
eliminate with the 10x? Take some time to think about it.
