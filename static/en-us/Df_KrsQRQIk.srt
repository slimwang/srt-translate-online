I'd like to say a few words on the issue of correspondence,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
often also called data association.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Supposing we have two camera images, as shown over here,

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and we seen an interesting point P in the left image.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
The question is where do you search in the right image?

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Everywhere? Along a line? Or can you already predict the point?

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
So where do you search in the right image?

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Everywhere would be in 2D--the entire image.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Along a line would be 1D, and a fixed point would be 0D.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Please check the appropriate box.
