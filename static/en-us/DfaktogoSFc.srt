1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:01,470
All right, so we've said before, so

2
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:04,939
far our main ideas are, we're going to
use those rectangles as features.

3
00:00:04,939 --> 00:00:07,810
And it's really easy to compute them
because or the integral image, and

4
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:10,840
then we're going to use that
discriminative ones as the weak learner,

5
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:12,280
the weak classifiers.

6
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:16,860
All right, well we're using this with
a within a boosted framework so not

7
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:20,920
surprise you that we're going to combine
them to make our final classifier,

8
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,770
that's what boosting does.

9
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:24,490
But the other idea they had,

10
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:27,655
was to form this thing called
a cascade of classifiers.

11
00:00:27,655 --> 00:00:31,145
And it's such an important idea that
I made it in italics, yellow, and

12
00:00:31,145 --> 00:00:32,925
red, okay?

13
00:00:32,925 --> 00:00:36,125
We're going to form a cascade
of these classifiers, and

14
00:00:36,125 --> 00:00:39,625
we're going to reject
clear negatives quickly.

15
00:00:39,625 --> 00:00:42,405
What's this all about, all right?

16
00:00:42,405 --> 00:00:45,975
So the second big idea of this paper,
besides the integral image one,

17
00:00:45,975 --> 00:00:46,905
was the cascade.

18
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,530
And here's the issue.

19
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:52,210
Even if our filters are really
fast to compute, so

20
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:56,840
even if we can get these you know,
compute these rectangles on a new thing

21
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:01,570
very quickly there's an awful
lot of places to go search.

22
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:05,000
How can we make the detection
more efficient?

23
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,950
And this was the insight.

24
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:10,650
Almost everywhere in
a picture is not a face.

25
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:12,000
I don't care what the picture is.

26
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,740
You know, unless you happen to
be looking at the, you know,

27
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:20,940
the 1972 New York Yankees like this,
you know, we got, you know, 75 faces.

28
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:24,049
But even then,
most of the locations are not a face,

29
00:01:24,049 --> 00:01:28,150
there's only 75 locations that
are a face, and all the other locations,

30
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:31,700
remember Kristen's little,
those are not faces.

31
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:33,910
So, what you'd like to be able to do,

32
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:38,360
is quickly know that
something is not a face.

33
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,070
Right?
So you can move on.

34
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:42,700
And, if I say that
something's not a face,

35
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:46,720
I want to be sure that it's not a face,
so I can move on.

36
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,755
So what they built was
a cascaded set of filters.

37
00:01:50,755 --> 00:01:54,110
Okay, so at each level, there's
going to be a boosted filter, but

38
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:56,710
here's what they did, all right?

39
00:01:56,710 --> 00:02:01,210
So, you have a whole bunch of,
of images, windows, scales,

40
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:03,280
et cetera, whatever.

41
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,938
You train a classifier,
it's called stage 1.

42
00:02:05,938 --> 00:02:08,532
All right?

43
00:02:08,532 --> 00:02:15,620
And Whatever it says is not a face,
you're sure that it's not a face.

44
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:18,630
So when you adjust your classifier,
you adjust it so

45
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:21,550
that it has no, what are called,
false negatives.

46
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:24,150
Everything it says is not
a face is really not a face.

47
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:27,261
Everything that you say is a face,

48
00:02:27,261 --> 00:02:30,230
you're going to put into
another classifier.

49
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:33,740
So you're going to train
a second stage classifier, and

50
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:36,920
what it's going to do is,
remember this is on training data so

51
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:41,480
it's labelled, you're going to give
it a whole bunch of positive faces.

52
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:44,090
But what negatives
are you going to give it?

53
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:47,190
The negatives you're going
to give it are the false

54
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:49,430
positives from the last stage.

55
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:53,850
So stage 1, remember, we set it so that
everything it says is not a face isn't,

56
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:56,120
but it says a whole bunch
of things are a face.

57
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,780
Some of those are wrong.

58
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,740
Those are false positives.

59
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:06,430
So use those negatives, plus real
positives, to train the next classifier.

60
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:11,390
And we do that again, and
what that gives you is a cascaded set of

61
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:16,600
filters where when you apply this in
testing data, you have to make it

62
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:21,810
through all the filters, all the stages,
in order to be labeled as a face.

63
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:24,820
But to be rejected,
you can be rejected quickly.

64
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,580
Its just like dating in college, right?

65
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:30,260
You can get rejected quickly, but it
takes you a long time to get accepted.

66
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:30,920
All right.

67
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:35,643
Just as a quick summary, we have a whole
bunch of images, faces and non-faces,

68
00:03:35,643 --> 00:03:38,353
we're going to train
a cascade of classifiers,

69
00:03:38,353 --> 00:03:42,889
they used AdaBoost, all right, which
is a particular boosting algorithm.

70
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:46,507
And we're going to select out features
and thresholds and weights, which is do,

71
00:03:46,507 --> 00:03:47,756
you have to do in AdaBoost.

72
00:03:47,756 --> 00:03:50,749
And then, what you're going to do,
is for some image,

73
00:03:50,749 --> 00:03:53,160
you're going to apply it to the window.

74
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,930
That's where the face really is.

75
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:59,130
We clicked the window,
we slide it around, and there it is.

76
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:00,760
And it finds the right face.
