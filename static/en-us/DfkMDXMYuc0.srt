1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The first thing that we need to deal in this problem is the issue of the mosquito nets.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Well we know that at first there are no mosquito nets in place at all,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
so we're going to create this variable called net factor and initialize it to 1.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
We know that after 100 days, net factor is reduced by bite reduction by net,

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
this constant that we created up here.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
We add in this if statement right here saying that after 100 days,

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
net factor is reduced by 0.9 which is bite reduction by net.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Remember that this is basically the probability that a person is going to be bitten.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
It makes sense that if you add in the mosquito net, the probability of you being bitten will go down.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Now for implementing the forward Euler method with the infected population,

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
both human and mosquito.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
For the number of infected humans at the next time step,

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
we of course, need to start with the number of infected humans at the previous step.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
To this, we're going to add on the number of people

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
that are being added to the infected population.

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
We are going to subtract the number of people that are moving out

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
of the infected into the susceptible population.

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Let's first think about the term that's being added to the number of infected humans.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
We take the probability of a person being bitten which is in that factor

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
times the number of bites per day and per mosquito that a person gets

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
also multiply that by the number of infected mosquitoes

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
and then we multiply this by the fraction of the total human population that is still susceptible

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,000
also multiply this by the probability of a mosquito transmitting malaria to a human.

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
On the other side of the coin, we have factors that move people away

25
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
from the infected population and back into a susceptible population.

26
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
This is a very simple term.

27
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
We simply take the number of people that were infected at the previous time step

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
and divide this by the time that it takes a person to recover.

29
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Remember that all of that was multiplied by age

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
and added to the number of people infected at the previous time step.

31
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Now, let's take a look at how the infected mosquito population was changing.

32
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Since we're using the forward Euler method, we started with the number of infected mosquitoes

33
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,000
at the previous step and then add to this age times a bunch of other things.

34
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Now to find out how many mosquitoes are moving into the infected group,

35
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
we start with the probability of a mosquito biting a person,

36
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
which of course might give the mosquito malaria as well,

37
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
multiply this again by the bites per day of mosquito,

38
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
multiply this by the number of susceptible mosquitoes and the number of infected humans.

39
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
We then divide this by the total number of humans

40
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
and multiply the transmission probability from human to mosquito.

41
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
If you remember the drawing that I showed earlier on in the video introducing this problem,

42
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I told you that the only way the mosquitoes can no longer be infected is to die.

43
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
They don't move back to being susceptible.

44
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
This means that the only thing that is going to decrease

45
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
the number of infected mosquitoes is death of mosquitoes.

46
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,000
So, we subtract from this entire expression if 1 over the mosquito lifetime

47
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
times another infected mosquitoes at the previous step.

48
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I know that that was a lot of constants and variables to keep track of,

49
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
but great job if you're able to fill all this up.

50
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Now, let's take a peek at what our final graph for Unit 3 looks like.

51
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Now in this graph, the blue curve shows the fraction of humans that were infected

52
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
and the green curve shows the fraction of the number of mosquitoes that are infected.

53
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
At first glance, it might look like there are many many more humans infected the mosquitoes.

54
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
But remember that because this is fraction, this doesn't actually show us plain numbers.

55
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
In fact, we started with 10¹⁰ mosquitoes, but only 10⁸ humans.

56
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
So even if a much smaller percent of the mosquito population was infected from the human population,

57
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
the mosquitoes are able to infect such a great portion of humans

58
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
because there are so many more mosquitoes than there are humans to it.

59
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
You can see that the number of both humans and mosquitoes infected,

60
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
at first, increases sharply and then levels off and stays at a very high number.

61
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
However, as soon as 100 days hits, and we introduce the mosquito nets.,

62
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
the number of infected in each population starts to decrease certainly.

63
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
We can see that a mosquito net idea was definitely very effective

64
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
for helping slow the spread of malaria in the human population as well as the mosquito population.

65
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Great job on all three problems in Unit 3.

66
00:04:01,000 --> 99:59:59,999
I hope you found this discussion of the SIR model and its variations interesting.
