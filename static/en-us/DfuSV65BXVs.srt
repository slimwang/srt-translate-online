00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:48,440
>> So it can be a little bit weird to talk about the truth value of

2
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:51,600
an implication sentence. What we're really saying here is, whether or

3
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,830
not this implication actually holds true. So let's take

4
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:58,540
three different implications to see this. First let's think of the implication,

5
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:03,260
feathers implies bird. All birds have feathers and only birds have feathers. So,

6
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:07,730
we know that if an animal has feathers, then it is a bird. That's true.

7
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:12,060
On the other hand, let's take the implication, if scales then bird. Lots of

8
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:15,810
animals with scales aren't birds and in fact no animals with scales are birds.

9
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:20,930
So the implication, scales implies birds. Would be False. For our third example,

10
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:25,640
let's take the implication, flight implies bird. If we have a penguin,

11
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:30,180
flight is False. But the penguin is still a bird. So, flight can be false and

12
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:33,740
bird can still be true, meaning the implication can still be true here.

13
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:37,840
On the other hand, if we have a cat, flight if False. And bird is False.

14
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:42,430
So, the implication can still be true. So in this case, if flight was false,

15
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:45,670
we can't actually make a determination on whether or not the animal is a bird.
