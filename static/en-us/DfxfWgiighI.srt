My solution is to use three loops, one for each axis. Directly setting the X,

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:07,414
Y, and Z values to each of the grid intervals. I then create a vertex with each

3
00:00:07,414 --> 00:00:11,260
point and add it to the list. I encourage you to modify various parameters in

4
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:15,450
this particle system and see the effects. If you set size attenuation to false,

5
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:18,550
the particles will have a size of 35 units in the world itself, instead of 35

6
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:22,344
pixels. If you turn off sort particles you'll see rendering errors as the

7
00:00:22,344 --> 00:00:26,430
particles are drawn in the wrong order from various view directions. Try

8
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:29,380
removing the spray texture entirely to see how that looks.
