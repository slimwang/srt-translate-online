00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,610
If you recall, when we were discussing
Sudo, we mentioned that it's

2
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:07,360
a common pattern to disable
the ability to log in as root, and

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:11,650
to only log in as a different user
that has the ability to use Sudo.

4
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:13,060
This is a security measure,

5
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:17,800
since every bad guy out there knows
every Linux box has a user named root.

6
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,750
By disabling this
account from remote log,

7
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:22,820
in we remove a very easy attack vector.

8
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:24,830
Now vagrant took care of this for us.

9
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:26,510
They created a user name vagrant and

10
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:30,190
we just type vagrant ssh from our
terminal to automatically connect.

11
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:33,910
But not every hosting provider is going
to set something like this up for you.

12
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:34,960
So let's do this ourselves.
