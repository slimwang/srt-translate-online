1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So today is an exciting day.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
We'll talk about planning under uncertainty,

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
and it really puts together from the material

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
we've talked about in past classes.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
We talked about planning,

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
but not under uncertainty, and you've had

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
many, many classes of under uncertainty,

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
and now it gets to the point where we can make

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
decisions under uncertainty.

10
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
This is really important for my own research field

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
like robotics where the world is full of uncertainty, and the

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
type of techniques I'll tell you about today

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
will really make it possible to drive robots

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
in actual physical roles and

15
00:00:30,000 --> 99:59:59,999
find good plans for these robots to execute.
