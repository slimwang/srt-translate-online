1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,400
Now it's time for
you to think about a product idea.

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:06,020
One you'll use throughout
the rest of this course.

3
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:08,039
>> Yeah and
if you don't have an idea already,

4
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:10,830
think about problems in your
life that you want to solve.

5
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:13,210
If nothing comes in mind
check out requests for

6
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:14,970
startups in the instructor notes.

7
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:17,100
Is there an industry that
you always think about?

8
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:20,130
You can also observe others and their
work and talk to them about the problems

9
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:22,930
that they face or
the problems that there companies face.

10
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:26,770
The best problems to address are those
that you have personal experiences with.

11
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:29,400
Your commitment to finding a solution
will be that much stronger and

12
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,270
it will be the one thing that keeps
you going through the crazy highs and

13
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:34,740
the crazy lows of building a company.

14
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:37,650
>> It's a key idea to make sure
that you're building something

15
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:39,490
that solves a real problem.

16
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:43,290
Yeah, for example Apoorva Mehta, the
founder of Instacart and his cofounder.

17
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:46,030
They spent a year and a half trying to
build a social network for lawyers,

18
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:48,700
without realizing one cardinal
truth about the space.

19
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:51,160
And that's that,
lawyers don't like to share.

20
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:53,070
Apoorva eventually solved
a different problem.

21
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:56,640
And it was one that he always thought
was a personal pain, grocery shopping.

22
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,050
He realized that his friends were
willing to use the app that he built,

23
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:01,620
and it was unlike so
many of his other products.

24
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:04,319
>> By observing and
reflecting on the world around you,

25
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,930
you'll be likely to stumble
upon an idea that you love.
