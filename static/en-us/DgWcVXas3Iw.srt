00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The diagram that we get works as follows. Let's for instance look at the two red curves.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
They show the effect the initial value has on the result.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:18,000
It changes the initial value up and down by 5 * 10⁴ tons and you get this curve and that curve.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
You can immediately spot that this blue curve belongs to a factor that's more critical.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
The blue one is the carrying capacity, and obviously,

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
the most critical is M for magenta, the maximum growth rate.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
If we want to improve the reliability of our result, we definitely need to work on the uncertainty

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
of all maximum growth rate as opposed to what we just did.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
This code doesn't look at the complete temporal evolution, it just looks at one single value,

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
the total amount of harvest for that particular set of parameters.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
It compares what happens when that factor goes up to what happens when that factor goes down

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
and then determines the factor for which this difference is largest.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
When you show here as we increase the value of that factor, the result may go down,

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
and as we decrease the value of that factor, the result may go up,

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
so that we end up with a negative sign of the difference here.

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,000
This is why we're using the absolute value and corresponding to what we guessed from the curves,

17
00:01:19,000 --> 99:59:59,999
the most critical parameter is the maximum growth rate.
