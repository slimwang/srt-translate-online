1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,740
So the answer to the problem, as you may
have found out is 5. But there are

2
00:00:03,752 --> 00:00:07,841
actually two different ways that you can
solve this problem. Let's go through both

3
00:00:07,853 --> 00:00:12,042
of them. So, if you remember our order of
operations acronym, PEMDADS> This tells us

4
00:00:12,054 --> 00:00:16,081
that, before we do any subtraction, which
we'll have to do right here. We need to

5
00:00:16,093 --> 00:00:20,078
deal with whatever's happening inside
parentheses. So if we were following this

6
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:24,400
set of rules, we would say that this is
equal to 10 minus dealing with what's

7
00:00:24,412 --> 00:00:29,455
inside the parentheses, 2+3 is 5, and then
we would do the subtraction, 10-5 is 5.

8
00:00:29,562 --> 00:00:34,550
However, as we saw in dealing with the
equation that we gave to Grant, there's a

9
00:00:34,562 --> 00:00:39,315
way to get rid of parentheses, so that we
can solve this problem in different way.

10
00:00:39,411 --> 00:00:43,348
Let's pretend that the numbers that we
have up here actually refer to some

11
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:47,776
objects. Let's say these circles that I
have done here right now. So, here are ten

12
00:00:47,788 --> 00:00:52,104
circles and I want to figure how to modify
these super circles in accordance with

13
00:00:52,116 --> 00:00:56,938
this expression. So we have ten vice, and
then you want to get rid of 2+3 of them.

14
00:00:57,052 --> 00:01:02,801
So if we did the problem the original way,
where we have 10-5 circles. Then we would

15
00:01:02,813 --> 00:01:08,100
just count out five of these 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, select just those ones and then get rid

16
00:01:08,112 --> 00:01:13,072
of them. And then in the end we're left
with 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, five circles. However,

17
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:16,888
let's talk about how to do the problem in
the other way. Instead of grouping the

18
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:20,601
circles that we want to get rid of as one
whole group, as we did in the first way,

19
00:01:20,689 --> 00:01:24,444
so that's by dealing with what's inside
the parenthesis first, and circling all

20
00:01:24,456 --> 00:01:28,184
five of the circles we want to get rid of,
let's think about these as two separate

21
00:01:28,196 --> 00:01:32,009
groups. So, we know that we want to get
rid of two circles. So that's just these

22
00:01:32,021 --> 00:01:35,326
two and we also want to get rid of three
circles. Now instead of merging these into

23
00:01:35,338 --> 00:01:38,668
one group like we did the first way, why
don't we just get rid of each of them

24
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:42,054
separately since we know that we need to
get rid of this whole thing. So first

25
00:01:42,066 --> 00:01:45,302
we'll get rid of these two and then we'll
get rid of these three as well and in the

26
00:01:45,314 --> 00:01:48,569
end we' re left with the same five circles
that were when we did the problem the

27
00:01:48,581 --> 00:01:52,350
first way. So what we really did was
subtract two circles. So 10 minus 2

28
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:58,415
circles and then we subtracted the 3. So
this gave us, our final five circles.
