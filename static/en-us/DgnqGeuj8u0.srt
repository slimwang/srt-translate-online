00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,695
y to the 7th times y to the negative 3rd is just y to the 4th power. Remember

2
00:00:05,707 --> 00:00:11,614
that shortcut we learned before, for any numbers n, a, and b, n to the a times n

3
00:00:11,626 --> 00:00:17,235
to the b is just equal to n to the a plus b power. So here, all we need to do is

4
00:00:17,247 --> 00:00:21,102
add our exponents together, 7 minus 3 is equal to 4.
