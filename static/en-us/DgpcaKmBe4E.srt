1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:02,200
Now let me just show you
a simple demonstration.

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:04,110
And I'll actually be
sharing the code for

3
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:07,250
this demonstration that you can
actually use for a variety of things.

4
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:10,620
And again, you'll have an opportunity
to play around with this on your own.

5
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:14,970
Here I want to basically demonstrate
how we can morph between the two

6
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:20,290
different types of jaguars, the jaguar
the car, and the real jaguar here.

7
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:22,370
Now recall,
to accomplish any kind of morphing,

8
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:25,770
we need to find feature
points to create a mesh.

9
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:29,660
In this case, I've actually created
a mesh that covers the whole image, but

10
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:33,850
I've found specific feature points
that I want to be able to identify

11
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:35,730
in this image here.

12
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:37,460
And this is, of course,

13
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:42,130
now the same mesh with different feature
points applied to the real jaguar.

14
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:43,280
So, basically again,

15
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,220
you should see that this feature
point here is matching this one.

16
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:49,435
This feature point is matching this one.

17
00:00:49,435 --> 00:00:54,775
So once I have these two meshes and I'll
basically now figure out how to do this

18
00:00:54,775 --> 00:00:58,225
alignment of these types of
meshes across the two images,

19
00:00:58,225 --> 00:01:01,765
I can use that to generate
a morph sequence between the two.

20
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:09,280
So here you see the animation sequence
that basically is morphing from this

21
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,850
jaguar to this jaguar, and you basically
notice all the key points deforming, and

22
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:17,890
these mesh triangles deforming with
the right kinds of pixels, and

23
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:20,960
warping them appropriately
to generate a new sequence.

24
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,080
Let's look at this again
without the triangles.

25
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:28,950
So there you see the original
image sequence now without any of

26
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:30,970
the triangles and see the morphing.

27
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:35,000
We will share this code with the slides
for you to play around with this

28
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,980
on your own with your open cv package
that you've been playing around with.
