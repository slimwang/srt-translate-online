1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:02,710
Professional developers,
more often than not,

2
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:06,438
will find themselves working on
pre-existing code with other developers.

3
00:00:06,438 --> 00:00:09,420
They use Git to track changes,
compare versions, and

4
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:13,540
view the commit history for complex
projects, just like you've been doing.

5
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:15,840
There's one difference, though.

6
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:17,120
All your repositories and

7
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:22,130
changes had been made locally, which
means they only exist on your computer.

8
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:23,900
And you are the only
one who can see them.

9
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:28,700
Unless, if all those developers want
to take turns working on your computer,

10
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:30,030
there needs to be another way for

11
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:33,010
developers to work on
repositories remotely.

12
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:34,420
And there is.

13
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:37,690
In this lesson, you'll learn how
to use Git and GitHub, to view and

14
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:39,480
update shared repositories.

15
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,080
You'll also practice with
a demo repository and

16
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,640
be able to apply your skills
to your future projects.
