1
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:04,070
In 2D of course, it's not just a derivative but

2
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:06,740
we have to talk about the direction of the derivative.

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:08,980
In gradients, we have derivatives in the x direction and

4
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:10,660
derivatives in the y direction.

5
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:14,040
So when you do this same trick of taking the derivative of our filter,

6
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:17,540
we have to say, in what direction are we taking that derivative?

7
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:18,850
So let's write this like this.

8
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:20,300
So what we want to do is,

9
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:25,410
let's suppose we want to take the derivative in the x direction.

10
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:29,010
And what this little h of x is meant to imply is that

11
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:32,860
that's a little filter that just takes our derivative in the x direction.

12
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:36,130
Maybe it's a Sobel operator, maybe it's one of the others.

13
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:39,390
But it's a small filter taking a derivative.

14
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:42,870
And g, here, is going to be our Gaussian.

15
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:46,530
And you know, as we said before, because of the associative property,

16
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:48,690
besides smoothing and then taking the derivative,

17
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:53,490
we can apply an operator that is the Gaussian with its derivative.

18
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:55,050
So that's what's shown here.

19
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:58,040
Okay? And the minus 1 1, that's a trivial one,

20
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:02,000
it could be minus 1 0 1, it's my generic derivative operator.

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,500
And the g, this is my Gaussian, my nice smooth, and

22
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:09,250
I just pulled out a chunk of the matrix that's, that's kind of like that.

23
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:11,030
And what does that give us?

24
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:14,580
Well that gives us this function like that, okay?

25
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:18,760
And so that is, it's first derivative of the Gaussian, which when I apply to

26
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:23,730
an image gives me the derivative of the Gaussian smooth image for

27
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:26,280
that associative property from before.

28
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:30,410
So the question is, is it preferable to do this, right, to apply this.

29
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:33,430
And we should think about this as a quiz, all right.

30
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:34,820
Because it is preferable.
