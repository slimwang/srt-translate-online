1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,342
Okay, so I've written down
a sort of flow chart here.

2
00:00:03,342 --> 00:00:04,257
>> Okay.

3
00:00:04,257 --> 00:00:06,084
>> An alternative for King Solomon,

4
00:00:06,084 --> 00:00:09,612
that I'm going to claim better than
what King Solomon actually did

5
00:00:09,612 --> 00:00:12,810
in the story which is threaten
to cut the baby in half.

6
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:14,805
>> It's certainly more complicated and
sort of.

7
00:00:14,805 --> 00:00:16,535
>> Well, you think it is but
maybe it's not.

8
00:00:16,535 --> 00:00:18,040
>> [LAUGH]
>> So I'm going to read all this to you

9
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:21,490
and we'll just kind of go through it and
you'll see if you understand.

10
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:24,790
Now, remember we're starting out
under the assumption that the value

11
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:28,140
of the baby to the real mother
is bigger than the value of

12
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:29,130
the baby to the fake mother.

13
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:29,670
>> Okay.

14
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:31,580
>> Okay, now here's step 0.

15
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:34,380
>> And again value here is
like willingness to pay.

16
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:34,950
>> Yes.

17
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:36,590
>> But we're just going to go with that.

18
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:37,750
>> Yeah, we're going to go with that.

19
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:38,670
So here's step 0.

20
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:41,660
King Solomon is going to choose a fine.

21
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:43,010
>> Okay.
>> We'll call it F.

22
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:45,570
That's greater than 0 but
meant to be small.

23
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:47,180
Okay.
>> So, you know something like a dollar.

24
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:48,230
Now what I mean by small?

25
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:50,940
I don't just mean something like
a dollar, I mean F needs to be

26
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:53,605
greater than zero, so there needs
to be some cost to this fine.

27
00:00:53,605 --> 00:00:56,210
>> Mm-hm.
>> But it should be smaller than either

28
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:58,990
of the values v real or v fake.

29
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:01,705
Okay so B real bigger than
be fake bigger than F.

30
00:01:01,705 --> 00:01:03,539
>> That's exactly right.

31
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:04,569
>> Okay.
>> All right, so

32
00:01:04,569 --> 00:01:07,970
King Solomon picks the [INAUDIBLE] and
by the way tells the two women this

33
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:10,890
entire process that I'm I'm going
to another this is a surprise.

34
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:13,329
They both know this is what they're
going to have to go through.

35
00:01:13,329 --> 00:01:14,080
>> Okay.
>> Okay.

36
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,590
>> So King Solomon pick some value F.

37
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:19,680
Then in step one King Solomon
asks A is this your child?

38
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,970
If they says no then B gets
the child if A says yes

39
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:26,410
then King Solomon then turns to B and
says Is this your child?

40
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:31,390
If B says no then a gets the child
if B says yes, then King Solomon.

41
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:34,220
>> So somebody lying at that point
someone is lying King Solomon's not

42
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:38,010
having any of it and
tells a that a will pay F.

43
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:38,751
>> Wow, okay.

44
00:01:38,751 --> 00:01:39,280
>> Okay.

45
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,515
>> And then, requires that
be an ounce of the value v.

46
00:01:43,515 --> 00:01:46,156
Some number V that is
greater than F okay.

47
00:01:46,156 --> 00:01:47,515
>> Okay.
>> Then the next step

48
00:01:47,515 --> 00:01:49,930
King Solomon turns back to A and
he says.

49
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:51,416
[LAUGH] How about now?

50
00:01:51,416 --> 00:01:52,735
>> Yeah.
How about now?

51
00:01:52,735 --> 00:01:53,825
Is this your child?

52
00:01:53,825 --> 00:01:59,697
And if A says no it's not my child then
B gets the baby, but has to pay $V.

53
00:01:59,697 --> 00:02:01,655
>> Okay.

54
00:02:01,655 --> 00:02:05,400
>> If A says yes then
a gets to keep the baby.

55
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:09,090
A have to pay V, and B has to pay F.

56
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:10,759
>> Okay.
>> I'm going to claim

57
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:14,340
that this is better and then claim
here and then cut the baby in half.

58
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:16,280
>> At least in the listening
true preferences.

59
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:16,910
>> Interesting.

60
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:17,750
That make sense.

61
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:19,030
>> It's intriguing.

62
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:19,680
>> Well, so.

63
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,500
>> I mean this still feels,
this feels weirdly asymmetrical.

64
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,610
>> Well, it is in some sense

65
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:25,710
asymmetrical
>> But

66
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:29,880
that's because there are underlying
values are asymmetrical.

67
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,570
>> No,
I mean the end of the day either A or

68
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:36,090
B got the baby with no fines
if somebody fessed up early.

69
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:39,330
If they make it past the you
guys are arguing stage

70
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:42,430
three then one possibility
is a pays A fine.

71
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:49,630
And B pays V and gets the baby the other
possibility is that A pays the fine.

72
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:53,800
And A pays V, and
A gets the baby, and B pays F.

73
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:58,100
>> Now after King Solomon tells
A they're going to pay the fine.

74
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:01,230
If we get down to here,
A instead pays V and B pays F.

75
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:02,280
So A doesn't pay F+V.

76
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:06,805
One of them is going to pay half and
one of them's going to pay.

77
00:03:06,805 --> 00:03:09,020
>> Okay,k that feels more
symmetrical in short.

78
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:10,020
Okay, good.

79
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:10,920
Okay, so

80
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:16,940
how would you convince yourself of the
veracity of what I'm suggesting, that

81
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:21,060
this will do a better job of eliciting
true preferences of the mothers?

82
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:24,240
>> I guess I would think through
what the different, I don't know,

83
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:27,150
like, ways the game
can play out might be.

84
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:27,800
>> Okay, cool.

85
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,650
So we're going to go
under the assumption so.

86
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:34,480
Let's see one of these mothers is
really one of these mothers is fake.

87
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:40,250
So I mean I suppose it's
possible that they're both fake.

88
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:41,160
>> Let's not go.

89
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,780
>> Yeah, let's let's not go that's not
that's not allowed one of them is real

90
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:49,170
one of them is fake because this is King
Solomon and King and Knight shone like.
