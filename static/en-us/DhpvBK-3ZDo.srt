Here's a word cloud of student responses. Now if

2
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:05,350
you've never seen a word cloud before, the way

3
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:07,620
it works is the bigger the word, the more

4
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:10,430
often it was submitted by you and your fellow classmates.

5
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:14,300
>> Now, obviously, different people describe themselves in different ways,

6
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:16,500
so look at the word cloud and see if there's any

7
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,570
words that you use to describe yourself. If not, that just

8
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:22,000
means not than many people use the same words you use.
