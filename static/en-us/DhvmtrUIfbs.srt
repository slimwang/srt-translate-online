00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,390
The correct answer is, a vector image,

2
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:07,250
the reason being that vector images
scale without quality degradation.

3
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:11,020
This means that no matter how big they
are, they will always look the same.

4
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:13,640
This is definitely useful if you're
trying to make something that's

00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:14,320
50 meters wide.
