We've already seen that square roots can be expressed equivalently with either

2
00:00:04,801 --> 00:00:08,983
radical signs or with exponents of one half, but as a matter of fact, all

3
00:00:08,995 --> 00:00:13,202
exponent of 1 over n, where n is a natural number, can be expressed with a

4
00:00:13,214 --> 00:00:17,784
radical sign But we need to differentiate between this radical sign and this

5
00:00:17,796 --> 00:00:22,279
radical sign, or all the different radical signs we would use as this number n

6
00:00:22,291 --> 00:00:26,786
changes. To do this we put a little number next to the radical sign. To denote x

7
00:00:26,798 --> 00:00:32,070
to the 1/3 or the cube root of x, for example, you put a little 3 by the radical

8
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:32,896
sign.

9
00:00:32,902 --> 00:00:37,470
The question I have for you is, if we want to express the nth root of x, what

10
00:00:37,482 --> 00:00:39,889
symbol belongs next to the radical sign?
