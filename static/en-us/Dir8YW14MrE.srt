00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,480
Okay, let's take a quick look at the code.

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,500
So this is where you would have passed the ProfileForm

3
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:09,400
argument in to save profile. And then the other changed

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:12,150
you'll have made is that you get the display name

5
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:15,400
out from of the profile form. And you also get

6
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:19,150
the TeeShirtSize out of the pathed in profile form but

7
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:22,610
if the TeeShirtSize is not set by profile form then

8
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:25,260
don't get it out of the profile form. Basically just

9
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:27,620
use a default that we're already using, this

10
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:29,440
is where we set the default up here.
