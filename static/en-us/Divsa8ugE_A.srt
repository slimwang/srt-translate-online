1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,880
There's no question that even
simple models of computers,

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:06,340
the models that ignore the memory
hierarchy, parallelism, and

3
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:10,770
communication have, nevertheless,
been extremely productive.

4
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:11,340
In other words,

5
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:15,890
the CS community has produced an amazing
array of applications without having to

6
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:19,300
think too hard about the physical
realities of machines.

7
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:21,240
Or so it seems.

8
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:25,690
But if we are in fact approaching
the end of Moore's Law and

9
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:29,550
as we hit new performance bottlenecks
like limits on power and energy.

10
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:33,240
Then I think you have to stop and
ask yourself the kind of basic questions

11
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:36,240
that Danny Hillis was
asking in the early 80s.

12
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:39,660
These are questions like, how do we
make the most of the machines we have?

13
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:44,820
Is there a role for physical reality and
the design of algorithms and software?

14
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:49,460
And how exactly would we do all that and
still be productive developers?

15
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:53,790
These unrelated questions are at
the frontier of HPC research.

16
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:58,270
They include wackier ideas like quantum
computing and biological computing.

17
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:01,320
These are among the main
extremes of physical computation.

18
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:07,060
Now, while our course won't go so far
as to talk about these wackier ideas,

19
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:10,870
lucky for you, there's plenty of time
afterwards for you to think about that.
