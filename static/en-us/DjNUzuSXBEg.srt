1
00:00:00,016 --> 00:00:04,170
So, to summarize, I've basically introduced the whole concept of

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:08,200
feature detection that could be used for matching between two images.

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:11,520
I discussed variety of characteristics, four specifically,

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,240
of what makes a good feature.

5
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:15,500
Briefly introduced Harris Corner Detector and

6
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:20,100
SIFT, again, some things we will cover in detail a lot more, in the future.

7
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:22,930
Further reading is available on the website.

8
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:24,658
But you can look at them here.

9
00:00:24,658 --> 00:00:25,210
And these are a variety of papers that have existed.

10
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:26,490
These are a variety of papers that

11
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:33,560
I've come across in the area of computer vision, for doing feature detection.

12
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:37,860
Includes Sift, and also for example, Harris Corners.

13
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,740
Also I encourage you to look at descriptions like features and

14
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:43,000
open CV or Matlab sites.

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,150
Further lectures will cover more details on SIFT and how we can

16
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:51,380
apply them to various types of image alignment and image matching approaches.

17
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:54,500
Again, thanks to a variety sources I picked up information from.

18
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:58,420
And we'll continue discussing these types of concepts in future lectures.

19
00:00:58,420 --> 00:00:58,920
Thank you.
