1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
This one is easy to calculate for SPAM and HAM.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
For SPAM, it's 2/5,

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
and the reason is, we had previously

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
3 out of 8 messages assigned to SPAM.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
But thanks to the Laplacian smoother, we add 1 over here.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
And there are 2 classes, so we add 2 times 1 over here,

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
which gives us 4/10, which is 2/5.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Similarly to get 3/5 over here.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Now the tricky part comes up over here.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Before, we had 0 occurances of the word "today" in the SPAM class,

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
and we had 9 data points.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
But now we are going to add 1 for Laplacian smoother,

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
and down here, we are going to add 12.

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
And the reason that we add 12 is because

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
there's 12 different words in our dictionary

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Hence, for each word in the dictonary, we are going to add 1.

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
So we have a total of 12, which gives us the 12 over here.

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
That makes 1/21.

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
In the HAM class, we had 2 occurrences

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
of the word "today"--over here and over here.

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
We add 1, normalize by 15,

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
plus 12 for the dictionary size,

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:14,000
which is 3/27 or 1/9.

24
00:01:14,000 --> 99:59:59,999
This was not an easy question.
