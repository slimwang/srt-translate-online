1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Here I have a grammar that we've seen before, but I've abbreviated it still further.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Instead of identifier, I've just written "id," and instead of number, I've just written num.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
This sort of abbreviation is all too common in computer science.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Programmers can't help it.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Unfortunately, it's a bit of a vice, because while it's easy for me to see what's going on

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
it can be hard for someone reading it later--myself included--to tell what my variable names mean.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Whenever possible, you should take the time to make your variable names as descriptive as possible.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Add lots of comments.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
It turns out that 90% of software is maintenance.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Just like a popular book is read many more times than it's written,

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
a program is read or maintained or executed many more times than it's written.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
It's worth taking the time to do it right the first time.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
That said, clearly I'm not, so this must be one of those

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
do what I say and not what I do back professor sorts of maneuvers.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Regardless, back on track. Here's the grammar.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Statement goes to identifier equals expression,

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
and expression is the same sort of arithmetic we've seen before.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
We're not going to consider this particular sentence "yggdrasil equals 6 minus 5.

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I've written out a parse tree--a bit squashed at the bottom but still recognizable--

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
for this phrase "yggdrasil equals 6 minus 5,"

21
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
but I've forgotten two labels. It's quiz time. Fill in the blanks.

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
What would have to go in each of these blanks in order to this parse tree

23
00:01:28,000 --> 99:59:59,999
to match this input utterance according to this grammar?
