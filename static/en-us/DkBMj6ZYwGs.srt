00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The answer is that all of these are good, except for the sort command.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
That wouldn't be very good.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
It would maybe separate out the drugs that begin with "z" near the end of the list,

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
so that would help, but it would just do probably about random for everything else.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Now, you may be surprised to learn that the gzip command

6
00:00:19,000 --> 99:59:59,999
is actually pretty good as a classification algorithm. Let's try to understand that.
