00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,529
hey there it looks like you have a
pending resubmission so I'll help you

2
00:00:04,529 --> 00:00:08,730
understand what resubmissions are and
why we have this process in place also

3
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:13,469
give you some suggestions on how to best
prepare your project for resubmission if

4
00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:16,349
you haven't watched this video before
going to stick around see you have the

5
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:18,290
right mindset going forward

6
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:19,520
first of all

7
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:24,920
resubmissions are not a bad thing here's
what I mean developers in companies no

8
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:28,369
matter what their skill level are
subject something that we call code

9
00:00:28,369 --> 00:00:29,119
review

10
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:32,418
it's a process that we have to catch
mistakes and to double check that our

11
00:00:32,418 --> 00:00:36,589
solutions are the best that we can do
and just re-emphasize even the most

12
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:39,440
senior developers on a team go through
this process

13
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:44,180
why because everybody makes mistakes
doesn't matter who you are

14
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:48,379
everybody's human now your reviewers are
here to make sure that your code or

15
00:00:48,379 --> 00:00:50,780
write ups are solid and well written

16
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:54,320
this helps you catch any mistakes you
might be making and it's a process that

17
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,200
you can learn from

18
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,500
if you get any feedback that doesn't
make sense to you reach out to us

19
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,510
directly and we can help you out

20
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:03,989
three

21
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:07,920
if you don't know how to do what your
reviewer is suggesting reach out to your

22
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,600
community of students for help while the
classes will get you most of the way

23
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,360
there sometimes you'll have to research
things on your own

24
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,360
also remember that you and your fellow
students are in this together

25
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:23,670
so work with each other in the forums
share your research working and

26
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:26,730
researching with each other is great
practice for when you're in your next

27
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:28,940
job for

28
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:32,899
there are several categories of feedback
that you'll get now the highest priority

29
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:36,800
items are definitely things you should
address but don't stop there

30
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:40,610
even if you get feedback that feels
nitpicky to you like your indentation

31
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:42,170
isn't consistent

32
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:46,190
although it may feel unimportant you're
getting that feedback for a reason

33
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:49,820
your code should always be clean and
consistent with best practices

34
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:53,570
there also might be certain places where
you get certain feedback once but it

35
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:56,300
actually applies throughout your project

36
00:01:56,300 --> 00:02:00,170
the mixed white space feedback could be
an example of that it's fairly common to

37
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:03,500
make a mistake that has ramifications
throughout your project

38
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:07,880
now what's considered nitpicky feedback
by one reviewer might be a pretty big

39
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:13,820
deal to another and that brings us to
five different submissions might be

40
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:17,959
reviewed by different reviewers and this
is actually a good thing because it gets

41
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:21,530
your code in front of a lot of different
people's eyes and brains

42
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:25,310
they may even disagree with each other
but that's okay too that's good

43
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:29,630
this gives you more opinions and more
chances to learn from people plus having

44
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:34,250
multiple reviewers helps us get your
review back to you in record time

45
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:36,720
finally with all of this said

46
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:41,430
let's talk about mindset these reviews
are not hurdles that you have to jump

47
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:42,990
over don't think of him that way

48
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:47,250
there are opportunities for you to
improve your goal is not to get through

49
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:50,100
the project at all costs at top speed

50
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:54,239
remember that your goal should be to
become an awesome developer so keep that

51
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:57,300
in your mind when you're working through
these suggestions

52
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:00,810
thanks for watching and have fun making
your project better and better
