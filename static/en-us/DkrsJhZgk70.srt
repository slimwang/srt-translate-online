1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:03,270
And, and this is another link related to like the dashboard.

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:06,400
So we had the situation where if we were pushing too much data out,

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:09,650
then the website that was displaying it wouldn't update in time.

4
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:12,550
And it would sort of be a, the data was coming in so

5
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:16,328
fast that the browser was constantly updating, rather than,

6
00:00:16,328 --> 00:00:19,760
sort of rendering, because it was too large a render for it.

7
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,130
>> Oh, okay. >> And I just wondered if there was a trick for that.

8
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:23,890
>> That depends on,

9
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:28,490
how much you want to pick it up on all frequently refreshing the webpage too.

10
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:29,170
>> Okay.

11
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:32,600
>> Because, the thing is like, if you could,

12
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,880
I mean, take the example of a radius, right, and

13
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:40,460
if you have a scan into a radius, like, let's say your display is going to,

14
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:45,140
display a brand trend, over like ten days or 20 days, or whatever, right.

15
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:49,100
So after a five minute interval, then you might want to do,

16
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:53,550
fetch 24 hours divided by five minutes multiplied by ten days, right?

17
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:55,660
So that many data points that you would pick up every time.

18
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:57,010
>> I see.

19
00:00:57,010 --> 00:01:02,360
>> So what I would suggest is like, the page has data for

20
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:05,910
all the, the time and trouble that you have, and then you fix that a lot.

21
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:08,238
>> Yes. In the last five minutes only, and then update it internally.

22
00:01:08,238 --> 00:01:09,252
Then throw away that last one.

23
00:01:09,252 --> 00:01:11,890
. And then begin different importing.

24
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:12,390
>> Like a role model.

25
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:12,890
>> Yeah.
