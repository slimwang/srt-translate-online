1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,469
So now let's dive into understanding what an image gradient is.

2
00:00:03,469 --> 00:00:06,791
To help us define an image gradient, let's take the example of

3
00:00:06,791 --> 00:00:10,549
this sample image again, where we're interested in is at each and

4
00:00:10,549 --> 00:00:13,207
every point we want to compute the gradient.

5
00:00:13,207 --> 00:00:17,126
And with respect to the neighborhood that we're in traversing and

6
00:00:17,126 --> 00:00:19,820
again the both dimensions of the image.

7
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:25,540
A Gradient basically is defined as a measure of change in an Image function.

8
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:28,900
So that at this point, what are the changes of the image function with

9
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:33,320
respect to how things change in the x direction or

10
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:38,990
in this case, the columns or the y direction, the rows of an image?

11
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:42,200
We'd like to be able to compute this both in discontinuous and

12
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,790
the continuous form.

13
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:45,990
So how do we define it mathematically?

14
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:49,280
So basically, the differential of the function F,

15
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,130
which represents an image, with respect to x.

16
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:56,020
And then differential of the function image F, with respect to y.

17
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:59,380
And of course, both dimensions of this is represented by the del F,

18
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:01,930
is the gradient of the image F.

19
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:05,310
In essence, this is the way to measure the change in image function F,

20
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:06,530
in both x and y.

21
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:08,900
Let's look at that with a couple of simple examples.

22
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:12,440
Let's take a simple ramp image here, starts with a dark value,

23
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:16,190
let's say zero, to 255 where the pure white is.

24
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:20,440
At this point, I want to be able to measure the change of this image function,

25
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:24,710
as respect to how it is in this neighborhood here.

26
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:28,930
Very obvious if you take the same function here, you notice that all of

27
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:33,120
the change in this direction is for the x direction, none for the y.

28
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:36,700
So that of course, this is a very simple case where you can just represent

29
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:42,000
the del of F is nothing else at this point to be this function here.

30
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,300
The counter, of course, is when there is a pixel and actually it's now, or

31
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:47,610
this image here as a ramp here.

32
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:50,640
And of course, going from two fifth, 0 to 255,

33
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,430
from this point onwards, and, and in this case, we can

34
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:59,760
simply look at that there is not going to be any change in the x direction.

35
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,870
That seems to be fixed, and just in the y direction.

36
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:03,740
Combining these two,

37
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:07,080
we can look at if the changes are in both directions, then they will be,

38
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:12,640
of course the gradient direction would be at an angle, which is there.

39
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,950
In essence, what that basically means now is that the gradient point

40
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:19,740
in the direction of the most rapid increase in intensity.

41
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:24,670
From here, the intensity is increasing rapidly in this direction, less so

42
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:29,010
in this or this direction, so this is my most dominant angle.

43
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:31,400
Let's look at this a little bit more carefully.

44
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,340
How would we compute the gradient direction?

45
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:36,570
Just take the inverse of the tangent, I mean,

46
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:40,060
this is my vector, del F with x and y.

47
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:41,700
If I know the y and

48
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:45,570
the x changes, I can basically now do the inverse tangent to get data.

49
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:50,730
The magnitude of this vector, which would of course be the modulus of

50
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:54,760
this value here, which would be the square plus square, square root.

51
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,470
So I have this thing, it'll give me the magnitude of the vector.

52
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:59,440
So the angle of the vector and

53
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,520
the magnitude of the vector are the ones we're looking for, and

54
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:06,440
that would basically define the gradient at any point in an image.

55
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:10,627
So while we're at it one thing I want everybody to think about is how does this,

56
00:03:10,627 --> 00:03:12,793
how does this relate to edge direction.

57
00:03:12,793 --> 00:03:17,479
When I have a point here and I have the gradient direction here the theta and

58
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:18,480
the magnitude.

59
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,310
Where is the edge?

60
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:23,120
Hopefully you will have the answer in a bit.
