1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,500
Now you may notice that some of these points are spread

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:05,440
out from one another, while others are stacked right on top of

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:08,340
each other. This area of the graph is considered to be over

4
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:11,750
plotted. Over plotting makes it difficult to tell how many points are

5
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:15,180
in each region. So we can set the transparency of the

6
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:18,880
points using the alpha parameter and geom point. I'm going to add this

7
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,800
on a new line so that we can see our layers more

8
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,970
clearly. Next I set the alpha parameter equal to 1 over 20.

9
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:27,760
So this means it's going to take 20 points to

10
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,950
be the equivalent of one of these black dots. Writing

11
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:32,659
this code, we can see that the bulk of our

12
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:36,370
data lies below the 1000 threshold for friend count. Now

13
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:39,550
let's also add a little jitter here too. We can

14
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:44,150
swap out geom_point with the geom_jitter. Age is a continuous

15
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:47,160
variable but you really only have integer values, so we

16
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,030
are seeing these perfectly lined up columns. Which isn't a

17
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:54,830
true reflection of age. These columns should feel intuitively wrong

18
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:57,010
and we want to make sure that we can see more

19
00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:59,870
of the points. So using jitter we can add some

20
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:02,310
noise to each age so we get a clearer picture

21
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:05,630
of the relationship between age and friend count. Writing our

22
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:07,830
code with geom_jitter we can see that we get a

23
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:11,320
more disperse distribution. What stands out to you in this

24
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:14,650
new plot? Keep in mind that the alpha is set to

25
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:17,359
1/20th or 0.05.
