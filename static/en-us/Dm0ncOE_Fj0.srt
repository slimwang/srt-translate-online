1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,779
We can cancel an x minus 3 in the numerator and the denominator. We can also

2
00:00:04,779 --> 00:00:09,176
cancel an x minus 2. Now we're left with these factors. We want to be careful

3
00:00:09,176 --> 00:00:14,300
here. We can't simplify 3 x minus 2 and 3 x plus 2. They're not identical

4
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:18,187
rational expressions. And they're not opposite polynomials, since the 3 x have

5
00:00:18,187 --> 00:00:22,970
the same signs. The same is true of x minus 3 and x plus 3. The signs for the x

6
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:27,294
terms are the same. So these are not identical polynomials, and they're not

7
00:00:27,294 --> 00:00:32,922
opposite polynomials. We can, however, simplify 2x and 6x. You know, x divided

8
00:00:32,922 --> 00:00:38,175
by x equals 1. And 2 divided by 6 reduces to 1 third. You want to make sure you

9
00:00:38,175 --> 00:00:41,675
don't forget about monomial terms. Be sure to cancel common factors for the

10
00:00:41,675 --> 00:00:47,038
numbers. And common powers for the variables. After we've done that we have our

11
00:00:47,038 --> 00:00:53,798
simplified rational expression, 3x minus 2 times x minus 3 and 3x plus 2 times 3

12
00:00:53,798 --> 00:00:55,066
times x plus 3.
