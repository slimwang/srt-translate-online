00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,802
A spotlight in 3JS is similar to a spotlight in the real world. You shine this

2
00:00:03,802 --> 00:00:06,709
sort of light on something to make it the focus of attention. This emitter is

3
00:00:06,709 --> 00:00:09,732
like a point light in that it has a position. It's also like a directional

4
00:00:09,732 --> 00:00:12,925
light, in that you have to point it somewhere. However, there's one important

5
00:00:12,925 --> 00:00:16,854
addition. Control of the cone of light it forms. The main control in 3JS is the

6
00:00:16,854 --> 00:00:20,620
angle where the spotlight ends. There's also a fall off exponent that's similar

7
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:24,015
to how specular highlighting works. As you increase this number the spotlight

8
00:00:24,015 --> 00:00:28,039
becomes tighter. More elaborate spotlights are possible. For example, this is

9
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:31,997
3D Studio Max's spotlight. It uses two angles to control the outer cone, and a

10
00:00:31,997 --> 00:00:35,866
separate inner cone it calls a hot spot. The spotlight can also be circular or

11
00:00:35,866 --> 00:00:38,953
rectangular. There are no rules about what constitutes a spotlight, and with

12
00:00:38,953 --> 00:00:42,934
shader programming, you can create any sort of spotlight you can imagine. I

13
00:00:42,934 --> 00:00:45,076
should also mention, at this point, that you can put any number of lights in a

14
00:00:45,076 --> 00:00:48,250
scene. There's only one ambient light setting, but you can have as many spot,

15
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:52,510
point, and directional lights as you want. Each light's contribution is added

16
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:54,166
to the fragment's final color.
