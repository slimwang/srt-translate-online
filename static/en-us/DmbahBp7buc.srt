00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
[Thrun] In this specific example, the rule that we could apply is very, very simple.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Any 2 variables are independent if they're not linked by just unknown variables.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
So for example, if we know B, then everything downstream of B

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
becomes independent of anything upstream of B.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
E is now independent of C, conditioned on B.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
However, knowledge of B does not render A and E independent.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,000
In this graph over here, A and B connect to C and C connects to D and to E.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
So let me ask you, is A independent of E,

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
A independent of E given B,

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
A independent of E given C,

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
A independent of B,

12
00:00:43,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and A independent of B given C?
