00:00:00,158 --> 00:00:04,283
Well, server-side rendering is
normally the fastest way to go.

2
00:00:04,283 --> 00:00:07,616
It introduces a number
of extra challenges for

3
00:00:07,616 --> 00:00:11,803
a progressive web app that uses
the app shell model because

4
00:00:11,803 --> 00:00:15,960
the data is already embedded
in the user interface.

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:21,460
If the app caches the data as it was
served, including the embedded data,

6
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:26,076
it can quickly become stale and
instead of the dreaded flash of

7
00:00:26,076 --> 00:00:30,800
unstyled content,
you'll have a flash of outdated content.
