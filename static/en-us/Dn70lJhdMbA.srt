00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,810
This mockup is pretty similar to the portfolio mockup you worked on

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:04,730
in the previous lesson.

3
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:06,570
There are some differences, however.

4
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:09,780
For example, the layout of the work examples and

5
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:13,110
the color scheme, particularly that of the background.

6
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:17,020
You can see the colors and the hex codes on the left hand side of the screen.

7
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:19,890
But you should always start with looking at the design, and,

8
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:22,030
as always, consider the structure.

9
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:23,310
It should be pretty similar for

10
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:26,470
this mockup because it's so similar to the one you already did.

11
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:29,530
Despite the fact that you don't know anything about Bootstrap yet,

12
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,720
you can get started with a new webpage.

13
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:35,120
Now that you've got the design mockup, which steps can you complete now?

14
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,890
Can you create a folder structure for the project?

15
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:40,280
Can you create a DOM tree for the page?

16
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:43,340
Can you write HTML that defines the DOM?

17
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:46,150
Can you assign class names to HTML elements?

18
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:47,670
Can you write CSS?

19
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:49,580
And can you the test the page?

20
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:50,330
Check all that apply.
