1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Now let's take a look.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This was a potentially tricky quiz. Don't feel bad if you had a little trouble with it.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
We want this pplus nonterminal to correspond to one or more Ps.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
No matter which branch you take here, you're definitely getting at least one P,

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
but we need you to have the chance to get more.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
This option, pplus goes to P, corresponds to picking just one.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Pplus goes to P followed by pplus--this recursive rewrite rule

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Gives you the possibility to have as many as you want--possibly even infinite.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
We've seen that before with expression goes to expression plus expression.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Over here, this i-question mark is supposed to relate to i-option.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
One possibility is that you donâ€™t want to write an i at all, but another possibility is that you do.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Here this question mark means have either 1 or 0,

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
this the rule for having 1, and this is the rule for having 0.

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Some strings in this language or p, pi, ppi--that sort of thing.

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
In fact, if you have a bit of a musical theater bent,

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
you could imagine context-free grammars singing across to regular expressions

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
the classic line from Annie Get Your Gun,

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
"Anything you can do, I can do better. I can do anything better than you."

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
To which, classically, the opponent replies, "Can you bake a pie?" "No." "Neither can I."

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
But in fact, any regular expression relating to pi or something similar, as we've seen above,

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
can be handled both by our regular expression protagonist and our grammar protagonist.

22
00:01:37,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Just a fun little interlude.
