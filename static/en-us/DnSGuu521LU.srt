1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:01,640
So, our setup link.

2
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:02,560
>> There we go.

3
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:05,710
>> And I've become a huge fan of this little search box.

4
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:08,320
>> Oh man, life before that search box was really rough.

5
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,810
>> Who wants to navigate all this nonsense arrows and business?

6
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:17,040
Alright, so chatter. Chatter mobile, new. Is that what we're doing?

7
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:17,598
>> No.

8
00:00:17,598 --> 00:00:18,028
[LAUGH]

9
00:00:18,028 --> 00:00:21,670
Under build > Chatter, and then Feed Tracking.

10
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:23,950
>> Okay.

11
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:27,060
>> Okay, so just to give you a brief synopsis

12
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,300
of what we're looking at, this is showing you all of

13
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:31,410
the different objects that you have within your org. Both

14
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:33,700
the standard objects that are included, and the stuff we've created.

15
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:34,060
>> Mm hmm.

16
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:37,300
>> Now what we want to do, is we want to enable our stage

17
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:41,140
object for feed tracking, so that people can collaborate on a stage record.

18
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:41,710
>> Okay.

19
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:43,540
>> And so what this means, Enable for Feed Tracking,

20
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:45,370
means it's going to put a Chatter feed at

21
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:47,100
the top of our stage record, for people

22
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,350
to either follow the record if they want

23
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:51,930
to or just, you know, make post-songs record.

24
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:52,600
>> Okay.

25
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:56,420
>> So, we want to look for the stage object over here.

26
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:57,910
>> Stage, over here?

27
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:03,050
>> Yep. And so if we enable this for feed tracking.

28
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:03,783
>> Mm-hm.

29
00:01:03,783 --> 00:01:06,960
>> We can also select whatever fields we want to

30
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,730
show up in the feed if they were to change.

31
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:08,950
>> Okay.

32
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:12,660
>> Like for example, if we were to choose the stage manager field.

33
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:17,310
If we checked the stage manager field, whenever the stage manager gets changed.

34
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:17,310
>>

35
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:17,595
[CROSSTALK]

36
00:01:17,595 --> 00:01:17,721
Mm-hm.

37
00:01:17,721 --> 00:01:20,010
>> Or reassigned. That's going to automatically post to

38
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:22,525
the chatter feed, hey, the stage manager's changed from.

39
00:01:22,525 --> 00:01:22,915
[CROSSTALK]

40
00:01:22,915 --> 00:01:23,040
>> Cool.

41
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:23,780
>> Blah to blah.

42
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:28,290
>> Okay, so, I don't know let's follow the stage manager.

43
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:31,730
And if the size of the stage changes, he'd want to know.

44
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:32,080
>> Yeah.

45
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:35,400
>> I don't really think anything else would change enough to need it.

46
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,070
>> That looks good to me and then just click

47
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:40,660
Save. So you can configure this for any of the

48
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:43,650
objects in your organization if you say, just want to

49
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:46,740
get updated or collaborate on any of your custom schema.

50
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:46,963
>> Mm-hm.

51
00:01:46,963 --> 00:01:47,130
>> Yeah.

52
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:48,830
>> Okay

53
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:52,020
so we've enabled Chatter. What can I do now? Go back to stage?

54
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,440
>> Yeah, lets go back to the Stage Record.
