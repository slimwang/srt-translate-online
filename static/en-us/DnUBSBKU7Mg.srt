Pennies divided by 10, it's 43, because we have 435 divided by 10. That would

2
00:00:09,379 --> 00:00:17,115
be 43.5. The 0.5 is erased. We're left with 43. Now that means we have ten

3
00:00:17,115 --> 00:00:23,824
times 43 of 430 accounted for. And the remainder is 5. In general the remainder

4
00:00:23,824 --> 00:00:31,242
by 10 is always the last digit of a number. That's a useful fact to remember.
