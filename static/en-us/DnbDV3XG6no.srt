1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:05,190
After the data is prepared, the next
step is to perform the analysis and,

2
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:07,040
if appropriate, model the problem.

3
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:12,260
There are a number of different methods
available for performing the analysis.

4
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:15,940
In the next lesson of this course,
we'll go into detail on how to select

5
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:20,350
the methodology and modeling method
that is best suited for your scenario.

6
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:23,120
Let's us our electricity example
to elaborate on this step.

7
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:26,710
Earlier, in the problem
solving framework,

8
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:29,180
we determined that we needed
to predict the temperature for

9
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:32,850
the next day using some of
the factors we identified.

10
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:36,629
And then, we are going to predict the
electricity usage using the predicted

11
00:00:36,629 --> 00:00:39,040
temperature as well as other factors.

12
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,570
So we start by building
out a predictive model

13
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:44,560
that helps us predict
the temperature for the next day.

14
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:47,410
We have identified a number of
factors that may be good at predicting

15
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:48,510
temperature.

16
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:50,930
But we'll start with one to
create our initial model and

17
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:52,740
learn during the process.

18
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:55,533
Once we have created our first model,
we'll validate it and

19
00:00:55,533 --> 00:00:59,760
then determine if we need to update
the model with additional information.

20
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,755
Once we have a model that we can
confidently predict temperature with,

21
00:01:02,755 --> 00:01:06,760
we'll repeat the process to
predict electricity usage.

22
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:09,160
After creating a model that
we're comfortable with,

23
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,020
one that predicts electricity usage for

24
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:14,930
a given hour on the next day,
we need to perform our analysis.

25
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:17,650
This may include the number of
electricity plants that we need for

26
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:21,440
any given temperature, as well as
the thresholds when we need to activate

27
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:24,590
additional plants or
purchase electricity on the market.

28
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:27,610
We'll probably perform
the analysis step multiple times

29
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:30,000
until we have confidence
in our analysis.

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,500
So let's discuss how we get the level
of confidence that we need.
