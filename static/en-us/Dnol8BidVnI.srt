1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:03,570
So this is what my solution looks like.

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:08,550
I put each of the three elements on its
own line because I think it's easier to

3
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:09,930
read like this.

4
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:12,790
Either way it is actually
valid one line or

5
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:15,760
three lines but
I like this way a little bit more.

6
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:18,250
Notice that I have opening tags and

7
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:23,510
closing tags with content in between for
each of my three elements.

8
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:26,270
Also notice that my closing tags
look different because they

9
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:30,300
all have a slash here
after the less-than sign.

10
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,210
So let's see how this looks.

11
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:36,358
I've saved my file and I will come over
to the browser and I will hit refresh.

12
00:00:36,358 --> 00:00:41,370
And there you go, notice that
the p tag that says I'm Cameron

13
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:45,440
is all on its own line,
there is nothing next to it.

14
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,050
But the two spans that
say I like teaching, and

15
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:50,930
web dev :) are all on the same line.

16
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:54,330
Remember, this is a paragraph,
so it wants to be by itself.

17
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:58,630
But spans are part of a line,
so they are part of a line.

18
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:00,660
That's why I left this space right here.

19
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:03,000
So, that goes to show
you a couple things.

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,460
One, is that it's really not
too bad writing these things.

21
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:11,650
And two, every type of element
will display differently.

22
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:14,140
You'll be learning all about
the different elements and

23
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:16,250
the way that they display later on.
