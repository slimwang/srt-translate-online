1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:02,900
So here're some of the properties
of DEC_POMDPs that probably worth

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:03,880
knowing about.

3
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:04,620
As you pointed out,

4
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:08,189
there's elements of game theory and
POMDPs mixed together deliciously.

5
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,640
And as a result,

6
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:15,460
member POMDPs, well like I told
you the POMDPs are not computable.

7
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:20,440
So DEC-POMDPs are also not computable,
but in the finite horizon, POMDPs are P

8
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:25,495
space complete which is probably
definitely kind of hard.

9
00:00:25,495 --> 00:00:28,763
DEC-POMPDPs are actually known
to be NEXP-complete which is

10
00:00:28,763 --> 00:00:30,100
non-deterministic.

11
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:32,875
It's like NP except with
an X in the middle,

12
00:00:32,875 --> 00:00:35,800
non-deterministic exponential
time complete.

13
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,680
>> That sounds difficult.

14
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,100
>> Yeah, I mean so the best that we
know how to solve non-deterministic

15
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:44,630
exponential time problems
is double exponential time.

16
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:48,575
The shortest that it could possibly be
solvable is single exponential time.

17
00:00:48,575 --> 00:00:51,770
[LAUGH] So it's somewhere between
single and double exponential.

18
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:53,390
>> Like 1.2 exponential.

19
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:56,980
>> Well, it could be, could be 1,
could be 2, could be 1.8.

20
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:58,050
>> As long as we have choices.

21
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:01,140
>> One of the the beauties of this
model, one of the reasons that people in

22
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:06,460
spite of this computational challenge,
like to think about it, is because,

23
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:11,050
just like POMDPS are useful because
they let you think about actions to gain

24
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:15,420
information, DEC POMDPS let you
think about actions to communicate.

25
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:18,990
An optimal solution to a DEC POMDP has
to balance the cost of communicating

26
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:20,380
with the cost of not communicating.

27
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:22,310
So is it worth saying this at time?

28
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:24,740
>> Okay, that makes sense.

29
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:27,146
That sounds like some of the other
discussions about POM DPs, and

30
00:01:27,146 --> 00:01:29,030
exploration versus
exploitation trade offs.

31
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:30,040
>> Right.
But it gets into some of these

32
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,400
interesting questions
about communication.

33
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:35,960
So this is model that's fun to think
about if you're a multi-agent person or

34
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:40,280
maybe a natural language person or
a met natural language dialogue person

35
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:42,974
where you actually have to reason
about what's worth saying.

36
00:01:42,974 --> 00:01:43,860
>> Okay.

37
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:46,340
>> And there are some algorithms and
heuristics that are known,

38
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:48,425
there are some applications
that are known and

39
00:01:48,425 --> 00:01:52,460
just the last thing I want to do is
run us through a quick example, so

40
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:55,910
you can have a concrete example,
what it feels like to be in a DEC POMDP.

41
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:56,410
>> Okay.
