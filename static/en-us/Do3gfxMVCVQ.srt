>> That's good David. Note that when we did this problem previously using means

2
00:00:32,613 --> 00:00:36,779
analysis and product reduction, we ran in to all kinds of problems, because

3
00:00:36,779 --> 00:00:40,772
plans for property goals and we had no way of ordering these radius goals.

4
00:00:40,772 --> 00:00:44,420
Now we have a way, that's the power of partial [UNKNOWN].

5
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:49,910
Note also that this partial art of planning, this algorithm makes certain

6
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:54,810
things that are implicit in human reasoning, explicit. Presumably when you and

7
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:58,910
I reason about things we must be reasoning something like this, or

8
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:02,370
at least this is one hypothesis about how we might be reasoning. And we have

9
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:06,440
just made many of the operations of human reasoning so explicit and so precise.
