00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:04,135
Now, let's see if you can do one on your own. What do you think is the vertex

2
00:00:04,135 --> 00:00:09,095
form of this parabola? I want you to write it here, and I've already listed the

3
00:00:09,095 --> 00:00:14,130
y equals for you. Once you have the equation in vertex form, also tell me the

4
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:15,330
vertex.
