00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Formerly the class NP is the set of non-deterministic polynomial time decidable problems--

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
that is to say that it's a problem that can be dissolved by a program that runs in polynomial time

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
that has non-deterministic elements in it.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Now, I'm going to explain what that is in just a moment,

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
but first what I'd like to do is give you a handle on intuitively what this means.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I'd like to say the NP stands for nice puzzle problems, so let me explain what I mean by that.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Think of a problem like solving a Sudoku problem.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
You might phrase this as a decision problem by saying here is a grid,

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
can this be filled in to complete the Sudoku problem.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:51,000
It has to satisfy that if you don't know this is a very popular newspaper puzzle that involves--

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
you're given a bunch of numbers in a 9x9 grid and you have to fill in more numbers,

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
you have to fill in all the grid cells and ultimately, the solution that you fill in has to have the property

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:10,000
that every row in every column has the number 1 through 9 and each block into these dark blocks

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
also has the numbers 1 through 9.

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
So I can give you a Sudoku like this and it could be very, very challenging to know whether or not

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:25,000
this can be completed to satisfy the Sudoku constraints, but the next day in the newspaper

17
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
or if it's a puzzle magazine, may be at the back of the puzzle magazine.

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:36,000
It's very easy to convince you if the answer is yes, so if the answer is yes, then i can prove it you

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:44,000
by simply giving you a small what's called accepting certificate, which in this case just means

20
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
a filled in Sudoku board.

21
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
So if I filled in Sudoku board, you can very quickly do two things--check to see if it's correct,

22
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
if all the rows and columns have the number 1 through 9--

23
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:59,000
that's a polynomial time decision problem that you can write very easily,

24
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:06,000
and also check if the cells that you're given match what was given in the original puzzle

25
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
and that also is a very fast thing to be able to check.

26
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
All you have to do is run through the cells of the original puzzle and each time

27
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
there was something that was filled in, check if it matches in the answer.

28
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:27,000
So even though it maybe very difficult to answer the question if you're given the right kind of information

29
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
you can check it very fast.
