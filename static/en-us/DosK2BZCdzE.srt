1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:04,228
Two of these options are correct, if a to squared is the proportion of total

2
00:00:04,228 --> 00:00:08,324
variation due to between group differences total variation should be in the

3
00:00:08,324 --> 00:00:14,342
denominator. That rules out these middle two as an option and we are interested

4
00:00:14,342 --> 00:00:19,895
in the total variation due to between group differences. Therefore, between

5
00:00:19,895 --> 00:00:25,379
group differences must be in the numerator. Therefore, ETA squared are these

6
00:00:25,379 --> 00:00:26,208
two.
