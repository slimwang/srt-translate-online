1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,250
Alright, we're going to look at another algorithm that kind

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:06,170
of takes the idea of random restarts one step further.

3
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:09,240
Instead of just waiting until you hit a local optimum

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:12,380
to, to decide that you're going to randomly restart, there's always

5
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:15,460
a chance of taking a step in a downward direction

6
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:17,690
while you're trying to do your hill climbing. And the

7
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:21,310
algorithm that we're talking about in concretely is called Simulating

8
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:25,130
Annealing. So the basic idea is that we don't always improve.

9
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:28,570
Sometimes we actually need to search. We need to take the point

10
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:31,550
where we are now and wander away from it, with the hope

11
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:34,340
of finding something even better. And you can think of this as

12
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:37,790
being related to the notion exploring and exploiting. The hill climbing is what

13
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:40,790
it's doing is always trying to exploit. It's always trying to climb

14
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:43,810
its way up the hill as quickly as it can, which can

15
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:47,240
lead it to getting stuck. Exploring is the idea of visiting more

16
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:50,090
of the space with the hope that you can actually climb even further.

17
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:51,450
>> So,

18
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,790
which is better then, exploring or exploiting?

19
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:58,480
>> Well you have to trade these off really carefully. So, if you're just

20
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,540
exploring, it means you're just randomly wandering

21
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:01,890
around the space. You're not using any of

22
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:05,300
the local information to improve yourself. But if you only exploit then you can

23
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:08,450
get stuck in these local optima. So you need to do a bit of both.

24
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:09,940
>> So, since I'm always trying to connect

25
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:12,490
this back to stuff we talked before. If you

26
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:15,280
exploit all the time that's kind of like

27
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,810
overfitting. That's like believing your data too much and

28
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:20,070
not taking any chances at all. Does that make

29
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:21,810
sense or is that too much of a stretch?

30
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:24,650
>> I doesn't make sense to be me but I'm sure it make sense to you.

31
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:27,120
>> [LAUGH] It makes sense to me.

32
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:31,080
>> So you want to think of that as being kind of like overfitting.

33
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,210
>> Well, you know, the fundamental problem of overfitting, right,

34
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:36,880
is believing your data too much. And, and dealing with just

35
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,420
the coincidences of what you happen to see. And that's

36
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:42,950
like being very myopic. And exploiting, in this case, only taking

37
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:44,920
the direction which you go is like believing the data point

38
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:48,530
where you happen to be. I predict, from this one example, that

39
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:50,870
I should be headed in this direction, and I don't care about

40
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:53,790
anything else. And I'm not going to worry about anything else. Well,

41
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:56,220
that's kind of like believing too much, which is sort of

42
00:01:56,220 --> 00:02:01,560
what overfitting is. Meanwhile search on the other hand, the exploring, is

43
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:05,570
like believing nothing and taking advantage of nothing. So obviously as you

44
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:08,038
need to take, as you said, take advantage of the local information.

45
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:09,970
You need to believe it at least a little bit at least

46
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:14,080
some of time time or otherwise it's as if you've learned nothing.

47
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,540
>> Alright, well I definitely agree with

48
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:17,050
you that there's a trade-off there and that

49
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:19,078
there's a resemblance to overfitting. I don't,

50
00:02:19,078 --> 00:02:20,290
I don't know how deep that resemblance is.

51
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:23,820
>> Superficial. They're like twin cousins.

52
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:29,970
>> Twin cousins from another family branch. So the simulated annealing

53
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:31,620
algorithm that we're talking about is

54
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:34,020
related to an algorithm called Metropolis-Hastings,

55
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:37,684
which I always thought sounded really cool. And the whole

56
00:02:37,684 --> 00:02:42,170
idea of it actually gets into metallurgy. So here I drew

57
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:45,270
a picture of a sword. And we want the sword,

58
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:47,120
when we're making a sword if we're a blacksmith and we're

59
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,610
making a sword, we want it to be nice and

60
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:51,540
hard. And the way to make it hard and sharp, and,

61
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:56,030
and, and well structured, is for all the molecules to

62
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:59,020
be, be aligned in the same way. So they fit together

63
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:01,700
very snugly and they kind of lock in. And, so, there is

64
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:04,120
a bit of an optimization process that has to happen. There is

65
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:07,170
all these different ways that the molecules can be arranged and we

66
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:11,340
would like to settle into an arrangement that has the lowest energy. Well,

67
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:13,950
it turns out that the way blacksmiths have figured out to do

68
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:16,680
this is they will make the sword and then do repeated hea,

69
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:20,690
heating and cooling, and that actually show, they can see that that

70
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:22,420
actually strengthens the blade, and, and

71
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:24,030
what's really happening at the molecular level

72
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:26,290
is it's giving the molecules an opportunity to

73
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:29,090
realign themselves, to find an even better solution to

74
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:30,580
the problem of how they can all fit into

75
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:34,170
that space. So, this annealing is, is this idea

76
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:36,390
of heating and cooling. And we're not really

77
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:38,170
literally heating and cooling, though of course when we

78
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:40,550
run the computer it is getting a bit hotter.

79
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:43,020
We're just simulating the idea of the temperature changing.
