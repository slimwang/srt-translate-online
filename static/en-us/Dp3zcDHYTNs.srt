1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:04,490
We're going to explore the Medicare Dataset somewhat further.

2
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:09,970
Remember, we wanted to see how we can find anomalies in the data, but

3
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:16,500
to walk through the ways we can go about finding anomalies in data in general.

4
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:21,710
So, the next important question we are going to ask

5
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:25,480
is what are the variables of interest in the data set.

6
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:31,290
Lets switch back to the IPythonNotebook to investigate this.

7
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:36,800
We had seen from the summary of the data set that we

8
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,620
had 28 different columns of data.

9
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:41,910
The list of columns is long.

10
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:44,040
If you scroll to the bottom of it,

11
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:49,020
you will see six variables that may be of interest to us.

12
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:53,790
One of them is called average Medicare allowed amount.

13
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:57,570
The other is average the submitted charge amount.

14
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:59,570
And the Medicare payment amount.

15
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:05,420
These are the variables that have directly some indication of charges.

16
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:09,160
We're going to investigate these variables further.

17
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:13,850
Some of the other columns are very specific to Medicare and

18
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:19,640
could be useful if we did some more research on Medicare and the data.

19
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:24,370
However, without doing some domain-specific research, we can still see

20
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:30,910
that these variables could be of interest in detecting unusual charges.

21
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:35,560
To keep things simple, we are only going to use the average Medicare amount.

22
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:41,030
We can use the standard deviation of the Medicare allowed amount and

23
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:45,590
the submitted charge amounts and the payments amount as inherent,

24
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:49,340
irreducible variants in the average charges.

25
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,850
After looking at the variables of interest in the dataset,

26
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:59,530
we came to the conclusions that the allowed amount, the charged amount, and

27
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:04,050
the payment amounts might be of interest for our investigation.
