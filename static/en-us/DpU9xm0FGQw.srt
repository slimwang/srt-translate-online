1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,430
Remember the main idea of
the lower bound analysis.

2
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:07,930
You computed the minimum volume of
data sent by at least one node.

3
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:12,400
So if a node sends n squared over root
p words, how many messages is that?

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,570
Well remember every node
has a memory of size M, so

5
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:19,920
that means the largest message
that a node can send is M.

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,840
That means the number of messages is
at least the total volume divided by M.

7
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:27,020
So simplifying, you'll get this.

8
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:30,340
Since that's the minimum number of
messages that the node can send,

9
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:31,540
that becomes the alpha term.
