00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
And the answer is the mean is 5 as before. It's 25/5=5. σ² is a bit more difficult to compute.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:17,000
135/N, which is 5, that happens to 27 - 1/N² which is 25 of this expression X².

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:26,000
That's 25²--625 and of course, 25² divided by 25 is 25. The difference between 27 and 25 is 2.

4
00:00:26,000 --> 99:59:59,999
It's the same variance we had before, just computed a little bit differently.
