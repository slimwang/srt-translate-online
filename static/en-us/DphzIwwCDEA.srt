1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:05,320
All right, so we used a workflow, to, you know, automate these manual tasks,

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:08,490
tell people what's going on automatically. What's

3
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:10,580
next? What, what should we build next?

4
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:15,800
>> So, in our flow, we have handled, sort of, the maintenance side of things.

5
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:15,861
>> Mm-hm.

6
00:00:15,861 --> 00:00:18,480
>> But, what about the scheduling stuff? I mean,

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,850
we kind of built that out, but then, let it be.

8
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:25,560
>> Yeah, so scheduling, I imagine would look something like, I dunno,

9
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,710
whoever's doing the scheduling for the band says, hey, I

10
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:30,660
really like this band, let's schedule. Book him on the stage.

11
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:30,910
>> Right.

12
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:32,400
>> And then the stage manager probably gets

13
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,910
all upset because they're like hey, you didn't

14
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:35,670
tell me. Or, you know, the concert, the

15
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:37,810
festival promoter's like, woah, woah, woah, what's going on?

16
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:40,260
>> You three's already playing at that time. You can't have that time.

17
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:42,360
>> Yeah, yeah, I can't do that. Okay, so we need some way to

18
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:43,695
get these people talking to each other.

19
00:00:43,695 --> 00:00:45,688
Making sure that nobody's doing anything crazy.

20
00:00:45,688 --> 00:00:46,353
>> Right.

21
00:00:46,353 --> 00:00:46,918
>> Okay.

22
00:00:46,918 --> 00:00:49,570
>> So I imagine that would be the stage manager handling all that.

23
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:49,950
>> Okay.

24
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:50,630
>> So,

25
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:54,100
similar to how we could assign tasks and things like that

26
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:56,960
to a maintenance worker, we can do that to a stage manager.

27
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:57,970
>> Sounds reasonable.

28
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:01,670
>> And we could do that, like what we're talking about

29
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:05,260
right now. You know, approving these, book bands at certain set times.

30
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:05,651
>> Mm-hm.

31
00:01:05,651 --> 00:01:07,260
>> Using something really similar to

32
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:08,920
a workflow roll, called an approval process.

33
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:09,804
>> Okay, so this is the

34
00:01:09,804 --> 00:01:10,064
[SOUND]

35
00:01:10,064 --> 00:01:13,300
something you see with the stamp of approval before it can move on.

36
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:14,740
>> Right, I mean, it's just like a workflow

37
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:16,580
in the sense that you have automated actions, but

38
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:18,960
it involves that stamp of approval and that personal

39
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,520
interaction in order for it to complete the cycle.

40
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:21,950
>> Makes sense.

41
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:22,179
>> Yeah.

42
00:01:22,179 --> 00:01:22,530
>> Okay.
