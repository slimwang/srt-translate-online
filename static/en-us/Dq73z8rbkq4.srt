00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,290
Good job on finishing lesson 1.

2
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:05,090
Now you know how to process
data in a database.

3
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:08,029
We use the command line to
create a SQLite database and

4
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:10,050
you created a table within it.

5
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:13,050
Then we talked about how to
insert rows into the table, and

6
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:15,890
update them and also delete them.

7
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:18,720
Then we talked about the infinite
number of ways that you could query for

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,670
data to get back the rows and

9
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:24,560
the columns that you care about by using
a select statement and aware clause.
