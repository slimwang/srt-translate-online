1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,640
All right, I'll just go in order.

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:05,780
I'll start with the three
boxes we see here.

3
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:07,730
Each box takes up a third of the page.

4
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:13,030
So I'll set their width to 33%, and
the orders will go up sequentially.

5
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:15,270
One, two, and three.

6
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:18,280
On the next row down, the dark green.

7
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:21,765
And the orange boxes are both
taking up 50% of view port, so

8
00:00:21,765 --> 00:00:27,050
as their widths to 50% and
their orders are four and five.

9
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:29,790
And lastly there's another element that
takes up the full width of the view

10
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:33,560
ports this would be something probably
like a footer on the page, and

11
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:37,610
because it goes the whole view
port width it has a width of 100%.

12
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:40,468
And I set its order to
six because it's last.

13
00:00:40,468 --> 00:00:44,320
You might have decided to give each
element a different order number, and

14
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,748
that's totally fine, so long as
they're in the right sequential order.

15
00:00:48,748 --> 00:00:53,580
I could have just as easily picked
increasing prime numbers, but

16
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:54,760
that would've just been silly.
