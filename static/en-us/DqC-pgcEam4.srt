00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,942
Okay. Let's look at the data and compare the two distributions. The population

2
00:00:03,942 --> 00:00:08,856
mean, in other words the average number of blue M&M's across all of our bags,

3
00:00:08,856 --> 00:00:13,445
was 11.25. The expected value, in other words the mean of all the means we took

4
00:00:13,445 --> 00:00:20,430
from our 50 random samples. Is 11.08. Notice those are pretty close. They're not

5
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:25,660
exactly the same, but they are not far off. The population standard deviation

6
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:32,993
for all 48 plates or bags was 3.49. >> Hi, it's me again. Let's recap Professor

7
00:00:32,993 --> 00:00:36,926
Rogers and Professor Laraways experiment, and then predict what happened before

8
00:00:36,926 --> 00:00:41,620
they tell us their result. So they took a bag of M&Ms and they calculated the

9
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:46,664
number of blue M&Ms in that bag. So this is the first bag and they put it on a

10
00:00:46,664 --> 00:00:52,124
plate labelled plate number 1 and n1 represents the number of blue M&Ms in that

11
00:00:52,124 --> 00:00:57,332
bag or now on that plate and they did that with the second bag and counted the

12
00:00:57,332 --> 00:01:02,582
number of blue M&Ms. And they did that up to number 48, and they have 48 bags,

13
00:01:02,582 --> 00:01:08,003
and they dumped each bag onto one plate. So here's our population, the number of

14
00:01:08,003 --> 00:01:13,845
blue M&Ms on each plate. They found that the mean is 11.25 blue M&M's, and the

15
00:01:13,845 --> 00:01:19,714
standard deviation is 3.49. From this population, professors Laraway, and

16
00:01:19,714 --> 00:01:24,972
Rodgers, randomly selected five plates. And then they counted the number of blue

17
00:01:24,972 --> 00:01:30,540
M&M's divided by 5, and got the average number of blue M&M's. And then they did

18
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:36,765
this 50 times. Can you believe it? So then they got 50 sample means. So now

19
00:01:36,765 --> 00:01:41,273
let's take a quick quiz. According to the Central Limit Theorem, approximately

20
00:01:41,273 --> 00:01:45,695
what should be the mean and standard deviations of this distribution of sample

21
00:01:45,695 --> 00:01:51,968
means? So write your answer here. When you calculate these, remember you're

22
00:01:51,968 --> 00:01:57,350
calculating the theoretical probability, which is based on using every possible

23
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:03,130
sample of size 5 from this population. But here they're using only 50 samples of

24
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:07,805
size 5. There are a lot more, but we can't expect professors Rogers and Laraway

25
00:02:07,805 --> 00:02:13,171
to do that. That would really take forever. So calculate the theoretical mean

26
00:02:13,171 --> 00:02:17,203
and standard error based on the central limit theorem.
