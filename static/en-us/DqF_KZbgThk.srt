1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,910
Let's talk about answers to these
questions we have ,about how many

2
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:10,480
vulnerabilities do we know about in
software that is running on our systems.

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:13,200
So, first there's how
many vulnerabilities

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,880
do you think are there in the NVD?

5
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:20,030
Unfortunately, the number is
the largest possible that we have

6
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:22,900
is the answers is close to 70,000.

7
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:25,818
The last time I checked
it was 69,000 something.

8
00:00:25,818 --> 00:00:30,045
We're talking about tens of
thousands of vulnerability.

9
00:00:30,045 --> 00:00:33,835
To that there is millions and million
of lines code out there, that have been

10
00:00:33,835 --> 00:00:38,135
developed by all kind of people and
companies and things like that.

11
00:00:38,135 --> 00:00:42,405
But these vulnerabilities that can
be exploited by attackers are not

12
00:00:42,405 --> 00:00:45,340
necessarily very rare,
we know about lots and

13
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:47,410
lots of them so that's answer is 70,000.

14
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:51,540
So then we going to focus
just on buffer overflows,

15
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:54,570
we know what exactly
buffer overflows are.

16
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:58,160
We going to do our,
fix our vulnerability for checking or

17
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,620
things like that.

18
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:01,390
We know we can make them go away.

19
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:06,950
Well, the last three months if you look
at, and this is sometime in middle

20
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:12,250
of March in 2015,
we actually have close to 100, actually

21
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:16,730
the number was 107 I think, buffer
overflow vulnerabilities that have been

22
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:21,250
reported to the National Vulnerability
Database in just the last three months.

23
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:23,330
If you look at the last three years,

24
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:27,050
the number is about 1,000,
a little over 1,000,

25
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:32,330
which means the rate at which these
come at us not necessarily decreasing.

26
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:34,350
Because in three months,
if you have close to 100,

27
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:37,760
in a year you'll have about 400.

28
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:41,010
In three years we'll have 1,200,
so it's in the range.

29
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:44,480
Looks like we're seeing this
vulnerabilities becoming known

30
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:47,650
at the rate that doesn't seem
to be going down significantly,

31
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:50,090
compared to two years ago or
something like that.

32
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:54,870
So the answers are that even when we
focus on buffer overflow ,we seeing

33
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:57,500
almost a vulnerability everyday.

34
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,500
Close to 100 over three months.

35
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:00,980
That's about 90 some days.

36
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:05,810
So we're seeing almost a new buffer
overflow vulnerability every day,

37
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:10,030
leading to thousands of those or
close to 1,000 in the last three years.

38
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:14,120
So the takeaway here is that
software vulnerabilities.

39
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,190
Now we know how they get exploited.

40
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:20,310
They are out there and
they provide a very viable path for

41
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:24,290
attackers to craft attacks and
gain control of our systems.

42
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:28,560
And we know that, we discovering
them almost on a daily basis.

43
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,550
And the attackers
perhaps know about them.

44
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:34,470
They discover them before you do, and
then they're able to exploit them.

45
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:39,440
Because you don't have any defenses or
any widely deployed patches to fix them.
