00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,349
So far we've seen success with loading image data. But it would be great if we

2
00:00:03,349 --> 00:00:07,068
could extend this functionality into loading JavaScript files too. The good

3
00:00:07,068 --> 00:00:10,524
news is that you can add a JavaScript file to the DOM dynamically and just like

4
00:00:10,524 --> 00:00:15,578
with images, you get a callback function, once the file has been loaded. So,

5
00:00:15,578 --> 00:00:18,384
what you need to do now, is to fill in the rest of this code, to allow the load

6
00:00:18,384 --> 00:00:21,052
assets function to take a list of file names, which might be images, or

7
00:00:21,052 --> 00:00:25,768
JavaScript, and load them correctly. Which means is that in here, before we

8
00:00:25,768 --> 00:00:28,792
actually issue off our command, we need to figure out what type of file we're

9
00:00:28,792 --> 00:00:33,066
trying to load. Tricky, tricky. You may have to look at the file name's

10
00:00:33,066 --> 00:00:34,840
extension, to determine this.
