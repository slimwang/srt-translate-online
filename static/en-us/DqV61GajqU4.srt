00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,034
Since we're factoring by grouping, we want to look at these first two terms

2
00:00:05,034 --> 00:00:10,351
first, 2z cubed minus 3z squared. The only common factor that they share is a z

3
00:00:10,351 --> 00:00:15,490
squared. So we can rewrite them as z squared times 2z minus 3. Now, onto the

4
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:20,463
last two terms, negative 6z plus 9 has a common factor of negative 3. Now, of

5
00:00:20,463 --> 00:00:25,113
course, we could have pulled out a positive three instead and left this as a

6
00:00:25,113 --> 00:00:29,838
negative 2z plus 3, but I'd rather have a positive coefficient in front of my

7
00:00:29,838 --> 00:00:34,669
variable, that's just a personnel preference thing. Now we just pull out the

8
00:00:34,669 --> 00:00:39,487
common factor between the two terms we have left, that common factor is 2z minus

9
00:00:39,487 --> 00:00:43,693
3 and then what's left over is z squared minus 3. And voila, we are fully

10
00:00:43,693 --> 00:00:44,320
factored.
