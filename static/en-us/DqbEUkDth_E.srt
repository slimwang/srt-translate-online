00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Let's recap the TLS Handshake.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
There's an important part of it that we haven't focused on yet.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
The first step is the hello from the client to server.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
The second step, the server responds--both of these messages include new randomness,

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and part of this response is the certificate.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,000
In the third step, the client sends a new random value encrypted with the server's public key.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
At the end of this process, the client and the server have agreed on the master secret,

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
which is used to derive the keys for communication.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
So the key question and the goal of the protocol is for the client to know

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
that it's communicating with the correct server,

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
and that that master secret is only shared with the server it intends to communicate with.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
The question is how can the client trust that it's communicating

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
with the server it intends to communicate with.

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Here are the choices, select the best answer, and I should warn you

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
this is a bit of an unfair question since we haven't talked about this yet,

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
but I think you'll know enough to figure out the answer based on what you've seen so far.
