00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,708
For our second quiz where you have to define your own procedure,

2
00:00:03,708 --> 00:00:05,385
we'll make things a little more complicated.

3
00:00:05,385 --> 00:00:07,446
Now you're going to define a procedure.

4
00:00:07,462 --> 00:00:13,138
We'll call it sum3, and the reason I'm calling it sum3 is because it takes 3 inputs.

5
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:17,154
This is to distinguish it from the example, sum procedure, that we saw earlier

6
00:00:17,154 --> 00:00:18,873
that only takes 2 inputs.

7
00:00:18,873 --> 00:00:23,508
What sum3 should do is output the sum of those 3 inputs.

8
00:00:23,508 --> 00:00:27,169
So as an example, if you define sum3 correctly,

9
00:00:27,169 --> 00:00:30,992
if we print out the result of sum3,

10
00:00:30,992 --> 00:00:35,646
passing in 1, 2, and 3 as the inputs,

11
00:00:35,646 --> 00:00:39,398
the output should be the result of 1 + 2 + 3

12
00:00:39,398 --> 00:00:43,000
Last I checked, that was 6.
