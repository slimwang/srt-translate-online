Learning by correcting mistakes is a fundamental process of human learning.

2
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:06,750
In fact, it may closely resemble the way you and

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:11,440
I learn and practice. In our lives, we rarely are passive learners.

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:16,120
Most of the time we're active participants in the learning process. Even in

5
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:19,680
a difficult setting like this, you're not just listening to what I'm saying.

6
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,190
Instead, you're using your knowledge and reasoning, to make sense of what I'm

7
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:28,390
saying. You generate expectations. Sometimes those expectations may be violated.

8
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:30,860
When they're violated, we generate explanations for

9
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:35,740
them. We try to figure out, what was in error, in your knowledge and reasoning.

10
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:40,770
This, is learning by correcting mistakes. Notice, that you think about your own

11
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:44,490
thinking, a step towards meta-reasoning, which is our next lesson.
