00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,794
Now that we have a single fraction on one side of our inequality, and zero on

2
00:00:03,794 --> 00:00:07,638
the other side, we can finally start to solve for x. First of all, what are the

3
00:00:07,638 --> 00:00:11,669
critical numbers here? What does x need to equal to make the numerator zero? And

4
00:00:11,669 --> 00:00:15,463
what does it need to equal to make the denominator zero? These will be our two

5
00:00:15,463 --> 00:00:16,430
critical numbers.
