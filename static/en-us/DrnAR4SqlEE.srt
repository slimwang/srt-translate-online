1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So let's do one final exercise.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Now I am throwing dice.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
The difference between dice and coins is that there are now 6 possible outcomes.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Let me just draw them, and say it's a fair die,

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
which means each of the different sides comes up with a probability over 6

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
for any of the numbers you can plug in over here.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
What do you think the probability is the die comes up with an even number?

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm going to write this as the outcome of the die is even.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 99:59:59,999
And you can once again use a truth table to calculate that number.
