00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,864
For this one, I think we should use elimination. If I multiply the first

2
00:00:04,864 --> 00:00:10,176
equation by positive 2, I could wind up with a positive 12 x, which would be the

3
00:00:10,176 --> 00:00:15,047
opposite in sign of this negative 12 x. This would let me eliminate the x

4
00:00:15,047 --> 00:00:19,965
variables. 2 times 6 x is 12 x. 2 times negative 5 y is negative 10 y. And 2

5
00:00:19,965 --> 00:00:24,302
times positive 3 is positive 6. So, I have the new first equation, and then I

6
00:00:24,302 --> 00:00:28,333
just rewrite my second equation right under it. So, elimination would probably

7
00:00:28,333 --> 00:00:31,952
be the best here. We choose elimination over the other two because, with

8
00:00:31,952 --> 00:00:35,734
substitution, we don't have any single variable solved for. And I know if I

9
00:00:35,734 --> 00:00:39,721
solve for these variables, I'd have to divide by coefficients, like 12 or 10.

10
00:00:39,721 --> 00:00:43,627
That could create fractions in my substitution, which would make my math more

11
00:00:43,627 --> 00:00:47,533
complicated. I know graphing would be more difficult, too, because I would

12
00:00:47,533 --> 00:00:51,315
either have to create tables, or solve these equations for y and put them in

13
00:00:51,315 --> 00:00:52,477
slope intercept form.
