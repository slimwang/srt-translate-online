1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Initially there is only A,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
and the maximum likelihood we get the probability of A being in the first place is 1,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
and all the other ones are 0.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
There are 7 transitions out of A as indicated by the lines under the As over here.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
In 3 cases, A is followed by A--over here, over here, and over here.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
This gives us 3/7 for the maximum likelihood estimator.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
A flows into B in another 3 cases--over here, over here, and over here--again, 3/7.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
There is 1 instance where A moves into C--1/7.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
There are 4 transitions out of B--

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
3 go to C, and 1 goes to B over here,

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
which gives us 0, 1/4, and 3/4.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Then there are 4 transitions out of C--one, two, three, four--

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
3 of which result in C, but one goes into A over here.

14
00:00:55,000 --> 99:59:59,999
These are the results--1/4, 0, and 3/4.
