1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,019
So Implicit memory is also called non-declarative memory because we can not

2
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:09,275
directly recall this type of memory. Implicit memory is a kind of memory that's

3
00:00:09,275 --> 00:00:13,240
made up of knowledge based on previous experiences such as skills that we

4
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:19,126
preform automatically once you have mastered them. Implicit memory resides

5
00:00:19,126 --> 00:00:23,234
outside of our conscience awareness. So for implicit memory, we know how to do

6
00:00:23,234 --> 00:00:26,946
something, for example ride a bike, but it's difficult to describe how we can

7
00:00:26,946 --> 00:00:32,296
preform the skills we know how to do so well. For example, I know how to scuba

8
00:00:32,296 --> 00:00:35,407
dive, and I love to dive, but it's difficult for me to describe how you swim

9
00:00:35,407 --> 00:00:40,590
through the water. Make sure you're weighted right, have to inflate or deflate

10
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:44,800
your bcd, it's something you have to experience for yourself. On the other

11
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,714
hand, Susan knows how to knit and she can knit really pretty scarves, but if

12
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:50,487
you ask her how to explain it or give you step by step instructions like I

13
00:00:50,487 --> 00:00:55,625
have, it's hard for her to do that. So for the example of Susan and knowing how

14
00:00:55,625 --> 00:00:58,712
to knit, she needs to know where her fingers belong, where the needles go and

15
00:00:58,712 --> 00:01:03,924
how to move the yarn around. This is an example of procedural memory. So

16
00:01:03,924 --> 00:01:08,212
procedural memory refers to the knowledge we hold for almost any behavior or

17
00:01:08,212 --> 00:01:13,650
physical skill we've learned. Again this could be things like driving a manual

18
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:19,058
transmission car, knitting, scuba diving, playing hockey or any sport. Priming

19
00:01:19,058 --> 00:01:24,175
is another type of Implicit memory. Priming occurs when recall is improved by

20
00:01:24,175 --> 00:01:29,645
prior exposure to the same or similar stimuli. In fact memory is better for

21
00:01:29,645 --> 00:01:32,906
information that relates to prior knowledge.
