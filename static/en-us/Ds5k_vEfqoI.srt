00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,320
To put our overly
infrastructure to work,

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:05,040
let's start by displaying
Giggi Gals' remaining ammo.

3
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:10,128
Next, we'll start calculating a score
based on how many times Giggi Gal hits

4
00:00:10,128 --> 00:00:13,250
enemies and
how many enemies she destroys.

5
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:17,424
Finally, we'll start keeping track of
how many lives Giggi Gal has left, and

6
00:00:17,424 --> 00:00:18,900
add that to the HUD as well.

7
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:21,660
Check out the to do's in the course
code to make a helpful HUD.
