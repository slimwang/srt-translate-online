1
00:00:00,235 --> 00:00:03,790
Wow, can you believe the amount
of code we just waded through?

2
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:06,730
We first looked at templates
which are just strings.

3
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:09,590
They use delimiters to section off
where JavaScript data will appear.

4
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:13,270
Underscores template
function returns a function.

5
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:14,680
We then call this function with data.

6
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:18,190
Then we saw how backbone handles events.

7
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:20,380
It takes an event object and
stores an event and

8
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:23,490
callback function in
an _events property.

9
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:27,460
When the event is triggered on the
object, it runs the callback function.

10
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:31,060
And we just dug into how routing and
backbone.history work.

11
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:33,110
The app's router sets up the routes and

12
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:36,276
their callback function in
backbone.history.handlers.

13
00:00:36,276 --> 00:00:40,510
Then backbone.history.start
watches the URL for changes.

14
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:44,330
If the URL matches a route,
then it runs the callback function.

15
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:47,940
These three abilities,
templates, events, and routing,

16
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:52,270
are key aspects of how frameworks make
developing complicated apps easier.

17
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:54,910
In the next lesson, we'll move from
looking at the inner workings of

18
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:57,480
Backbone to Angular,
a framework by Google.
