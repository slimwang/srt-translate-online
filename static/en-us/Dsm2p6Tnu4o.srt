1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,530
Now that we know the 0s are negative 2 3rds and positive 5, we can set up our

2
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:08,357
three intervals on our number line. Now, I want you to test each of these

3
00:00:08,357 --> 00:00:13,453
intervals to determine which ones are part of the solution set. Again, if you

4
00:00:13,453 --> 00:00:16,305
plug in a value in this region and the statement winds up being true, then we

5
00:00:16,305 --> 00:00:20,800
include this as part of our solution set. If the statement turns out to be

6
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,089
false, then we exclude the interval from the solution set.
