00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,355
So, I hope you remember from the last lecture the concepts of convolution and

2
00:00:03,355 --> 00:00:05,870
cross-correlation.

3
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:09,670
We'd looked at in detail, this was how we denote the symbol for

4
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:14,440
doing convolution between a kernel and an input image to get an output.

5
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:17,360
Just related also the convolution method.

6
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:21,400
The big difference between them is how we loop around the matrix or

7
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:25,710
the input image to be able to then assign attributes from the filter.

8
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:27,000
And basically, using this method,

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,050
we can apply various types of filters to process images.

10
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:32,070
And we actually looked at how we can do this for

11
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:36,250
doing noise removal and blurring and smoothing of images.

12
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:40,660
Of course, you should by now remember that depending on h, if it's symmetric or

13
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:43,530
not, you have to choose which one of these to apply.
