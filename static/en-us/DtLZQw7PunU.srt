00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:02,900
If you take nothing else
away from this lesson,

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:07,720
just remember that there are five main
monetization models available to you.

3
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:11,836
Premium, freemium,
which is currently extremely popular,

4
00:00:11,836 --> 00:00:16,020
subscriptions, e-commerce, and ads.

5
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:20,000
>> Also remember,
that no matter what model you choose,

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,130
your goal is to charge the right users,
at the right time with the right amount.

7
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:28,970
>> So, now we've kind of got an overview
of all of the methods available.

8
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:30,610
How do our entrepreneurs choose one?

9
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:33,210
>> We'll get into that
in the next lesson.

10
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:36,020
Come back and join us when you're ready.
