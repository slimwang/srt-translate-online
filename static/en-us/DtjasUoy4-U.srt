00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,960
Here we are inside the CSS documentation on Bootstrap's website.

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:07,700
Inside the images section, we find something about responsive images.

3
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:08,590
This is what we want.

4
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:10,980
We want our images to be responsive-friendly.

5
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:15,120
It looks like we only need to add the image responsive class to make sure our

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,120
images are, well, responsive.

7
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,190
Let's see if that works.

8
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:19,710
Let's go ahead and open up DevTools.

9
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:21,600
And I'll go ahead and try it out on this image.

10
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,470
Booting it up.

11
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:23,570
I've got image here.

12
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:26,900
I'll right-click on it, add attribute.

13
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:30,940
So we've applied the class image responsive to this image in particular.

14
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:33,910
Let's go ahead and resize the page and see if it works.

15
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:37,060
I will make it smaller, and smaller, and

16
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:39,238
smaller until we're about the size of mobile.

17
00:00:39,238 --> 00:00:41,800
And because we've added that responsive image class,

18
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:45,770
you can see the entire image fitting within the width of this small frame.

19
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:48,684
So, the correct class is img-responsive.
