00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,054
Now we're ready for the final step of parsing our map data. We want to keep

2
00:00:04,066 --> 00:00:07,810
track of each tile set that our map loads. So we need to keep an array of

3
00:00:07,822 --> 00:00:11,856
available tile sets in our tile map class. Now what you need to do is while we

4
00:00:11,868 --> 00:00:15,910
are parsing our tile sets, create a new object and populate the array we just

5
00:00:15,922 --> 00:00:20,138
showed you containing all the attributes or our tile set from our data file. For

6
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:24,134
example, first GID, image, image width, et cetera. Finally we'll need push this

7
00:00:24,146 --> 00:00:25,933
object into our array of tile sets.
