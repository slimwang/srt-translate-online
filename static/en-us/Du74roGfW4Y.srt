1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:02,975
So we talked about a trusted path,
remember?

2
00:00:02,975 --> 00:00:06,335
So, between the user and
the trusted computing base he or

3
00:00:06,335 --> 00:00:07,528
she wants to log in.

4
00:00:07,528 --> 00:00:11,313
They want to provide the password
to the trusted computing base.

5
00:00:11,313 --> 00:00:12,859
Okay?
So they need to have a path

6
00:00:12,859 --> 00:00:14,578
to the trusted computing base, and

7
00:00:14,578 --> 00:00:18,033
that's what we talked about when we
were talking about a trusted path.

8
00:00:18,033 --> 00:00:22,295
So this question's saying what
problem would arise if we don't have

9
00:00:22,295 --> 00:00:23,330
a trusted path?
