1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:07,523
The correct factorization of this trinomial is 5y squared times 5x minus 4 times

2
00:00:07,523 --> 00:00:12,362
2x plus 1. That was a pretty tough problem, How do you do? If you got it right,

3
00:00:12,362 --> 00:00:15,820
you are on your way to being a factoring genius. Let's see how we got this

4
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:19,732
answer. Remember, when I'm factoring any polynomial, I want to check to see if

5
00:00:19,732 --> 00:00:23,680
there's a greatest common factor. When I look at these three terms, I notice a

6
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:29,079
couple of things. The first thing I notice is all three terms have a y-squared.

7
00:00:29,079 --> 00:00:33,974
In that case, I should be able to factor out a y-squared. The other thing that I

8
00:00:33,974 --> 00:00:39,366
notice is that each of the three terms is divisible by 5. So this polynomial has

9
00:00:39,366 --> 00:00:44,738
a GCF of 5 y-squared. When I factor out the 5 y-squared from each term, what am

10
00:00:44,738 --> 00:00:50,760
I left with? When I factor out the GCF, I'm left with 10 x squared, minus 3 x

11
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:56,992
minus 4. 5 y squared times 10 x squared gives me the 50 x squared y squared. 5 y

12
00:00:56,992 --> 00:01:02,725
squared times negative 3 x is negative 15 x y squared, and negative 4 times 5 y

13
00:01:02,725 --> 00:01:08,692
squared gives me the negative 20 y squared. After I factor out the GCF, I need

14
00:01:08,692 --> 00:01:14,420
to look at the remaining polynomial, 10 x squared minus 3 x minus 4. Now I have

15
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:18,818
to factor this trinomial. Remember when there is a coefficient in front of the x

16
00:01:18,818 --> 00:01:23,034
squared variable, you have to multiply the coefficient of the x squared variable

17
00:01:23,034 --> 00:01:28,550
by the constant term. To factor this polynomial, I have to look at the factors

18
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:34,375
of 10 times negative 4 which is negative 40, that add up to negative 3. There

19
00:01:34,375 --> 00:01:38,663
are a lot of different factors that multiply together to get negative 40, but

20
00:01:38,663 --> 00:01:43,018
the factors that multiply together to get negative 40, and add together to get

21
00:01:43,018 --> 00:01:49,294
negative 3, are negative 8 and 5. Negative 8 times 5 is negative 40, negative 8

22
00:01:49,294 --> 00:01:54,295
plus 5 is negative 3. Now we need to rewrite the middle term, using these two

23
00:01:54,295 --> 00:02:01,124
factors. When I rewrite negative 3x using my factors, I get 10x squared minus 8x

24
00:02:01,124 --> 00:02:06,650
plus 5x which gives me the negative 3x minus 4. Now I can factor by grouping.

25
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:12,850
When I factor by grouping, I notice that the GCF of the first two terms is 2x,

26
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:19,915
and I have 5x minus 4. 2x times 5x is 10x squared. 2x times negative 4 gives me

27
00:02:19,915 --> 00:02:24,421
negative 8x. Now this is an interesting situation. Here I have 5x minus 4, and

28
00:02:24,421 --> 00:02:30,534
that's what I want my second binomial to be. So what do I factor out? There is

29
00:02:30,534 --> 00:02:35,816
no GCF here. Well, technically there is a GCF, but the GCF is simply one. 1

30
00:02:35,816 --> 00:02:44,912
times 5x, 5x. 1 times negative 4 is negative 4. Now I see the same binomial in

31
00:02:44,912 --> 00:02:51,720
both places, so I can now factor that out. Don't forget to bring along our

32
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:57,780
overall GCF, 5x minus 4 times 2x plus 1. That was a pretty difficult problem.

33
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:01,883
Great job if you got it right. If not maybe try it again.
