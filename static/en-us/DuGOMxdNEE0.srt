00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:04,180
Re-shooting video ten, create and evaluate an estimator.

2
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:05,610
Let's summarize where we are.

3
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:08,760
So recall we started with the initial general question,

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:11,070
can we predict the next time a person will tweet?

5
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:12,930
So we started with a general question,

6
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:15,420
can we predict the next time a person will tweet.

7
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:19,440
We decided to use the number of seconds since last tweet,

8
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,030
in order to quantify the problem.

9
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:25,000
We decided that we wanted to estimate the number of seconds since last tweet,

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,040
using the regression estimator.

11
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:31,110
And we modeled that regression estimator using an exponential fit,

12
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:34,770
which gave us an initial data parameter of 1451.5 seconds.

13
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,660
We then used half things inequality to put a confidence band around that.

14
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:43,042
Now, lets see how this guess turns out.

15
00:00:43,042 --> 00:00:46,412
So, for each value in our time until next list,

16
00:00:46,412 --> 00:00:51,820
we're going to subtract from it, our guess of 1451 and a half seconds.

17
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:56,560
Then we'll just collect those values, in this list (exp_diffs).

18
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,630
And, just to pick up from where we were before,

19
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:01,530
here's a histogram of those sign differences.

20
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:03,580
So, the first thing you might notice,

21
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:08,070
which is very interesting, is that most of this graph occurs before 0.

22
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:10,840
The meaning of this is that most of the time our guess is

23
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,560
over estimating the actual intertweet time, so

24
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:16,540
to make this quantitative let's use the describe method.

25
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:21,670
As you can see here, over 50% of the time it overestimates the time until

26
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:24,720
next tweet, by at least 18 and a half minutes.

27
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,210
Now in the next video we'll continue to investigate the results of our model,

28
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:30,970
but before we do that it's time for a quiz.
