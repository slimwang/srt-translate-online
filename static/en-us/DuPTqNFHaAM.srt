00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:03,740
Here are some of the coding steps that
we'll need to do in the quick report app

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:05,850
to get the network
request set up properly.

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:11,023
First of all, should remove the hard
coded JSON response in QueryUtils.

4
00:00:11,023 --> 00:00:15,853
Then, you're going to need to add
helper methods in QueryUtils to create

5
00:00:15,853 --> 00:00:18,751
a URL object, perform a network request,

6
00:00:18,751 --> 00:00:22,870
convert the InputStream to a string and
then parse the JSON.

7
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:27,140
Then, you going to need to modify
the JSON parsing method to

8
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:30,520
extract a list of earthquakes
from the web server response.

9
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:34,790
Declare EarthquakeAsyncTask as
an inner class to MainActivity.

10
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:35,600
And create and

11
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:40,120
execute an EathquakeAsyncTask in
the MainActivity onCreate() method.

12
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:43,350
Finally, you'll need to
add internet permission.

13
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:46,100
If you provided more details,
then good for you.

14
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:48,710
That shows that you're
really able to think ahead

15
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:50,990
on what code you need to write for
a given task.
