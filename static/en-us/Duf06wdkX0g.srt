2
00:00:03,208 --> 00:00:07,498
One of the most surprising things about
seeing the results of the hundreds and

3
00:00:07,498 --> 00:00:11,328
hundreds of competitions isn't
the competitions themselves, but

4
00:00:11,328 --> 00:00:12,130
who won them.

5
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:15,430
If you were following machine
learning a decade ago,

6
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:18,190
then you'd think that people doing
interesting work in machine learning

7
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:24,122
were limited to a couple of large
companies that operating online,

8
00:00:24,122 --> 00:00:29,070
a couple hedge funds, and
some top academic labs,

9
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:33,820
but running hundreds of competitions
exposed that's not the case whatsoever.

10
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:38,140
People great at machine learning come
from a really diverse array of different

11
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:40,340
backgrounds and different countries.

12
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:43,460
Most of our winners actually
are from outside the US,

13
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:46,680
so many different
countries around the world.

14
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:51,040
Many of them aren't bright eyed,
fresh machine learning

15
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:54,990
phd students better, instead people
who have worked 40 years in another

16
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:59,705
career, such as computer science or
physics or electrical engineering.

17
00:00:59,705 --> 00:01:03,100
And they've read a lot
about machine learning and

18
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:05,330
AI, which piques their curiosity.

19
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:06,910
They became passionate about it.

20
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:11,360
And they spent several years of their
free time to really grow their skills

21
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,027
there and
grow deep into machine learning.

22
00:01:14,027 --> 00:01:16,715
So the diversity of the people
who win competitions is

23
00:01:16,715 --> 00:01:18,754
the single most surprising thing to me.

24
00:01:18,754 --> 00:01:22,171
[BLANK_AUDIO]

25
00:01:22,171 --> 00:01:27,082
Right now, machine learning is still
in its very much in its infancy.

26
00:01:27,082 --> 00:01:30,979
It is difficult to get machine
learning algorithms to work well and

27
00:01:30,979 --> 00:01:34,109
to work reliably, and
on a decade long time horizon,

28
00:01:34,109 --> 00:01:36,460
that is going to completely change.

29
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:38,950
Right now, if I want to spin up a new,
reliable web service,

30
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:43,650
it's a really straightforward thing from
an engineering perspective to go and

31
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:44,870
spin up a new web app or

32
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:49,180
spin up a new iPhone app that which
works well and works effectively.

33
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:54,566
Machine learning is going to become just
as easy to create and use as an iPhone

34
00:01:54,566 --> 00:01:59,361
app is or a web app is, so it's not
going to be this magical thing that

35
00:01:59,361 --> 00:02:04,610
requires a small number of really
specialized experts to create and use.

36
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:07,950
So it would be access to machine
learning will become much more

37
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:10,008
commoditized and democratized, and

38
00:02:10,008 --> 00:02:13,830
that's really going to enable
a huge wave of new applications.

39
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:18,140
If you think about the tasks that
most people do on a day to day basis,

40
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:22,660
whether it's things like driving a car,
entering data,

41
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:28,670
verifying data, asking a set of
questions to triage a patient

42
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:33,980
to understand who they should see or
things along those lines.

43
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:36,209
Those are highly repetitive tasks and

44
00:02:36,209 --> 00:02:40,736
are the types of tasks that machines can
excel at, so expect over a longer time

45
00:02:40,736 --> 00:02:45,057
horizon all the jobs that are highly
repetitive to ultimately be done more

46
00:02:45,057 --> 00:02:49,333
efficiently by machines enabled by
machine learning algorithms in AI.

00:02:52,988 --> 00:02:56,290
Kaggle's mission is to help
the world learn from data.

49
00:02:56,290 --> 00:02:59,170
We started off by enabling
vast scientists to

50
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:03,700
access a really fascinating set of
use cases through a platform and

51
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:06,830
through machine learning competitions,
as well as to demonstrate and

52
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:11,252
have very standardized setting,
how well algorithms perform.

53
00:03:11,252 --> 00:03:15,610
We're going to stand much more
proudly from that as per for

54
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:18,920
our next focus for
helping the world learn from data.

55
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:21,040
We think that data science tools and

56
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:25,490
workflows are three decades behind
their software engineering equivalents.

57
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:28,990
Data scientists already have good
tools for collaboration right now.

58
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:33,600
They spend most of their time doing
ground worker repetitive tasks

59
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:37,470
that are the types of things that can
be abstracted out and made much more

60
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:41,575
efficient, sort of providing tooling
to help with their repetitive tasks and

61
00:03:41,575 --> 00:03:45,150
collaboration on that,
in the same sense that suffer generis

62
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:49,240
have tools like Git for version control,
GitHub for collaborating on top of

63
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:53,556
called continuous integration surveys
to prove that the code works well, etc.

64
00:03:53,556 --> 00:03:58,510
We're going to provide a mirrored set
of tools for data scientists to make

65
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:03,380
them much more productive and
to make the world very efficient for

66
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:07,020
the world to, as soon as a new data
sample or new data point comes in,

67
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:09,100
to learn everything possible
from that data point.
