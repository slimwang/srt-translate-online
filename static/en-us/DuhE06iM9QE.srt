1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The answer is the first choice.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
We know that this is the case because this set has n - 1 elements.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
We also know that there are no duplicates in this set,

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
because we know that n is prime and a is not divisible by n.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
That means that this will generate the numbers 1 through n - 1 in some order,

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
some permutation of those, but since it's a set, it's the same as the set 1 through n -1.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
This turns out to be a useful property for proving Fermat's Little Theorem,

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
because we can set these two things as equal

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
and multiply all the elements in those sets.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Since we know they're the same set, we know that their products are also equal.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
This product is (n - 1)!.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Since the sets contain the same elements, we know their products also must be equal.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
So this is the product of the first set. This is the product of the second set.

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:58,000
It's (n - 1)!, because it's multiplying all those numbers up to n - 1, and mod n--those must be equal.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
We took the mod n out of each of these terms, but that's fine.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Then we can simplify this, taking out the a's.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:21,000
If we take out all the a's what we have is (1 * 2 * 3 * ... * n - 1)a still equal to (n - 1)! mod n.

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Now we can separate those, taking out all the numbers at all the a's,

19
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
so we'll have n - 1 terms.

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
We have n^(n - 1) here times all the numbers is still equal to (n - 1)!

21
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
This is the same as (n - 1)!.

22
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Now we can remove these terms, and we're left with exactly what we wanted--

23
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,000
that a^(n - 1)! is congruent to 1 mod n.

24
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
This is pretty close to what we want, but we needed for Euler's theorem

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,000
and what we'll need for the RSA correctness proof is this property with Ï†(n).

26
00:01:56,000 --> 99:59:59,999
That's different from what we have here.
