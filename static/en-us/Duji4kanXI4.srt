00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:04,124
There are two reasons why conformity may occur, they are informational social

2
00:00:04,124 --> 00:00:09,770
influence and normative social influence. Let's start with the informational

3
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:13,616
social influence. This happens when people conform to the behavior of others

4
00:00:13,616 --> 00:00:16,964
because they view the other people as a source of knowledge regarding what

5
00:00:16,964 --> 00:00:22,040
they're supposed to do or how they're supposed to act. Have you ever found

6
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:26,319
yourself in a new situation and were unsure of how to act or what to do? Did

7
00:00:26,319 --> 00:00:29,982
you look to others to see how they were behaving? Well this is an example of

8
00:00:29,982 --> 00:00:34,457
informational social influence. Consider a freshman starting college, the

9
00:00:34,457 --> 00:00:37,544
person may look around to see how other people are behaving in the lunchroom

10
00:00:37,544 --> 00:00:41,840
for example. Do people take their food off their trays to eat, do they keep

11
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:47,574
their food on their trays? Do they mostly sit outside, do they sit inside this

12
00:00:47,574 --> 00:00:53,330
usually happens in situations that are ambiguous, or in a novel situation.

13
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:57,020
That's when we are most likely to see the informational social influence occur.

14
00:00:57,020 --> 00:01:00,375
The next influence on our behavior will be quite obvious when you stop and

15
00:01:00,375 --> 00:01:05,870
think about some examples in your own life. This is normative social influence,

16
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:10,298
and it explains a lot of our behavior. For example, do you dress similarly to

17
00:01:10,298 --> 00:01:15,028
your friends? Do you listen to the same type of music as your friends? Have you

18
00:01:15,028 --> 00:01:19,524
ever tried drugs or alcohol to be accepted by a particular social group? Well

19
00:01:19,524 --> 00:01:23,052
if you've changed your behavior in order to gain acceptance by a particular

20
00:01:23,052 --> 00:01:26,580
social group, social psychologists would say that this is due to normative

21
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:28,989
social influence.
