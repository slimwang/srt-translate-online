00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:04,270
Now that you know a little about how
your app will be visually organized, and

2
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:06,850
some of the common design
patterns you might use,

3
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:09,900
let's talk about how you can
customize its look and feel.

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:13,200
Android uses themes and
styles to create reusable sets of

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,410
attributes that can be applied
to your UI to customize it.

6
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:18,630
It's similar to CSS on the web.

7
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:22,240
A style the appearance
of a single UI element.

8
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,750
You might change the style of
an element for branding reasons,

9
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:27,070
such as the color or the font.

10
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:29,008
Or for
practical reasons such as legibility.

11
00:00:29,008 --> 00:00:33,640
A theme uses the same syntax as a style,
but applied as a collection of

12
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:37,730
styles to an element, an activity,
or even your whole application.

13
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:40,245
Now styles always operate
on a single element.

14
00:00:40,245 --> 00:00:42,460
Whereas themes cascade to its children.

15
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:46,080
For example, if you wanted to turn all
of the buttons in your application

16
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:49,800
pink to match your branding,
then you can create a style to do that.

17
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,610
And then apply it to
the whole application theme.

18
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:54,950
Next up James will show you
how to apply this lesson.
