00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,890
Let us look at how the process of configuration would work in detail.

2
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:07,650
Recorder will met a file of represent in reason, will represent knowledge and

3
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:11,890
then reason over it. So suppose it asked the configure a chair. We must then

4
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:15,490
somehow represent all of the knowledge of this chair then we can reason over it.

5
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:19,040
So we will represent all of our knowledge of the chair in the form of a frame.

6
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:22,100
Here's is the frame, here are the beta slots. For the time being,

7
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:25,922
let's just assume that there are six slots that are important. The last four of

8
00:00:25,922 --> 00:00:30,150
the slots may point to their own frames. So there might be a frame for legs,

9
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:34,730
a frame for seat, and so on. Now some of these frames have slots like size, and

10
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:39,330
material, and cost. For legs, you may have an additional slot like count.

11
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:42,830
What is the number of legs on the chair? And this particular frame

12
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:47,590
representation captures of the knowledge of the generic, prototypical chair.

13
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:51,700
To do configuration design is to come up with a specific arrangement of all

14
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:55,860
the parts to this particular chair, to assign values to each of the variables,

15
00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:00,300
which means filling out the fillers for each of the slots. Of course, the values

16
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:04,370
of these variables depends in part on the global constraints of mass and

17
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:08,890
cost. We may, for example, have a global constraint on the mass of the chair, or

18
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:12,710
in the cost of the chair, or both. We may have additional constraint as well.

19
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:15,100
For example in material of a chair might become an,

20
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:16,610
perhaps the material needs to be metal.
