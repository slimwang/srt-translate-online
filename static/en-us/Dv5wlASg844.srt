1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,200
First, Kerberos provides
authentication and access control.

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,680
This is true.

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:09,680
Second, Kerberos also
distributes session keys.

4
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:11,150
This is true.

5
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:15,230
Third, to avoid over-exposure
of a user's master key,

6
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:19,310
Kerberos uses a per-day key and
a ticket-granting-ticket.

7
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:20,810
This is true.

8
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:25,070
Fourth, the authenticators
used in requests to KDC and

9
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:27,840
application servers can be omitted.

10
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,280
This is false.

11
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:33,470
These authenticators are used
to authenticate the senders.

12
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:37,060
And authentication is
an important goal of Kerberos.

13
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:41,350
Therefore, these authenticators
must not be omitted.

14
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:46,670
Fifth, access to any network resource
requires a ticket issued by the KDC.

15
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:47,250
This is true.
