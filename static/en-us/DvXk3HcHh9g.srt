1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:04,200
The four values produced are X, Y, Z and W. These are called homogeneous

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,350
coordinates and they're used for projection. What we do next with these

3
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:11,988
coordinate values is divide each value by the W of the coordinate. This is

4
00:00:11,988 --> 00:00:16,152
called the prospective divide or homogeneous divide. So for our three test

5
00:00:16,152 --> 00:00:20,678
points we had a value such as 0, 0, negative 1, 1. Dividing by 1 is simple

6
00:00:20,678 --> 00:00:26,192
enough. That gives us 0, 0, negative 1. We don't need to bother writing out the

7
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:31,070
W value in the results, since W divided by W will always equal 1. For our next

8
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:36,456
point, W is 11. Dividing all these coordinates by 11 gives 0, 1, 1. Our last

9
00:00:36,456 --> 00:00:41,774
point is a little more interesting. Dividing through by W gives us 0, 0.67,

10
00:00:41,774 --> 00:00:45,522
0.83. Here are plots of the original points and view space and their

11
00:00:45,522 --> 00:00:49,971
corresponding new locations. Notice that the negative Z axis is pointing to the

12
00:00:49,971 --> 00:00:54,314
right for the frustum, and the resulting axis is plus Z to the right. Look at

13
00:00:54,314 --> 00:00:57,545
what's happened with these points and where they're transformed. They started

14
00:00:57,545 --> 00:01:01,476
inside or on the edge of our frustum. After the projection matrix is applied

15
00:01:01,476 --> 00:01:04,804
and division by W is performed the resulting points are in normalized device

16
00:01:04,804 --> 00:01:07,872
coordinates, anything in the range negative 1 to 1 for X, Y and Z is in the

17
00:01:07,872 --> 00:01:13,072
visible view volume. Let's take another example to show what happens to three

18
00:01:13,072 --> 00:01:17,678
objects that are the same size in world space but at different distances. When

19
00:01:17,678 --> 00:01:20,492
we transform to normalized device coordinates the relative area of coverage of

20
00:01:20,492 --> 00:01:24,360
the near plane stays the same. That is, the close object was half as high as

21
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:29,256
the screen in our frustum view and transforms to half the height in NDC space.

22
00:01:29,256 --> 00:01:32,966
The second object is farther away and shows up as smaller. The third object on

23
00:01:32,966 --> 00:01:36,494
the back of the frustum is indeed much smaller than the others in normalized

24
00:01:36,494 --> 00:01:40,920
device coordinates. You might have noticed an interesting thing has happened to

25
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:44,157
the depth of the second object. It started in the middle but it's moved

26
00:01:44,157 --> 00:01:47,290
backwards. We'll talk more about that in a bit as it's important.
