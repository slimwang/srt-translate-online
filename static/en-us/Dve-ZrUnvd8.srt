CortÃ©s makes it easy to roll out updates
to your applications by modifying

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,320
the deployments and managing them.

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:08,370
It's major update time.

4
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:12,030
Let's modify the off deployment
configuration file to use Version 2.0

5
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:13,350
of the author container image.

6
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:17,790
Now will apply or
update using the coup apply command.

7
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:23,879
We can track the progress of our of
the plumbing using the COO CTO describe

8
00:00:23,879 --> 00:00:24,584
deployments

10
00:00:26,147 --> 00:00:27,950
Let's walk through
the output of this command.

11
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:31,390
Here's our only update strategy.

12
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:34,870
This ensures that the right number
of PAs are always available.

13
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:38,330
Once the rolling update is complete
we can view the running pads for

14
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:39,010
the off service.

15
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,980
Here we see the new replica
said that's being used

16
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:47,240
to ensure that we are running the latest
version of our off container.

17
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:50,020
Once the rolling update is complete
we can view the running path for

18
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:51,650
the off service.

19
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:53,560
Notice how long they have been running.

20
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:56,650
The new version of the off Pod
have replaced the previous ones.

21
00:00:57,985 --> 00:01:01,845
We can verify that the off Pod
is running the new version of

22
00:01:01,845 --> 00:01:04,724
the off container using
the COO CTO described command.

23
00:01:05,895 --> 00:01:09,825
Updating deployments this way keeps us
with a clean declarative approach for

24
00:01:09,825 --> 00:01:13,277
rolling out update Kubernetes
makes it easy to roll out changes

25
00:01:13,277 --> 00:01:16,027
to our applications using
a declarative approach.

26
00:01:16,027 --> 00:01:19,097
Whether you have 1 or
100 pause in a deployment,

27
00:01:19,097 --> 00:01:22,707
Kubernetes makes it easy to update
them using a few simple commands.
