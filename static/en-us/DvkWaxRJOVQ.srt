1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,610
To make the words appear
in the other activities,

2
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:04,780
we can follow the first
hint which was to copy and

3
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:08,310
paste the code that we already
have in the numbers activity.

4
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:10,570
So let's copy all this code
here from the NumbersActivity.

5
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:14,380
And then first we'll paste
into the ColorsActivity.

6
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:20,806
Before I paste this bucket code in, the
ColorsActivity was using the activity

7
00:00:20,806 --> 00:00:23,446
under pseudo colors.xml layout file.

8
00:00:23,446 --> 00:00:25,250
As the content view, so

9
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:28,760
we could change the colors activity
to refer to this layout file again.

10
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,460
However, we would also need to change
the layout file to have a list

11
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:36,700
list view XML layout instead
of a relative layout.

12
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:39,000
In the quiz we give you hint number two,

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,200
which is all the activities
can use the same layout file.

14
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:47,037
Which has a List item element in it
since activity_numbers.XML already

15
00:00:47,037 --> 00:00:49,420
has the correct layout.

16
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:51,300
Let's just go ahead and use that.

17
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,690
Delete this tools context attribute

18
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:57,140
which says which file
the layout should be used in.

19
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:00,940
Because now this layout will be used for
four different activities.

20
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:04,620
Next we'll want to rename this file so
that it's not number specific.

21
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:09,790
So to do that we'll right-click,
head to Refactor and then Rename.

22
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:12,850
So how about something like.

23
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:15,370
Word, underscore, list, dot XML.

24
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:19,560
So refactoring here will update
all locations in the code.

25
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,360
That refer to the old name.

26
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,680
And update it with the new name now.

27
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,280
Back in the numbers activity.

28
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,600
We refer to the activity underscore
numbers layout but notice here it now

29
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:35,900
refers to the words_List XML file which
is the new name for the same file.

30
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:40,220
And then we'll move over to the colors
activity we can set the content view to

31
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:44,670
also be the word's list XML file
which contains a list item view.

32
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:47,770
So then in the colors activity
we can set the content view

33
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:52,730
to also be the word list Excel file,
which contains a list view element.

34
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:55,960
All right so let's make sure all
your code in the colors activity is

35
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,630
correctly referring to
the colors category,

36
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:00,680
and we don't have anything left
over to store the first numbers.

37
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:04,611
So the most apparent one here
is the English and translations.

38
00:02:04,611 --> 00:02:07,110
Let's update that to
reflect the color words.

39
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,730
So the remaining code in
the onCreate method looks correct.

40
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:14,930
So we created a word adapter
from this list of word colors.

41
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:19,850
Then we find the list view with
the view ID list in the words_list.xml.

42
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:23,930
layout, and lastly we set
the adapter on to this list view.

43
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:25,760
So now there is no errors in our code.

44
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,842
So let's run the app on a device.

45
00:02:27,842 --> 00:02:31,170
So when the app launches and
I click on the colors category.

46
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:34,200
We see the list of color
words nice it's working.

47
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,140
So the mihwa colors on top and
the English word is below it.

48
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:40,920
Now we'll repeat the same thing
with the family activity.

49
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,505
I copied over the file from
the colors activity and

50
00:02:43,505 --> 00:02:47,245
updated the list of family words from
the provided dictionary document.

51
00:02:47,245 --> 00:02:50,495
And when I run the app on my device,
it looks like this.

52
00:02:50,495 --> 00:02:51,735
Now, excellent job.

53
00:02:51,735 --> 00:02:54,275
All the categories are properly
displaying the me walk and

54
00:02:54,275 --> 00:02:55,545
English translations for each word.

55
00:02:55,545 --> 00:02:58,595
Now there's one last cleanup
step we could do that

56
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:00,455
would be nice to fix our code.

57
00:03:00,455 --> 00:03:02,695
Since we're just using
a single layout file.

58
00:03:02,695 --> 00:03:05,320
Our word list XML file.

59
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:08,990
For all four activities,
we can delete the unused layout files.

60
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:13,050
I'm going to go ahead and delete the
layout files for the colors, family, and

61
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:14,070
phrases.

62
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:16,640
Whenever you delete files, you should
test the app one more time to make sure

63
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,190
it's still working and you didn't delete
anything you actually might need.

64
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:24,060
So after running the app on my device,
it looks like it's still working.

65
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:26,410
So take a step back and
congratulate yourself.

66
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:28,870
You just finished the coding
task in lesson two.

67
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:30,034
That's a really big milestone.
