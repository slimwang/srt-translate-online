Here are our filled-in versions of our tables. Looking at the numbers we wrote

2
00:00:04,208 --> 00:00:07,088
in for y here, and comparing them to this table, and then looking at these

3
00:00:07,088 --> 00:00:11,396
numbers for y. And comparing them to this table, there's definitely something

4
00:00:11,396 --> 00:00:14,976
pretty interesting going on here. Let's take a peek at the graphs of these

5
00:00:14,976 --> 00:00:19,352
functions to maybe get a better idea of what that is. Here are the graphs of

6
00:00:19,352 --> 00:00:25,267
our two functions. This red one shows y equals 10x plus 150, and the purplish

7
00:00:25,267 --> 00:00:31,155
one shows y equals x over 10 minus 15. Start to see if you can pick up a

8
00:00:31,155 --> 00:00:34,600
pattern relating the points on this line to the points on this line, using both

9
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,499
the tables and the graph here.
