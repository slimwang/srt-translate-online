00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:05,980
>> So the only one of these six states that disobeys our one rule against having

2
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:11,000
more prisoners than guards on either shore, is this state over here. So,

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,950
that's the only state that's going to get thrown out. These five states are all

4
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:19,620
legal according to our dumb testers understanding of the problem. So after we

5
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:23,500
dismiss that state, though. We'll notice that we only have two unique states,

6
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:28,080
we have everyone on the left coast and one prisoner on the right coast. So

7
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,560
like we did earlier, we can collapse these two down into only these two states.

8
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,640
It won't matter how we got there, once we're there.
