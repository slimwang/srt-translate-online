1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,072
Let's start with this first number line. The first shaded region down here

2
00:00:04,072 --> 00:00:08,232
starts all the way out at negative infinity, and comes up through negative 9,

3
00:00:08,232 --> 00:00:12,532
including negative 9. So we have negative infinity to negative 9 united with

4
00:00:12,532 --> 00:00:16,782
negative 6, which is not included up through positive infinity. Written as a

5
00:00:16,782 --> 00:00:21,003
compound inequality, this should be read as y is less than or equal to 9 or y is

6
00:00:21,003 --> 00:00:25,812
greater than negative 6. Of course, noting that our variable here is y as shown

7
00:00:25,812 --> 00:00:30,712
at the edge of the number line. For the second number line, our interval goes

8
00:00:30,712 --> 00:00:35,767
from negative 4, including negative 4, through 8, which is not included. The

9
00:00:35,767 --> 00:00:40,647
inequality for this would be read as negative 4 is less than or equal to z is

10
00:00:40,647 --> 00:00:45,612
less than 8. We could also write this of course, using an and. Negative 4 is

11
00:00:45,612 --> 00:00:48,470
less than or equal to z and z is less than 8.
