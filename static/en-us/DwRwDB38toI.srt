00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Now you are going to play the role of a learner.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I've given you three positive examples and three negative examples,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
and what I'd like you to do is craft a regular expression

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
that accepts the three positive examples but rejects the three negative examples.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Quite a bit of room for creativity here. Go try it out.
