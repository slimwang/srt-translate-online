1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:04,030
So what is this user
preferred text size anyway?

2
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:04,530
Well, for

3
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:09,960
accessibility purposes Android allows
users to customize their font size.

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:13,980
Users that have trouble reading
text can increase their font size.

5
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:17,210
You can normally find this option in
the display settings on your phone or

6
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:19,350
tablet under font size.

7
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:23,730
It's often also available through
the accessibility settings.

8
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:28,350
With scale-independent pixels,
16 sp is exactly the same as

9
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:33,440
16 dp when the user's font
size is normal or 100%.

10
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:38,070
But when the user's font size is large,
for example 125%,

11
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:44,300
16 sp will translate to 20 dp or
1.25 times 16.

12
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:47,770
Using sp units will make for
a better experience for

13
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:49,780
people with impaired eyesight.

14
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:53,660
You'll be saving someone the frustration
of downloading your awesome app,

15
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:55,410
only to find that they
can't read the text.
