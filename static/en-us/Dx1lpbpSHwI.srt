1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
All right. Let's look at the answer.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Here's a particular graph where all the nodes are of even degree.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Let's see what happens when we try to follow an Eulerian path.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Let's just pick any node to start--say E--and go to C.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
There are some choices here. Let's follow an edge back to B.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Then maybe to D to C to A to B and to E.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
So it looks like we were able to hit all of the edges exactly once.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
This graph does have an Eulerian path.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
But there's something very special about that path,

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
and that it is started at E and it ended with E.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Because the path actually started and ended at the same node,

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
that node should have even degree,

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
because each time we go into we come out,

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
except for the first time where we go out but then the last time we come back in.

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Everything matches up and you end up with even degree.

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
This is a special kind of Eulerian path called an "Eulerian Tour."

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
"To tour" in the sense that we start off in our home city,

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
and we go around, we visit lots of things, and we come back to our home city.

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
We kind of did a tour of the graph, and it was very scenic.

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
That's an Eulerian Tour.

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
This first answer is definitely not correct.

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Such a graph can have an Eulerian path.

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
No, it doesn't depend on the graph.

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
It turns out that this is going to be fine no matter what,

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
because we're going to end up starting and ending at the same node.

26
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
We could have actually started and ended on any of the nodes

27
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
and it would've worked out the same way. All such graphs do.

28
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
All graphs that have only even degree nodes do have Eulerian paths,

29
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
specifically Eulerian Tours, but it's not the case that all such graphs do.

30
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Let's make a quick example graph just so that you can see it.

31
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
For this to work we need to have a graph where more than two of the nodes has odd degree.

32
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Let's make one where four of the nodes has odd degree.

33
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
We have these four nodes--F, G, H, and I.

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Let's make it so that each of them has odd degree.

35
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Now they all have even degree. Now two of them have odd degree.

36
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
If we connect these two guys, then they have odd degree as well.

37
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
All the nodes have odd degree. It's not just 0 or 2.

38
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
All of them have degree of 3.

39
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Let's see what happens when we try to make an Eulerian path.

40
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
We'll pick some node like I.

41
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:02,000
We'll go I to G, G to F, F to I, I to H, H to F, and now we hit a dead end.

42
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Maybe we didn't want to do that. Let's instead go H to G where we also hit a dead end.

43
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
In fact, you can do this all day long, and what you're going to discover

44
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
is there's always going to be at least one edge that you just can't visit,

45
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
because again, each node in this case has an odd degree.

46
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Every part of the path has to come into the node and out of it,

47
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
so it has to have even degree except for the endpoint.

48
00:02:21,000 --> 99:59:59,999
No matter what we're going to be stuck.
