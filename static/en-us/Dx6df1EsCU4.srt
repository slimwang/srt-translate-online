00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:06,170
Because these types of applications are so common, a group of technologies

2
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:11,330
has evolved to support them. These technologies are called Middleware. That is,

3
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:17,990
they are technologies between the user or client and the ultimate server.

4
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:23,420
They essentially are responsible for dealing with satisfying the non-functional

5
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:28,090
constraints of the overall distributed system. They're similar,

6
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:33,510
in concept, to the architectural connectors that we've talked about. It will be

7
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:38,845
interesting to contrast those connectors with the kind of middlewares described.

8
00:00:38,845 --> 00:00:43,260
We'll be using in particular the material taken from the Emmerich paper,

9
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:44,310
which I've asked you to read.
