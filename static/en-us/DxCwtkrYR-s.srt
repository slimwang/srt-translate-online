00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,680
Now that you know about stop words, I'm going to show you how to get a list of

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:08,550
stop words out of a Python package called NLTK, which stands for

3
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:11,110
the natural language tool kit.

4
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:14,400
In this demonstration, I'm going to be using the interpreter.

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,520
At the end of this video, there will be a quiz, and

6
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:22,390
I want you to do the quiz on your own laptop, not in the Udacity web browser.

7
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:24,480
So this quiz is a little bit different.

8
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,760
So, let's get started.

9
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:26,720
I fire up the interpreter.

10
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:31,100
To get the stopwords out, I have to import them from NLTK.

11
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:36,110
I found this line of code in an example when I went to Google looking for

12
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:37,460
how to get stopwords from NLTK.

13
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:44,850
To get a list of stopwords, say something like sw equal stopwords.words.

14
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:46,440
And then as a parameter to words,

15
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,176
I have to tell it what language I am interested in.

16
00:00:48,176 --> 00:00:49,906
That's English.

17
00:00:49,906 --> 00:00:52,760
And [LAUGH] if you are using NLTK for

18
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:58,180
the first time like I am on this computer you'll get an error because NLTK

19
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:01,900
needs to have a corpus from which it gets the stopwords.

20
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:04,190
The corpus is just a body of documents.

21
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:08,430
So in order to fix this, I have to call this nltk.download function.

22
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:13,520
You have to make sure NLTK is imported first, and

23
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,520
then what we need is the corpora and then we hit download.

24
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,470
This will take a few minutes.

25
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:21,000
And now that that's finished, I can try again.

26
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:24,690
Much better.

27
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:29,150
So I can go into this sw list and I can ask what some of the stock words are.

28
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:31,560
So the first one in the list, is the word i.

29
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,200
That makes sense, people like to talk about themselves a lot.

30
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,370
Let's find out what the tenth one is.

31
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,430
Yours.

32
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:38,670
Again, makes sense.

33
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:39,490
What I want you to do

34
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:42,310
in the quiz now is to repeat these steps that I went through.

35
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:45,810
So, use your Python interpreter to actually download the corpus and

36
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:48,550
to get the list of stop words out.

37
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:50,350
And here's my question for you.

38
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:52,490
How many stop words are in the list?

39
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:53,460
