00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,450
The strategy we've been using to solve these problems is definitely useful, but

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:07,935
there are different interest options for Grant to explore. What if instead of

3
00:00:07,935 --> 00:00:11,711
only compounding the interest once a year, his account compounded it twice a

4
00:00:11,711 --> 00:00:18,736
year? Now, interest rate is still quoted as a yearly rate. So let's say he

5
00:00:18,736 --> 00:00:23,721
keeps it at 3%. However, since his interest is going to be compounded twice a

6
00:00:23,721 --> 00:00:27,808
year or semi-annually, then each time the compounding happens, the rate that's

7
00:00:27,808 --> 00:00:34,450
used is only going to be half of this annual rate. That means that each time we

8
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:38,170
do a calculation, we're not going to use the number 0.03 anymore, instead,

9
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:43,791
we're going to use half of that. I'd like you to help me describe the situation

10
00:00:43,791 --> 00:00:49,330
by filling in some numbers for me in a few sentences. Here's what I'd like you

11
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:54,723
to tell me. If Grant invests $10,000 at a 3% annual rate compounded twice a

12
00:00:54,723 --> 00:01:03,465
year, then in six months, he will receive 1.5% on his $10,000 investment. Which

13
00:01:03,465 --> 00:01:07,686
means that some amount of money, which you'll write in here, will be added to

14
00:01:07,686 --> 00:01:13,315
his account in interest. The total balance of the account will then be whatever

15
00:01:13,315 --> 00:01:18,771
you think. Then after six more months, Grant will again receive 1.5% interest,

16
00:01:18,771 --> 00:01:24,355
but this time, on the new amount. The interest added this time is going to be

17
00:01:24,355 --> 00:01:28,643
something, which will make the total amount of money in the account after one

18
00:01:28,643 --> 00:01:31,521
year equal to what?
