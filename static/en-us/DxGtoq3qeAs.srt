1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,540
So, once again let's go back and
look and

2
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:04,710
detail the scale invariant detectors.

3
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:06,970
Let's first look at
the Harris-Laplacian.

4
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:10,270
Again, I've given a reference for those
of you who want to read more about it.

5
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:14,760
Basically, what is does is it finds a
local maximum of Harris corner detector

6
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:17,740
in space, in a Laplacian scale.

7
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:21,990
Remember, we've looked at how
to do Laplacians already.

8
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,110
So here basically is the best
way to kind of visually see it.

9
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:30,950
Scale is shown up this way, space is x,
y, that's where the images are.

10
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:34,770
Scale basically kind of captures
the frequency in the octaves.

11
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:35,770
First what I basically do,

12
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:39,640
is I run a corner detector in space
in the image coordinates, but

13
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:43,458
then I kind of move up in scale
by looking for the same features.

14
00:00:43,458 --> 00:00:47,400
Using the Laplacians this time,
as I go from one scale to the other.

15
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:50,420
And that basically allows me to
find now at these different scales,

16
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:55,330
the feature does have the information
I want, if one scale or the other.

17
00:00:55,330 --> 00:01:00,080
So just to reiterate,
in the scale which is up here and

18
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,890
then space which is down here.

19
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:05,750
In space, we are actually just running
a standard Harris corner detector, but

20
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:09,120
then we're using a Laplacian
in the scale space here.

21
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:13,440
So Laplacian in this, Harris in this
gives us the Harris-Laplacian detector.

22
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:17,640
Again, a widely used detector and
image processing computer vision and

23
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,889
computation photography.
