00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,767
You may have noticed that there have been a few teapots in these lessons. I hope

2
00:00:03,767 --> 00:00:07,419
you like them because you'll be seeing lots more of them as we go. The teapot

3
00:00:07,419 --> 00:00:11,229
model was created by Martin Newell, one of the pioneers of computer graphics.

4
00:00:11,229 --> 00:00:14,969
Among other accomplishments, he co-developed an early rendering method called

5
00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:18,800
the painter's algorithm and did seminal work in the area of procedural modeling.

6
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,530
He also founded the company Ashlar Incorporated, a computer aided design

7
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:27,350
software firm. The model was inspired by a real live Melitta teapot,

8
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:30,898
manufactured in 1974. Back then, there weren't many good models to use for

9
00:00:30,898 --> 00:00:34,722
rendering, especially for displaying materials. Objects made of cubes, cylinders

10
00:00:34,722 --> 00:00:38,764
and spheres and so on, can only take you so far. In 1975, Martin Newell, at the

11
00:00:38,764 --> 00:00:42,732
University of Utah at the time, was talking about this problem with his wife,

12
00:00:42,732 --> 00:00:47,926
Sandra. They were just sitting down for tea, so she suggested that he model a

13
00:00:47,926 --> 00:00:51,480
tea set. He made a sketch of the silhouette on graph paper. The drawing

14
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:56,044
represented a recognizable profile of a teapot. It doesn't match the real world

15
00:00:56,044 --> 00:00:59,688
teapot. The spout and the knob on the lid are a bit different, for example. He

16
00:00:59,688 --> 00:01:04,358
described these curves by using what are called "cubic bezier splines." A spline is

17
00:01:04,358 --> 00:01:09,222
a fancy word for a type of curve. These spline curves are formed by carefully

18
00:01:09,222 --> 00:01:13,438
placing a few points called "control points". A surface is then formed by using

19
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:17,472
spline curves in two different directions to define a patch. See the additional

20
00:01:17,472 --> 00:01:21,030
course materials to learn more about this process. To render these patches

21
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:24,740
interactively, we often convert them into grids of triangles. This type of

22
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:28,088
modelling is useful for creating all sorts of curved surfaces, such as car

23
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:31,728
bodies. When Newell created the teapot, he also made some other models to

24
00:01:31,728 --> 00:01:35,025
create a whole set. Not half as well known, the tea cup and saucer make up a

25
00:01:35,025 --> 00:01:38,452
pretty nice little model. At least they look good from this angle. Well, not

26
00:01:38,452 --> 00:01:41,884
great though, there's no shadow. So, the cup looks like it's floating over the

27
00:01:41,884 --> 00:01:45,814
saucer. If you rotate the view, its secret is revealed. There's a large hole in

28
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:49,060
the middle of it. There's also a teaspoon model, which is pleasing from any view.

29
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:52,836
I was surprised by how easy it was to display these models, once I had my teapot

30
00:01:52,836 --> 00:01:56,501
demo working. The text files of patch data for the teacup and teaspoon are

31
00:01:56,501 --> 00:02:01,664
available on the web. The time stamp on these files is from 1991. Digital data

32
00:02:01,664 --> 00:02:06,016
doesn't rot. A nice feature of using cubic beziers for the data description is

33
00:02:06,016 --> 00:02:09,734
that the text files were each around 8,000 bytes. For a lot of applications

34
00:02:09,734 --> 00:02:13,604
nowadays, that's less than the size of an empty save file. Let's get back to the

35
00:02:13,604 --> 00:02:17,080
teapot. Like the tea cup, the teapot also didn't originally have a bottom. After

36
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:20,644
all, a teapot is usually sitting on some tabletop, so doesn't really need one

37
00:02:20,644 --> 00:02:25,713
most of the time. Four patches defining a bottom were added later by Frank Crow

38
00:02:25,713 --> 00:02:29,895
in 1987. Some graphics practitioners consider adding a bottom to be heresy. So,

39
00:02:29,895 --> 00:02:33,534
be careful about what choices you make and whom you show your teapots. One other

40
00:02:33,534 --> 00:02:36,702
obvious difference between the real world and virtual teapots is the vertical

41
00:02:36,702 --> 00:02:40,577
scale. Martin Newell shared his teapot data set with other researchers. His

42
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:44,176
original sketch's scale matches the real world teapot, but the computer

43
00:02:44,176 --> 00:02:47,875
graphics model evolve to be squatter. I've seen two stories in print about how

44
00:02:47,875 --> 00:02:51,611
this happened and being in print it makes it true, right? The more reputable one

45
00:02:51,611 --> 00:02:55,387
is that Jim Blinn, one of the early users of the teapot data set, decided that the

46
00:02:55,387 --> 00:02:59,344
teapot simply looked more pleasing when squished. The other story I've seen is

47
00:02:59,344 --> 00:03:03,056
that the display Blinn was working on didn't have square pixels. Rather than

48
00:03:03,056 --> 00:03:07,000
mess with the camera's transform, he decided to scale down the teapot vertically

49
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,732
to compensate. I like this version a lot, since Blinn has a well-known quote of:

50
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:14,077
"All it takes is for the rendered image to look right." I asked Martin Newell

51
00:03:14,077 --> 00:03:17,469
about these two stories and he thinks the non-square pixels may have been the

52
00:03:17,469 --> 00:03:21,073
original reason, but that Blinn's aesthetic sense could well have kept the model

53
00:03:21,073 --> 00:03:25,651
that way. Martin himself prefers the squat version. Speaking of looking right,

54
00:03:25,651 --> 00:03:28,889
there is a noticeable gap between the lid and the body of the teapot. I've taken

55
00:03:28,889 --> 00:03:32,610
the liberty in this course of widening the lid a bit, so that this gap is not

56
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:37,191
noticeable. Shhh - don't tell anyone. Blinn's use of the teapot in his research

57
00:03:37,191 --> 00:03:41,161
popularized it and the size change stuck. The teapot is a great object to render

58
00:03:41,161 --> 00:03:45,585
for a number of reasons. First and foremost, we have a good mental model of what

59
00:03:45,585 --> 00:03:49,444
the teapot should look like, so can easily identify bugs. The curvature of the

60
00:03:49,444 --> 00:03:53,474
surface varies considerably, especially on the spout and handle, causing the

61
00:03:53,474 --> 00:03:57,402
shading to change in interesting ways. Some of the spline patches form a dense set

62
00:03:57,402 --> 00:04:01,309
of triangles, others less so, which gives some rendering algorithms a workout.

63
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:05,860
Since the teapot is not some simple convex form, such as a block or cylinder, it

64
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:09,848
casts a shadow on itself - another good test case. My small contribution to the

65
00:04:09,848 --> 00:04:13,788
cause was an open-source program that generated the teapot. This was back in the

66
00:04:13,788 --> 00:04:18,019
late 1980s, long before the term "open source" even existed. I ported this code

67
00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:21,920
to three.js for this course. Many people consider the teapot a standard model.

68
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:26,606
Back in 1987, Jim Arvo created this classic image, showing the teapot as the 6th

69
00:04:26,606 --> 00:04:31,036
platonic solid, next to the tetrahedron, cube, and so on. Really, I've seen a lot

70
00:04:31,036 --> 00:04:35,070
more teapots rendered than I have dodecahedra. The teapot is an iconic object

71
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:39,312
that is the symbol of 3D computer graphics. There are other famous models out

72
00:04:39,312 --> 00:04:43,778
there - the VW Bug, the Stanford bunny, the Sponza Palace. But the teapot is by

73
00:04:43,778 --> 00:04:48,430
far the most celebrated. Keep an eye out for it in the first "Toy Story" movie

74
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:52,025
and in the Simpson's 3D episode. If you want to see the real teapot in all its

75
00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:55,085
glory, it's on display at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View,

76
00:04:55,085 --> 00:05:02,209
California. Now that you're aware of the teapot, you'll start to notice it

77
00:05:02,209 --> 00:05:05,903
popping up when you least expect it.
