00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:02,750
One thing to keep in mind,

2
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:07,120
browsers make no promises that
they'll keep data around forever.

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,970
Data can be removed without warning.

4
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:11,080
For that reason,

5
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:16,329
it's important to sync critical data
to the cloud as soon as possible.

6
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:20,630
The other advantage of doing this is
when the user signs into your app on

7
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:26,190
another device, their settings, data and
other information is right there for

8
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:28,730
them, and they can pick up
right where they left off.
