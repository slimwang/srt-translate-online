00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:03,460
So at the end of every lesson, I will briefly recap what we talked about during

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:06,160
that lesson and try to tie it into some future topics.

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,470
Today, we started off by talking about the central conundrums and

4
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:11,070
characteristics of AI. This may have connected with some of

5
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:14,270
your previous experience with other AI classes, like machine learning in AI for

6
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:17,220
robotics. We then talked about the four schools of AI, and

7
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:21,080
we talked about knowledge-based AI more specifically, what is it and where does

8
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:24,490
it fit in with the other schools? Then we talked about cognitive systems and

9
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:28,490
how cognitive systems are always concerned with human like intelligence. Lastly,

10
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:30,400
we talked about the overall structure of the course,

11
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,820
which is broken up into eight large categories, like learning, planning and

12
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:36,570
analogical reasoning. Next time we'll talk a little bit more

13
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:39,530
specifically about this class in particular. The goals, the outcomes and

14
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:41,877
the learning strategies, and what projects you'll complete.
