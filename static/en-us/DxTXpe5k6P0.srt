00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:04,286
Here, the correct answer is our negative 5 halves and positive 2. Now that's

2
00:00:04,286 --> 00:00:07,854
amazing if you got that correct. You've really gained steam in solving

3
00:00:07,854 --> 00:00:12,860
quadratic equations. We start solving this equation by subtracting 10 from both

4
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:17,090
sides. This sets our quadratic equation equal to 0, and now we can try and

5
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:23,100
factor. We want to find factors of negative 20 that sum to positive 1. These

6
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:27,460
factors are positive 5 and negative 4. We use these coefficients to rewrite our

7
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:31,840
middle term of x, and these factoring by grouping to get these factors. We set

8
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:38,010
each factor equal to 0, and then solve each equation for x. This gives us a

9
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:42,586
solution set of negative 5 halves and positive 2. I hope this was a great

10
00:00:42,586 --> 00:00:47,070
refresher on solving quadratic equations. In the upcoming lessons, we'll find

11
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:51,975
other ways to solve these quadratics. Sometimes they aren't always factorable.
