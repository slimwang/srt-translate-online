00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,520
Now, let's do a little quiz just to see that you can easily make the distinction

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:06,750
between the polynomial and exponential running time.

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:11,340
So I'm going to give you a couple of running times and I want you to tell me if this is

4
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:14,510
a polynomial running time or an exponential running time.

5
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:31,130
So we have O(2n*log(n)), O(2log(n)), O(1.00001n), n¹⁰⁰⁰, and then Alice's algorithm,

6
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:36,900
which you'll recall had a running time of O(2n*n²).

7
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:40,790
So please for each of these functions is that the function for a polynomial running time

8
00:00:40,790 --> 99:59:59,999
or for an exponential running time.
