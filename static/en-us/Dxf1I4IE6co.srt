1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:03,370
Now that I've explained r-squared to you, question you might be

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:07,240
asking is this is all well and good Katie but how do I get this information?

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:10,150
You haven't given me an equation for it or anything like that.

4
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:13,810
And what I want to do instead of giving you a big mathematical equation,

5
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:17,220
which I don't find that interesting and you could look up on your own.

6
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,730
I want to show you how to get this information out of scikit-learn.

7
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:22,910
This is the code we were looking at a few videos ago when we were building our

8
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:24,500
net worth predictor.

9
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:28,740
Now, I filled in these lines that are importing the linear progression and

10
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:30,130
making some predictions.

11
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:33,510
Another thing that happened was I printed some information to the screen,

12
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:34,540
you may remember.

13
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:36,430
Two of these things I explained to you already.

14
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:38,170
The slope and the intercept.

15
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:40,690
I access that information by looking for the coefficients and

16
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:42,100
the intercept of the regression.

17
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:45,670
These are just lines of code that I found in an example online.

18
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:47,700
But one thing I did promise you we would come back to,

19
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:50,730
and now we are, is this r-squared score that I was printing out.

20
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:56,310
And the way access that, is through the reg.score quantity.

21
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:59,980
This is kind of similar to how we computed the accuracy in

22
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:01,140
our supervised classifier.

23
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:05,590
So what we do is we pass the ages, which are the features in this case,

24
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:06,680
the input, and

25
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:10,440
the net_worths, which are the outputs, the things we're trying to predict.

26
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:14,030
And then since the regression has already been fit, up here,

27
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:17,470
it knows what it thinks the relationship between these two quantities are.

28
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:20,550
So this is all the information that it needs to compute an r-squared score.

29
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:22,070
And then, I can just print it out.

30
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:26,030
So let me take you over here and show you again what that looks like.

31
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:27,740
I have the same output as I had before,

32
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:31,000
this might look a little bit familiar so I'm predicting my own net worth.

33
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,610
I have my slope, my intercept.

34
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:35,180
But now you understand the importance of the r-squared score.

35
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:40,090
So my r-squared score is about point eight six which is actually really good.

36
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:45,450
I'm predicting, I'm doing about 85% of what the best I could doing is.

37
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:47,750
I would say 86% is close to one.

38
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:53,690
It can be a little bit of an art to translate between an r-squared numerically,

39
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:55,150
and saying whether it's a good fit or not.

40
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:58,250
And this is something you'll get some intuition for

41
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:00,830
overtime, as you play with things.

42
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:06,920
I would certainly say that .857 is a good r-squared.

43
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:10,970
We're doing a good job of capturing the relationship between the age and

44
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:12,810
the net worth of people here.

45
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:15,660
I've also seen higher r-squareds in my life.

46
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:18,518
So it's possible that there still could be variables out there.

47
00:02:18,518 --> 00:02:23,440
For example, features that if we were able to incorporate the information from

48
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,420
additional features we would be better able to predict a person's net worth.

49
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:30,290
So in other words, if we were able to use more than one feature,

50
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:32,510
sometimes we can push up this r squared even further.

51
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:36,410
On the other hand, there are sometimes really complicated problems where it's

52
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:40,330
almost impossible to get an r squared that would be anywhere near this high.

53
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:43,390
So sometimes, in Political Science for example they're trying to

54
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:46,530
run a regression that will predict whether a country will go to war.
